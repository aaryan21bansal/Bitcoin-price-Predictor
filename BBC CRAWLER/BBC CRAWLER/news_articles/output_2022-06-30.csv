Boss of collapsed energy firm Bulb to step down,"The boss and co-founder of collapsed energy firm Bulb will leave at the end of July, the company said. Bulb went bust late last year when wholesale gas prices soared. It is being run by the government through regulator Ofgem until a buyer is found. Hayden Wood was in place temporarily ""to ensure a smooth handover and sales process,"" the government told the BBC in April. The firm has not yet sold. Mr Wood hadcome under fire from MPs for staying on with a Â£250,000 salary. The collapse of Bulb wasexpected to cost the taxpayer Â£3bn, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee was told in April. This is the biggest state bailout since the Royal Bank of Scotland collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. Rescue of Bulb set to cost taxpayers billions more Bulb said on Thursday Mr Wood was ""stepping back from the business. We wish him all the best for the future."" Mr Wood had previously defended remaining in his role after the collapse, telling MPs he was asked to stayed on to help minimise disruption to customers. The firm, which has 1.6 million customers, was among 29 energy suppliers which went under after massive hikes in wholesale gas prices. When Bulb collapsed, the Treasury set aside Â£1.7bn to buy the gas its customers needed until the end of the tax year in April 2022. It was hoped by that time the business would be sold but so far no buyer has been found. There are reportedly several bidders in talks over buying the company. The BBC has asked the Department for Business for a comment.

"Tyneside homing pigeon found 4,000 miles away in US","Bob the pigeon is being cared for at an animal shelter in Alabama A confused pigeon has turned up thousands of miles away in the US after getting lost racing back to Tyneside. Bob set off from Guernsey in the Channel Islands three weeks ago on the 400-mile (644 km) route to Gateshead, which was supposed to take 10 hours. But instead of heading home to Tyneside the four-year-old was found at the home of a puzzled Alabama resident. Owner Alan Todd believed Bob took a wrong turn and landed on a ship where he crossed the Atlantic. The bird, who is said to be worth more than Â£1,000, is currently being cared for by an animal shelter in Monroeville, Alabama. Staff said despite being underweight Bob ""looks pretty good"" and had been checked by a vet. Mr Todd, from Winlaton, who has been reunited with Bob via webcam, is planning to travel over to bring him back. ""He wouldn't have flown all that way, I think he has probably jumped on to a ship,"" he said. ""He was covered in oil - it could have been an oil tanker. ""They are obviously looking after him very well - when I saw him yesterday he didn't look in a good state, but looking at him today he looks a lot better just in one day."" Bob has been checked by a vet and gained weight after being cared for by the shelter The pigeon was traced to north-east England by staff at Monroe County Alabama Animal Shelter who put out an appeal on social media. They said they had been contacted by an elderly resident who had found the bird at his home in Mexia on Wednesday. Because Bob was wearing distinctive leg bands, staff at the shelter investigated and tracked down the North of East Homing Union (NEHU), where his owner was found. Megan Bryan and Monica Hardy, who have been caring for the pigeon at the shelter, said: ""He's appearing well, he's doing great.""

Culture secretary confuses rugby codes in speech,"Nadine Dorries is the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries confused the two rugby codes in a speech at a Rugby League World Cup event in St Helens on Thursday. Dorries thought Jonny Wilkinson's 2003 winning drop-goal for England against Australia in rugby union's World Cup final took place in rugby league. ""I've always quite liked the idea of rugby league,"" Dorries said in her speech. ""My long-standing memory is that 2003 drop-goal."" She added: ""We were drinking Bloody Marys at the time. Wow, what a moment that was."" She later addressed her mistake on Twitter. ""Like Jason Robinson I may have switched codes in my speech,""she wrote.,external ""Both league and union have a rich heritage in the UK. Obviously I've followed rugby league much less in my lifetime, but I'm looking forward to watching England (and all the home nations) in the RL World Cup this autumn."" Rugby league and union have separate rules, points systems and team sizes - 15 players in a union side, and 13 in a league side. Jonny Wilkinson's winning drop goal in the 2003 Rugby (union) World Cup final Dorries had been speaking at the launch of an interim report into the World Cup's social impact programme, which is investing Â£25m into communities across England. Rugby League World Cup chief executive Jon Dutton said the secretary of state had ""clearly made a mistake"" but added he was delighted she was there to support the launch of the report. ""The sport is 127 years old but needs a tournament like this to have more visibility. We want more people to be educated on what a wonderful sport rugby league is - and also, what a wonderful sport rugby union is,"" he said. ""We've had a conversation and we look forward to her coming to the tournament."" World Cup has produced Â£25.8m investment boost, says impact report Billy Vaughan, vice-chairman of Portico Vine rugby league club in St Helens where the event took place, said: ""I thought it was comical. ""No detriment to her, somebody writes that speech for her, they just need to do their research. It's a little bit disrespectful to the various codes and there's a big difference in the codes.""

"Former SNP MP jailed for embezzling Â£25,000","Natalie McGarry arrives at court for sentencing for her embezzlement conviction Former SNP MP Natalie McGarry has been jailed for embezzling Â£25,000 from the SNP and a pro-independence group. The 40-year-old was sentenced to two years in prison. She was found guilty last month of embezzling Â£19,974 while treasurer of Women For Independence and Â£4,661 when she was treasurer, secretary and convener of the Glasgow Regional Association of the SNP. McGarry was the MP for Glasgow East between 2015 and 2017. Sentencing McGarry, Sheriff Tom Hughes said she had betrayed people who put their trust in her and that a custodial sentence was inevitable. He told her: ""It's quite clear that society has a right to expect the highest standards from those who seek and eventually achieve high public office."" He added: ""Through your role in these offences, you have not only betrayed the trust placed in you by others, but your standards have fallen well short of those the public should have a right to expect from MPs."" McGarry was elected as the MP for Glasgow East in 2015, but did not stand in the snap general election two years later In December 2019, McGarry had an earlierconviction for embezzlement quashedafter judges ruled she had suffered a miscarriage of justice. However, last month, the jury returned majority verdicts on two charges after three hours of deliberations. It was alleged during the second, six-week trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court that McGarry spent some of the money on expenses such as rent and shopping. Her legal team had admitted that her finances were ""disorganised"" and ""chaotic"", but she denied both charges. Former MP found guilty of embezzling Â£25,000 Ex-MP says she forgot bill after Â£2,000 payment I wasn't skint after election, says ex-MP McGarry The court heard from dozens of witnesses,including Scotland's former health secretary Jeane Freeman,who said she reported McGarry after noticing a significant shortfall in WFI accounts. Ms Freeman said she had no idea donations made to the group's independence crowdfunder were going from the organisation's PayPal account into McGarry's personal bank account. She also voiced her frustrations at McGarry's delay in handing over receipts and invoices which would show what the funds had been spent on. The court also heard from witnesses that McGarry had personal financial difficulties and regularly received loans from family and friends. That included from Humza Yousaf, the current Scottish health secretary, who gave McGarry Â£600 to prevent her from being evicted from her house. The court also saw McGarry's bank records, which showed crowdfunder donations from WFI being transferred to her own personal account. McGarry had said these were ""legitimate"" expenses which she had incurred and which she was reimbursing herself for. Jeane Freeman gave evidence in the trial of Natalie McGarry A WFI financial probe in late 2015 discovered an income and expenditure gap of Â£31,824 and the matter was reported to the police. McGarry paid back Â£6,436.21 in September 2015, funded by a Â£6,500 loan from a friend. In the 2019 trial, McGarry pled guilty to two charges of embezzlement and later attempted to withdraw the guilty pleas. She had not guilty pleas accepted to another embezzlement charge, and a charge that she refused to give police the passcode for a mobile phone. Her lawyer in that trial told the court she had suffered mental health issues over the years, including depression and anxiety, and also had postpartum depression following the birth of her daughter in November 2017. She wassentenced to 18 months in prisonbut was freed on bail a few days later after lodging an appeal. McGarry was elected as an SNP MP in 2015 but resigned the party whip after the allegations against her were first made. She did not seek re-election in the 2017 general election.

Defence spending to rise as dangers increase - PM,"The UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade, Boris Johnson has said. As Nato members discussed their response to Russian aggression, the prime minister said the ""cost of freedom"" is ""always worth paying"". It is expected to mean an extra Â£55bn by 2030, and could mean investments in future air combat capabilities for a ""more dangerous"" world, the PM said. The defence secretary had reportedly called for a faster timescale. Ben Wallace said in a speech on Tuesday that investment in defence had to grow ""before it's too late"". But he later denied reports he had called for spending in 2028 to reach 2.5% of GDP - a measure of the size of the nation's economy - in a letter to the prime minister. A source close to Mr Wallace said he was ""very grateful"" for the budget increase and had ""always been clear that as the threat changes, so should defence spending"". Setting out his intention as the Nato summit in Madrid drew to a close, Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""invest for the long-term in vital capabilities"" such as air combat and adapt to ""a more dangerous and more competitive world"". Russia threat requires Army cash boost - minister Is the government breaking its promise on defence? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said ministers should listen to warnings from British Army chief Gen Sir Patrick Sanders that the world is in a ""1937 moment"" - referring to Europe's failure to confront the growing Nazi threat before World War Two. ""This timid increase over eight years shows we still don't appreciate the changing geo-political landscape and the scale of threats coming over the horizon,"" Mr Ellwood said. ""The funds are needed immediately to reversecuts to troop numbers, tanks, ships and fast jets - not in eight years' time."" After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in the prime minister's opening address at his news conference here in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to embark, of these decisions, is 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the decade."" This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members. I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't match. Last year, the UK spent Â£42.4bn on defence, which was a Â£2.5bn increase on the previous year. The UK is now counting its support for Ukraine as part of its defence spending, bringing the current total to 2.3% of GDP. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the size of the economy by adding together the total value of all the goods and services produced. It stood at Â£2.1 trillion last year. Addressing questions about spiralling inflation due to the war in Ukraine, Mr Johnson told a news conference ""the cost of freedom, as it were, is actually always worth paying"". He said that, unless Russia is stopped, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be able to commit further acts of aggression against neighbouring countries, causing ""further oil shocks, further panics and more economic distress for the whole world"".

How will indyref2 compare with 2014?,"Scotland voted to stay in the UK by 55% to 45% in the 2014 independence referendum Dust off the placards. Unpack the soapbox. Grab your cagoule. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has fired the starting gun in another referendum campaign â so here we go, right? Not so fast. Many supporters of independence describe the run up to the 2014 poll - whenScotland voted to stick with the UKby 55% to 45% - as exhilarating and optimistic. Plenty of their opponents recall feelings of exclusion and sadness. Either way, it is hard to deny that politics came alive that year. For a while the nation crackled with energy as campaigners for and against independence debated poverty and pensions in the nation's parks and plazas. BBC iPlayer - Independence: Why Scotland could vote again Is indyref2 Nicola Sturgeon's biggest political gamble? Some of that enthusiasm persists in regular pro-independence marches and the occasional show of solidarity for the union but the nation is no longer in full-on campaign mode. And even if the Scottish government is able to persuade the UK Supreme Court of its right to hold a referendum - a long shot according to some eminent legal scholars - an exact repeat of 2014 does not seem very likely. Too much has changed. For a start both teams, for and against independence, have splintered. Labour's reputation was damaged by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Conservatives in the Better Together campaign to keep Scotland in the Union. It is very hard to imagine such a cross-party coalition being formed again. Former First Minister Alex Salmond and his successor Nicola Sturgeon are no longer in the same party Their opponents in the Yes Scotland camp have fallen out too, about vision, strategy and tactics, a divide most obvious in the rift between Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond who now leads a separate pro-independence party, Alba. It's not just the players who have evolved since 2014 though. So has the script. A pandemic, a cost of living crisis, war in Ukraine and Brexit have all scrambled the discourse about Scotland's future. While the UK voted to leave by 52% to 48% Scotland voted to remain by 62% to 38%. Independence: Why Scotland could vote again Scottish independence: Is there a mandate for another referendum? Scottish independence: 19 October 2023 proposed as date for referendum The first minister contends that being removed from the European Union against Scotland's will strengthens the democratic case for independence. Scotland is ""not a region questioning its place in a larger unitary state"" she argues but ""a country in a voluntary union of nations"". Of course many of her opponents contend that Brexit weakens the economic case for independence on the grounds that if Scotland were readmitted to the EU it would have to erect a hard border with its largest trading partner â England. Leaving that aside for a moment though, what about the fundamental principle? Does Scotland in fact have a right to leave the Union? Margaret Thatcher speaking at the Conservative conference in 1981 In her 1993 memoirs The Downing Street Years Margaret Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979 - 1990, appeared to accept that it did, writing: ""As a nation, [the Scots] have an undoubted right to national self-determination; thus far they have exercised that right by joining and remaining in the Union. Should they determine on independence no English party or politician would stand in their way, however much we might regret their departure."" The current Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who draws heavy criticism from many Scottish voters for both his policies and his morals, has taken a different tack, repeatedly insisting that now is not the time for another referendum. But Ciaran Martin, the former senior UK civil servant who negotiated the Edinburgh Agreement which formed the basis for the 2014 referendum, now professor of government at Oxford University, draws a distinction between the political argument for Scottish self-determination and the legal case. ""The Supreme Court can absolutely say there's no mechanism to consult the Scottish people on independence without Westminster's consent,"" says Prof Martin. However he adds, if Downing Street refuses to describe another path for Scotland to secede ""you have to give up the pretence that this is a voluntary union, that Scotland is allowed to leave."" Prof Sir Tom Devine has written several books including The Scottish Nation 1700 to 2000 Of course it was not the Scottish people who hitched their wagon to England and Empire in the first place. The historianProf Sir Tom Devine,externalhas described the Scottish nobles who took the decision as ""the elite of an elite,"" an electorate representing 0.06 per cent of the population. It is also true that the Scottish economy was in dire straits after the debacle of the Darien Scheme, a disastrous attempt to establish a colony on the isthmus of Panama which links Central and South America, and bridges the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Nonetheless there was a vote in the Scottish Parliament and the nobles did indeed choose union, which took effect on 1 May 1707. Gradually this United Kingdom grew even closer - trading together, building an empire together and fighting wars together. But long before anyone had heard the word Brexit the relationship was under strain. In the 1960s the US and the UK stationed nuclear weapons on the Clyde, less than 30 miles from Glasgow, bringing jobs but also generating moral outrage. In the 1970s North Sea oil boomed. Energy firms made fortunes and the UK Treasury raked in millions in taxation. But with most of the UK's oil off Scottish shores its discovery fuelled a nationalist movement which wanted all Scots to share in the spoils. The 1980s were the decade of Mrs Thatcher, a Tory prime minister supported by most English voters but rejected by most Scots. Her decision to pioneer the controversial poll tax in Scotland combined with her strategy of forcing old industries to change or die drove many Scottish voters into the arms of her political opponents. Even the arrival of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 did not ""kill nationalism stone dead"" as Labour's George (now Lord) Robertson had hoped it would. Instead support for independence remained more or less steady and eventually began to rise. ""The parliament took a lot of the sting out of being Scottish and that was really good,"" said the writer and commentator Fiona Rintoul, ""but it set up a scenario where if there was a different government in Westminster...there was going to be a clash."" The decline of the Labour party is a key feature of Scottish politics in the 21st Century, arguably both symptom and cause of the rise in nationalist sentiment. Tony Blair enjoyed a close working relationship with President George W Bush Chris Deerin, Scotland Editor of the New Statesman, argues that in the later years of Tony Blair's 1997-2007 premiership the SNP under Alex Salmond spotted that Labour was becoming fatigued and pounced. ""In a sense they were offering a like-for-like replacement to the Labour Party,"" he said, but further to the left and ""more optimistic."" This shift was accelerated by Mr Blair's decision to join the United States in invading Iraq which was ""the final straw"" for some Labour activists in their move towards embracing independence, according to Mr Deerin. He remains persuaded that there is a strong case for Scotland to stick with the Union, involving the ""common sense"" redistribution of resources within the UK and a seat at the top tables of international institutions but he also worries that Britain has become a ""transactional"" affair, weakening its attraction. Ms Rintoul sees Scotland drifting away from its neighbour, and approves of the direction of travel. ""A result of 45% of people voting to completely overturn the status quo in a non-wartime situation is not a ringing endorsement for the status quo,"" she said, adding that since then Brexit and the pandemic have meant that ""Scottish politics has completely decoupled from British politics."" The turmoil of the past few years has certainly reshaped the debate about Scotland's future. It has generated thorny questions about currency, borrowing, benefits and borders, tax and trade, nuclear weapons and energy. Of course there are options for Scotland other than independence and the Union. After 2014 the Scottish Parliament's tax and benefits powers were expanded and a Labour commission led by the former prime minister Gordon Brown is currently considering whether to go even further, perhaps even advocating a federal UK. For now though, 315 years after the Union was formed; 25 years since Scotland voted for devolution; and eight years on from choosing to remain in the UK, it's independence which still dominates the national conversation. It's just not clear at the moment if or when that conversation will spill out onto the streets in another full-on campaign.

Thousands of BT workers vote to strike over pay,"Thousands of BT workers have voted to go on strike in a dispute over pay. Some 30,000 Openreach engineers and 9,000 BT call centre workers were balloted and overwhelmingly backed industrial action, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) said. General secretary Dave Ward said BT now faced its first national strike since it was privatised in the 1980s. BT said it was disappointed and would ""work to keep our customers and the country connected"" if staff walked out. Mr Ward said he expected BT to offer a ""significantly improved"" pay rise by next week or strike dates will be set. CWU said the potential strike action would have a serious effect on the roll-out of broadband and could cause big problems for those working from home. Royal Mail workers to vote on strike over pay Why didn't rail strikes cause more disruption? Big pay rises could push prices up, says minister Prices are rising at their fastest rate with UK inflation at a 40-year high of 9.1%. Higher costs for food, unprecedented energy bills and soaring fuel prices are putting households under pressure and workers and unions are pushing for pay rises to help them cope. But the government haswarned against bosses giving big wage increasesfor fear of causing a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through higher prices. This year BT gave staff a Â£1,500 per year pay rise but CWU said that with price rises at record highs ""this is a dramatic real-terms pay cut"". It said BT made Â£1.3bn in annual profit and the company's chief executive, Philip Jansen, received a Â£3.5m salary - a 32% increase. A BT Group spokesperson said the company had awarded its highest pay rise for frontline colleagues in more than 20 years - an average 5% increase and up to 8% for those on the lowest salaries.

Number paying higher rate tax rises by two million,"The jump in the number of people paying higher rates of income tax comes as the cost of living soars There are almost two million more higher and additional rate taxpayers in the UK, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The number of people paying 40% or 45% tax has risen from 4.25m to more than 6.1m workers since 2019, figures show. It comes as pricesrise at the fastest rate for 40 yearsand workers and unions push for pay rises to cope. The Treasury has been urged to re-examine tax brackets, but it said most tax payers still paid the basic rate. The amount a worker can earn before paying income tax, known as personal allowance, was frozen in the April 2021 Budget until 2026, along with all tax thresholds. Usually, governments increase personal allowances each year, so that someone can get a pay rise that matches the rising cost of living without getting dragged into the next tax bracket. But right now, inflation is at 9.1% and expected to rise further. This means pay rises are expected to lead to many more people paying higher tax rates, and generating more money for the Treasury. At the time of March's Spring Statement, the government's independent watchdog, The Office for Budget Responsibility, estimated that by 2026 the government's tax take in relation to the size of theeconomy would rise to its highest since the 1940s. Why are prices rising so quickly? Food boss says prices could rise by up to 15% Job vacancies outpace unemployment for first time The Treasury said it had taken ""tough but responsible decisions"" to ""avoid saddling future generations with more debt"" after record levels of borrowing during the pandemic. ""Maintaining income tax thresholds is a progressive approach. The vast majority of taxpayers will still pay the basic rate and the UK still has the highest personal allowance in the G20,"" the spokesperson added. Countering this approach, former Liberal Democrat pensions minister Sir Steve Webb said that paying higher rate tax ""used to be reserved for the very wealthiest"". But this has changed ""very dramatically"" in recent years, added the partner at consultants LCP. ""People who would not think of themselves as being particularly rich can now easily face an income tax rate of 40% and around 1 in 5 of all taxpayers will soon be in the higher rate bracket,"" he said. More people will be paying more in taxes after the Spring Statement Higher rate taxpayers paying 40% earn Â£50,271 in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. In Scotland the higher rate is 41% for those earning Â£43,663 or over. Tax is not paid on the first Â£12,570 of earnings covered by the personal allowance. They represent a projected 16.2% of the overall income tax-paying population in 2022-2023, according to the HMRC. Meanwhile, additional rate taxpayers who earn over Â£150,000 and pay at 45% tax make up around 1.9%, it said. Clive Gawthorpe, partner at accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young said the government needs to ""urgently"" examine these tax brackets. ""Due to inflation, taxpayers sucked into the higher band were already having to make their monthly pay checks stretch further - without the additional burden of higher tax,"" he added. When income tax brackets do not move in line with inflation, more taxpayers can fall into higher tax brackets, increasing overall income tax payments in an effect known as fiscal drag. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday defended the government's taxation policy, pointing to plans to raise the threshold for paying National Insurance in July. ""Next month, we've got a tax cut worth Â£330 on average...for all payers of National Insurance contributions coming in, a very substantial tax cut in addition to what we've done on fuel duty and on council tax. ""Of course, we always want to try to reduce burdens, but we have to do it in a sensible and a responsible way,"" he said. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Mum, stepdad and teen sentenced for boy's murder","Logan Mwangi was a previously ""smiling, cheerful little boy"", the court heard A mother, stepfather and a teenager have been given life sentences for murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi and dumping his body in a river. John Cole, 40, will serve a minimum term of 29 years in prison while Logan's mother, Angharad Williamson, 31, will serve at least 28 years. Craig Mulligan, 14, will serve at least 15 years.All three were convicted of murdering Loganin July 2021. His body was found in the River Ogmore, near his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. Mrs Justice Jefford told Cardiff Crown Court that the attack on the ""defenceless"" schoolboy, who weighed 3st 1lb (20kg), was ""nothing short of horrifying"". Mulligan -who can now be publicly named for the first timeafter a judge lifted ananonymity order,external- is not the biological son of Cole but he raised him from the age of nine months and considered himself a father figure. WatchLogan Mwangi: A Boy Betrayedon iPlayer. Juror's nightmares after child murder trial Why Logan Mwangi's teenage killer can now be named How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Rejecting Williamson's version of events that Cole and Mulligan attacked Logan two days before his body was found and that she had run out of the house in an attempt to get help, Mrs Justice Jefford said: ""That was made up after the event to protect yourself and shift the blame. ""You had an opportunity to protect your son from further injury and you did nothing. ""Whatever time the ferocious assault on Logan happened, he was for the most part of Friday injured or dying."" Angharad Williamson, 31, Craig Mulligan, 14, and John Cole, 40, have been sentenced for Logan's murder Police officers found Logan partially submerged in the river in Pandy Park, just 250m from his home. He was wearing his dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top. His body was dumped like ""fly-tipped rubbish"", the prosecution said. During the trial, jurors had heard howLogan was treated like a prisoner in the days before his death. On 20 July, Logan tested positive for Covid-19 and he was shut in his bedroom for 10 days with a baby gate stopping him from leaving. Mrs Justice Jefford described this decision by the couple as ""extreme"" and said the treatment of him was ""the culmination of treatment that had dehumanised him"". Logan's stammer is said to have worsened, becoming particularly bad around Cole, the jury was told, and he wet himself more frequently and began self-harming. This video can not be played How Logan Mwangi's killers tried to fool police The jury were played extensive CCTV footage from nearby houses which showed Cole and Mulligan at 02:43 BST on 31 July moving Logan's body in a sports bag to the nearby river, where they dumped it. They were caught again as they came back to the house to pick up the dinosaur pyjama top Logan had been wearing, which police found in a wooded area with a big cut in. Talking about the cover-up, Mrs Justice Jefford said what they did was ""careful and calculated and not the product of panic"". ""It is impossible to imagine the terror a five-year-old would feel suffering those horrific injuries inflicted upon him by those regarded as his family with the compliance of his mother."" The concealment of Logan's body in the river, was described as ""heartless"", ""calculated and orchestrated"". Logan Mwangi's dad asks why he had to die Boy, 5, 'treated like rubbish in life and death' The jury also heard Mulligan had a ""desire for violence"" andpushed Logan down the stairs, breaking his arm. A support worker once heard him singing: ""I love to punch kids in the head, it's orgasmic."" Mrs Justice Jefford told the trio they were ""all responsible for Logan's death and all the anguish that has flowed from it"". ""Because he was killed in his own home, it is not possible to be sure what has happened to him,"" she said. She described the injuries Logan suffered as ""the sort of injuries seen in abused children"". Logan's body was found 250m away from the home he shared with his family Logan, a previously ""smiling, cheerful little boy"", died after suffering a ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, including extensive bruising to the back of his head and tears in his liver and bowel. Friends of the couple said Cole told them he did not like Logan, and others said his attitude changed after becoming obsessed with the idea that Williamson had cheated on him with Logan's father Ben Mwangi. Ben Mwangi (centre) says he experiences recurring nightmares Ben Mwangi wept as his victim impact statement was read out to the court on his behalf. In it, he recalled collapsing and hitting his head when he was told of his son's death while at work. ""I just felt like every fibre in my body had died and I couldn't stop crying."" After finding out about Williamson's arrest, he said he felt ""devastated that I couldn't have been there to protect him"". Mr Mwangi said he could no longer sleep and experienced recurring nightmares. ""My dreams of Logan are so vivid, Logan comes to tell me that he is OK and to check if I'm OK. ""He runs into my arms and I hold him tight, but he then slowly disappears until he's no longer in my arms. I wake up screaming and crying. ""I find it difficult to go back to sleep, I don't want to go back to sleep because I don't want to experience these dreams because they are so painful."" The courtroom was full, including Logan's family, relatives of the three killers and members of the jury who sat through the trial. Williamson cried throughout and held her head down throughout the sentencing. Cole showed no emotion as he was sentenced, nor did Mulligan. Cole previously pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, while Williamson and Mulligan were found guilty of the same charge. Tondu Primary School set up a memorial garden and ""buddy bench"" in memory of Logan In a statement, Tondu Primary School said Logan was a ""loving, sweet-natured child who was polite and articulate at all times"". ""Logan was always smiling, and was described in court by his own teachers as having the kind of smile that could light up a classroom. ""He was a highly inquisitive child who enjoyed his lessons, particularly when using the outdoor classroom where he would have great fun with his friends. ""Logan loved playing with his classmates, especially games like hide-and-seek or pretending to be superheroes. His favourite character was always Spider-Man and he would display a keen and vivid imagination in his games. ""Ultimately, we remember Logan as being a bright, happy child who was caring and loving, and an absolute pleasure to teach.""

Juror's nightmares after child murder trial,"This video can not be played Dr Joselyn Sellen: ""I knew that this was going to be a difficult case"" A juror says she was so traumatised by evidence at a child's murder trial she suffered recurrent nightmares and was signed off work for more than a month. Five-year-old Logan Mwangi's mother, stepfather and a 14-year-old boy weregiven long sentences for his murder. The trial was paused several times when Dr Joselyn Sellen and other jurors found the evidence too distressing. Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service said it recognised the importance of jurors' wellbeing. Police officers found Logan's body partially submerged in the River Ogmore in Bridgend county in July 2021. The prosecution said Logan's body was dumped like ""fly-tipped rubbish"", just 250m from his home in Sarn. WatchLogan Mwangi: A Boy Betrayedon iPlayer. The trial heard he died after suffering a""brutal and sustained"" attack at home,leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries. The jury found Logan's stepfather John Cole, 40, mother, Angharad Williamson, 31, and Craig Mulligan, 14, guilty at the end of the trial in April. Cole was jailed for a minimum term of 29 years, Williamson for at least 28 years and Mulligan was given at least 15 years' detention on Thursday. Mulligan can now be named for the first time after a judge lifted an anonymity order after a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. Under law, no-one can speak to jurors about how they reached their verdict, how they voted, or any discussions or opinions expressed during their deliberations. Jurors must also notdisclose this information to anyone,external. However, jurors are allowed to talk about what happened in the courtroom and Dr Sellen, who has agreed to be identified as a juror, is able to speak to the BBC about her experience of serving on a jury and the impact of the trial on her life. She has decided to share her experience because she wants to see change. Psychologist Dr Sellen, one of the 12 jurors on the case, said the hardest evidence she heard was from a paediatrician who described how Logan's final hours would have been. ""That was incredibly difficult,"" she said. ""Because your imagination will take you to very dark places when you're hearing that kind of evidence. ""It is very, very distressingâ¦ you just keep thinking what was happening for that child and how he must have been suffering."" This video can not be played Logan Mwangi's dad said the world was colder and darker without his son She said she would never forget the police body-cam footage that showed the moment Logan's body was found. ""That will stay with me forever,"" she said, adding she heard the police officer's reaction. ""Though it was blurred out you absolutely got the emotion of when someone first sees a child's body in the river... even though it was blurred out you could see very clearly."" Child murder trial prompts call for juror support Logan's killers: A 'racist' and stockbroker's girl How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Logan had 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, including extensive bruising to the back of his head and tears in his liver and bowel, which experts said were so severe they were consistent with those seen in road traffic accidents. Dr Sellen said she was thankful the court had used computer generated images of his injuries: ""It would have been devastating to have seen that actually on his body,"" she said. Logan was found dead in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend county, last July The evidence, as well as the weight of responsibility of reaching verdicts for the three defendants, one still a child, had a devastating impact on her life outside of the courtroom, she said. ""I felt as though my normal life was completely hijacked,"" she said. ""This completely took over my life... [I was] completely traumatised."" She said something as simple as hearing children laughing could be a trigger: ""My thoughts would go straight back to the case. ""I'd be thinking 'how was it for Logan? Was he ever laughing? What happened when he cried?'."" She said she faced recurrent nightmares, intrusive thoughts, difficulty getting to sleep and would over-react to to the smallest of things. Friends were a welcome distraction, she said, but they could not support her as she was not allowed to discuss the case. She said her 15-year-old daughter would try to support her but did not know why she was so upset. Dr Joselyn Sellen says no-one apart from the other jurors could support her as she was not allowed to discuss the case ""Several times [my daughter] was sat holding me when I'm crying inconsolably and I couldn't tell her why,"" she said. ""Simple things like planning our meals for the week became overwhelming, so normal day-to-day living just changed completely."" She said after dropping her daughter at school she would be hit by a wave of emotion. ""Almost as soon as she was out of the car door I'd be crying, I would cry most days from the moment I dropped her off until I got to court. ""I'd be sat in my car thinking 'with every fibre of my being I don't want to go in' but I knew I had to and I had a duty."" She said it was the other jurors' support that made it possible to keep going. Hundreds of toys, teddy bears and flowers were left in Pandy Park after Logan's body was found ""The court are very neglectful of their duty of care to jurors,"" she said. ""There was no professional support available through the courtâ¦the ushers, security, the judge, every person who came into contact with jurors was fantastic, but they weren't trained in terms of trauma therapy."" She said the court service advised jurors to go to the Samaritans, which she did, but as she was not able to talk about the case ""it became a very short conversation"". She had the same issue with her GP. Dr Sellen said a trauma therapist should be made available to jurors for particularly harrowing or traumatic cases. ""[Someone] who is able to maintain the integrity of that process but enable and empower the jurors to be able to offload some of that so we can still function in normal life,"" she said. She would also like to see jurors screened for mental health issues and past trauma before being selected for harrowing cases. She said the judge Mrs Justice Jefford did give jurors the opportunity to decline taking part after the opening statements but it was an ""intimidating situation"" and they were not given adequate time to think about it. ""To put your hands up to a high court judge and in front of barristers and say 'I don't think I can handle it', that's a very difficult position to be in,"" she said. A spokesperson for Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) said: ""Jury service is one of the most important civic duties that anyone can perform and we recognise the importance of well-being throughout the process. ""In each case, the trial judge will seek to meet the interests of justice without causing undue anxiety to any juror. ""This can include warnings of distressing evidence as well as offering a range of support such as counselling from GPs and advice from the Samaritans."" A leaflet entitled Supporting You Through Jury Service offers further advice to jurors and is available in courts, they added. Angharad Williamson and John Cole were found guilty of murder in April At the end of the case, Mrs Justice Jefford thanked the jury for their ""exceptional public service"", and recognised they had endured ""very unpleasant and emotional evidence"". She then excused them from having to undertake jury service again unless they decide they want to. But for Dr Sellen it is an experience she is keen to never repeat. ""This really was my worst nightmare to be on a case that's so traumatic,"" she said. ""I would not want to do jury service again, particularly as there's no support for jurors.""

School summer holidays could be cut to four weeks,"There has been concern disadvantaged pupils fall behind over the summer break School summer holidays in Wales could be cut to as little as four weeks as part of a shake-up of term times. Welsh government education minister Jeremy Miles has ruled out cutting the break to two or three weeks or having fewer holidays. One union said there were ""many more pressing issues that need attention"". Mr Miles said public research showed while there was ""reasonable contentment"" with the timetable there was ""openness"" to change. A public consultation on whether the summer holidays should be shortened is due to begin in the next academic year. Activists want meat cut from Wales' school dinners Grandmother wants lessons in Welsh schools TikTok gives better period education than schools, say teens It is likely to present different options for changing the pattern of school terms. Head teacher Clive Williams said staff room suggestions included taking a week from the summer holidays and adding it to an autumn break A report by Beaufort Research for the government came up with three: A five-week summer break with three school terms of about 13 weeks, with a one-week break halfway and three weeks at Christmas A four-week summer break with five school terms of about seven or eight weeks. Three weeks holiday at Christmas and two weeks between the other terms A three-week summer break with terms lasting about six or seven weeks with fortnightly breaks in between Overall, the report said people were content with the current six-week summer holiday with two weeks at Christmas, two at Easter and three week-long half-term breaks. Mr Miles said the research showed people were open to looking at how holidays were spread out and more consistent term lengths. ""Exploring options for change can enable us to support curriculum planning and delivery, tackle disadvantage and educational inequalities, and support learner and staff well-being,"" he said. ""We now have an opportunity to explore these issues in the context of whether the current structure really is the best system to deliver on these shared priorities."" There has been concern that disadvantaged pupils in particular lose progress over the long summer break. Some have argued that adding holidays at other times in the year would help refresh staff and pupils. The report for the government showed pupils favoured the longer break and researchers said more work would be needed on the impact of any change on exam timetables. Concerns in the tourism industry that reducing the summer break would have ""serious consequences"" for an important economic sector should also be addressed, they said. Head teachers' representatives have questioned why the minister wanted to push ahead with reforms in view of research which showed ""no great appetite"" for change. Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said there were ""many more pressing issues"" such as funding teacher shortages, education recovery following the pandemic and the launch of anew curriculum. ""There would need to be very clear educational benefits to justify such a huge upheaval and so much time and energy, and it is imperative that detailed evidence is provided along with any proposals,"" she said. Clive Williams, head teacher at Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, welcomed the consultation, saying a long school holiday could be a challenge for some parents and children. ""Having that long summer break of six or possibly seven weeks on some occasions can be a very difficult situation for some of them,"" he said. ""I think there is a general consensus that some children would be safer and they would feel more supported in the school environment."" He said there seemed to be a consensus among some of his staff for an extended summer break, although some had suggested taking a week from the summer holidays and adding it to the autumn half-term break. Dollie, a Year 6 Ysgol Gymraeg pupil, said: ""I like a long holiday but sometimes it's difficult because you don't see your friends over the holidays and sometimes you want to be at school."" Her classmate Gruffydd added: ""I think it works out well at the moment, there is enough time to do what you want in the summer but it would be nice to get more holiday time at Christmas."" NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel challenged the report's transparency Head teachers' union NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel challenged the report's transparency, claiming the questions were pushing a Welsh government agenda. She said: ""Those who identified current arrangements as their preference were presented with a series of alternative options with no choice of retaining the status quo, the key question is how changing term times would improve outcomes for learners. This remains unanswered."" Ms Doel said evidence available showed countries with longer summer breaks than Wales had higher attainment levels. NEU Cymru said the majority of its members were concerned about the plans. Its Wales secretary David Evans said: ""We believe it is really important the Welsh government speak to the education workforce about their concerns. ""This is an extremely challenging time for everyone in education - we still have Covid disruption, we have the new curriculum starting in September, and the first exams in three years just drawing to a close. Now seems a very strange time to be adding more change to education."" The pledge to look at reform of the school year was part of an agreement with Plaid Cymru in the Senedd. Meanwhile, apilot projectto extend the school day was run earlier this year. Eli, Mali and Charlie enjoy summer holidays - except when they are boring Schoolchildren Eli, Mali and Charlie all liked the summer holidays, but also thought they could be boring. ""They can get quite boring but in the middle it's quite fun because I go out with my friends, go to the beach and stuff,"" said Eli. ""And I get to stay in bed and go to bed really late."" Mali found the heat a bit much. ""Sometimes it gets too hot, and sometimes it can get a bit boring,"" she said. Charlie gets bored by the end of them. ""I like it but I don't at the same time,"" he said. Mum Amrita Chouhan believed children needed a break from school life Mum-of-two, Amrita Chouhan, from Porthcawl, Bridgend county, believed a six-week holiday was fine. She said: ""Kids should have a break from academic life. They need to go and enjoy the school holidays and spend time with grandparents. ""That is the perfect time to visit family and it can be a productive time."" Luisa Verederame said losing two weeks from the school break could be a problem for her cafe Louisa Verderame, owner of Porthcawl's Piccolo bar and cafe, said holiday trade was important. ""Provided the holidays were moved to Easter time, when there is fair weather when people can still go on holiday and people can provide us with trade would suit us,"" she said. ""The problem is if they completely eradicate two weeks from summer holidays and do not replace them with fair weather time."" Grandma Linda Mitchell said children get bored during the summer holidays Grandmother Linda Mitchell, from Treorchy, who owns a caravan in Porthcawl, thought six weeks was a long time for a break. She said: ""My grandchildren get bored because they have been off school for so long and I think they lose a lot by doing nothing but play, then they have to go back and some kids don't want to go back. ""They lose the continuity as well."" The Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: ""I genuinely cannot believe that at a time when children are not getting the educational support they need after so much disruption, in addition to our young people not getting the mental health and well-being support that they need in school, or even to get back into school, the Labour government are choosing to prioritise this. ""The Labour government also show utter contempt for the wider impact of such decisions, such as the detrimental effect shorter summer holidays could have our tourism industry here in Wales.""

Her emaciated body was found covered in her own faeces, urine and vomit when paramedics were called to the family home in Leicester in 2019. Her father was found guilty of allowing the death of a vulnerable adult. This is a lesser charge than manslaughter, of which he was found not guilty by a jury. Leicester Crown Court heard the family had an ""aversion"" to hospitals following the death of Ms Burdett's mother, Grace, in 2005. The judge, Mr Justice Pepperall, said this was ""not a case of callous disregard"". ""Indeed, there is abundant evidence that you both loved Julie very much,"" he told the defendants. ""I accept that Julie herself made you both promise that you would not let anyone else care for her and that you would not cause her to be admitted to hospital. ""Misguided though it was, I accept that you convinced yourselves that it was in Julie's best interests to remain at home and buried your heads in the sand. ""You plainly intended her no harm but you were in denial."" Philip Burdett was jailed for three years after being found guilty by a jury of gross negligence manslaughter. Ralph Burdett was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, suspended for two years. The court was told Ms Burdett was 61 when paramedics found her dead on 15 January 2019. She was described by the judge as being a ""friendly, articulate and clever woman"". However, he said, she had suffered from chronic and complex medical conditions for many years. These interrupted her university studies and had also cut short her working life. ""As she became more immobile her limited social life became more difficult and in her last years she barely left her home,"" the judge said. She lived at home with her brother, father and mother. However, her mother died in 2005 and the family became ""increasingly reclusive"", according to the judge. They were also ""extreme hoarders"", and Ms Burdett's bedroom was ""particularly bad, to the extent that even her bed was covered in clutter"". Julie had been on her bedroom floor for at least two weeks by the time of her death, according to evidence heard at the trial. ""Julie died an appalling death in horrific and filthy conditions on the floor of her bedroom covered in her own faeces, urine and vomit,"" the judge said. ""She was too weak to get back into bed or even to bear some of her own weight to allow someone else to help her."" Ms Burdett weighed just 30kg (4st 10lb) at her death. ""She had suffered the most extensive pressure sores that an expert in tissue viability with over 40 years' experience in nursing had ever seen,"" the judge said. ""On both her back and her hip, the tissue had become completely necrotic and her wounds infected with MRSA. She developed osteomyelitis and overwhelming sepsis."" The judge said no professionals had raised concerns over the years as to Philip Burdett's care of his sister. ""While he was capable of being an effective carer while Julie was relatively mobile and was independent in the activities of daily living, he was utterly out of his depth when that situation changed in January 2019,"" he said. He said Philip Burdett suffered from health problems himself, namely a recurrent depressive disorder which was characterised by insomnia and suicidal ideation, and also agoraphobia, which made him irrationally anxious about leaving the house. He had also not been well over Christmas and the New Year. ""Your own incapacitation undermined your ability to provide proper care for your sister at least at the beginning of this crisis,"" the judge said.

Here are today's closing headlines:  The writers of today's live page were: Dulcie Lee, James Clarke, Catherine Evans, Malu Cursino, Nadeem Shad and Doug Faulkner. The editors were Holly Wallis, Jeremy Gahagan, Heather Sharp and Rob Corp Since Turkey dropped its veto over Sweden and Finland joining Nato, there have been some concerns over its reasons for doing so. On Wednesday, Ankara said it would seekthe extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspectsfrom Sweden and Finland. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Ankara wanted 12 suspects from Finland and another 21 from Sweden. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"". Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. But on Thursday, Sweden's Justice Minister Morgan Johansson insisted that any decisions regarding extradition of Kurds would be made by ""independent courts"". ""Swedish citizens are not extradited,"" said Johansson. ""Non-Swedish citizens can be extradited at the request of other countries, but only if it is compatible with Swedish law and the European Convention."" A mainstay of Putin's inner circle, Sergei Lavrov, has been drawing some historic parallels during a press conference. The Russian foreign minister said that a new ""iron curtain"" was being put in place between the West and Russia. The term was used during the Cold War to refer to the division between Western countries and those with links to the Soviet Union, as relations between the two sides ebbed to an all time low. ""As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending..."" said Lavrov. ""The process has begun,"" he said, adding that Western countries should ""just behave carefully"". Funerals continue to be held for those who have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. They include victims of the Kremenchuk shopping centre which was hit by Russian rockets on Monday. Relatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony for Andriy Krasyuk who was killed in the Russian rocket attack on the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk on Monday A woman mourns in front of flowers left in memory of civilian victims killed at the shopping mall Natalia, the wife of Ukrainian serviceman Volodymyr Kochetov, 46, who was killed in a fight during Russia's invasion, cries by his coffin during his funeral in the village of Babyntsi, Ukraine A soldier holds a red carnation as he attends the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier at the St Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv We've been reporting on the situation in Lysychansk, a city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, the region's governor, warned residents in Lysychansk to stay in shelters because ""it is no longer possible to evacuate"". Haidai said Russian troops were on the outskirts of the city and were firing from several directions. Earlier, Haidai said the city has beensuffering ""endless air strikes""and the Russians were using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture Lysychansk. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said Russia has been successful in seizing some of the territory in Lysychansk's oil refinery, but that Ukrainian forces had beaten back an attack on a gelatin plant in the city. Lysychansk stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. It's the last major city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region The United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Ukraine says there is ""blatant ignoring"" of international humanitarian and human rights law in parts of the country no longer under Ukrainian government control. Osnat Lubrani says aid organisations were unable to deliver relief supplies, or get access, to Kherson or Mariupol, and had been unable to get agreement on safe passage to evacuate people to leave Severodonetsk. Russian forces are now in control of both Mariupol and Severodonetsk. ""We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart by this war,"" Lubrani says at a news conference in Kyiv. ""But the Russian Federation, also the Ukrainian government, have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible."" More now on Nato's new strategy towards China. Earlier on, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the new approach reflects Russia and China's use of ""economic leverage, coercion, and hybrid approaches to advance their interests in the region"". But Beijing has called Nato's new strategy irresponsible . China's foreign minister, Zhao Lijian, said ""Nato's so-called new strategy concept document disregards the facts"". Lijian said that the new strategy ""wrongly defines China as posing a strategic challenge and smears China's foreign policy"". He added that it is ""irresponsible, encourages conflict, and is full of Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice"". Earlier this week China criticised the West for arming Ukraine. This video can not be played Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg speaks with the BBC's Frank Gardner While Nato's focus has been on the situation in Ukraine, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also spoken about China. For the first time the defence alliance has decided to talk about what it's been calling ""the challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests and values."" It comes as China's military presence has been growing on the world stage. The country recently launched it's third and most modern aircraft carrier joining a very small group of nations that are capable of fielding these kinds of ships. Taiwan, an island in the East China Sea is seen by China as an integral part of its territory. In recent years Beijing officials have threatened military action if any attempts are made for independence. While emphasizing that Taiwan is not a Nato member, the Nato head admitted that what happens to the island does ""matter to Nato allies"". Stoltenberg made the comments during an interview with the BBC's Frank Gardner where Stoltenberg also discussed China and Russia's development of hypersonic missiles. Both countries have led the way in the development of the weapons that are capable of travelling towards their target at more than five times the speed of sound on a unpredictable flight path. Ukraine says it's introducing a trade embargo against Syria and sanctions targeting Syrian legal entities and individuals. It's in response to Syria's decision to recognise the two Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas region, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has announced. On its website it says it ""strongly condemns"" the decision of the Syrian Arab Republic to recognise ""the so-called independence"" of the ""temporarily occupied territories"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. It called the move an ""unfriendly act"" towards Ukraine and a violation of the principles of international law. On Wednesday, Syria's Foreign Ministry announced that the country - an ally of Russia - had recognised the ""independence and sovereignty of the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky severed diplomatic ties with Syria following the announcement. Chris PartridgeBBC News New satellite imagery taken today shows the aftermath of Ukraineâs attack on Snake Island, which many believe forced Russian troops to leave. Pictures from Maxar Technologies were taken this morning, showing whatâs left of burned vehicles and structures across the north end of the island. Artillery strikes and air attacks delivered the blows to Russian forces, something that has been happening frequently to stop Moscow gaining a permanent foothold. We know at least one Russian Pantsir SA-22 air defence unit with medium-range capability was stationed on the island. Itâs not clear whether it was destroyed in this latest attack, or in any of the strikes before. In this second image, a colour infrared view, the black/grey areas present those which were recently burned. Non-burned vegetation shows up red/pink. More details will likely emerge of what was destroyed, but Ukraine is clear it was enough to drive out Russian forces. âNot withstanding the fire of our artillery, missile strikes and aviation, Russian occupants left Snake Island,â said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Main Operations Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow says it left as a âgoodwill gesture.â You can read more about Snake Islandhere Mykolaiv came under heavy shelling on Wednesday Turning to the conflict on the ground now, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv yesterday has risen to six, the local emergency services say. Another six people were injured and rescuers are continue to search for bodies at the five-storey residential building which came under attack and was destroyed, they added. The six victims are among 10 civilians reported to have been killed in Russian shelling across yesterday and today. Two were killed in shelling of the Donetsk region, and another person died in an attack on the Izyum district of the Kharkiv region, according to posts from the regional governors on messaging service Telegram. And Russian missiles, mortars and artillery hitting the northern Sumy Region left one person dead, the governor there says. We have more now on that diplomatic telling-off Russia has given to the UK ambassador in Moscow over comments made by UK PM Boris Johnson. Earlier this week Johnson said Vladimir Putin would not have started the war in Ukraine if he was a woman and described the operation as a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"". Putin has dismissed Johnson's comments as ""incorrect"". In a statement the Russian foreign ministry said that ""in polite society it is customary to apologise for remarks of this kind"", adding that it was ""unacceptable insulting rhetoric"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also accused the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman of ""every week, threatening to nuke everyone or doing something or another"". The Russian foreign ministry underlined it was ""unacceptable"" for British officials ""to share deliberately false information, especially on alleged threats by Russians 'resorting to nuclear arms'"". Russia has summoned the British ambassador in Moscow to protest against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""offensive"" remarks about President Vladimir Putin, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. Deborah Bronnert was told that Russia ""firmly"" opposed the ""openly offensive comments by the British authorities towards Russia, its leader, its officials as well as the Russian people"", the AFP news agency reported the ministry as saying. Reuters reported that the ""offensive"" statements included those about alleged Russian threats to use nuclear weapons. Ukraine has welcomed the release of 144 soldiers in the biggest prisoner swap seen yet in this war. The exchange includes 95 soldiers who defended Mariupol's steelworkers, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds, blast traumas, burns, fractured bones and amputated limbs, the agency known by the acronym GUR said in a statement on Telegram. There was no comment from Russia about a prisoner swap. But the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine said it had secured the release of 144 soldiers, including its fighters and those of the Russian army. It is the biggest prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia so far The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said Ambulances gathered at the site to treat the injured soldiers Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter The Snake Island defenders were depicted in a set of Ukrainian stamps As Russia's troops withdraw from Snake Island, remember the Ukrainian
border guard who went viral when it was first attacked? His name was Roman and he became famous around the world for defiantly swearing at
a Russian warship which had threatened to bomb him and his fellow border guards
on the Black Sea island if they didnât surrender. A recording of the exchange was shared widely on social media in the
early days of the war - and the Ukrainian government declared that Roman and
his comrades had died as national heroes. Romanâs mother Tetyana thought that he had died - but it turned out he
was still alive. I interviewed her forBBC Radio 4âs War on Truth podcast, where she
told me about what it was like being at the heart of the information
war over Ukraine. Her story
tells us a lot about how propaganda battles play out alongside military
action. In
the fog of war, it can be hard to tell what is a concerted effort to mislead -
war strategy and propaganda - and what is just down to confusion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has met Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin on consecutive days, says his country would like the war to end soon. Speaking at a news conference with Putin in Moscow following their meeting, Widodo said: ""Although the external situation is still difficult, it is still important to move towards a settlement and open dialogue. ""I call on all world leaders to revive the spirit of co-operation,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the talks had been productive, adding: ""I am convinced that the agreements reached today will further strengthen the Russian-Indonesian partnership."" But the Russian leader took the opportunity to blame the West for any potential global food crisis. ""We have repeatedly stressed that the imbalance of food markets is a direct consequence of many years of irresponsible economic policies of a number of countries, uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts, and the situation has worsened since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""However, Western countries, not wanting to admit the fallacy of their economic course, are further destabilising global agricultural production by imposing restrictions on the supply of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers,"" he said, repeating his claim that sanctions are preventing agricultural exports from leaving the region, rather than Russia's invasion and its blockade of Black Sea ports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo says he has delivered a message from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Widodo met the Ukrainian president on a visit to Kyiv yesterday and has been in Moscow today for a meeting with Putin. ""I conveyed President Zelensky's message to President Putin,"" Widodo said after the Moscow talks. He did not reveal what the message said but added he's expressed his ""readiness"" to help start communication between the two leaders. Widodo said Indonesia will continue to co-operate with Russia, and in turn Putin told reporters that Russia is ready to fulfil Indonesia's need for fertilisers - the supply of which has been affected by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The Indonesian leader is the current president of the G20 group of nations and a member of a United Nations crisis group set up to address the threat of global hunger resulting from the war. Widodo has invited Zelensky to the November G20 summit in Bali. AFP reports the Ukrainian president told Widodo his attendance would depend on who else was there - Russia is a member of the G20 and as such Putin would be expected to attend. Joko Widodo met Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday... Aiden Aslin (left) and Shaun Pinner (centre) were sentenced alongside Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun Russia has been told to prevent the execution of two Britons who were capturedwhile fighting for Ukraine, by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were sentenced by a Russian proxy  court -which is not internationally recognised - in eastern Ukraine earlier this month. In an emergency ruling, the ECHR said Russia must ensure the death penalty is not carried out, but Russia has dismissed the call for the men to be spared. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""You know that Russia no longer complies with the requirements of the ECHR,"" in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier this month, the family ofMr Aslin said he had been told that the execution would be carried out. Chris MasonPolitical editor, reporting from Madrid After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending
in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in UK Prime
Minister Boris Johnson's opening address at his news conference here at the Nato summit in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to
embark, these decisions, is that we'll reach 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the
decade,"" he announced. This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members
and I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for
defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the
next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number
can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision
points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least
some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't always match. Lysychansk residents are trying to leave the city for safety by train The city of Lysychansk ""suffers from endless air strikes"", according to the governor of Luhansk region,  Serhiy Haidai. He says in a post on Telegram the Russians are using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture the city, which is in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region. It stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. Haidai says ""there is a lot of destruction"" in Lysychansk, the police department has been destroyed and the city's oil refinery damaged. ""It is difficult to find a safe place in the city,"" Haidai says. ""People dream of at least half an hour of silence, but the occupiers do not stop firing from all available weapons."" He says it is difficult to get to and from the city, with roads to Lysychansk ""littered with shell fragments"", and the Russians trying to take control of the highway linking the city with Bakhmut, about 50km away. Many residents who want to leave the city are aiming to do so by train. He says despite this, there are attempts to bring food into the city but adds residents can only access water when it is delivered by the emergency services. Â© 2025 BBC.

The exchange includes 95 soldiers who defended Mariupol's steelworkers, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds, blast traumas, burns, fractured bones and amputated limbs, the agency known by the acronym GUR said in a statement on Telegram. There was no comment from Russia about a prisoner swap. But the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine said it had secured the release of 144 soldiers, including its fighters and those of the Russian army. It is the biggest prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia so far The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said Ambulances gathered at the site to treat the injured soldiers Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter The Snake Island defenders were depicted in a set of Ukrainian stamps As Russia's troops withdraw from Snake Island, remember the Ukrainian
border guard who went viral when it was first attacked? His name was Roman and he became famous around the world for defiantly swearing at
a Russian warship which had threatened to bomb him and his fellow border guards
on the Black Sea island if they didnât surrender. A recording of the exchange was shared widely on social media in the
early days of the war - and the Ukrainian government declared that Roman and
his comrades had died as national heroes. Romanâs mother Tetyana thought that he had died - but it turned out he
was still alive. I interviewed her forBBC Radio 4âs War on Truth podcast, where she
told me about what it was like being at the heart of the information
war over Ukraine. Her story
tells us a lot about how propaganda battles play out alongside military
action. In
the fog of war, it can be hard to tell what is a concerted effort to mislead -
war strategy and propaganda - and what is just down to confusion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has met Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin on consecutive days, says his country would like the war to end soon. Speaking at a news conference with Putin in Moscow following their meeting, Widodo said: ""Although the external situation is still difficult, it is still important to move towards a settlement and open dialogue. ""I call on all world leaders to revive the spirit of co-operation,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the talks had been productive, adding: ""I am convinced that the agreements reached today will further strengthen the Russian-Indonesian partnership."" But the Russian leader took the opportunity to blame the West for any potential global food crisis. ""We have repeatedly stressed that the imbalance of food markets is a direct consequence of many years of irresponsible economic policies of a number of countries, uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts, and the situation has worsened since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""However, Western countries, not wanting to admit the fallacy of their economic course, are further destabilising global agricultural production by imposing restrictions on the supply of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers,"" he said, repeating his claim that sanctions are preventing agricultural exports from leaving the region, rather than Russia's invasion and its blockade of Black Sea ports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo says he has delivered a message from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Widodo met the Ukrainian president on a visit to Kyiv yesterday and has been in Moscow today for a meeting with Putin. ""I conveyed President Zelensky's message to President Putin,"" Widodo said after the Moscow talks. He did not reveal what the message said but added he's expressed his ""readiness"" to help start communication between the two leaders. Widodo said Indonesia will continue to co-operate with Russia, and in turn Putin told reporters that Russia is ready to fulfil Indonesia's need for fertilisers - the supply of which has been affected by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The Indonesian leader is the current president of the G20 group of nations and a member of a United Nations crisis group set up to address the threat of global hunger resulting from the war. Widodo has invited Zelensky to the November G20 summit in Bali. AFP reports the Ukrainian president told Widodo his attendance would depend on who else was there - Russia is a member of the G20 and as such Putin would be expected to attend. Joko Widodo met Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday... Aiden Aslin (left) and Shaun Pinner (centre) were sentenced alongside Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun Russia has been told to prevent the execution of two Britons who were capturedwhile fighting for Ukraine, by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were sentenced by a Russian proxy  court -which is not internationally recognised - in eastern Ukraine earlier this month. In an emergency ruling, the ECHR said Russia must ensure the death penalty is not carried out, but Russia has dismissed the call for the men to be spared. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""You know that Russia no longer complies with the requirements of the ECHR,"" in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier this month, the family ofMr Aslin said he had been told that the execution would be carried out. Chris MasonPolitical editor, reporting from Madrid After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending
in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in UK Prime
Minister Boris Johnson's opening address at his news conference here at the Nato summit in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to
embark, these decisions, is that we'll reach 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the
decade,"" he announced. This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members
and I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for
defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the
next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number
can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision
points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least
some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't always match. Lysychansk residents are trying to leave the city for safety by train The city of Lysychansk ""suffers from endless air strikes"", according to the governor of Luhansk region,  Serhiy Haidai. He says in a post on Telegram the Russians are using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture the city, which is in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region. It stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. Haidai says ""there is a lot of destruction"" in Lysychansk, the police department has been destroyed and the city's oil refinery damaged. ""It is difficult to find a safe place in the city,"" Haidai says. ""People dream of at least half an hour of silence, but the occupiers do not stop firing from all available weapons."" He says it is difficult to get to and from the city, with roads to Lysychansk ""littered with shell fragments"", and the Russians trying to take control of the highway linking the city with Bakhmut, about 50km away. Many residents who want to leave the city are aiming to do so by train. He says despite this, there are attempts to bring food into the city but adds residents can only access water when it is delivered by the emergency services. Â© 2025 BBC.

Emotional Boulter dedicates Wimbledon win to gran,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Katie Boulter dedicates her win against Karolina Pliskova to her gran Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. British wildcard Katie Boulter delighted Wimbledon's Centre Court with a stunning fightback to beat 2021 runner-up Karolina Pliskova. After a 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 win, Boulter fought back tears when revealing her gran Jill died two days ago. ""I'm going to get so emotional. I'd like to dedicate it to her,"" she said after securing her best Grand Slam run. Fellow BritonsLiam BroadyandHeather Watsonalso earned memorable wins on Thursday to reach the third round. Wildcard Broady, 28, won 6-2 4-6 0-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 against Argentine 12th seed Diego Schwartzman to also record his best performance at a major. British number four Watson, 30, matched her best Wimbledon singles performance with a 7-5 6-4 win against China's Wang Qiang. There was the possibility of an all-British meeting between world number 132 Broady andJack Draperin the last 32, but the 20-year-old was beaten by Australian 19th seed Alex de Minaur. Draper, who earned direct entry into the men's draw for the first time, won the first set before De Minaur's greater experience and endurance enabled him to take control. Draper was only playing in his third Grand Slam match, compared with a 44th for his opponent, and it ended in a 5-7 7-6 (7-0) 6-2 6-3 defeat. Boulter watched on from 23-year-old De Minaur's box and stood to applaud when her boyfriend made the Wimbledon third round for the second time in his career. Another British exit came whenHarriet Dartlost to eighth seed Jessica Pegula, with the American fighting back to win 4-6 6-3 6-1. British wildcardAlastair Gray,ranked 288th and making his men's singles debut at the All England Club, had chances against American 11th seed Taylor Fritz before falling to a 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 defeat. Second Serve: Doubts linger about doubles pair's 'Harmony' and a 'Wookie' error Kyrgios wins 'to remind everyone' of his ability Kvitova sets up encounter with fourth seed Badosa Boulter, once the emerging and exciting talent in the British women's game, is trying to rebuild her career after it was heavily interrupted by injury problems in recent years. The British number three reached a career-high 82nd in the world rankings and was on an upward trajectory before her injury problems began in early 2019. Boulter, now ranked 118th, proved she still has the talent to beat the best when she earned the biggest win of her career against world number seven Pliskova in Eastbourne last week. Now the 25-year-old has eclipsed that with another victory over the Czech former world number one, this time on the one of the greatest stages in the sport and against a backdrop of personal grief. Boulter struggled for words in the on-court interview immediately after she sealed victory, with an ecstatic crowd initially thinking it was solely down to the magnitude of her achievement. When asked later about her gran, Boulter said: ""Her favourite tournament was Wimbledon. That's why it's a special one for me. She'd watch every single match that was on the TV. ""It's been a tough few days for sure. I've tried to kind of get my emotions out and deal with the situation, try and keep my head on the tennis. ""I was lucky because my grandpa managed to come down from Leicester, and so we could keep him company and keep supporting him at the same time."" This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Katie Boulter come from a set down to beat Karolina Pliskova When Boulter won the second set, the family members supporting from her box - which included her mother Sue, brother James and grandfather - shared emotional and jubilant hugs. It was a similar scene when Boulter clinched a memorable win with a net volley. Shaking both fists in the air, Boulter smiled as she looked towards her family and moments later revealed why the celebrations meant so much. On Saturday, she will aim to reach the last 16 when she faces France's Harmony Tan. Tan, making her Wimbledon main-draw debut this year, beat American great Serena Williams in the first round and backed up that memorable win with a 6-2 6-4 victory over Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo. ""It's a dream come true for me and if I can have you behind me for those I can probably go a long way,"" Boulter, who lost at the same stage on the 15,000-capacity show court last year, told the Centre Court crowd. This video can not be played Wimbledon: Watch the stunning best shots as Broady beats Diego Schwartzman to advance British number five Broady is finally starting to reap the rewards of a more professional outlook as he celebrated making the last 32 of a major at the seventh attempt. A promising junior who made the 2011 Wimbledon boys' final, Broady won his first ATP Challenger title last year and reached a career-high ranking of 116 earlier this season. The left-hander has achieved several more notable milestones this season, including qualifying for a first appearance at the Australian Open, and has spoken about how his fortunes have improved after limiting his nights out. Now his increased dedication has resulted in one of the most unforgettable days of his career in front of a jubilant home crowd. Broady trailed by two sets to one, and was a break down in the fourth, after 2020 French Open semi-finalist Schwartzman won 11 games in a row. But he recovered to win a fourth-set tie-break and then sealed victory by winning the final five games of the decider. ""Sometimes I struggle a bit to put the ball in the court but my heart is always there,"" said Broady, who initially walked off court before realising he had to give a winning on-court interview. ""With everyone out there it was incredible and there was no way I was giving up."" Watson, 30, needed only one game to wrap up victory in a match halted by darkness on Wednesday. Watson, who has played in singles every day of the tournament and only had four hours' sleep on Wednesday night, will face Slovenian Kaja Juvan on Friday. ""I woke up not feeling great this morning,"" the world number 121 said. ""It's been a really tough few days for me with the scheduling. It's not been on my side at all. ""I've just tried to do the best I could. In every situation try to stay positive and in the moment. I feel like I've handled it really well."" Heather Watson has reached the Wimbledon third round on three previous occasions Watson, who said she had to take a caffeine gel before playing on Wednesday which had then affected her sleep, said she might have to have a nap before her doubles match scheduled for later in the day. But that match, where she is playing alongside compatriot Dart, was later moved to another day. In the men's singles, 24-year-old Gray served for the second set against Fritz but was eventually beaten by the recent Eastbourne champion. Gray saved two set points in the second-set tie-break and thought he had saved a third, running away in celebration after stretching for a forehand volley, but a diving Fritz managed to get to the ball and send it back over the net.

"Mum, stepdad and teen sentenced for boy's murderA judge says the attack on the ""defenceless"" Logan Mwangi was ""nothing short of horrifying"".Wales","Logan Mwangi was a previously ""smiling, cheerful little boy"", the court heard A mother, stepfather and a teenager have been given life sentences for murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi and dumping his body in a river. John Cole, 40, will serve a minimum term of 29 years in prison while Logan's mother, Angharad Williamson, 31, will serve at least 28 years. Craig Mulligan, 14, will serve at least 15 years.All three were convicted of murdering Loganin July 2021. His body was found in the River Ogmore, near his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. Mrs Justice Jefford told Cardiff Crown Court that the attack on the ""defenceless"" schoolboy, who weighed 3st 1lb (20kg), was ""nothing short of horrifying"". Mulligan -who can now be publicly named for the first timeafter a judge lifted ananonymity order,external- is not the biological son of Cole but he raised him from the age of nine months and considered himself a father figure. WatchLogan Mwangi: A Boy Betrayedon iPlayer. Juror's nightmares after child murder trial Why Logan Mwangi's teenage killer can now be named How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Rejecting Williamson's version of events that Cole and Mulligan attacked Logan two days before his body was found and that she had run out of the house in an attempt to get help, Mrs Justice Jefford said: ""That was made up after the event to protect yourself and shift the blame. ""You had an opportunity to protect your son from further injury and you did nothing. ""Whatever time the ferocious assault on Logan happened, he was for the most part of Friday injured or dying."" Angharad Williamson, 31, Craig Mulligan, 14, and John Cole, 40, have been sentenced for Logan's murder Police officers found Logan partially submerged in the river in Pandy Park, just 250m from his home. He was wearing his dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top. His body was dumped like ""fly-tipped rubbish"", the prosecution said. During the trial, jurors had heard howLogan was treated like a prisoner in the days before his death. On 20 July, Logan tested positive for Covid-19 and he was shut in his bedroom for 10 days with a baby gate stopping him from leaving. Mrs Justice Jefford described this decision by the couple as ""extreme"" and said the treatment of him was ""the culmination of treatment that had dehumanised him"". Logan's stammer is said to have worsened, becoming particularly bad around Cole, the jury was told, and he wet himself more frequently and began self-harming. This video can not be played How Logan Mwangi's killers tried to fool police The jury were played extensive CCTV footage from nearby houses which showed Cole and Mulligan at 02:43 BST on 31 July moving Logan's body in a sports bag to the nearby river, where they dumped it. They were caught again as they came back to the house to pick up the dinosaur pyjama top Logan had been wearing, which police found in a wooded area with a big cut in. Talking about the cover-up, Mrs Justice Jefford said what they did was ""careful and calculated and not the product of panic"". ""It is impossible to imagine the terror a five-year-old would feel suffering those horrific injuries inflicted upon him by those regarded as his family with the compliance of his mother."" The concealment of Logan's body in the river, was described as ""heartless"", ""calculated and orchestrated"". Logan Mwangi's dad asks why he had to die Boy, 5, 'treated like rubbish in life and death' The jury also heard Mulligan had a ""desire for violence"" andpushed Logan down the stairs, breaking his arm. A support worker once heard him singing: ""I love to punch kids in the head, it's orgasmic."" Mrs Justice Jefford told the trio they were ""all responsible for Logan's death and all the anguish that has flowed from it"". ""Because he was killed in his own home, it is not possible to be sure what has happened to him,"" she said. She described the injuries Logan suffered as ""the sort of injuries seen in abused children"". Logan's body was found 250m away from the home he shared with his family Logan, a previously ""smiling, cheerful little boy"", died after suffering a ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, including extensive bruising to the back of his head and tears in his liver and bowel. Friends of the couple said Cole told them he did not like Logan, and others said his attitude changed after becoming obsessed with the idea that Williamson had cheated on him with Logan's father Ben Mwangi. Ben Mwangi (centre) says he experiences recurring nightmares Ben Mwangi wept as his victim impact statement was read out to the court on his behalf. In it, he recalled collapsing and hitting his head when he was told of his son's death while at work. ""I just felt like every fibre in my body had died and I couldn't stop crying."" After finding out about Williamson's arrest, he said he felt ""devastated that I couldn't have been there to protect him"". Mr Mwangi said he could no longer sleep and experienced recurring nightmares. ""My dreams of Logan are so vivid, Logan comes to tell me that he is OK and to check if I'm OK. ""He runs into my arms and I hold him tight, but he then slowly disappears until he's no longer in my arms. I wake up screaming and crying. ""I find it difficult to go back to sleep, I don't want to go back to sleep because I don't want to experience these dreams because they are so painful."" The courtroom was full, including Logan's family, relatives of the three killers and members of the jury who sat through the trial. Williamson cried throughout and held her head down throughout the sentencing. Cole showed no emotion as he was sentenced, nor did Mulligan. Cole previously pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, while Williamson and Mulligan were found guilty of the same charge. Tondu Primary School set up a memorial garden and ""buddy bench"" in memory of Logan In a statement, Tondu Primary School said Logan was a ""loving, sweet-natured child who was polite and articulate at all times"". ""Logan was always smiling, and was described in court by his own teachers as having the kind of smile that could light up a classroom. ""He was a highly inquisitive child who enjoyed his lessons, particularly when using the outdoor classroom where he would have great fun with his friends. ""Logan loved playing with his classmates, especially games like hide-and-seek or pretending to be superheroes. His favourite character was always Spider-Man and he would display a keen and vivid imagination in his games. ""Ultimately, we remember Logan as being a bright, happy child who was caring and loving, and an absolute pleasure to teach.""

"Defence spending to rise as dangers increase - PMBoris Johnson says it will hit 2.5% of GDP by 2030, after the defence secretary called for change.UKComments","The UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade, Boris Johnson has said. As Nato members discussed their response to Russian aggression, the prime minister said the ""cost of freedom"" is ""always worth paying"". It is expected to mean an extra Â£55bn by 2030, and could mean investments in future air combat capabilities for a ""more dangerous"" world, the PM said. The defence secretary had reportedly called for a faster timescale. Ben Wallace said in a speech on Tuesday that investment in defence had to grow ""before it's too late"". But he later denied reports he had called for spending in 2028 to reach 2.5% of GDP - a measure of the size of the nation's economy - in a letter to the prime minister. A source close to Mr Wallace said he was ""very grateful"" for the budget increase and had ""always been clear that as the threat changes, so should defence spending"". Setting out his intention as the Nato summit in Madrid drew to a close, Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""invest for the long-term in vital capabilities"" such as air combat and adapt to ""a more dangerous and more competitive world"". Russia threat requires Army cash boost - minister Is the government breaking its promise on defence? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said ministers should listen to warnings from British Army chief Gen Sir Patrick Sanders that the world is in a ""1937 moment"" - referring to Europe's failure to confront the growing Nazi threat before World War Two. ""This timid increase over eight years shows we still don't appreciate the changing geo-political landscape and the scale of threats coming over the horizon,"" Mr Ellwood said. ""The funds are needed immediately to reversecuts to troop numbers, tanks, ships and fast jets - not in eight years' time."" After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in the prime minister's opening address at his news conference here in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to embark, of these decisions, is 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the decade."" This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members. I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't match. Last year, the UK spent Â£42.4bn on defence, which was a Â£2.5bn increase on the previous year. The UK is now counting its support for Ukraine as part of its defence spending, bringing the current total to 2.3% of GDP. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the size of the economy by adding together the total value of all the goods and services produced. It stood at Â£2.1 trillion last year. Addressing questions about spiralling inflation due to the war in Ukraine, Mr Johnson told a news conference ""the cost of freedom, as it were, is actually always worth paying"". He said that, unless Russia is stopped, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be able to commit further acts of aggression against neighbouring countries, causing ""further oil shocks, further panics and more economic distress for the whole world"".

Post Office scandal victims to get more money,"The group first won compensation in 2019 More than 500 sub-postmasters wrongly suspected or accused of taking money by the Post Office are to get an interim payment worth around Â£40,000 each. They were all affected by faulty software which made it look like money was missing from their branches. Despite winning Â£58m in compensation in 2019, the group's funds were swallowed up due to a ""no win, no fee"" agreement. Many have been left with no financial resources, while being excluded from other Post Office compensation schemes. The Postal Affairs Minister, Paul Scully, announced in March that this group would be put on a level pegging to other victims in this scandal, but it has taken months to lay out the process for that to take place, after years of fighting to prove their innocence. Now Mr Scully says an interim payment of compensation totalling Â£19.5m will be paid until a final agreement is reached, which he said he hopes would go some way to helping many postmasters who are still facing hardships. Some of this group had been given wrongful criminal convictions and so are entitled to separate higher payouts, but the majority who lost their jobs, their businesses and their livelihoods have so far been excluded. The payout has brought relief of a kind to many within the group, after mounting frustration as they felt strung along by promises from the minister without any details. The minister says the latest payments will be made within weeks, but it's not a final amount yet. Freeths solicitors, who represented the victims in the civil case, have now been brought in by the government to try to speed up the process of getting those full payments faster. Post Office scandal victims wait for compensation Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? A Post Office spokesperson said that the chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, had been urging the government to take action on this for some time, and that ""Ensuring full, fair and final compensation for all Horizon Scandal victims is a priority as we put right the wrongs of the past."" There was also more information about progress for those who have had their convictions overturned. Despite having their names cleared, no final settlements have been reached. Many are old, and plenty are still struggling financial after decades of bankruptcy for a crime they were not guilty of. Legal teams had been at such loggerheads on how to financially quantify the impact of this scandal that a neutral party has been appointed to come up with a suggestion. Mr Scully has announced that former Supreme Court Judge Lord Dyson is expected to make an announcement by the end of July.

"Nearly 40,000 BT workers vote to strike over pay","Thousands of BT workers have voted to go on strike in a dispute over pay. Some 30,000 Openreach engineers and 9,000 BT call centre workers were balloted and overwhelmingly backed industrial action, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) said. General secretary Dave Ward said BT now faced its first national strike since it was privatised in the 1980s. BT said it was disappointed and would ""work to keep our customers and the country connected"" if staff walked out. Mr Ward said he expected BT to offer a ""significantly improved"" pay rise by next week or strike dates will be set. CWU said the potential strike action would have a serious effect on the roll-out of broadband and could cause big problems for those working from home. Royal Mail workers to vote on strike over pay Why didn't rail strikes cause more disruption? Big pay rises could push prices up, says minister Prices are rising at their fastest rate with UK inflation at a 40-year high of 9.1%. Higher costs for food, unprecedented energy bills and soaring fuel prices are putting households under pressure and workers and unions are pushing for pay rises to help them cope. But the government haswarned against bosses giving big wage increasesfor fear of causing a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through higher prices. This year BT gave staff a Â£1,500 per year pay rise but CWU said that with price rises at record highs ""this is a dramatic real-terms pay cut"". It said BT made Â£1.3bn in annual profit and the company's chief executive, Philip Jansen, received a Â£3.5m salary - a 32% increase. A BT Group spokesperson said the company had awarded its highest pay rise for frontline colleagues in more than 20 years - an average 5% increase and up to 8% for those on the lowest salaries. It said it was in the middle of a once-in-a-generation investment programme to upgrade the country's broadband and mobile networks which was vital for millions of customers and the UK economy. ""Above all, [the investments] are central to the success of this business - and its colleagues - now and in the future,"" they said. The CWU announced that on a 74.8% turnout, the union's 30,000 Openreach engineers voted by 95.8% to take strike action. It said BT staff, including 9,000 call centre workers, voted by 91.5% on a 58.2% turnout for strike action. A vote by CWU members at EE failed by a few votes to reach the legal threshold.

"Up to 21,000 people hit by ghost broking scamThere's a warning to ""safeguard personal finances against fraud"" amidst the cost of living crisis.","Ghost broking. It's a term you may not have heard before, but it's thought up to 21,000 people in the UK have fallen victim to this car insurance scam. People should ""safeguard their personal finances against fraud"" amidst the cost of living crisis, warns The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB). It comes after an investigation by Which? found a scam has given motorists fraudulent cover. Last year, 517 reports were made by victims,according to Action Fraud,external. ""Young and vulnerable people are constantly being targeted online with fake car insurance deals,"" says Ben Fletcher, director at the IFB. The IFB says insurers last yearcollectively reported,externalmore than 21,000 policies that could be connected to the scam. ""The cost of living crisis means it's never been more important for people to safeguard their personal finances against fraud,"" he added. More people looking for cheaper deals can ""be an additive"" to the scam, according to cyber security expert and former crime officer Jake Moore. Ghost brokers can be individuals or groups that are unlicensed, who pose as middlemen for insurance companies and claim to be able to find cheap car insurance prices for those struggling to get affordable cover. They have various ways of operating - including selling bogus paperwork to victims, and they'll often sell a policy that will appear against the vehicle on the Motor Insurance Database. ""They might advertise on student websites or through WhatsApp and social media,"" Jake says. The problem, according to Jake, is they will go and cancel it without you knowing a couple of weeks later, so they'll get the money back. Then you'll be without insurance, leaving you potentially liable for fraud and at risk of penalties for driving uninsured. Fraudsters target under-35s on WhatsApp 'I wish I hadn't given Â£300k to a man I met online' Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen' In 2021, ghost broking victims who contacted Action Fraud reported losses of Â£1,950 each, on average. So what can you do to avoid falling victim to this scam? Here are Jake's tips. ""People need to be very wary of brokers using just their mobile phone, or WhatsApp or just their email as a way of contact,"" he says. ""And you need to really stick to the authentic roots of car insurance. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is."" ""For peace of mind, you can actually go and check out on the Financial Conduct authority's website for a list of authorised brokers."" If they aren't authorised - stay away. After using a broker, get in touch with the company they've given you to ""double check your car is insured"". ""If you aren't insured, then you're going to be losing a lot more money than the savings you've had from using that broker."" When you come across a really good deal on a shopping trip, you might share it with your friends and family. Do the same for car insurance deals. ""It goes back to erring on the side of caution. Why is something less than what you'd expect it to be? Is there a reason?"" ""Usually someone else points out that it could be a scam, and they might be the first one to go and search online and realise it may be part of a con,"" Jake adds. People don't like reporting things on social media ""because they think it's not going anywhere"", Jake says. ""But if lots of people get together and do report it, then it will be seen by a human pair of eyes. And they will do what they can to block those accounts."" This video can not be played Reporter Dan Whitworth was phoned by a fraudster and managed to record the call Jake says scammers ""are very good at tailoring their craft"" and looking for ways to con people. ""The government really struggle with the sophistication behind these new emerging scams, they're, they're often one step or even two steps behind."" Jake has investigated these crimes for cyber police and says ""it's getting more difficult every day."" ""It comes back to that education, making people aware this actually happens.

"Extreme hoarder jailed for leaving sister to dieJulie Burdett was found emaciated and covered in her own faeces, urine and vomit, a court hears.","Philip Burdett, 59, and Ralph Burdett, 93, were described as ""extreme hoarders"" in court The hoarder brother of a disabled woman who died from extreme ulcerations after being left on her bedroom floor for two weeks has been jailed for manslaughter. Philip Burdett was paid a carer's allowance of Â£60 a week to look after his sister Julie Burdett. Her emaciated body was found covered in her own faeces, urine and vomit when paramedics were called to the family home in Leicester in 2019. Her father was found guilty of allowing the death of a vulnerable adult. This is a lesser charge than manslaughter, of which he was found not guilty by a jury. Leicester Crown Court heard the family had an ""aversion"" to hospitals following the death of Ms Burdett's mother, Grace, in 2005. The judge, Mr Justice Pepperall, said this was ""not a case of callous disregard"". ""Indeed, there is abundant evidence that you both loved Julie very much,"" he told the defendants. ""I accept that Julie herself made you both promise that you would not let anyone else care for her and that you would not cause her to be admitted to hospital. ""Misguided though it was, I accept that you convinced yourselves that it was in Julie's best interests to remain at home and buried your heads in the sand. ""You plainly intended her no harm but you were in denial."" Philip Burdett was jailed for three years after being found guilty by a jury of gross negligence manslaughter. Ralph Burdett was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, suspended for two years. The court was told Ms Burdett was 61 when paramedics found her dead on 15 January 2019. She was described by the judge as being a ""friendly, articulate and clever woman"". However, he said, she had suffered from chronic and complex medical conditions for many years. These interrupted her university studies and had also cut short her working life. ""As she became more immobile her limited social life became more difficult and in her last years she barely left her home,"" the judge said. She lived at home with her brother, father and mother. However, her mother died in 2005 and the family became ""increasingly reclusive"", according to the judge. They were also ""extreme hoarders"", and Ms Burdett's bedroom was ""particularly bad, to the extent that even her bed was covered in clutter"". Julie had been on her bedroom floor for at least two weeks by the time of her death, according to evidence heard at the trial. ""Julie died an appalling death in horrific and filthy conditions on the floor of her bedroom covered in her own faeces, urine and vomit,"" the judge said. ""She was too weak to get back into bed or even to bear some of her own weight to allow someone else to help her."" Ms Burdett weighed just 30kg (4st 10lb) at her death. ""She had suffered the most extensive pressure sores that an expert in tissue viability with over 40 years' experience in nursing had ever seen,"" the judge said. ""On both her back and her hip, the tissue had become completely necrotic and her wounds infected with MRSA. She developed osteomyelitis and overwhelming sepsis."" The judge said no professionals had raised concerns over the years as to Philip Burdett's care of his sister. ""While he was capable of being an effective carer while Julie was relatively mobile and was independent in the activities of daily living, he was utterly out of his depth when that situation changed in January 2019,"" he said. He said Philip Burdett suffered from health problems himself, namely a recurrent depressive disorder which was characterised by insomnia and suicidal ideation, and also agoraphobia, which made him irrationally anxious about leaving the house. He had also not been well over Christmas and the New Year. ""Your own incapacitation undermined your ability to provide proper care for your sister at least at the beginning of this crisis,"" the judge said.

"Defence spending to rise as dangers increase - PMBoris Johnson says it will hit 2.5% of GDP by 2030, after the defence secretary called for change.UKCommentsFormer SNP MP jailed for embezzling Â£25,000Natalie McGarry sentenced to two years for taking cash from the SNP and a pro-independence group.Scotland","The UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade, Boris Johnson has said. As Nato members discussed their response to Russian aggression, the prime minister said the ""cost of freedom"" is ""always worth paying"". It is expected to mean an extra Â£55bn by 2030, and could mean investments in future air combat capabilities for a ""more dangerous"" world, the PM said. The defence secretary had reportedly called for a faster timescale. Ben Wallace said in a speech on Tuesday that investment in defence had to grow ""before it's too late"". But he later denied reports he had called for spending in 2028 to reach 2.5% of GDP - a measure of the size of the nation's economy - in a letter to the prime minister. A source close to Mr Wallace said he was ""very grateful"" for the budget increase and had ""always been clear that as the threat changes, so should defence spending"". Setting out his intention as the Nato summit in Madrid drew to a close, Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""invest for the long-term in vital capabilities"" such as air combat and adapt to ""a more dangerous and more competitive world"".

Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said ministers should listen to warnings from British Army chief Gen Sir Patrick Sanders that the world is in a ""1937 moment"" - referring to Europe's failure to confront the growing Nazi threat before World War Two. ""This timid increase over eight years shows we still don't appreciate the changing geo-political landscape and the scale of threats coming over the horizon,"" Mr Ellwood said. ""The funds are needed immediately to reversecuts to troop numbers, tanks, ships and fast jets - not in eight years' time."" After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in the prime minister's opening address at his news conference here in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to embark, of these decisions, is 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the decade."" This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members. I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't match. Last year, the UK spent Â£42.4bn on defence, which was a Â£2.5bn increase on the previous year. The UK is now counting its support for Ukraine as part of its defence spending, bringing the current total to 2.3% of GDP. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the size of the economy by adding together the total value of all the goods and services produced. It stood at Â£2.1 trillion last year. Addressing questions about spiralling inflation due to the war in Ukraine, Mr Johnson told a news conference ""the cost of freedom, as it were, is actually always worth paying"". He said that, unless Russia is stopped, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be able to commit further acts of aggression against neighbouring countries, causing ""further oil shocks, further panics and more economic distress for the whole world"".

"Former SNP MP jailed for embezzling Â£25,000Natalie McGarry sentenced to two years for taking cash from the SNP and a pro-independence group.Scotland","Natalie McGarry arrives at court for sentencing for her embezzlement conviction Former SNP MP Natalie McGarry has been jailed for embezzling Â£25,000 from the SNP and a pro-independence group. The 40-year-old was sentenced to two years in prison. She was found guilty last month of embezzling Â£19,974 while treasurer of Women For Independence and Â£4,661 when she was treasurer, secretary and convener of the Glasgow Regional Association of the SNP. McGarry was the MP for Glasgow East between 2015 and 2017. Sentencing McGarry, Sheriff Tom Hughes said she had betrayed people who put their trust in her and that a custodial sentence was inevitable. He told her: ""It's quite clear that society has a right to expect the highest standards from those who seek and eventually achieve high public office."" He added: ""Through your role in these offences, you have not only betrayed the trust placed in you by others, but your standards have fallen well short of those the public should have a right to expect from MPs."" McGarry was elected as the MP for Glasgow East in 2015, but did not stand in the snap general election two years later In December 2019, McGarry had an earlierconviction for embezzlement quashedafter judges ruled she had suffered a miscarriage of justice. However, last month, the jury returned majority verdicts on two charges after three hours of deliberations. It was alleged during the second, six-week trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court that McGarry spent some of the money on expenses such as rent and shopping. Her legal team had admitted that her finances were ""disorganised"" and ""chaotic"", but she denied both charges. Former MP found guilty of embezzling Â£25,000 Ex-MP says she forgot bill after Â£2,000 payment I wasn't skint after election, says ex-MP McGarry The court heard from dozens of witnesses,including Scotland's former health secretary Jeane Freeman,who said she reported McGarry after noticing a significant shortfall in WFI accounts. Ms Freeman said she had no idea donations made to the group's independence crowdfunder were going from the organisation's PayPal account into McGarry's personal bank account. She also voiced her frustrations at McGarry's delay in handing over receipts and invoices which would show what the funds had been spent on. The court also heard from witnesses that McGarry had personal financial difficulties and regularly received loans from family and friends. That included from Humza Yousaf, the current Scottish health secretary, who gave McGarry Â£600 to prevent her from being evicted from her house. The court also saw McGarry's bank records, which showed crowdfunder donations from WFI being transferred to her own personal account. McGarry had said these were ""legitimate"" expenses which she had incurred and which she was reimbursing herself for. Jeane Freeman gave evidence in the trial of Natalie McGarry A WFI financial probe in late 2015 discovered an income and expenditure gap of Â£31,824 and the matter was reported to the police. McGarry paid back Â£6,436.21 in September 2015, funded by a Â£6,500 loan from a friend. In the 2019 trial, McGarry pled guilty to two charges of embezzlement and later attempted to withdraw the guilty pleas. She had not guilty pleas accepted to another embezzlement charge, and a charge that she refused to give police the passcode for a mobile phone. Her lawyer in that trial told the court she had suffered mental health issues over the years, including depression and anxiety, and also had postpartum depression following the birth of her daughter in November 2017. She wassentenced to 18 months in prisonbut was freed on bail a few days later after lodging an appeal. McGarry was elected as an SNP MP in 2015 but resigned the party whip after the allegations against her were first made. She did not seek re-election in the 2017 general election.

"Defence spending to rise as dangers increase - PMBoris Johnson says it will hit 2.5% of GDP by 2030, after the defence secretary called for change.UKCommentsSchool summer holidays could be cut to four weeksOne teaching union says there are ""many more pressing issues that need attention"".Wales","The UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade, Boris Johnson has said. As Nato members discussed their response to Russian aggression, the prime minister said the ""cost of freedom"" is ""always worth paying"". It is expected to mean an extra Â£55bn by 2030, and could mean investments in future air combat capabilities for a ""more dangerous"" world, the PM said. The defence secretary had reportedly called for a faster timescale. Ben Wallace said in a speech on Tuesday that investment in defence had to grow ""before it's too late"". But he later denied reports he had called for spending in 2028 to reach 2.5% of GDP - a measure of the size of the nation's economy - in a letter to the prime minister. A source close to Mr Wallace said he was ""very grateful"" for the budget increase and had ""always been clear that as the threat changes, so should defence spending"". Setting out his intention as the Nato summit in Madrid drew to a close, Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""invest for the long-term in vital capabilities"" such as air combat and adapt to ""a more dangerous and more competitive world"". Russia threat requires Army cash boost - minister Is the government breaking its promise on defence? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said ministers should listen to warnings from British Army chief Gen Sir Patrick Sanders that the world is in a ""1937 moment"" - referring to Europe's failure to confront the growing Nazi threat before World War Two. ""This timid increase over eight years shows we still don't appreciate the changing geo-political landscape and the scale of threats coming over the horizon,"" Mr Ellwood said. ""The funds are needed immediately to reversecuts to troop numbers, tanks, ships and fast jets - not in eight years' time."" After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in the prime minister's opening address at his news conference here in Madrid.

"School summer holidays could be cut to four weeksOne teaching union says there are ""many more pressing issues that need attention"".Wales","There has been concern disadvantaged pupils fall behind over the summer break School summer holidays in Wales could be cut to as little as four weeks as part of a shake-up of term times. Welsh government education minister Jeremy Miles has ruled out cutting the break to two or three weeks or having fewer holidays. One union said there were ""many more pressing issues that need attention"". Mr Miles said public research showed while there was ""reasonable contentment"" with the timetable there was ""openness"" to change. A public consultation on whether the summer holidays should be shortened is due to begin in the next academic year. Activists want meat cut from Wales' school dinners Grandmother wants lessons in Welsh schools TikTok gives better period education than schools, say teens It is likely to present different options for changing the pattern of school terms. Head teacher Clive Williams said staff room suggestions included taking a week from the summer holidays and adding it to an autumn break A report by Beaufort Research for the government came up with three: A five-week summer break with three school terms of about 13 weeks, with a one-week break halfway and three weeks at Christmas A four-week summer break with five school terms of about seven or eight weeks. Three weeks holiday at Christmas and two weeks between the other terms A three-week summer break with terms lasting about six or seven weeks with fortnightly breaks in between Overall, the report said people were content with the current six-week summer holiday with two weeks at Christmas, two at Easter and three week-long half-term breaks. Mr Miles said the research showed people were open to looking at how holidays were spread out and more consistent term lengths. ""Exploring options for change can enable us to support curriculum planning and delivery, tackle disadvantage and educational inequalities, and support learner and staff well-being,"" he said. ""We now have an opportunity to explore these issues in the context of whether the current structure really is the best system to deliver on these shared priorities."" There has been concern that disadvantaged pupils in particular lose progress over the long summer break. Some have argued that adding holidays at other times in the year would help refresh staff and pupils. The report for the government showed pupils favoured the longer break and researchers said more work would be needed on the impact of any change on exam timetables. Concerns in the tourism industry that reducing the summer break would have ""serious consequences"" for an important economic sector should also be addressed, they said. Head teachers' representatives have questioned why the minister wanted to push ahead with reforms in view of research which showed ""no great appetite"" for change. Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said there were ""many more pressing issues"" such as funding teacher shortages, education recovery following the pandemic and the launch of anew curriculum. ""There would need to be very clear educational benefits to justify such a huge upheaval and so much time and energy, and it is imperative that detailed evidence is provided along with any proposals,"" she said. Clive Williams, head teacher at Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, welcomed the consultation, saying a long school holiday could be a challenge for some parents and children. ""Having that long summer break of six or possibly seven weeks on some occasions can be a very difficult situation for some of them,"" he said. ""I think there is a general consensus that some children would be safer and they would feel more supported in the school environment."" He said there seemed to be a consensus among some of his staff for an extended summer break, although some had suggested taking a week from the summer holidays and adding it to the autumn half-term break. Dollie, a Year 6 Ysgol Gymraeg pupil, said: ""I like a long holiday but sometimes it's difficult because you don't see your friends over the holidays and sometimes you want to be at school."" Her classmate Gruffydd added: ""I think it works out well at the moment, there is enough time to do what you want in the summer but it would be nice to get more holiday time at Christmas."" NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel challenged the report's transparency Head teachers' union NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel challenged the report's transparency, claiming the questions were pushing a Welsh government agenda. She said: ""Those who identified current arrangements as their preference were presented with a series of alternative options with no choice of retaining the status quo, the key question is how changing term times would improve outcomes for learners. This remains unanswered."" Ms Doel said evidence available showed countries with longer summer breaks than Wales had higher attainment levels. NEU Cymru said the majority of its members were concerned about the plans. Its Wales secretary David Evans said: ""We believe it is really important the Welsh government speak to the education workforce about their concerns. ""This is an extremely challenging time for everyone in education - we still have Covid disruption, we have the new curriculum starting in September, and the first exams in three years just drawing to a close. Now seems a very strange time to be adding more change to education."" The pledge to look at reform of the school year was part of an agreement with Plaid Cymru in the Senedd.

Mali found the heat a bit much. ""Sometimes it gets too hot, and sometimes it can get a bit boring,"" she said. Charlie gets bored by the end of them. ""I like it but I don't at the same time,"" he said. Mum Amrita Chouhan believed children needed a break from school life Mum-of-two, Amrita Chouhan, from Porthcawl, Bridgend county, believed a six-week holiday was fine. She said: ""Kids should have a break from academic life. They need to go and enjoy the school holidays and spend time with grandparents. ""That is the perfect time to visit family and it can be a productive time."" Luisa Verederame said losing two weeks from the school break could be a problem for her cafe Louisa Verderame, owner of Porthcawl's Piccolo bar and cafe, said holiday trade was important. ""Provided the holidays were moved to Easter time, when there is fair weather when people can still go on holiday and people can provide us with trade would suit us,"" she said. ""The problem is if they completely eradicate two weeks from summer holidays and do not replace them with fair weather time."" Grandma Linda Mitchell said children get bored during the summer holidays Grandmother Linda Mitchell, from Treorchy, who owns a caravan in Porthcawl, thought six weeks was a long time for a break. She said: ""My grandchildren get bored because they have been off school for so long and I think they lose a lot by doing nothing but play, then they have to go back and some kids don't want to go back. ""They lose the continuity as well."" The Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: ""I genuinely cannot believe that at a time when children are not getting the educational support they need after so much disruption, in addition to our young people not getting the mental health and well-being support that they need in school, or even to get back into school, the Labour government are choosing to prioritise this. ""The Labour government also show utter contempt for the wider impact of such decisions, such as the detrimental effect shorter summer holidays could have our tourism industry here in Wales.""

""The problem is if they completely eradicate two weeks from summer holidays and do not replace them with fair weather time."" Grandma Linda Mitchell said children get bored during the summer holidays Grandmother Linda Mitchell, from Treorchy, who owns a caravan in Porthcawl, thought six weeks was a long time for a break. She said: ""My grandchildren get bored because they have been off school for so long and I think they lose a lot by doing nothing but play, then they have to go back and some kids don't want to go back. ""They lose the continuity as well."" The Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: ""I genuinely cannot believe that at a time when children are not getting the educational support they need after so much disruption, in addition to our young people not getting the mental health and well-being support that they need in school, or even to get back into school, the Labour government are choosing to prioritise this. ""The Labour government also show utter contempt for the wider impact of such decisions, such as the detrimental effect shorter summer holidays could have our tourism industry here in Wales.""

Ukrainian troops getting weapons training in UK,"This video can not be played Watch: Footage of Ukrainian troops training in UK Britain has been training hundreds of Ukrainian troops, with new weapons being provided by the UK for their fight with Russia. The training has been taking place over the past few weeks in south-west England's Wiltshire county. The Ukrainians have been learning how to use the British Army's Multiple Rocket Launcher System (MLRS) which has a range of more than 80km (50 miles). Britain is believed to be providing Ukraine with three of these advanced long-range systems. The UK has also purchased around 50 howitzers for Ukraine, another long-range weapon. The L119 light gun howitzer can fire up to 12km (eight miles) away. What weapons are being given to Ukraine by the UK? Inside the room where Ukraine orders arms from the West British and New Zealand soldiers who have been overseeing the training say they have been impressed by the Ukrainian troops' eagerness to learn. ""Their motivation to be quick to learn is incredible... they don't take many breaks,"" Warrant Officer Rebecca Bullock, a master gunner with the Royal Artillery, said. They know their window of learning is reasonably short, she says, so they are motivated to get as much knowledge as possible - ""they just work, work and work and ask a lot of questions"". ""How can they be quicker, how can they move faster, how can they come into action? It is all about the speed."" Along with New Zealand's Captain Jonathan Dick she has been training the bulk of the troops in the use of the L119 gun. ""We definitely see a high degree of motivation and dedication to the defence of Ukraine with these guys,"" Capt Dick said. Ukraine has been vastly outgunned and outnumbered by Russia's artillery and has been pleading for more heavy weapons from the West. For the first time the MoD allowed some of the training to be filmed, as long as no Ukrainian troops were identified That supply has now started to arrive, though still not in the quantities that Ukraine wanted - and the training is taking time. The transition to Western weapons has become even more important as Ukraine runs low on its stocks of Soviet-era artillery rounds. Nato countries use a different calibre of ammunition. Capt Dick described the L119 gun, which fires a 105mm shell, as a ""very capable weapon"". ""It's mobile, it can be slung in the back of helicopters, pushed around, dragged by trucks big or small,"" he said. He believes it will ""fill a gap"" in Ukraine's armoury. Warrant Officer Bullock added ""hopefully they will put it to good use"". The Ukrainians being trained are already experienced artillery soldiers. The head of the US military, General Mark Milley, has called them ""top-notch gunners"". They have certainly been getting plenty of experience. Ukraine's military say that they have been firing between 5,000-6,000 artillery rounds a day in the battle for the Donbas. The Russians have fired nearly 10 times that number. The British Army's Multiple Rocket Launcher System (MLRS) which has a range of more than 50 miles For the Ukrainian troops who came to the UK this has been more of a conversion course rather than a baptism of fire. They have had five days of training followed by a one-day live fire exercise on Salisbury Plain. It has taken longer to train on the Multiple Rocket Launcher System. The MLRS is the British Army's most advanced long range artillery weapon - similar to the US HIMARS rocket launchers already being used in Ukraine. It normally takes five weeks to train an MLRS commander, but for the Ukrainian troops it has been done in just three weeks. They are not just having to learn how to use the new system, but also how to keep them maintained. Captain James Oliphant, of the Royal Artillery, said he believes it is a weapon that will make a big difference. ""It's going to give them more mobility which is going to aid in their survivability,"" he said. Capt James Oliphant said there is a ""common language"" with Ukraine's experienced artillery soldiers Added to that he said it uses rockets ""that can punch out to 84km (52 miles)"" - beyond the range of most Russian artillery. Despite the obvious language barrier Capt Oliphant says they have had a ""common language"" with the Ukrainians who are already experienced in using their own rocket launchers. Over time, the Ukrainians have become more accustomed to the UK equipment, Capt Oliphant says. We are able to take a step back now, he says, with a Ukrainian commander ""exercising his troops under his own doctrine and tactics"". From the Ukrainians there is gratitude for their new weapons and training. Some were fighting for their lives and country before they arrived in the UK and will be doing exactly the same as soon as they return. One said: ""It's hard. My soldiers are still fighting there. I keep thinking of them."" Another Ukrainian soldier speaks of the exhaustion from battle. ""We are just tired, but in the same way we are so motivated to continue our struggle"". He added: ""When others realise we have MLRS they will have strong motivationâ¦ we are powerful and strong"". In reality no one weapon will win this war. And certainly not in such limited numbers. Ukraine has been asking for 300 multiple rocket launchers. The US, UK and Germany are so far supplying less than a dozen, though more may follow. But the West says it is committed to Ukraine's long-term fight. And a few hundred Ukrainian troops training in Britain may soon be followed by thousands more. Boris Johnson has offered to train 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers a month. Ukrainian troops being trained in the UK.

Inquiry begins into Captain Tom Foundation,"Captain Sir Tom Moore became famous for his fundraising efforts during the first coronavirus lockdown An inquiry has been launched into a foundation set up in honour of Capt Sir Tom Moore amid concerns his family may have profited from using his name. The Charity Commission said it was concerned about the The Captain Tom Foundation's independence from a business run by his family. The veteran, who died last year aged 100, raised millions for the NHS but this money is not part of the inquiry. The foundation said it would ""work closely"" with the inquiry. Capt Sir Tom, who was born in Keighley in West Yorkshire, gained international fame when he carried out the fundraising walk at his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, when Covid restrictions were first introduced in 2020. The Â£33m raised (Â£38.9m including gift aid) was managed and distributed by NHS Charities Together before the JustGiving account was closed down. Capt Sir Tom won the nation's hearts with his fundraising walk which took in 100 laps of his garden After he became a well-known figure, his family set up The Captain Tom Foundation, which aims to support and ""empower"" older people through fundraising and awareness campaigns. Shortly before the formation of the foundation his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin, set up a private company called Club Nook Ltd. Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said the watchdog's ""concerns have mounted"" over the charity. ""We consider it in the public interest to examine them through a formal investigation, which gives us access to the full range of our protective and enforcement powers,"" she said. The commission became concerned about arrangements between the charity and Club Nook Ltd, as well as the trustees' decision-making and how the foundation was governed. The issues revolve around a ""failure to consider intellectual property and trademark issues"", including the trademarking of variations of the name ""Captain Tom"" by the company controlled by Ms Ingram-Moore and Mr Ingram-Moore, without objection from the charity. This could have generated ""significant profit"" for the company, the commission added. The Charity Commission said it had concerns over links to a company part-controlled by Sir Capt Tom's daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore Earlier this year, the Commissionreviewed payment of consultancy fees to third partiesbut said it was later ""satisfied"" that these specific payments were a reasonable reimbursement for expenses incurred by the companies in the formation of the charity. It added it was also satisfied that the payments were ""adequately identified and managed"". Stephen Jones, chairman of the board of trustees of The Captain Tom Foundation, said: ""We will of course work closely with the commission in its inquiry."" He said the commission was aware of where the image and intellectual property rights were held when the charity was set up. Jack Gilbert, who became chief executive of the foundation at the beginning of the month, said he would ""ensure that in all respects, including governance and finance, the foundation conforms to best practice"". In March 2022, the publication of the first annual accounts of the foundation showed it had incurred Â£240,000 in costs and given Â£160,000 to good causes. A statement from the Ingram-Moore family said that Club Nook, controlled by Ms Ingram-Moore and Mr Ingram-Moore, ""made its application for various trademarks in April 2020 prior to the formation of The Captain Tom Foundation"", which was in May 2020. ""Neither Hannah nor Colin Ingram-Moore were trustee directors of The Captain Tom Foundation upon its formation,"" the statement added.

"Post Office scandal victims to get more moneyMore than 500 subpostmasters are to get an interim payment from the government worth around Â£40,000 each.Business","The group first won compensation in 2019 More than 500 sub-postmasters wrongly suspected or accused of taking money by the Post Office are to get an interim payment worth around Â£40,000 each. They were all affected by faulty software which made it look like money was missing from their branches. Despite winning Â£58m in compensation in 2019, the group's funds were swallowed up due to a ""no win, no fee"" agreement. Many have been left with no financial resources, while being excluded from other Post Office compensation schemes. The Postal Affairs Minister, Paul Scully, announced in March that this group would be put on a level pegging to other victims in this scandal, but it has taken months to lay out the process for that to take place, after years of fighting to prove their innocence. Now Mr Scully says an interim payment of compensation totalling Â£19.5m will be paid until a final agreement is reached, which he said he hopes would go some way to helping many postmasters who are still facing hardships. Some of this group had been given wrongful criminal convictions and so are entitled to separate higher payouts, but the majority who lost their jobs, their businesses and their livelihoods have so far been excluded. The payout has brought relief of a kind to many within the group, after mounting frustration as they felt strung along by promises from the minister without any details. The minister says the latest payments will be made within weeks, but it's not a final amount yet. Freeths solicitors, who represented the victims in the civil case, have now been brought in by the government to try to speed up the process of getting those full payments faster. Post Office scandal victims wait for compensation Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? A Post Office spokesperson said that the chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, had been urging the government to take action on this for some time, and that ""Ensuring full, fair and final compensation for all Horizon Scandal victims is a priority as we put right the wrongs of the past."" There was also more information about progress for those who have had their convictions overturned. Despite having their names cleared, no final settlements have been reached. Many are old, and plenty are still struggling financial after decades of bankruptcy for a crime they were not guilty of. Legal teams had been at such loggerheads on how to financially quantify the impact of this scandal that a neutral party has been appointed to come up with a suggestion. Mr Scully has announced that former Supreme Court Judge Lord Dyson is expected to make an announcement by the end of July.

LiveLiveRussia withdraws troops from Snake Island1 minute ago,"Indonesia's president says he's delivered a message to Russia's Vladimir Putin from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky Joko Widodo tells reporters after meeting Putin in Moscow that he wants to help start communication between the two leaders Ukraine is celebrating after Russia withdrew its forces from Snake Island - but Moscow says the move is a ""goodwill gesture"" UK PM Boris Johnson commits to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade Nato members have agreed a significant increase in funding for the alliance, on the second day of its Madrid summit The alliance's chief says Sweden and Finland will sign the protocol to join Nato on Tuesday, though member states will then need to ratify it Edited by Rob Corp and Heather Sharp Thank you for joining our live coverage of the Nato summit and war in Ukraine. Here are today's closing headlines:  The writers of today's live page were: Dulcie Lee, James Clarke, Catherine Evans, Malu Cursino, Nadeem Shad and Doug Faulkner. The editors were Holly Wallis, Jeremy Gahagan, Heather Sharp and Rob Corp Since Turkey dropped its veto over Sweden and Finland joining Nato, there have been some concerns over its reasons for doing so. On Wednesday, Ankara said it would seekthe extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspectsfrom Sweden and Finland. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Ankara wanted 12 suspects from Finland and another 21 from Sweden. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"". Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. But on Thursday, Sweden's Justice Minister Morgan Johansson insisted that any decisions regarding extradition of Kurds would be made by ""independent courts"". ""Swedish citizens are not extradited,"" said Johansson. ""Non-Swedish citizens can be extradited at the request of other countries, but only if it is compatible with Swedish law and the European Convention."" A mainstay of Putin's inner circle, Sergei Lavrov, has been drawing some historic parallels during a press conference. The Russian foreign minister said that a new ""iron curtain"" was being put in place between the West and Russia. The term was used during the Cold War to refer to the division between Western countries and those with links to the Soviet Union, as relations between the two sides ebbed to an all time low. ""As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending..."" said Lavrov. ""The process has begun,"" he said, adding that Western countries should ""just behave carefully"". Funerals continue to be held for those who have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. They include victims of the Kremenchuk shopping centre which was hit by Russian rockets on Monday. Relatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony for Andriy Krasyuk who was killed in the Russian rocket attack on the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk on Monday A woman mourns in front of flowers left in memory of civilian victims killed at the shopping mall Natalia, the wife of Ukrainian serviceman Volodymyr Kochetov, 46, who was killed in a fight during Russia's invasion, cries by his coffin during his funeral in the village of Babyntsi, Ukraine A soldier holds a red carnation as he attends the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier at the St Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv We've been reporting on the situation in Lysychansk, a city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, the region's governor, warned residents in Lysychansk to stay in shelters because ""it is no longer possible to evacuate"". Haidai said Russian troops were on the outskirts of the city and were firing from several directions. Earlier, Haidai said the city has beensuffering ""endless air strikes""and the Russians were using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture Lysychansk. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said Russia has been successful in seizing some of the territory in Lysychansk's oil refinery, but that Ukrainian forces had beaten back an attack on a gelatin plant in the city. Lysychansk stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. It's the last major city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region The United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Ukraine says there is ""blatant ignoring"" of international humanitarian and human rights law in parts of the country no longer under Ukrainian government control. Osnat Lubrani says aid organisations were unable to deliver relief supplies, or get access, to Kherson or Mariupol, and had been unable to get agreement on safe passage to evacuate people to leave Severodonetsk. Russian forces are now in control of both Mariupol and Severodonetsk. ""We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart by this war,"" Lubrani says at a news conference in Kyiv. ""But the Russian Federation, also the Ukrainian government, have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible."" More now on Nato's new strategy towards China. Earlier on, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the new approach reflects Russia and China's use of ""economic leverage, coercion, and hybrid approaches to advance their interests in the region"". But Beijing has called Nato's new strategy irresponsible . China's foreign minister, Zhao Lijian, said ""Nato's so-called new strategy concept document disregards the facts"". Lijian said that the new strategy ""wrongly defines China as posing a strategic challenge and smears China's foreign policy"". He added that it is ""irresponsible, encourages conflict, and is full of Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice"". Earlier this week China criticised the West for arming Ukraine. This video can not be played Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg speaks with the BBC's Frank Gardner While Nato's focus has been on the situation in Ukraine, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also spoken about China. For the first time the defence alliance has decided to talk about what it's been calling ""the challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests and values."" It comes as China's military presence has been growing on the world stage. The country recently launched it's third and most modern aircraft carrier joining a very small group of nations that are capable of fielding these kinds of ships. Taiwan, an island in the East China Sea is seen by China as an integral part of its territory. In recent years Beijing officials have threatened military action if any attempts are made for independence. While emphasizing that Taiwan is not a Nato member, the Nato head admitted that what happens to the island does ""matter to Nato allies"". Stoltenberg made the comments during an interview with the BBC's Frank Gardner where Stoltenberg also discussed China and Russia's development of hypersonic missiles. Both countries have led the way in the development of the weapons that are capable of travelling towards their target at more than five times the speed of sound on a unpredictable flight path. Ukraine says it's introducing a trade embargo against Syria and sanctions targeting Syrian legal entities and individuals. It's in response to Syria's decision to recognise the two Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas region, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has announced. On its website it says it ""strongly condemns"" the decision of the Syrian Arab Republic to recognise ""the so-called independence"" of the ""temporarily occupied territories"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. It called the move an ""unfriendly act"" towards Ukraine and a violation of the principles of international law. On Wednesday, Syria's Foreign Ministry announced that the country - an ally of Russia - had recognised the ""independence and sovereignty of the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky severed diplomatic ties with Syria following the announcement. Chris PartridgeBBC News New satellite imagery taken today shows the aftermath of Ukraineâs attack on Snake Island, which many believe forced Russian troops to leave. Pictures from Maxar Technologies were taken this morning, showing whatâs left of burned vehicles and structures across the north end of the island. Artillery strikes and air attacks delivered the blows to Russian forces, something that has been happening frequently to stop Moscow gaining a permanent foothold. We know at least one Russian Pantsir SA-22 air defence unit with medium-range capability was stationed on the island. Itâs not clear whether it was destroyed in this latest attack, or in any of the strikes before. In this second image, a colour infrared view, the black/grey areas present those which were recently burned. Non-burned vegetation shows up red/pink. More details will likely emerge of what was destroyed, but Ukraine is clear it was enough to drive out Russian forces. âNot withstanding the fire of our artillery, missile strikes and aviation, Russian occupants left Snake Island,â said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Main Operations Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow says it left as a âgoodwill gesture.â You can read more about Snake Islandhere Mykolaiv came under heavy shelling on Wednesday Turning to the conflict on the ground now, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv yesterday has risen to six, the local emergency services say. Another six people were injured and rescuers are continue to search for bodies at the five-storey residential building which came under attack and was destroyed, they added. The six victims are among 10 civilians reported to have been killed in Russian shelling across yesterday and today. Two were killed in shelling of the Donetsk region, and another person died in an attack on the Izyum district of the Kharkiv region, according to posts from the regional governors on messaging service Telegram. And Russian missiles, mortars and artillery hitting the northern Sumy Region left one person dead, the governor there says. We have more now on that diplomatic telling-off Russia has given to the UK ambassador in Moscow over comments made by UK PM Boris Johnson. Earlier this week Johnson said Vladimir Putin would not have started the war in Ukraine if he was a woman and described the operation as a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"". Putin has dismissed Johnson's comments as ""incorrect"". In a statement the Russian foreign ministry said that ""in polite society it is customary to apologise for remarks of this kind"", adding that it was ""unacceptable insulting rhetoric"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also accused the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman of ""every week, threatening to nuke everyone or doing something or another"". The Russian foreign ministry underlined it was ""unacceptable"" for British officials ""to share deliberately false information, especially on alleged threats by Russians 'resorting to nuclear arms'"". Russia has summoned the British ambassador in Moscow to protest against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""offensive"" remarks about President Vladimir Putin, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. Deborah Bronnert was told that Russia ""firmly"" opposed the ""openly offensive comments by the British authorities towards Russia, its leader, its officials as well as the Russian people"", the AFP news agency reported the ministry as saying. Reuters reported that the ""offensive"" statements included those about alleged Russian threats to use nuclear weapons. Ukraine has welcomed the release of 144 soldiers in the biggest prisoner swap seen yet in this war. The exchange includes 95 soldiers who defended Mariupol's steelworkers, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds, blast traumas, burns, fractured bones and amputated limbs, the agency known by the acronym GUR said in a statement on Telegram. There was no comment from Russia about a prisoner swap. But the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine said it had secured the release of 144 soldiers, including its fighters and those of the Russian army. It is the biggest prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia so far The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said Ambulances gathered at the site to treat the injured soldiers Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter The Snake Island defenders were depicted in a set of Ukrainian stamps As Russia's troops withdraw from Snake Island, remember the Ukrainian
border guard who went viral when it was first attacked? His name was Roman and he became famous around the world for defiantly swearing at
a Russian warship which had threatened to bomb him and his fellow border guards
on the Black Sea island if they didnât surrender. A recording of the exchange was shared widely on social media in the
early days of the war - and the Ukrainian government declared that Roman and
his comrades had died as national heroes. Romanâs mother Tetyana thought that he had died - but it turned out he
was still alive. I interviewed her forBBC Radio 4âs War on Truth podcast, where she
told me about what it was like being at the heart of the information
war over Ukraine. Her story
tells us a lot about how propaganda battles play out alongside military
action. In
the fog of war, it can be hard to tell what is a concerted effort to mislead -
war strategy and propaganda - and what is just down to confusion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has met Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin on consecutive days, says his country would like the war to end soon. Speaking at a news conference with Putin in Moscow following their meeting, Widodo said: ""Although the external situation is still difficult, it is still important to move towards a settlement and open dialogue. ""I call on all world leaders to revive the spirit of co-operation,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the talks had been productive, adding: ""I am convinced that the agreements reached today will further strengthen the Russian-Indonesian partnership."" But the Russian leader took the opportunity to blame the West for any potential global food crisis. ""We have repeatedly stressed that the imbalance of food markets is a direct consequence of many years of irresponsible economic policies of a number of countries, uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts, and the situation has worsened since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""However, Western countries, not wanting to admit the fallacy of their economic course, are further destabilising global agricultural production by imposing restrictions on the supply of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers,"" he said, repeating his claim that sanctions are preventing agricultural exports from leaving the region, rather than Russia's invasion and its blockade of Black Sea ports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo says he has delivered a message from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Widodo met the Ukrainian president on a visit to Kyiv yesterday and has been in Moscow today for a meeting with Putin. ""I conveyed President Zelensky's message to President Putin,"" Widodo said after the Moscow talks. He did not reveal what the message said but added he's expressed his ""readiness"" to help start communication between the two leaders. Widodo said Indonesia will continue to co-operate with Russia, and in turn Putin told reporters that Russia is ready to fulfil Indonesia's need for fertilisers - the supply of which has been affected by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The Indonesian leader is the current president of the G20 group of nations and a member of a United Nations crisis group set up to address the threat of global hunger resulting from the war. Widodo has invited Zelensky to the November G20 summit in Bali. AFP reports the Ukrainian president told Widodo his attendance would depend on who else was there - Russia is a member of the G20 and as such Putin would be expected to attend. Joko Widodo met Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday... Aiden Aslin (left) and Shaun Pinner (centre) were sentenced alongside Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun Russia has been told to prevent the execution of two Britons who were capturedwhile fighting for Ukraine, by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were sentenced by a Russian proxy  court -which is not internationally recognised - in eastern Ukraine earlier this month. In an emergency ruling, the ECHR said Russia must ensure the death penalty is not carried out, but Russia has dismissed the call for the men to be spared. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""You know that Russia no longer complies with the requirements of the ECHR,"" in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier this month, the family ofMr Aslin said he had been told that the execution would be carried out.

Minister Boris Johnson's opening address at his news conference here at the Nato summit in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to
embark, these decisions, is that we'll reach 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the
decade,"" he announced. This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members
and I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for
defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the
next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number
can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision
points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least
some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't always match. Lysychansk residents are trying to leave the city for safety by train The city of Lysychansk ""suffers from endless air strikes"", according to the governor of Luhansk region,  Serhiy Haidai. He says in a post on Telegram the Russians are using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture the city, which is in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region. It stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. Haidai says ""there is a lot of destruction"" in Lysychansk, the police department has been destroyed and the city's oil refinery damaged. ""It is difficult to find a safe place in the city,"" Haidai says. ""People dream of at least half an hour of silence, but the occupiers do not stop firing from all available weapons."" He says it is difficult to get to and from the city, with roads to Lysychansk ""littered with shell fragments"", and the Russians trying to take control of the highway linking the city with Bakhmut, about 50km away. Many residents who want to leave the city are aiming to do so by train. He says despite this, there are attempts to bring food into the city but adds residents can only access water when it is delivered by the emergency services. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ukrainian troops getting weapons training in UKThe move to Western equipment is increasingly important as Ukraine runs low on Soviet-era arms.,"This video can not be played Watch: Footage of Ukrainian troops training in UK Britain has been training hundreds of Ukrainian troops, with new weapons being provided by the UK for their fight with Russia. The training has been taking place over the past few weeks in south-west England's Wiltshire county. The Ukrainians have been learning how to use the British Army's Multiple Rocket Launcher System (MLRS) which has a range of more than 80km (50 miles). Britain is believed to be providing Ukraine with three of these advanced long-range systems. The UK has also purchased around 50 howitzers for Ukraine, another long-range weapon. The L119 light gun howitzer can fire up to 12km (eight miles) away. What weapons are being given to Ukraine by the UK? Inside the room where Ukraine orders arms from the West British and New Zealand soldiers who have been overseeing the training say they have been impressed by the Ukrainian troops' eagerness to learn. ""Their motivation to be quick to learn is incredible... they don't take many breaks,"" Warrant Officer Rebecca Bullock, a master gunner with the Royal Artillery, said. They know their window of learning is reasonably short, she says, so they are motivated to get as much knowledge as possible - ""they just work, work and work and ask a lot of questions"". ""How can they be quicker, how can they move faster, how can they come into action? It is all about the speed."" Along with New Zealand's Captain Jonathan Dick she has been training the bulk of the troops in the use of the L119 gun. ""We definitely see a high degree of motivation and dedication to the defence of Ukraine with these guys,"" Capt Dick said. Ukraine has been vastly outgunned and outnumbered by Russia's artillery and has been pleading for more heavy weapons from the West. For the first time the MoD allowed some of the training to be filmed, as long as no Ukrainian troops were identified That supply has now started to arrive, though still not in the quantities that Ukraine wanted - and the training is taking time. The transition to Western weapons has become even more important as Ukraine runs low on its stocks of Soviet-era artillery rounds. Nato countries use a different calibre of ammunition. Capt Dick described the L119 gun, which fires a 105mm shell, as a ""very capable weapon"". ""It's mobile, it can be slung in the back of helicopters, pushed around, dragged by trucks big or small,"" he said. He believes it will ""fill a gap"" in Ukraine's armoury. Warrant Officer Bullock added ""hopefully they will put it to good use"". The Ukrainians being trained are already experienced artillery soldiers. The head of the US military, General Mark Milley, has called them ""top-notch gunners"". They have certainly been getting plenty of experience. Ukraine's military say that they have been firing between 5,000-6,000 artillery rounds a day in the battle for the Donbas. The Russians have fired nearly 10 times that number. The British Army's Multiple Rocket Launcher System (MLRS) which has a range of more than 50 miles For the Ukrainian troops who came to the UK this has been more of a conversion course rather than a baptism of fire. They have had five days of training followed by a one-day live fire exercise on Salisbury Plain. It has taken longer to train on the Multiple Rocket Launcher System. The MLRS is the British Army's most advanced long range artillery weapon - similar to the US HIMARS rocket launchers already being used in Ukraine. It normally takes five weeks to train an MLRS commander, but for the Ukrainian troops it has been done in just three weeks. They are not just having to learn how to use the new system, but also how to keep them maintained. Captain James Oliphant, of the Royal Artillery, said he believes it is a weapon that will make a big difference. ""It's going to give them more mobility which is going to aid in their survivability,"" he said. Capt James Oliphant said there is a ""common language"" with Ukraine's experienced artillery soldiers Added to that he said it uses rockets ""that can punch out to 84km (52 miles)"" - beyond the range of most Russian artillery. Despite the obvious language barrier Capt Oliphant says they have had a ""common language"" with the Ukrainians who are already experienced in using their own rocket launchers. Over time, the Ukrainians have become more accustomed to the UK equipment, Capt Oliphant says. We are able to take a step back now, he says, with a Ukrainian commander ""exercising his troops under his own doctrine and tactics"". From the Ukrainians there is gratitude for their new weapons and training. Some were fighting for their lives and country before they arrived in the UK and will be doing exactly the same as soon as they return. One said: ""It's hard. My soldiers are still fighting there. I keep thinking of them."" Another Ukrainian soldier speaks of the exhaustion from battle. ""We are just tired, but in the same way we are so motivated to continue our struggle"". He added: ""When others realise we have MLRS they will have strong motivationâ¦ we are powerful and strong"". In reality no one weapon will win this war. And certainly not in such limited numbers. Ukraine has been asking for 300 multiple rocket launchers. The US, UK and Germany are so far supplying less than a dozen, though more may follow. But the West says it is committed to Ukraine's long-term fight. And a few hundred Ukrainian troops training in Britain may soon be followed by thousands more. Boris Johnson has offered to train 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers a month. Ukrainian troops being trained in the UK.

LiveLiveRussia withdraws troops from Snake Island3 minutes ago,"Indonesia's president says he's delivered a message to Russia's Vladimir Putin from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky Joko Widodo tells reporters after meeting Putin in Moscow that he wants to help start communication between the two leaders Ukraine is celebrating after Russia withdrew its forces from Snake Island - but Moscow says the move is a ""goodwill gesture"" UK PM Boris Johnson commits to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade Nato members have agreed a significant increase in funding for the alliance, on the second day of its Madrid summit The alliance's chief says Sweden and Finland will sign the protocol to join Nato on Tuesday, though member states will then need to ratify it Edited by Rob Corp and Heather Sharp Thank you for joining our live coverage of the Nato summit and war in Ukraine. Here are today's closing headlines:  The writers of today's live page were: Dulcie Lee, James Clarke, Catherine Evans, Malu Cursino, Nadeem Shad and Doug Faulkner. The editors were Holly Wallis, Jeremy Gahagan, Heather Sharp and Rob Corp Since Turkey dropped its veto over Sweden and Finland joining Nato, there have been some concerns over its reasons for doing so. On Wednesday, Ankara said it would seekthe extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspectsfrom Sweden and Finland. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Ankara wanted 12 suspects from Finland and another 21 from Sweden. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"". Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. But on Thursday, Sweden's Justice Minister Morgan Johansson insisted that any decisions regarding extradition of Kurds would be made by ""independent courts"". ""Swedish citizens are not extradited,"" said Johansson. ""Non-Swedish citizens can be extradited at the request of other countries, but only if it is compatible with Swedish law and the European Convention."" A mainstay of Putin's inner circle, Sergei Lavrov, has been drawing some historic parallels during a press conference. The Russian foreign minister said that a new ""iron curtain"" was being put in place between the West and Russia. The term was used during the Cold War to refer to the division between Western countries and those with links to the Soviet Union, as relations between the two sides ebbed to an all time low. ""As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending..."" said Lavrov. ""The process has begun,"" he said, adding that Western countries should ""just behave carefully"". Funerals continue to be held for those who have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. They include victims of the Kremenchuk shopping centre which was hit by Russian rockets on Monday. Relatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony for Andriy Krasyuk who was killed in the Russian rocket attack on the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk on Monday A woman mourns in front of flowers left in memory of civilian victims killed at the shopping mall Natalia, the wife of Ukrainian serviceman Volodymyr Kochetov, 46, who was killed in a fight during Russia's invasion, cries by his coffin during his funeral in the village of Babyntsi, Ukraine A soldier holds a red carnation as he attends the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier at the St Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv We've been reporting on the situation in Lysychansk, a city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, the region's governor, warned residents in Lysychansk to stay in shelters because ""it is no longer possible to evacuate"". Haidai said Russian troops were on the outskirts of the city and were firing from several directions. Earlier, Haidai said the city has beensuffering ""endless air strikes""and the Russians were using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture Lysychansk. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said Russia has been successful in seizing some of the territory in Lysychansk's oil refinery, but that Ukrainian forces had beaten back an attack on a gelatin plant in the city. Lysychansk stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. It's the last major city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region The United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Ukraine says there is ""blatant ignoring"" of international humanitarian and human rights law in parts of the country no longer under Ukrainian government control. Osnat Lubrani says aid organisations were unable to deliver relief supplies, or get access, to Kherson or Mariupol, and had been unable to get agreement on safe passage to evacuate people to leave Severodonetsk. Russian forces are now in control of both Mariupol and Severodonetsk. ""We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart by this war,"" Lubrani says at a news conference in Kyiv. ""But the Russian Federation, also the Ukrainian government, have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible."" More now on Nato's new strategy towards China. Earlier on, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the new approach reflects Russia and China's use of ""economic leverage, coercion, and hybrid approaches to advance their interests in the region"". But Beijing has called Nato's new strategy irresponsible . China's foreign minister, Zhao Lijian, said ""Nato's so-called new strategy concept document disregards the facts"". Lijian said that the new strategy ""wrongly defines China as posing a strategic challenge and smears China's foreign policy"". He added that it is ""irresponsible, encourages conflict, and is full of Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice"". Earlier this week China criticised the West for arming Ukraine. This video can not be played Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg speaks with the BBC's Frank Gardner While Nato's focus has been on the situation in Ukraine, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also spoken about China. For the first time the defence alliance has decided to talk about what it's been calling ""the challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests and values."" It comes as China's military presence has been growing on the world stage. The country recently launched it's third and most modern aircraft carrier joining a very small group of nations that are capable of fielding these kinds of ships. Taiwan, an island in the East China Sea is seen by China as an integral part of its territory. In recent years Beijing officials have threatened military action if any attempts are made for independence. While emphasizing that Taiwan is not a Nato member, the Nato head admitted that what happens to the island does ""matter to Nato allies"". Stoltenberg made the comments during an interview with the BBC's Frank Gardner where Stoltenberg also discussed China and Russia's development of hypersonic missiles. Both countries have led the way in the development of the weapons that are capable of travelling towards their target at more than five times the speed of sound on a unpredictable flight path. Ukraine says it's introducing a trade embargo against Syria and sanctions targeting Syrian legal entities and individuals. It's in response to Syria's decision to recognise the two Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas region, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has announced. On its website it says it ""strongly condemns"" the decision of the Syrian Arab Republic to recognise ""the so-called independence"" of the ""temporarily occupied territories"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. It called the move an ""unfriendly act"" towards Ukraine and a violation of the principles of international law. On Wednesday, Syria's Foreign Ministry announced that the country - an ally of Russia - had recognised the ""independence and sovereignty of the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky severed diplomatic ties with Syria following the announcement. Chris PartridgeBBC News New satellite imagery taken today shows the aftermath of Ukraineâs attack on Snake Island, which many believe forced Russian troops to leave. Pictures from Maxar Technologies were taken this morning, showing whatâs left of burned vehicles and structures across the north end of the island. Artillery strikes and air attacks delivered the blows to Russian forces, something that has been happening frequently to stop Moscow gaining a permanent foothold. We know at least one Russian Pantsir SA-22 air defence unit with medium-range capability was stationed on the island. Itâs not clear whether it was destroyed in this latest attack, or in any of the strikes before. In this second image, a colour infrared view, the black/grey areas present those which were recently burned. Non-burned vegetation shows up red/pink. More details will likely emerge of what was destroyed, but Ukraine is clear it was enough to drive out Russian forces. âNot withstanding the fire of our artillery, missile strikes and aviation, Russian occupants left Snake Island,â said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Main Operations Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow says it left as a âgoodwill gesture.â You can read more about Snake Islandhere Mykolaiv came under heavy shelling on Wednesday Turning to the conflict on the ground now, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv yesterday has risen to six, the local emergency services say. Another six people were injured and rescuers are continue to search for bodies at the five-storey residential building which came under attack and was destroyed, they added. The six victims are among 10 civilians reported to have been killed in Russian shelling across yesterday and today. Two were killed in shelling of the Donetsk region, and another person died in an attack on the Izyum district of the Kharkiv region, according to posts from the regional governors on messaging service Telegram. And Russian missiles, mortars and artillery hitting the northern Sumy Region left one person dead, the governor there says. We have more now on that diplomatic telling-off Russia has given to the UK ambassador in Moscow over comments made by UK PM Boris Johnson. Earlier this week Johnson said Vladimir Putin would not have started the war in Ukraine if he was a woman and described the operation as a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"". Putin has dismissed Johnson's comments as ""incorrect"". In a statement the Russian foreign ministry said that ""in polite society it is customary to apologise for remarks of this kind"", adding that it was ""unacceptable insulting rhetoric"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also accused the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman of ""every week, threatening to nuke everyone or doing something or another"". The Russian foreign ministry underlined it was ""unacceptable"" for British officials ""to share deliberately false information, especially on alleged threats by Russians 'resorting to nuclear arms'"". Russia has summoned the British ambassador in Moscow to protest against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""offensive"" remarks about President Vladimir Putin, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. Deborah Bronnert was told that Russia ""firmly"" opposed the ""openly offensive comments by the British authorities towards Russia, its leader, its officials as well as the Russian people"", the AFP news agency reported the ministry as saying. Reuters reported that the ""offensive"" statements included those about alleged Russian threats to use nuclear weapons. Ukraine has welcomed the release of 144 soldiers in the biggest prisoner swap seen yet in this war. The exchange includes 95 soldiers who defended Mariupol's steelworkers, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds, blast traumas, burns, fractured bones and amputated limbs, the agency known by the acronym GUR said in a statement on Telegram. There was no comment from Russia about a prisoner swap. But the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine said it had secured the release of 144 soldiers, including its fighters and those of the Russian army. It is the biggest prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia so far The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said Ambulances gathered at the site to treat the injured soldiers Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter The Snake Island defenders were depicted in a set of Ukrainian stamps As Russia's troops withdraw from Snake Island, remember the Ukrainian
border guard who went viral when it was first attacked? His name was Roman and he became famous around the world for defiantly swearing at
a Russian warship which had threatened to bomb him and his fellow border guards
on the Black Sea island if they didnât surrender. A recording of the exchange was shared widely on social media in the
early days of the war - and the Ukrainian government declared that Roman and
his comrades had died as national heroes. Romanâs mother Tetyana thought that he had died - but it turned out he
was still alive. I interviewed her forBBC Radio 4âs War on Truth podcast, where she
told me about what it was like being at the heart of the information
war over Ukraine. Her story
tells us a lot about how propaganda battles play out alongside military
action. In
the fog of war, it can be hard to tell what is a concerted effort to mislead -
war strategy and propaganda - and what is just down to confusion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has met Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin on consecutive days, says his country would like the war to end soon. Speaking at a news conference with Putin in Moscow following their meeting, Widodo said: ""Although the external situation is still difficult, it is still important to move towards a settlement and open dialogue. ""I call on all world leaders to revive the spirit of co-operation,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the talks had been productive, adding: ""I am convinced that the agreements reached today will further strengthen the Russian-Indonesian partnership."" But the Russian leader took the opportunity to blame the West for any potential global food crisis. ""We have repeatedly stressed that the imbalance of food markets is a direct consequence of many years of irresponsible economic policies of a number of countries, uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts, and the situation has worsened since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""However, Western countries, not wanting to admit the fallacy of their economic course, are further destabilising global agricultural production by imposing restrictions on the supply of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers,"" he said, repeating his claim that sanctions are preventing agricultural exports from leaving the region, rather than Russia's invasion and its blockade of Black Sea ports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo says he has delivered a message from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Widodo met the Ukrainian president on a visit to Kyiv yesterday and has been in Moscow today for a meeting with Putin. ""I conveyed President Zelensky's message to President Putin,"" Widodo said after the Moscow talks. He did not reveal what the message said but added he's expressed his ""readiness"" to help start communication between the two leaders. Widodo said Indonesia will continue to co-operate with Russia, and in turn Putin told reporters that Russia is ready to fulfil Indonesia's need for fertilisers - the supply of which has been affected by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The Indonesian leader is the current president of the G20 group of nations and a member of a United Nations crisis group set up to address the threat of global hunger resulting from the war. Widodo has invited Zelensky to the November G20 summit in Bali. AFP reports the Ukrainian president told Widodo his attendance would depend on who else was there - Russia is a member of the G20 and as such Putin would be expected to attend. Joko Widodo met Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday... Aiden Aslin (left) and Shaun Pinner (centre) were sentenced alongside Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun Russia has been told to prevent the execution of two Britons who were capturedwhile fighting for Ukraine, by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were sentenced by a Russian proxy  court -which is not internationally recognised - in eastern Ukraine earlier this month. In an emergency ruling, the ECHR said Russia must ensure the death penalty is not carried out, but Russia has dismissed the call for the men to be spared. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""You know that Russia no longer complies with the requirements of the ECHR,"" in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier this month, the family ofMr Aslin said he had been told that the execution would be carried out.

"Stepdad given life sentence for murdering boy, 5","Logan Mwangi was a previously ""smiling, cheerful little boy"", the court heard A mother, stepfather and a teenager have been given life sentences for murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi and dumping his body in a river. John Cole, 40, will serve a minimum term of 29 years in prison while Logan's mother, Angharad Williamson, 31, will serve at least 28 years. Craig Mulligan, 14, will serve at least 15 years.All three were convicted of murdering Loganin July 2021. His body was found in the River Ogmore, near his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. Mrs Justice Jefford told Cardiff Crown Court that the attack on the ""defenceless"" schoolboy, who weighed 3st 1lb (20kg), was ""nothing short of horrifying"". Mulligan -who can now be publicly named for the first timeafter a judge lifted ananonymity order,external- is not the biological son of Cole but he raised him from the age of nine months and considered himself a father figure. WatchLogan Mwangi: A Boy Betrayedon iPlayer. Juror's nightmares after child murder trial Why Logan Mwangi's teenage killer can now be named How CCTV helped police catch Logan's killers Rejecting Williamson's version of events that Cole and Mulligan attacked Logan two days before his body was found and that she had run out of the house in an attempt to get help, Mrs Justice Jefford said: ""That was made up after the event to protect yourself and shift the blame. ""You had an opportunity to protect your son from further injury and you did nothing. ""Whatever time the ferocious assault on Logan happened, he was for the most part of Friday injured or dying."" Angharad Williamson, 31, Craig Mulligan, 14, and John Cole, 40, have been sentenced for Logan's murder Police officers found Logan partially submerged in the river in Pandy Park, just 250m from his home. He was wearing his dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top. His body was dumped like ""fly-tipped rubbish"", the prosecution said. During the trial, jurors had heard howLogan was treated like a prisoner in the days before his death. On 20 July, Logan tested positive for Covid-19 and he was shut in his bedroom for 10 days with a baby gate stopping him from leaving. Mrs Justice Jefford described this decision by the couple as ""extreme"" and said the treatment of him was ""the culmination of treatment that had dehumanised him"". Logan's stammer is said to have worsened, becoming particularly bad around Cole, the jury was told, and he wet himself more frequently and began self-harming. This video can not be played How Logan Mwangi's killers tried to fool police The jury were played extensive CCTV footage from nearby houses which showed Cole and Mulligan at 02:43 BST on 31 July moving Logan's body in a sports bag to the nearby river, where they dumped it. They were caught again as they came back to the house to pick up the dinosaur pyjama top Logan had been wearing, which police found in a wooded area with a big cut in. Talking about the cover-up, Mrs Justice Jefford said what they did was ""careful and calculated and not the product of panic"". ""It is impossible to imagine the terror a five-year-old would feel suffering those horrific injuries inflicted upon him by those regarded as his family with the compliance of his mother."" The concealment of Logan's body in the river, was described as ""heartless"", ""calculated and orchestrated"". Logan Mwangi's dad asks why he had to die Boy, 5, 'treated like rubbish in life and death' The jury also heard Mulligan had a ""desire for violence"" andpushed Logan down the stairs, breaking his arm. A support worker once heard him singing: ""I love to punch kids in the head, it's orgasmic."" Mrs Justice Jefford told the trio they were ""all responsible for Logan's death and all the anguish that has flowed from it"". ""Because he was killed in his own home, it is not possible to be sure what has happened to him,"" she said. She described the injuries Logan suffered as ""the sort of injuries seen in abused children"". Logan's body was found 250m away from the home he shared with his family Logan, a previously ""smiling, cheerful little boy"", died after suffering a ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, leaving him with 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, including extensive bruising to the back of his head and tears in his liver and bowel. Friends of the couple said Cole told them he did not like Logan, and others said his attitude changed after becoming obsessed with the idea that Williamson had cheated on him with Logan's father Ben Mwangi. Ben Mwangi (centre) says he experiences recurring nightmares Ben Mwangi wept as his victim impact statement was read out to the court on his behalf. In it, he recalled collapsing and hitting his head when he was told of his son's death while at work. ""I just felt like every fibre in my body had died and I couldn't stop crying."" After finding out about Williamson's arrest, he said he felt ""devastated that I couldn't have been there to protect him"". Mr Mwangi said he could no longer sleep and experienced recurring nightmares. ""My dreams of Logan are so vivid, Logan comes to tell me that he is OK and to check if I'm OK. ""He runs into my arms and I hold him tight, but he then slowly disappears until he's no longer in my arms. I wake up screaming and crying. ""I find it difficult to go back to sleep, I don't want to go back to sleep because I don't want to experience these dreams because they are so painful."" The courtroom was full, including Logan's family, relatives of the three killers and members of the jury who sat through the trial. Williamson cried throughout and held her head down throughout the sentencing. Cole showed no emotion as he was sentenced, nor did Mulligan. Cole previously pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, while Williamson and Mulligan were found guilty of the same charge. Tondu Primary School set up a memorial garden and ""buddy bench"" in memory of Logan In a statement, Tondu Primary School said Logan was a ""loving, sweet-natured child who was polite and articulate at all times"". ""Logan was always smiling, and was described in court by his own teachers as having the kind of smile that could light up a classroom. ""He was a highly inquisitive child who enjoyed his lessons, particularly when using the outdoor classroom where he would have great fun with his friends. ""Logan loved playing with his classmates, especially games like hide-and-seek or pretending to be superheroes. His favourite character was always Spider-Man and he would display a keen and vivid imagination in his games. ""Ultimately, we remember Logan as being a bright, happy child who was caring and loving, and an absolute pleasure to teach.""

"Inquiry begins into Captain Tom FoundationThe charity watchdog says it is concerned about the foundation's independence from a business connected to the family,Beds, Herts & Bucks","Captain Sir Tom Moore became famous for his fundraising efforts during the first coronavirus lockdown An inquiry has been launched into a foundation set up in honour of Capt Sir Tom Moore amid concerns his family may have profited from using his name. The Charity Commission said it was concerned about the The Captain Tom Foundation's independence from a business run by his family. The veteran, who died last year aged 100, raised millions for the NHS but this money is not part of the inquiry. The foundation said it would ""work closely"" with the inquiry. Capt Sir Tom, who was born in Keighley in West Yorkshire, gained international fame when he carried out the fundraising walk at his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, when Covid restrictions were first introduced in 2020. The Â£33m raised (Â£38.9m including gift aid) was managed and distributed by NHS Charities Together before the JustGiving account was closed down. Capt Sir Tom won the nation's hearts with his fundraising walk which took in 100 laps of his garden After he became a well-known figure, his family set up The Captain Tom Foundation, which aims to support and ""empower"" older people through fundraising and awareness campaigns. Shortly before the formation of the foundation his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin, set up a private company called Club Nook Ltd. Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said the watchdog's ""concerns have mounted"" over the charity. ""We consider it in the public interest to examine them through a formal investigation, which gives us access to the full range of our protective and enforcement powers,"" she said. The commission became concerned about arrangements between the charity and Club Nook Ltd, as well as the trustees' decision-making and how the foundation was governed. The issues revolve around a ""failure to consider intellectual property and trademark issues"", including the trademarking of variations of the name ""Captain Tom"" by the company controlled by Ms Ingram-Moore and Mr Ingram-Moore, without objection from the charity. This could have generated ""significant profit"" for the company, the commission added. The Charity Commission said it had concerns over links to a company part-controlled by Sir Capt Tom's daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore Earlier this year, the Commissionreviewed payment of consultancy fees to third partiesbut said it was later ""satisfied"" that these specific payments were a reasonable reimbursement for expenses incurred by the companies in the formation of the charity. It added it was also satisfied that the payments were ""adequately identified and managed"". Stephen Jones, chairman of the board of trustees of The Captain Tom Foundation, said: ""We will of course work closely with the commission in its inquiry."" He said the commission was aware of where the image and intellectual property rights were held when the charity was set up. Jack Gilbert, who became chief executive of the foundation at the beginning of the month, said he would ""ensure that in all respects, including governance and finance, the foundation conforms to best practice"". In March 2022, the publication of the first annual accounts of the foundation showed it had incurred Â£240,000 in costs and given Â£160,000 to good causes. A statement from the Ingram-Moore family said that Club Nook, controlled by Ms Ingram-Moore and Mr Ingram-Moore, ""made its application for various trademarks in April 2020 prior to the formation of The Captain Tom Foundation"", which was in May 2020. ""Neither Hannah nor Colin Ingram-Moore were trustee directors of The Captain Tom Foundation upon its formation,"" the statement added.

Here are today's closing headlines:  The writers of today's live page were: Dulcie Lee, James Clarke, Catherine Evans, Malu Cursino, Nadeem Shad and Doug Faulkner. The editors were Holly Wallis, Jeremy Gahagan, Heather Sharp and Rob Corp Since Turkey dropped its veto over Sweden and Finland joining Nato, there have been some concerns over its reasons for doing so. On Wednesday, Ankara said it would seekthe extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspectsfrom Sweden and Finland. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Ankara wanted 12 suspects from Finland and another 21 from Sweden. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"". Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. But on Thursday, Sweden's Justice Minister Morgan Johansson insisted that any decisions regarding extradition of Kurds would be made by ""independent courts"". ""Swedish citizens are not extradited,"" said Johansson. ""Non-Swedish citizens can be extradited at the request of other countries, but only if it is compatible with Swedish law and the European Convention."" A mainstay of Putin's inner circle, Sergei Lavrov, has been drawing some historic parallels during a press conference. The Russian foreign minister said that a new ""iron curtain"" was being put in place between the West and Russia. The term was used during the Cold War to refer to the division between Western countries and those with links to the Soviet Union, as relations between the two sides ebbed to an all time low. ""As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending..."" said Lavrov. ""The process has begun,"" he said, adding that Western countries should ""just behave carefully"". Funerals continue to be held for those who have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. They include victims of the Kremenchuk shopping centre which was hit by Russian rockets on Monday. Relatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony for Andriy Krasyuk who was killed in the Russian rocket attack on the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk on Monday A woman mourns in front of flowers left in memory of civilian victims killed at the shopping mall Natalia, the wife of Ukrainian serviceman Volodymyr Kochetov, 46, who was killed in a fight during Russia's invasion, cries by his coffin during his funeral in the village of Babyntsi, Ukraine A soldier holds a red carnation as he attends the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier at the St Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv We've been reporting on the situation in Lysychansk, a city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, the region's governor, warned residents in Lysychansk to stay in shelters because ""it is no longer possible to evacuate"". Haidai said Russian troops were on the outskirts of the city and were firing from several directions. Earlier, Haidai said the city has beensuffering ""endless air strikes""and the Russians were using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture Lysychansk. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said Russia has been successful in seizing some of the territory in Lysychansk's oil refinery, but that Ukrainian forces had beaten back an attack on a gelatin plant in the city. Lysychansk stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. It's the last major city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region The United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Ukraine says there is ""blatant ignoring"" of international humanitarian and human rights law in parts of the country no longer under Ukrainian government control. Osnat Lubrani says aid organisations were unable to deliver relief supplies, or get access, to Kherson or Mariupol, and had been unable to get agreement on safe passage to evacuate people to leave Severodonetsk. Russian forces are now in control of both Mariupol and Severodonetsk. ""We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart by this war,"" Lubrani says at a news conference in Kyiv. ""But the Russian Federation, also the Ukrainian government, have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible."" More now on Nato's new strategy towards China. Earlier on, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the new approach reflects Russia and China's use of ""economic leverage, coercion, and hybrid approaches to advance their interests in the region"". But Beijing has called Nato's new strategy irresponsible . China's foreign minister, Zhao Lijian, said ""Nato's so-called new strategy concept document disregards the facts"". Lijian said that the new strategy ""wrongly defines China as posing a strategic challenge and smears China's foreign policy"". He added that it is ""irresponsible, encourages conflict, and is full of Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice"". Earlier this week China criticised the West for arming Ukraine. This video can not be played Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg speaks with the BBC's Frank Gardner While Nato's focus has been on the situation in Ukraine, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also spoken about China. For the first time the defence alliance has decided to talk about what it's been calling ""the challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests and values."" It comes as China's military presence has been growing on the world stage. The country recently launched it's third and most modern aircraft carrier joining a very small group of nations that are capable of fielding these kinds of ships. Taiwan, an island in the East China Sea is seen by China as an integral part of its territory. In recent years Beijing officials have threatened military action if any attempts are made for independence. While emphasizing that Taiwan is not a Nato member, the Nato head admitted that what happens to the island does ""matter to Nato allies"". Stoltenberg made the comments during an interview with the BBC's Frank Gardner where Stoltenberg also discussed China and Russia's development of hypersonic missiles. Both countries have led the way in the development of the weapons that are capable of travelling towards their target at more than five times the speed of sound on a unpredictable flight path. Ukraine says it's introducing a trade embargo against Syria and sanctions targeting Syrian legal entities and individuals. It's in response to Syria's decision to recognise the two Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas region, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has announced. On its website it says it ""strongly condemns"" the decision of the Syrian Arab Republic to recognise ""the so-called independence"" of the ""temporarily occupied territories"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. It called the move an ""unfriendly act"" towards Ukraine and a violation of the principles of international law. On Wednesday, Syria's Foreign Ministry announced that the country - an ally of Russia - had recognised the ""independence and sovereignty of the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky severed diplomatic ties with Syria following the announcement. Chris PartridgeBBC News New satellite imagery taken today shows the aftermath of Ukraineâs attack on Snake Island, which many believe forced Russian troops to leave. Pictures from Maxar Technologies were taken this morning, showing whatâs left of burned vehicles and structures across the north end of the island. Artillery strikes and air attacks delivered the blows to Russian forces, something that has been happening frequently to stop Moscow gaining a permanent foothold. We know at least one Russian Pantsir SA-22 air defence unit with medium-range capability was stationed on the island. Itâs not clear whether it was destroyed in this latest attack, or in any of the strikes before. In this second image, a colour infrared view, the black/grey areas present those which were recently burned. Non-burned vegetation shows up red/pink. More details will likely emerge of what was destroyed, but Ukraine is clear it was enough to drive out Russian forces. âNot withstanding the fire of our artillery, missile strikes and aviation, Russian occupants left Snake Island,â said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Main Operations Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow says it left as a âgoodwill gesture.â You can read more about Snake Islandhere Mykolaiv came under heavy shelling on Wednesday Turning to the conflict on the ground now, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv yesterday has risen to six, the local emergency services say. Another six people were injured and rescuers are continue to search for bodies at the five-storey residential building which came under attack and was destroyed, they added. The six victims are among 10 civilians reported to have been killed in Russian shelling across yesterday and today. Two were killed in shelling of the Donetsk region, and another person died in an attack on the Izyum district of the Kharkiv region, according to posts from the regional governors on messaging service Telegram. And Russian missiles, mortars and artillery hitting the northern Sumy Region left one person dead, the governor there says. We have more now on that diplomatic telling-off Russia has given to the UK ambassador in Moscow over comments made by UK PM Boris Johnson. Earlier this week Johnson said Vladimir Putin would not have started the war in Ukraine if he was a woman and described the operation as a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"". Putin has dismissed Johnson's comments as ""incorrect"". In a statement the Russian foreign ministry said that ""in polite society it is customary to apologise for remarks of this kind"", adding that it was ""unacceptable insulting rhetoric"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also accused the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman of ""every week, threatening to nuke everyone or doing something or another"". The Russian foreign ministry underlined it was ""unacceptable"" for British officials ""to share deliberately false information, especially on alleged threats by Russians 'resorting to nuclear arms'"". Russia has summoned the British ambassador in Moscow to protest against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""offensive"" remarks about President Vladimir Putin, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. Deborah Bronnert was told that Russia ""firmly"" opposed the ""openly offensive comments by the British authorities towards Russia, its leader, its officials as well as the Russian people"", the AFP news agency reported the ministry as saying. Reuters reported that the ""offensive"" statements included those about alleged Russian threats to use nuclear weapons. Ukraine has welcomed the release of 144 soldiers in the biggest prisoner swap seen yet in this war. The exchange includes 95 soldiers who defended Mariupol's steelworkers, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds, blast traumas, burns, fractured bones and amputated limbs, the agency known by the acronym GUR said in a statement on Telegram. There was no comment from Russia about a prisoner swap. But the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine said it had secured the release of 144 soldiers, including its fighters and those of the Russian army. It is the biggest prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia so far The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said Ambulances gathered at the site to treat the injured soldiers Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter The Snake Island defenders were depicted in a set of Ukrainian stamps As Russia's troops withdraw from Snake Island, remember the Ukrainian
border guard who went viral when it was first attacked? His name was Roman and he became famous around the world for defiantly swearing at
a Russian warship which had threatened to bomb him and his fellow border guards
on the Black Sea island if they didnât surrender. A recording of the exchange was shared widely on social media in the
early days of the war - and the Ukrainian government declared that Roman and
his comrades had died as national heroes. Romanâs mother Tetyana thought that he had died - but it turned out he
was still alive. I interviewed her forBBC Radio 4âs War on Truth podcast, where she
told me about what it was like being at the heart of the information
war over Ukraine. Her story
tells us a lot about how propaganda battles play out alongside military
action. In
the fog of war, it can be hard to tell what is a concerted effort to mislead -
war strategy and propaganda - and what is just down to confusion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has met Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin on consecutive days, says his country would like the war to end soon. Speaking at a news conference with Putin in Moscow following their meeting, Widodo said: ""Although the external situation is still difficult, it is still important to move towards a settlement and open dialogue. ""I call on all world leaders to revive the spirit of co-operation,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the talks had been productive, adding: ""I am convinced that the agreements reached today will further strengthen the Russian-Indonesian partnership."" But the Russian leader took the opportunity to blame the West for any potential global food crisis. ""We have repeatedly stressed that the imbalance of food markets is a direct consequence of many years of irresponsible economic policies of a number of countries, uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts, and the situation has worsened since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""However, Western countries, not wanting to admit the fallacy of their economic course, are further destabilising global agricultural production by imposing restrictions on the supply of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers,"" he said, repeating his claim that sanctions are preventing agricultural exports from leaving the region, rather than Russia's invasion and its blockade of Black Sea ports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo says he has delivered a message from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Widodo met the Ukrainian president on a visit to Kyiv yesterday and has been in Moscow today for a meeting with Putin. ""I conveyed President Zelensky's message to President Putin,"" Widodo said after the Moscow talks. He did not reveal what the message said but added he's expressed his ""readiness"" to help start communication between the two leaders. Widodo said Indonesia will continue to co-operate with Russia, and in turn Putin told reporters that Russia is ready to fulfil Indonesia's need for fertilisers - the supply of which has been affected by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The Indonesian leader is the current president of the G20 group of nations and a member of a United Nations crisis group set up to address the threat of global hunger resulting from the war. Widodo has invited Zelensky to the November G20 summit in Bali. AFP reports the Ukrainian president told Widodo his attendance would depend on who else was there - Russia is a member of the G20 and as such Putin would be expected to attend. Joko Widodo met Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday... Aiden Aslin (left) and Shaun Pinner (centre) were sentenced alongside Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun Russia has been told to prevent the execution of two Britons who were capturedwhile fighting for Ukraine, by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were sentenced by a Russian proxy  court -which is not internationally recognised - in eastern Ukraine earlier this month. In an emergency ruling, the ECHR said Russia must ensure the death penalty is not carried out, but Russia has dismissed the call for the men to be spared. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""You know that Russia no longer complies with the requirements of the ECHR,"" in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier this month, the family ofMr Aslin said he had been told that the execution would be carried out. Chris MasonPolitical editor, reporting from Madrid After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending
in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in UK Prime
Minister Boris Johnson's opening address at his news conference here at the Nato summit in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to
embark, these decisions, is that we'll reach 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the
decade,"" he announced. This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members
and I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for
defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the
next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number
can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision
points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least
some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't always match. Lysychansk residents are trying to leave the city for safety by train The city of Lysychansk ""suffers from endless air strikes"", according to the governor of Luhansk region,  Serhiy Haidai. He says in a post on Telegram the Russians are using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture the city, which is in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region. It stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. Haidai says ""there is a lot of destruction"" in Lysychansk, the police department has been destroyed and the city's oil refinery damaged. ""It is difficult to find a safe place in the city,"" Haidai says. ""People dream of at least half an hour of silence, but the occupiers do not stop firing from all available weapons."" He says it is difficult to get to and from the city, with roads to Lysychansk ""littered with shell fragments"", and the Russians trying to take control of the highway linking the city with Bakhmut, about 50km away. Many residents who want to leave the city are aiming to do so by train. He says despite this, there are attempts to bring food into the city but adds residents can only access water when it is delivered by the emergency services. Â© 2025 BBC.

Firms warn time is running out to save UK economy,"Businesses are being hit by higher energy and fuel costs The boss of a business lobby group has told the government to get its ""house in order"" to ""save the economy"" as firms struggle with higher prices. Shevaun Haviland, director-general of the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC), told a conference that time is running out to help the economy grow. It comes after Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey said soaring inflation could hit the UK harder than elsewhere. The government said it was supporting firms to ""navigate the months ahead"". Ms Haviland told audience members at the BCC's global annual conference that the government has ""until the Autumn budget to reset, rethink and get their house in order"". Rising material costs, supply chain issues and worker shortages are creating a ""perfect storm"", she said. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had ""cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses"" by increasing the employment allowance and cutting fuel duty. The Treasury said it was supporting British businesses through measures such as bringing in 50% business rates relief for eligible High Street businesses, and freezing an amount it uses to calculate rates which will be ""worth Â£4.6m over the next five years"" for firms. Fears for UK economy grow as higher prices bite Rising prices see basic pay fall fastest since 2011 Landlady gives up pub as energy bills near Â£30,000 Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years with UK inflation at 9.1% in May. Figures released on Thursday,externalshowed that household finances failed to keep up with inflation in the first three months of the year, marking the first time real disposable income has fallen for four quarters in a row since records began. Businesses are also being hit by higher prices, with fuel and energy prices at unprecedented levels. On Wednesday, the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, warned that soaring inflation would hit the UK harder than any other major economy during the current energy crisis. He said the UK's economy would be likely to weaken earlier and the effects would be more intense than for other countries as a result of the energy price shock and labour shortages. Mr Bailey did not rule out the possibility of interest rates rising by half a percentage point in future to try to curb inflation. Rates are already at their highest for 13 years, at 1.25%. ""There will be circumstances in which we will have to do more [on rates],"" he said. ""We're not there yet in terms of the next meeting. We're still a month away, but that's on the table."" Businesses are having to deal with pressures including higher energy costs The BCC's Ms Haviland said that higher costs for raw materials over last summer, supply chain and shipping issues, problems in recruiting people, and future energy price rises were ""firmly putting the brakes on"" the country's economic recovery from the pandemic. The energy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can raise the cost of household bills, went up to an unprecedented Â£1,971 in April for the typical household. This was a rise of about Â£700, and the cap is expected to rise by a further Â£800 a year in October. But unlike households, the energy price cap does not apply to firms, which the BCC says means they cannot predict what bills will be from one month to the next. Official figures released on Thursday showed that in the first three months of the year the UK's current account deficit - the gap between the value of goods and services imported compared with exports - hit the largest shortfall since records began in 1955. The deficit was Â£51.7bn in the January-to-March period, equivalent to 8.3% of GDP, although the Office for National Statistics advised ""caution"" over the figures as they were ""subject to higher levels of uncertainty than normal"" because of changes in the way the data is collected. Ms Haviland spoke to Chancellor Rishi Sunak at the BCC conference, saying firms were also facing ""a lot of challenges"" in exporting to the EU following Brexit. Mr Sunak said: ""Of course, there has been a change in our trading relationship [with the EU], that was always going to be the case, and you'll know that the government is looking at how we can ease some of those burdens further, particularly on the Northern Ireland side."" On Monday, MPs gave their initial approval to new legislation to give ministers the power to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. The EU opposes the move, saying it breaches international law. Mr Sunak added that the government had plans to ""make sure our customs procedures in this country are globally best in class"". More rail strikes extremely likely, says union boss BA Heathrow staff back summer strikes over pay Fears over the prospects for the UK economy have grown after latest figures showed it shrank in April. It has led to some analysts warning the UK risks falling into a recession,which is defined as the economy shrinking for two consecutive three-month periods. The cost of living has pushed unions to demand pay rises, leading to some workers going out on strike in recent weeks, with more walkouts planned over the summer. RMT Union members walked out last week in what was said to be the largest industrial action since 1989, with services across the country cancelled. More rail workers are set to walk out along with Royal Mail staff in July. British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have also voted to go on strike over pay. Ms Haviland said that a solution to strikes would come from ""cooperation not confrontation, because the consequences of ongoing strikes will have a major impact on everyone"".

Inquiry begins into Captain Tom Foundation charity,"Captain Sir Tom Moore became famous for his fundraising efforts during the first coronavirus lockdown An inquiry has been launched into a foundation set up in honour of Capt Sir Tom Moore amid concerns his family may have profited from using his name. The Charity Commission said it was concerned about the The Captain Tom Foundation's independence from a business run by his family. The veteran, who died last year aged 100, raised millions for the NHS but this money is not part of the inquiry. The foundation said it would ""work closely"" with the inquiry. Capt Sir Tom, who was born in Keighley in West Yorkshire, gained international fame when he carried out the fundraising walk at his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, when Covid restrictions were first introduced in 2020.

Stephen Jones, chairman of the board of trustees of The Captain Tom Foundation, said: ""We will of course work closely with the commission in its inquiry."" He said the commission was aware of where the image and intellectual property rights were held when the charity was set up. Jack Gilbert, who became chief executive of the foundation at the beginning of the month, said he would ""ensure that in all respects, including governance and finance, the foundation conforms to best practice"". In March 2022, the publication of the first annual accounts of the foundation showed it had incurred Â£240,000 in costs and given Â£160,000 to good causes. A statement from the Ingram-Moore family said that Club Nook, controlled by Ms Ingram-Moore and Mr Ingram-Moore, ""made its application for various trademarks in April 2020 prior to the formation of The Captain Tom Foundation"", which was in May 2020. ""Neither Hannah nor Colin Ingram-Moore were trustee directors of The Captain Tom Foundation upon its formation,"" the statement added.

"Up to 21,000 people hit by ghost broking scam","Ghost broking. It's a term you may not have heard before, but it's thought up to 21,000 people in the UK have fallen victim to this car insurance scam. People should ""safeguard their personal finances against fraud"" amidst the cost of living crisis, warns The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB). It comes after an investigation by Which? found a scam has given motorists fraudulent cover. Last year, 517 reports were made by victims,according to Action Fraud,external. ""Young and vulnerable people are constantly being targeted online with fake car insurance deals,"" says Ben Fletcher, director at the IFB. The IFB says insurers last yearcollectively reported,externalmore than 21,000 policies that could be connected to the scam. ""The cost of living crisis means it's never been more important for people to safeguard their personal finances against fraud,"" he added. More people looking for cheaper deals can ""be an additive"" to the scam, according to cyber security expert and former crime officer Jake Moore. Ghost brokers can be individuals or groups that are unlicensed, who pose as middlemen for insurance companies and claim to be able to find cheap car insurance prices for those struggling to get affordable cover. They have various ways of operating - including selling bogus paperwork to victims, and they'll often sell a policy that will appear against the vehicle on the Motor Insurance Database. ""They might advertise on student websites or through WhatsApp and social media,"" Jake says. The problem, according to Jake, is they will go and cancel it without you knowing a couple of weeks later, so they'll get the money back. Then you'll be without insurance, leaving you potentially liable for fraud and at risk of penalties for driving uninsured. Fraudsters target under-35s on WhatsApp 'I wish I hadn't given Â£300k to a man I met online' Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen' In 2021, ghost broking victims who contacted Action Fraud reported losses of Â£1,950 each, on average. So what can you do to avoid falling victim to this scam? Here are Jake's tips. ""People need to be very wary of brokers using just their mobile phone, or WhatsApp or just their email as a way of contact,"" he says. ""And you need to really stick to the authentic roots of car insurance. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is."" ""For peace of mind, you can actually go and check out on the Financial Conduct authority's website for a list of authorised brokers."" If they aren't authorised - stay away. After using a broker, get in touch with the company they've given you to ""double check your car is insured"". ""If you aren't insured, then you're going to be losing a lot more money than the savings you've had from using that broker."" When you come across a really good deal on a shopping trip, you might share it with your friends and family. Do the same for car insurance deals. ""It goes back to erring on the side of caution. Why is something less than what you'd expect it to be? Is there a reason?"" ""Usually someone else points out that it could be a scam, and they might be the first one to go and search online and realise it may be part of a con,"" Jake adds. People don't like reporting things on social media ""because they think it's not going anywhere"", Jake says. ""But if lots of people get together and do report it, then it will be seen by a human pair of eyes. And they will do what they can to block those accounts."" This video can not be played Reporter Dan Whitworth was phoned by a fraudster and managed to record the call Jake says scammers ""are very good at tailoring their craft"" and looking for ways to con people. ""The government really struggle with the sophistication behind these new emerging scams, they're, they're often one step or even two steps behind."" Jake has investigated these crimes for cyber police and says ""it's getting more difficult every day."" ""It comes back to that education, making people aware this actually happens. So just by talking about it, it makes those people better protected."" Have you been a victim of a scam? You can get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Third of Scots cut back spending on essentials,"A third of Scots are cutting back spending on food and other essentials due to the cost of living crisis, according to a new report. The Fraser of Allander Institute is also warning that Scotland's recovery from the pandemic is starting to falter. It says rising prices are taking a toll on both companies and consumers. The think tank says it now expects growth of 0.5% next year, instead of the 1.5% it previously forecast. In its latest quarterly economic commentary report, the institute said consumers were starting to modify their spending behaviour in response to the ongoing crisis. More than half reported spending less on non-essential items. A third said they were spending less on essential items such as food and fuel, while the cost of properties is seeing a significant increase. It mirrors the findings in a report by the Office for National Statistics which also found half of adults it surveyed saidthey had bought less food in the last fortnight due to higher prices. Asda and Tesco have also reported customers cutting back, whilePoundland says it has seen a rising number of shoppersas people seek savings. People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise Rent hike forces parents-to-be out of home Why are prices rising so quickly? Analysis by the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute suggests the impact of the cost of living crisis is being experienced in different ways by different demographics, highlighting that consumers of a younger age may feel the increase in property prices and that public transport costs are hitting harder. Older age groups, it said, are more likely to acknowledge a price rise in food and fuel. Institute director Prof Mairi Spowage said the data showed the recovery from the pandemic was starting to falter. ""The analysis we have carried out for this quarter's commentary indicates that inflation will be higher and persist for longer than we thought in March,"" she said. ""This has the potential to limit the economic recovery we hope to see during 2022 and 2023, as consumers cut back on discretionary spending and businesses limit production due to input costs."" She said this had led them to revise down their expectations for growth during 2023. ""Of course economic forecasting is a tricky business at the best of times, but forecasts are highly uncertain right now,"" she added. Angela Mitchell, senior partner at Deloitte, which sponsors the institute's economic commentary, added: ""While Scotland's economic recovery was well under way in the first quarter of 2022, challenges for businesses are likely to remain throughout this year as a result of the cost of living pressures driven by both rising inflation and interest rates. ""In this context, the risks posed to future economic growth are in plain sight. Weaker demand, higher costs and, in particular, uncertainty inhibit the likelihood of investment and growth. ""For business leaders, focus must turn to ways to foster productivity which are not solely dependent on the ups and downs of the economic cycle but can be driven by other factors, including prioritising technology, innovation and digital transformation. ""Organisations should consider the changing nature of work and draw on their experiences developed during the pandemic to bolster resilience and ensure a path through the current economic climate."" As prices rise, the tightening of belts by households and business is already leading to a 0.5% fall in output for April, according to Scottish government estimates. That economic weakness looks likely to continue through much of this year, says the Fraser of Allander Institute. Expect the second and third quarters to be weak, and the fourth looks like contraction. While the rate of price increase is expected to subside, albeit with prices remaining at a high level, next year is looking very tough going as well. Growth of only 0.5% next year implies a high chance of recession - and if not the two consecutive quarters of contraction which is the normal definition, then something that feels very like a downturn. And so it goes on into 2024, forecast to see the economy grow by an anaemic 1%. That chimes with the Scottish Fiscal Commission, which sees growth flatlining after this year at only 1%, and cannot see any reason for it to increase over its five-year time horizon. There is a growing perception that economic growth, measured by Gross Domestic Product, is no way to measure the success of an economy, and instead measures of wellbeing should be more widely adopted. That may be laudable, but without growth in the economy and without momentum to bring on investment and career prospects, it is hard going for firms and households. They face expectations of higher taxes to meet demographic change and political pledges. It is also a tough economic backdrop for theindependence referendum that the Scottish government wants to see in October 2023. The Allander's quarterly commentary points out that one way out of this is to step up efforts to tackle poor productivity. So we need to get smarter about the organisation of work, particularly coming out of Covid with the continuation of so much working from home. Harnessing that change and making it work for employers as well as employees will be an important part of the response to this very challenging decade. Why are prices rising in the UK?

How will indyref2 compare to 2014?,"Scotland voted to stay in the UK by 55% to 45% in the 2014 independence referendum Dust off the placards. Unpack the soapbox. Grab your cagoule. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has fired the starting gun in another referendum campaign â so here we go, right? Not so fast. Many supporters of independence describe the run up to the 2014 poll - whenScotland voted to stick with the UKby 55% to 45% - as exhilarating and optimistic. Plenty of their opponents recall feelings of exclusion and sadness. Either way, it is hard to deny that politics came alive that year. For a while the nation crackled with energy as campaigners for and against independence debated poverty and pensions in the nation's parks and plazas. BBC iPlayer - Independence: Why Scotland could vote again Is indyref2 Nicola Sturgeon's biggest political gamble? Some of that enthusiasm persists in regular pro-independence marches and the occasional show of solidarity for the union but the nation is no longer in full-on campaign mode. And even if the Scottish government is able to persuade the UK Supreme Court of its right to hold a referendum - a long shot according to some eminent legal scholars - an exact repeat of 2014 does not seem very likely. Too much has changed. For a start both teams, for and against independence, have splintered. Labour's reputation was damaged by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Conservatives in the Better Together campaign to keep Scotland in the Union. It is very hard to imagine such a cross-party coalition being formed again. Former First Minister Alex Salmond and his successor Nicola Sturgeon are no longer in the same party Their opponents in the Yes Scotland camp have fallen out too, about vision, strategy and tactics, a divide most obvious in the rift between Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond who now leads a separate pro-independence party, Alba. It's not just the players who have evolved since 2014 though. So has the script. A pandemic, a cost of living crisis, war in Ukraine and Brexit have all scrambled the discourse about Scotland's future. While the UK voted to leave by 52% to 48% Scotland voted to remain by 62% to 38%. Independence: Why Scotland could vote again Scottish independence: Is there a mandate for another referendum? Scottish independence: 19 October 2023 proposed as date for referendum The first minister contends that being removed from the European Union against Scotland's will strengthens the democratic case for independence. Scotland is ""not a region questioning its place in a larger unitary state"" she argues but ""a country in a voluntary union of nations"". Of course many of her opponents contend that Brexit weakens the economic case for independence on the grounds that if Scotland were readmitted to the EU it would have to erect a hard border with its largest trading partner â England. Leaving that aside for a moment though, what about the fundamental principle? Does Scotland in fact have a right to leave the Union? Margaret Thatcher speaking at the Conservative conference in 1981 In her 1993 memoirs The Downing Street Years Margaret Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979 - 1990, appeared to accept that it did, writing: ""As a nation, [the Scots] have an undoubted right to national self-determination; thus far they have exercised that right by joining and remaining in the Union. Should they determine on independence no English party or politician would stand in their way, however much we might regret their departure."" The current Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who draws heavy criticism from many Scottish voters for both his policies and his morals, has taken a different tack, repeatedly insisting that now is not the time for another referendum. But Ciaran Martin, the former senior UK civil servant who negotiated the Edinburgh Agreement which formed the basis for the 2014 referendum, now professor of government at Oxford University, draws a distinction between the political argument for Scottish self-determination and the legal case. ""The Supreme Court can absolutely say there's no mechanism to consult the Scottish people on independence without Westminster's consent,"" says Prof Martin. However he adds, if Downing Street refuses to describe another path for Scotland to secede ""you have to give up the pretence that this is a voluntary union, that Scotland is allowed to leave."" Prof Sir Tom Devine has written several books including The Scottish Nation 1700 to 2000 Of course it was not the Scottish people who hitched their wagon to England and Empire in the first place. The historianProf Sir Tom Devine,externalhas described the Scottish nobles who took the decision as ""the elite of an elite,"" an electorate representing 0.06 per cent of the population. It is also true that the Scottish economy was in dire straits after the debacle of the Darien Scheme, a disastrous attempt to establish a colony on the isthmus of Panama which links Central and South America, and bridges the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Nonetheless there was a vote in the Scottish Parliament and the nobles did indeed choose union, which took effect on 1 May 1707. Gradually this United Kingdom grew even closer - trading together, building an empire together and fighting wars together. But long before anyone had heard the word Brexit the relationship was under strain. In the 1960s the US and the UK stationed nuclear weapons on the Clyde, less than 30 miles from Glasgow, bringing jobs but also generating moral outrage. In the 1970s North Sea oil boomed. Energy firms made fortunes and the UK Treasury raked in millions in taxation. But with most of the UK's oil off Scottish shores its discovery fuelled a nationalist movement which wanted all Scots to share in the spoils. The 1980s were the decade of Mrs Thatcher, a Tory prime minister supported by most English voters but rejected by most Scots. Her decision to pioneer the controversial poll tax in Scotland combined with her strategy of forcing old industries to change or die drove many Scottish voters into the arms of her political opponents. Even the arrival of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 did not ""kill nationalism stone dead"" as Labour's George (now Lord) Robertson had hoped it would. Instead support for independence remained more or less steady and eventually began to rise. ""The parliament took a lot of the sting out of being Scottish and that was really good,"" said the writer and commentator Fiona Rintoul, ""but it set up a scenario where if there was a different government in Westminster...there was going to be a clash."" The decline of the Labour party is a key feature of Scottish politics in the 21st Century, arguably both symptom and cause of the rise in nationalist sentiment. Tony Blair enjoyed a close working relationship with President George W Bush Chris Deerin, Scotland Editor of the New Statesman, argues that in the later years of Tony Blair's 1997-2007 premiership the SNP under Alex Salmond spotted that Labour was becoming fatigued and pounced. ""In a sense they were offering a like-for-like replacement to the Labour Party,"" he said, but further to the left and ""more optimistic."" This shift was accelerated by Mr Blair's decision to join the United States in invading Iraq which was ""the final straw"" for some Labour activists in their move towards embracing independence, according to Mr Deerin. He remains persuaded that there is a strong case for Scotland to stick with the Union, involving the ""common sense"" redistribution of resources within the UK and a seat at the top tables of international institutions but he also worries that Britain has become a ""transactional"" affair, weakening its attraction. Ms Rintoul sees Scotland drifting away from its neighbour, and approves of the direction of travel. ""A result of 45% of people voting to completely overturn the status quo in a non-wartime situation is not a ringing endorsement for the status quo,"" she said, adding that since then Brexit and the pandemic have meant that ""Scottish politics has completely decoupled from British politics."" The turmoil of the past few years has certainly reshaped the debate about Scotland's future. It has generated thorny questions about currency, borrowing, benefits and borders, tax and trade, nuclear weapons and energy. Of course there are options for Scotland other than independence and the Union. After 2014 the Scottish Parliament's tax and benefits powers were expanded and a Labour commission led by the former prime minister Gordon Brown is currently considering whether to go even further, perhaps even advocating a federal UK. For now though, 315 years after the Union was formed; 25 years since Scotland voted for devolution; and eight years on from choosing to remain in the UK, it's independence which still dominates the national conversation. It's just not clear at the moment if or when that conversation will spill out onto the streets in another full-on campaign.

Sweden and Finland: From neutral to Nato,"Both Sweden and Finland have increased their military budget in recent years Sweden is now set to join neighbouring Finland as a new Nato member, after Turkey's president withdrew a series of objections. Finland officially joined the Western defensive alliance in April, bringing the number of member states to 31. The two Nordic states have long maintained military neutrality, but that changed in February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - the biggest war on the European continent since World War Two. It was Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and Finland's Sanna Marin who kick-started the countries' bids to join Nato in 2022 Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable. Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said joining the alliance was a ""done deal"" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year. For many Finns, the war brought a haunting sense of familiarity. It was in late 1939 that the Soviets invaded Finland. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory. Watching the war in Ukraine unfold was like reliving this history, said Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns were looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she said, and thinking: ""Could this happen to us?"" Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years. Sweden's military weakness came into full view in 2013 when Russian bomber planes were able to simulate an attack on Stockholm and Sweden needed Nato help to ward them off. In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled ""if crisis or war comes"" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. For a population of only 5.5 million, Finland's conscript military is highly trained and potentially large. It trains at least 21,000 conscripts every year and has a reserve force of 900,000, soits wartime strength is estimated at 280,000,external. Sweden's military capacity is far smaller at 57,000. But it brought back conscription at the start of 2018, after suspending it in 2010, and the current number of up to 6,000 conscripts will rise to 8,000 in 2025. From the 1990s Sweden cut back the size of its military and changed its priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that went into reverse with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and its increasing threat in the Baltic region. In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. The two countries will for the first time have security guarantees from nuclear states under Nato's Article 5, which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. Historian Henrik Meinander said Finns were mentally prepared for membership, following a succession of small steps towards Nato since the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden, and every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so by 2026. Sweden may have been neutral during the Cold War but at the time it kept a force of at least 15,000 soldiers on the Baltic island of Gotland and has recently rebuilt its presence there. It hopes to build up its full-time military as well as its conscript force in the coming years. Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Nato expansion is a direct threat to his country's security - and claimed it was the reason he launched the 2022 war in Ukraine. But his invasion had the opposite effect by only serving to extend Nato's reach. Finland's accession was a particular setback, further extending Nato's influence over the Baltic Sea. And it brought a warning from the Kremlin of unspecified ""military-technical"" measures in retaliation. Russia's foreign ministry said both Sweden and Finland had been warned of the consequences if they did choose to join. Now that Sweden has been given the green light by Turkey to become a member, the Kremlin has said it will respond with the same kind of measures it proposed for Finland. What those measures would be is still vague. Russia says it has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, and they could reach Finland and Sweden. But former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb has warned that Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations are more likely. Under Article Five, Finland has - and Sweden will - soon have the commitment of the entire alliance to come to their aid if they come under attack. Their membership also makes defending the Nordic and Baltic region far more comprehensive. But there is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe membership will have an adverse effect. Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argued that Nato's nuclear deterrence increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia. This complicated peace efforts, she said, and made Sweden a less safe place. Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the period between the 1960s and '80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator. Joining Nato would be abandoning that dream, Ms Solomon said. Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 ""friendship agreement"". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence. If Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, in Finland it was a question of existence, said Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden could even afford to have a debate about Nato membership was because it used Finland and the Baltics as a ""buffer zone"", he said. Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkey, and to a lesser extent Hungary, initially resisted both applications. Ankara accused the Nordic nations of supporting what it called terrorist organisations, including the Kurdish militant PKK and the Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population, and have been persecuted by Turkish authorities for generations. But it was Sweden that triggered most hostility as Kurds have mobilised successfully in politics there over the decades. President Erdogan asked how ""how a country with terrorists on the streets... can contribute to Nato"". His main demand was to end political, financial and ""arms support"" to militants. Sweden updated its terror laws in June 2023 to outlaw taking part in an extremist group in a way that supported it - and weeks later a Kurdish man was jailed for attempting to finance terrorism. But there was some suggestion, denied by Turkey, that its main reason for resisting Sweden's bid was that Ankara was waiting for the US to provide F-16 fighter jets.

Shopping centre attack fact-checked,"The aftermath of a missile strike in Kremenchuk Within hours of the attack on a shopping centre in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, false and unproven claims began circulating online. Stories were spread by Russian Telegram channels and by Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations. They included rumours that the attack was ""false"" or ""staged"" - and were repeated on Russian television. On Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry released a statement claiming the shopping centre was ""non-functioning"" and that the bombing of a nearby ammunitions dump sparked a secondary fire at the centre. Those claims were denied by Ukrainian officials. What's the truth? This claim is false. BBC reporters on the ground have spoken to shoppers and employees who were inside the building at the time of the attack. Multiple posts listing details of missing people who were either working at the shopping centre on the day or went shopping there, were published in alocal Telegram channel,externalin the hours after the attack. One pro-Kremlin ""fact-checking"" channel suggested that no photographs from inside the shopping centre had been posted on Instagram since March. However, a woman who lives in a nearby village and regularly goes shopping in Kremenchuk, told the BBC that the shopping centre had been ""constantly open"" and her family had visited it at least once a week. Inside the shopping centre things appeared to be relatively normal in a video filmed two days before the attack She also shared video she had taken at the shopping centre from 25 June, showing open shops and people walking inside the building. Other, similar footage posted online appears even more recent - includinga YouTube video apparently filmed just a day before the attack,external, also showing shoppers and businesses open as normal. A still from a video showing businesses open as usual two days before the attack Some Telegram channels claimed there were no women or children at the shopping centre -  implying that the building had been turned into a military facility. That claim is false, according to several eyewitness accounts and online videos. The Russian Defence Ministry claimed a strike on an arms storage facility detonated ammunition which set the shopping centre on fire. ""Western-manufactured weapons and ammunition stockpiled in the warehouse to be sent to a Ukrainian military grouping in Donbas were hit with a high-precision strike,"" the ministry said. Ukrainian officials have denied there was a weapons depot nearby. CCTV footage captured near a pond roughly 600 metres north of the shopping centre, on the other side of a factory building, shows two missile strikes in the area. Allow Twitter content?

Matching the exact spots where the two missiles land in the CCTV video with aerial images of the area, it appears one missile hit close to the eastern end of the shopping centre, while the other struck the northern end of the factory, near the southern edge of the pond. The factory mentioned by the Russian defence ministry is located roughly 300 metres north of the shopping centre. The buildings are separated by a wall, vegetation and rail tracks, making the claim that ""secondary explosions"" caused a large fire with multiple casualties in the shopping centre unlikely. This video can not be played Watch: Drone footage shows the extent of the destruction at the shopping centre According to the Ukrainian online publication Kyiv Independent,external, a press officer of the regional administration confirmed that the machinery plant had been hit, injuring two individuals. Svitlana Rybalko, from the regional State Emergency Service, denied there were weapons stored at the facility.""It's a place for making road equipment, machines for road construction,"" she told the BBC. ""There's also a greenhouse nearby where workers grow cucumbers."" This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows missile striking Ukrainian shopping mall Satellite images of the area, along with a video released by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky provide further evidence that these were the locations of the strikes. This video also supports an earlier Ukrainian assessment that the missile was an air-launched Kh-22 weapon. This is a medium-range cruise missile developed in the 1960s, originally to attack large warships. There is also a land-attack variant. The weapon is large, liquid-fuelled and supersonic - but inaccurate by today's standards. The relatively shallow angle of impact further points to its cruise nature. A ballistic missile follows a much more parabolic path. Ukraine says the missiles were launched from bombers in the Kursk region of Russia, some 300km (185 miles) away. Flames engulfing the mall in Kremenchuk This claim contradicts the official Russian defence ministry statement - even though top diplomats such as Mr Polyanskiy, the deputy UN ambassador, described the Kremenchuk attack as ""a new Bucha-style Ukrainian provocation"" on Twitter. There's simply no evidence - nor has any been offered - that Ukraine bombed the shopping centre, or that the attack was ""staged"". It's the latest example of a common tactic used by supporters of the Russian government - throwing multiple, conflicting, evidence-free narratives out in the immediate aftermath of an attack. The claim echoes other, debunked false assertions by Russia and its supporters, for instance that the attack on amaternity hospital in Mariupoland thekillings of civilians in Buchawere somehow faked or staged. In a Twitter message, Mr Polyanskiy said the attack ""will be used by Ukraine to attract as much attention as possible through promoting [a] false version of what happened"" and ""my tweet doesn't contradict the explanation provided by Russian [Ministry of Defence]"".

LiveLiveRussia: We have withdrawn troops from Snake Island3 minutes ago,"Indonesia's president says he's delivered a message to Russia's Vladimir Putin from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky Joko Widodo tells reporters after meeting Putin in Moscow that he wants to help start communication between the two leaders Ukraine is celebrating after Russia withdrew its forces from Snake Island - but Moscow says the move is a ""goodwill gesture"" UK PM Boris Johnson commits to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade Nato members have agreed a significant increase in funding for the alliance, on the second day of its Madrid summit The alliance's chief says Sweden and Finland will sign the protocol to join Nato on Tuesday, though member states will then need to ratify it Edited by Rob Corp and Heather Sharp Thank you for joining our live coverage of the Nato summit and war in Ukraine. Here are today's closing headlines:  The writers of today's live page were: Dulcie Lee, James Clarke, Catherine Evans, Malu Cursino, Nadeem Shad and Doug Faulkner. The editors were Holly Wallis, Jeremy Gahagan, Heather Sharp and Rob Corp Since Turkey dropped its veto over Sweden and Finland joining Nato, there have been some concerns over its reasons for doing so. On Wednesday, Ankara said it would seekthe extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspectsfrom Sweden and Finland. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Ankara wanted 12 suspects from Finland and another 21 from Sweden. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"". Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. But on Thursday, Sweden's Justice Minister Morgan Johansson insisted that any decisions regarding extradition of Kurds would be made by ""independent courts"". ""Swedish citizens are not extradited,"" said Johansson. ""Non-Swedish citizens can be extradited at the request of other countries, but only if it is compatible with Swedish law and the European Convention."" A mainstay of Putin's inner circle, Sergei Lavrov, has been drawing some historic parallels during a press conference. The Russian foreign minister said that a new ""iron curtain"" was being put in place between the West and Russia. The term was used during the Cold War to refer to the division between Western countries and those with links to the Soviet Union, as relations between the two sides ebbed to an all time low. ""As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending..."" said Lavrov. ""The process has begun,"" he said, adding that Western countries should ""just behave carefully"". Funerals continue to be held for those who have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. They include victims of the Kremenchuk shopping centre which was hit by Russian rockets on Monday. Relatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony for Andriy Krasyuk who was killed in the Russian rocket attack on the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk on Monday A woman mourns in front of flowers left in memory of civilian victims killed at the shopping mall Natalia, the wife of Ukrainian serviceman Volodymyr Kochetov, 46, who was killed in a fight during Russia's invasion, cries by his coffin during his funeral in the village of Babyntsi, Ukraine A soldier holds a red carnation as he attends the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier at the St Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv We've been reporting on the situation in Lysychansk, a city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, the region's governor, warned residents in Lysychansk to stay in shelters because ""it is no longer possible to evacuate"". Haidai said Russian troops were on the outskirts of the city and were firing from several directions. Earlier, Haidai said the city has beensuffering ""endless air strikes""and the Russians were using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture Lysychansk. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said Russia has been successful in seizing some of the territory in Lysychansk's oil refinery, but that Ukrainian forces had beaten back an attack on a gelatin plant in the city. Lysychansk stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. It's the last major city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region The United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Ukraine says there is ""blatant ignoring"" of international humanitarian and human rights law in parts of the country no longer under Ukrainian government control. Osnat Lubrani says aid organisations were unable to deliver relief supplies, or get access, to Kherson or Mariupol, and had been unable to get agreement on safe passage to evacuate people to leave Severodonetsk. Russian forces are now in control of both Mariupol and Severodonetsk. ""We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart by this war,"" Lubrani says at a news conference in Kyiv. ""But the Russian Federation, also the Ukrainian government, have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible."" More now on Nato's new strategy towards China. Earlier on, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the new approach reflects Russia and China's use of ""economic leverage, coercion, and hybrid approaches to advance their interests in the region"". But Beijing has called Nato's new strategy irresponsible . China's foreign minister, Zhao Lijian, said ""Nato's so-called new strategy concept document disregards the facts"". Lijian said that the new strategy ""wrongly defines China as posing a strategic challenge and smears China's foreign policy"". He added that it is ""irresponsible, encourages conflict, and is full of Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice"". Earlier this week China criticised the West for arming Ukraine. This video can not be played Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg speaks with the BBC's Frank Gardner While Nato's focus has been on the situation in Ukraine, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also spoken about China. For the first time the defence alliance has decided to talk about what it's been calling ""the challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests and values."" It comes as China's military presence has been growing on the world stage. The country recently launched it's third and most modern aircraft carrier joining a very small group of nations that are capable of fielding these kinds of ships. Taiwan, an island in the East China Sea is seen by China as an integral part of its territory. In recent years Beijing officials have threatened military action if any attempts are made for independence. While emphasizing that Taiwan is not a Nato member, the Nato head admitted that what happens to the island does ""matter to Nato allies"". Stoltenberg made the comments during an interview with the BBC's Frank Gardner where Stoltenberg also discussed China and Russia's development of hypersonic missiles. Both countries have led the way in the development of the weapons that are capable of travelling towards their target at more than five times the speed of sound on a unpredictable flight path. Ukraine says it's introducing a trade embargo against Syria and sanctions targeting Syrian legal entities and individuals. It's in response to Syria's decision to recognise the two Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas region, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has announced. On its website it says it ""strongly condemns"" the decision of the Syrian Arab Republic to recognise ""the so-called independence"" of the ""temporarily occupied territories"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. It called the move an ""unfriendly act"" towards Ukraine and a violation of the principles of international law. On Wednesday, Syria's Foreign Ministry announced that the country - an ally of Russia - had recognised the ""independence and sovereignty of the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky severed diplomatic ties with Syria following the announcement. Chris PartridgeBBC News New satellite imagery taken today shows the aftermath of Ukraineâs attack on Snake Island, which many believe forced Russian troops to leave. Pictures from Maxar Technologies were taken this morning, showing whatâs left of burned vehicles and structures across the north end of the island. Artillery strikes and air attacks delivered the blows to Russian forces, something that has been happening frequently to stop Moscow gaining a permanent foothold. We know at least one Russian Pantsir SA-22 air defence unit with medium-range capability was stationed on the island. Itâs not clear whether it was destroyed in this latest attack, or in any of the strikes before. In this second image, a colour infrared view, the black/grey areas present those which were recently burned. Non-burned vegetation shows up red/pink. More details will likely emerge of what was destroyed, but Ukraine is clear it was enough to drive out Russian forces. âNot withstanding the fire of our artillery, missile strikes and aviation, Russian occupants left Snake Island,â said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Main Operations Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow says it left as a âgoodwill gesture.â You can read more about Snake Islandhere Mykolaiv came under heavy shelling on Wednesday Turning to the conflict on the ground now, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv yesterday has risen to six, the local emergency services say. Another six people were injured and rescuers are continue to search for bodies at the five-storey residential building which came under attack and was destroyed, they added. The six victims are among 10 civilians reported to have been killed in Russian shelling across yesterday and today. Two were killed in shelling of the Donetsk region, and another person died in an attack on the Izyum district of the Kharkiv region, according to posts from the regional governors on messaging service Telegram. And Russian missiles, mortars and artillery hitting the northern Sumy Region left one person dead, the governor there says. We have more now on that diplomatic telling-off Russia has given to the UK ambassador in Moscow over comments made by UK PM Boris Johnson. Earlier this week Johnson said Vladimir Putin would not have started the war in Ukraine if he was a woman and described the operation as a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"". Putin has dismissed Johnson's comments as ""incorrect"". In a statement the Russian foreign ministry said that ""in polite society it is customary to apologise for remarks of this kind"", adding that it was ""unacceptable insulting rhetoric"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also accused the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman of ""every week, threatening to nuke everyone or doing something or another"". The Russian foreign ministry underlined it was ""unacceptable"" for British officials ""to share deliberately false information, especially on alleged threats by Russians 'resorting to nuclear arms'"". Russia has summoned the British ambassador in Moscow to protest against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""offensive"" remarks about President Vladimir Putin, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. Deborah Bronnert was told that Russia ""firmly"" opposed the ""openly offensive comments by the British authorities towards Russia, its leader, its officials as well as the Russian people"", the AFP news agency reported the ministry as saying. Reuters reported that the ""offensive"" statements included those about alleged Russian threats to use nuclear weapons. Ukraine has welcomed the release of 144 soldiers in the biggest prisoner swap seen yet in this war. The exchange includes 95 soldiers who defended Mariupol's steelworkers, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds, blast traumas, burns, fractured bones and amputated limbs, the agency known by the acronym GUR said in a statement on Telegram. There was no comment from Russia about a prisoner swap. But the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine said it had secured the release of 144 soldiers, including its fighters and those of the Russian army. It is the biggest prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia so far The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said Ambulances gathered at the site to treat the injured soldiers Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter The Snake Island defenders were depicted in a set of Ukrainian stamps As Russia's troops withdraw from Snake Island, remember the Ukrainian
border guard who went viral when it was first attacked? His name was Roman and he became famous around the world for defiantly swearing at
a Russian warship which had threatened to bomb him and his fellow border guards
on the Black Sea island if they didnât surrender. A recording of the exchange was shared widely on social media in the
early days of the war - and the Ukrainian government declared that Roman and
his comrades had died as national heroes. Romanâs mother Tetyana thought that he had died - but it turned out he
was still alive. I interviewed her forBBC Radio 4âs War on Truth podcast, where she
told me about what it was like being at the heart of the information
war over Ukraine. Her story
tells us a lot about how propaganda battles play out alongside military
action. In
the fog of war, it can be hard to tell what is a concerted effort to mislead -
war strategy and propaganda - and what is just down to confusion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has met Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin on consecutive days, says his country would like the war to end soon. Speaking at a news conference with Putin in Moscow following their meeting, Widodo said: ""Although the external situation is still difficult, it is still important to move towards a settlement and open dialogue. ""I call on all world leaders to revive the spirit of co-operation,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the talks had been productive, adding: ""I am convinced that the agreements reached today will further strengthen the Russian-Indonesian partnership."" But the Russian leader took the opportunity to blame the West for any potential global food crisis. ""We have repeatedly stressed that the imbalance of food markets is a direct consequence of many years of irresponsible economic policies of a number of countries, uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts, and the situation has worsened since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""However, Western countries, not wanting to admit the fallacy of their economic course, are further destabilising global agricultural production by imposing restrictions on the supply of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers,"" he said, repeating his claim that sanctions are preventing agricultural exports from leaving the region, rather than Russia's invasion and its blockade of Black Sea ports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo says he has delivered a message from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Widodo met the Ukrainian president on a visit to Kyiv yesterday and has been in Moscow today for a meeting with Putin. ""I conveyed President Zelensky's message to President Putin,"" Widodo said after the Moscow talks. He did not reveal what the message said but added he's expressed his ""readiness"" to help start communication between the two leaders. Widodo said Indonesia will continue to co-operate with Russia, and in turn Putin told reporters that Russia is ready to fulfil Indonesia's need for fertilisers - the supply of which has been affected by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The Indonesian leader is the current president of the G20 group of nations and a member of a United Nations crisis group set up to address the threat of global hunger resulting from the war. Widodo has invited Zelensky to the November G20 summit in Bali. AFP reports the Ukrainian president told Widodo his attendance would depend on who else was there - Russia is a member of the G20 and as such Putin would be expected to attend. Joko Widodo met Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday... Aiden Aslin (left) and Shaun Pinner (centre) were sentenced alongside Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun Russia has been told to prevent the execution of two Britons who were capturedwhile fighting for Ukraine, by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were sentenced by a Russian proxy  court -which is not internationally recognised - in eastern Ukraine earlier this month. In an emergency ruling, the ECHR said Russia must ensure the death penalty is not carried out, but Russia has dismissed the call for the men to be spared. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""You know that Russia no longer complies with the requirements of the ECHR,"" in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier this month, the family ofMr Aslin said he had been told that the execution would be carried out. Chris MasonPolitical editor, reporting from Madrid After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending
in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in UK Prime
Minister Boris Johnson's opening address at his news conference here at the Nato summit in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to
embark, these decisions, is that we'll reach 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the
decade,"" he announced. This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members
and I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for
defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the
next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number
can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision
points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least
some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't always match. Lysychansk residents are trying to leave the city for safety by train The city of Lysychansk ""suffers from endless air strikes"", according to the governor of Luhansk region,  Serhiy Haidai. He says in a post on Telegram the Russians are using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture the city, which is in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region. It stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. Haidai says ""there is a lot of destruction"" in Lysychansk, the police department has been destroyed and the city's oil refinery damaged. ""It is difficult to find a safe place in the city,"" Haidai says. ""People dream of at least half an hour of silence, but the occupiers do not stop firing from all available weapons."" He says it is difficult to get to and from the city, with roads to Lysychansk ""littered with shell fragments"", and the Russians trying to take control of the highway linking the city with Bakhmut, about 50km away. Many residents who want to leave the city are aiming to do so by train. He says despite this, there are attempts to bring food into the city but adds residents can only access water when it is delivered by the emergency services. Â© 2025 BBC.

Petrol station staff abused over high fuel prices,"Petrol station workers are reporting growing abuse from drivers as fuel prices remain at record highs. Staff are seeing a ""huge increase"" of verbal abuse from motorists angry at the price at the pump, according to forecourt operator Ascona Group. Petrol debt recovery firm, Forecourt Eye, said staff were dealing with ""very combative attitudes"" from customers. Soaring oil prices have pushed up the cost of petrol and diesel.It now costs more than Â£100 to fill the average car. Fuel prices in the UK have remained at record levels for weeks, as many countries reduce their dependency on Russian oil in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Nick Fisher, chief executive of Forecourt Eye said petrol station staff were being confronted by customers talking about being ""ripped off"" and asking questions like ""how do you expect me to pay?"" He said customers were ""becoming frustrated"" at the high prices because they had remained high and kept creeping higher. Many petrol stations rely on additional incomes made from sales of groceries, bakery items and coffee, he said. But shoppers will not buy other products from a store where they feel they are being overcharged, he added. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Darren Briggs, chief executive of the Ascona Group said there had been a rise in the number of people who are driving off without paying for their petrol, which he linked to cost of living pressures. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said that petrol theft has continued to rise across the country. Drive off incidents, where a motorist fills up and makes no attempt to pay before leaving, have increased by 61% so far this year, compared with the same period in 2021, according to figures from Forecourt Eye. Mr Fisher said this was putting pressure on margins, and if the current rate of drive-offs continued it would cost businesses Â£25 million in lost fuel sales over a year. Forecourt Eye digitally traces and tracks non-payers at more than 1,000 petrol stations and its new clients have doubled in the last two months due to the rise in non-payers, he said. The AA and RAC have both claimed in the last few days that it was unjustifiable that petrol prices continued to rise whilst wholesale prices have fallen. But Gordon Balmer from the PRA insisted its members had passed on the 5p fuel duty cut introduced in March. However, the wholesale costs were very volatile, and over time, they had ""overwhelmed"" the fuel duty cut, he said. Mr Briggs from Ascona Group said petrol stations were often not making enough to recoup costs. He said other pressures on margins included a reduction in how much fuel was being sold, as customers tried to save money - with the volume of sales at some sites only at 80% of normal levels. Mr Briggs said it could cost up to Â£25,000 per month to run a petrol station, covering costs such as wages, utility bills, maintenance, repairs. He said money lost by non-payment was another financial blow. Why are petrol prices going back up?

Prince Charles was ""absolutely thrilled"" by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's visit with their daughter and son Archie, the source added. Prince Harry, who quit as a working royal in 2020, said last year he had felt ""let down"" by his father. At one stage, his father stopped taking his calls, the duke told Oprah Winfrey. The Sussexes' interview with Oprah sparked controversy, after theyaccused an unnamed royal of racist remarks towards their son before his birthand saidthe wider institution failed to support Meghan when she had suicidal thoughts. The royal source said that the family's first trip to the UK together since they moved away in 2020 had been ""wonderful"".

He said it was also ""very, very special"" for Prince Charles to spend time with his grandson, Archie, now aged three. The source added: ""He hadn't met Lili, his granddaughter, and so to meet her was very emotional, a very, very wonderful thing."" Lilibet celebrated her first birthdayon the family's trip to the UK from California, where it would have also been the first opportunity for the Queen to meet her great-granddaughter and namesake, for the first time. Harry and Meghan attended a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral during the Jubilee, where they sat apart from Prince Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. They did not take part in any other public celebrations. Meghan and Harry shared the first photograph of Lilibet in December on a festive card. Her brother, Archie, now three, is also pictured. Speaking at a briefing on Clarence House's annual review, the royal source congratulated the Sussexes on their financial independence. ""Great credit to them. They said they wanted to transition to financial independence and that has now been achieved,"" the source said. In the Oprah interview, Prince Harry said his family ""cut me off financially"" in 2020, with Clarence House saying Prince Charles provided support until the summer that year. Harry and Meghan secured multi-million pound deals with Netflix and Spotify after moving to the US, although their first productions have yet to be released. With the Sussexes no longer listed in the accounts, Charles's bill for the activities of his sons and their families has dropped by Â£1.2m over two years.

US to ramp up European presence,"The US president said this was ""exactly"" what Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want The US will increase its military presence across Europe as Nato agreed a ""fundamental shift"" in its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A permanent army headquarters will be created in Poland, while new US warships will go to Spain, fighter jets to the UK and ground troops to Romania. Mr Biden said Nato was ""needed now more than it has ever been"". The alliance is having its biggest overhaul since the Cold War, Nato head Jens Stoltenberg said. The new plan in response to Russia's invasion will mean more than 300,000 troops at high readiness next year, up from the current level of 40,000. Mr Biden told a summit in Madrid that Nato would be ""strengthened in all directions across every domain - land, air and sea"". The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has also said it is significantly increasing the availability of forces to Nato's collective defence, with more warships, fighter jets and land forces on standby - although the MoD said it would not give details on numbers as they are ""militarily sensitive"". What is Nato and how is it changing? Five key challenges for Nato at critical summit The US announcement sees it shore up its presence across the continent but particularly in eastern Europe where the new permanent headquarters for its 5th Army Corps will be based. Mr Biden repeated the alliance's commitment to ""defend every inch"" of its territory, saying: ""We mean it when we say an attack against one is an attack against all."" The measures include: Boosting the fleet of US naval destroyers in Spain from four to six An additional ""rotational brigade in Romania consisting of 3,000 fighters and another 2,000-personnel combat team Two more squadrons of F-35 stealth jets to the UK Additional air defence and other capabilities in Germany and Italy. The UK has already nearly doubled the size of its military presence in Estonia, with just over 1,600 troops there. More will be allocated to the defence of the Baltics, however the MoD said these additional troops may be held at high readiness back home. At the summit Nato leaders agreed to accept the previously neutral Nordic statesFinland and Sweden into the alliance, with their membership needing to be ratified by the governments of all 30 Nato members. Mr Biden said this was ""exactly"" what Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want and said his strategy of invading Ukraine had backfired. Nato Secretary General Mr Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden had been formally invited to join the military alliance, describing it as the ""fastest accession process ever"", and said he expected the swift progress to continue. The two applicants must now show that they meet Nato's standards in politics, law, and in their armed forces - something which is expected to be relatively straightforward for the Nordic countries. Mr Stoltenberg said Ukraine could continue to count on the alliance's assistance in the face of Russian aggression for ""as long as it takes"", adding that Ukraine was fighting for its independence but also for values shared by Nato. He said member states had agreed a ""comprehensive assistance package"" for Ukraine, which included fuel, medical supplies, body armour, anti-drone systems and equipment to counter mines. Gone are the past mealy-mouthed references to Russia or China being partners. In an 11-page document, Nato's updatedStrategic Concept,externalexplains how the alliance views the threats facing western democracies and how it plans to deal with them. The Russian Federation, it says, is the most significant and direct threat to allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. We cannot consider it ""to be our partner"", it reads, but ""we remain willing to keep open channels of communication with Moscow"" to prevent escalation. The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and China runs counter to Nato values and interests, the document explains. In reference to President Putin's repeated reminders that he's got a large arsenal of nuclear weapons, Nato points to its own formidable nuclear deterrent. If anyone used nuclear weapons against the alliance, the document says, then it has the capabilities and resolve to impose ""unacceptable"" costs on an adversary. But these circumstances, it adds, are ""extremely remote"". The document is short on detail of where Nato plans to place its reinforcements. But its door remains open to new members, it says, and in words that will further annoy the Kremlin: ""We will continue to develop our partnerships with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine."" The summit described a new guiding blueprint for the alliance which said that Russia was ""the most significant and direct threat to Allies' security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area"". It added that ""we cannot discount the possibility of an attack against allies' sovereignty and territorial integrity"". Mr Putin said he could not rule out that tensions would emerge between Russia and Sweden and Finland after they joined Nato and said Moscow would respond in kind if Nato infrastructure was set up in the countries. He said Nato leaders wanted to ""assert their supremacy, their imperial ambitions"" but also said Russia had ""no problem"" with Finland and Sweden joining the bloc.

Sweden and Finland's journey from neutral to Nato,"Both Sweden and Finland have increased their military budget in recent years Sweden is now set to join neighbouring Finland as a new Nato member, after Turkey's president withdrew a series of objections. Finland officially joined the Western defensive alliance in April, bringing the number of member states to 31. The two Nordic states have long maintained military neutrality, but that changed in February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - the biggest war on the European continent since World War Two. It was Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and Finland's Sanna Marin who kick-started the countries' bids to join Nato in 2022 Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable. Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said joining the alliance was a ""done deal"" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year. For many Finns, the war brought a haunting sense of familiarity. It was in late 1939 that the Soviets invaded Finland. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory. Watching the war in Ukraine unfold was like reliving this history, said Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns were looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she said, and thinking: ""Could this happen to us?"" Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years. Sweden's military weakness came into full view in 2013 when Russian bomber planes were able to simulate an attack on Stockholm and Sweden needed Nato help to ward them off. In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled ""if crisis or war comes"" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. For a population of only 5.5 million, Finland's conscript military is highly trained and potentially large. It trains at least 21,000 conscripts every year and has a reserve force of 900,000, soits wartime strength is estimated at 280,000,external. Sweden's military capacity is far smaller at 57,000. But it brought back conscription at the start of 2018, after suspending it in 2010, and the current number of up to 6,000 conscripts will rise to 8,000 in 2025. From the 1990s Sweden cut back the size of its military and changed its priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that went into reverse with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and its increasing threat in the Baltic region. In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. The two countries will for the first time have security guarantees from nuclear states under Nato's Article 5, which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. Historian Henrik Meinander said Finns were mentally prepared for membership, following a succession of small steps towards Nato since the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden, and every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so by 2026. Sweden may have been neutral during the Cold War but at the time it kept a force of at least 15,000 soldiers on the Baltic island of Gotland and has recently rebuilt its presence there. It hopes to build up its full-time military as well as its conscript force in the coming years. Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Nato expansion is a direct threat to his country's security - and claimed it was the reason he launched the 2022 war in Ukraine. But his invasion had the opposite effect by only serving to extend Nato's reach. Finland's accession was a particular setback, further extending Nato's influence over the Baltic Sea. And it brought a warning from the Kremlin of unspecified ""military-technical"" measures in retaliation. Russia's foreign ministry said both Sweden and Finland had been warned of the consequences if they did choose to join. Now that Sweden has been given the green light by Turkey to become a member, the Kremlin has said it will respond with the same kind of measures it proposed for Finland. What those measures would be is still vague. Russia says it has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, and they could reach Finland and Sweden. But former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb has warned that Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations are more likely. Under Article Five, Finland has - and Sweden will - soon have the commitment of the entire alliance to come to their aid if they come under attack. Their membership also makes defending the Nordic and Baltic region far more comprehensive. But there is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe membership will have an adverse effect. Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argued that Nato's nuclear deterrence increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia. This complicated peace efforts, she said, and made Sweden a less safe place. Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the period between the 1960s and '80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator. Joining Nato would be abandoning that dream, Ms Solomon said. Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 ""friendship agreement"". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence. If Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, in Finland it was a question of existence, said Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden could even afford to have a debate about Nato membership was because it used Finland and the Baltics as a ""buffer zone"", he said. Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkey, and to a lesser extent Hungary, initially resisted both applications. Ankara accused the Nordic nations of supporting what it called terrorist organisations, including the Kurdish militant PKK and the Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population, and have been persecuted by Turkish authorities for generations. But it was Sweden that triggered most hostility as Kurds have mobilised successfully in politics there over the decades. President Erdogan asked how ""how a country with terrorists on the streets... can contribute to Nato"". His main demand was to end political, financial and ""arms support"" to militants. Sweden updated its terror laws in June 2023 to outlaw taking part in an extremist group in a way that supported it - and weeks later a Kurdish man was jailed for attempting to finance terrorism. But there was some suggestion, denied by Turkey, that its main reason for resisting Sweden's bid was that Ankara was waiting for the US to provide F-16 fighter jets.

Here are today's closing headlines:  The writers of today's live page were: Dulcie Lee, James Clarke, Catherine Evans, Malu Cursino, Nadeem Shad and Doug Faulkner. The editors were Holly Wallis, Jeremy Gahagan, Heather Sharp and Rob Corp Since Turkey dropped its veto over Sweden and Finland joining Nato, there have been some concerns over its reasons for doing so. On Wednesday, Ankara said it would seekthe extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspectsfrom Sweden and Finland. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Ankara wanted 12 suspects from Finland and another 21 from Sweden. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"". Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. But on Thursday, Sweden's Justice Minister Morgan Johansson insisted that any decisions regarding extradition of Kurds would be made by ""independent courts"". ""Swedish citizens are not extradited,"" said Johansson. ""Non-Swedish citizens can be extradited at the request of other countries, but only if it is compatible with Swedish law and the European Convention."" A mainstay of Putin's inner circle, Sergei Lavrov, has been drawing some historic parallels during a press conference. The Russian foreign minister said that a new ""iron curtain"" was being put in place between the West and Russia. The term was used during the Cold War to refer to the division between Western countries and those with links to the Soviet Union, as relations between the two sides ebbed to an all time low. ""As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending..."" said Lavrov. ""The process has begun,"" he said, adding that Western countries should ""just behave carefully"". Funerals continue to be held for those who have been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. They include victims of the Kremenchuk shopping centre which was hit by Russian rockets on Monday. Relatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony for Andriy Krasyuk who was killed in the Russian rocket attack on the Amstor shopping mall in Kremenchuk on Monday A woman mourns in front of flowers left in memory of civilian victims killed at the shopping mall Natalia, the wife of Ukrainian serviceman Volodymyr Kochetov, 46, who was killed in a fight during Russia's invasion, cries by his coffin during his funeral in the village of Babyntsi, Ukraine A soldier holds a red carnation as he attends the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier at the St Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv We've been reporting on the situation in Lysychansk, a city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine. Serhiy Haidai, the region's governor, warned residents in Lysychansk to stay in shelters because ""it is no longer possible to evacuate"". Haidai said Russian troops were on the outskirts of the city and were firing from several directions. Earlier, Haidai said the city has beensuffering ""endless air strikes""and the Russians were using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture Lysychansk. The Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff said Russia has been successful in seizing some of the territory in Lysychansk's oil refinery, but that Ukrainian forces had beaten back an attack on a gelatin plant in the city. Lysychansk stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. It's the last major city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region The United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Ukraine says there is ""blatant ignoring"" of international humanitarian and human rights law in parts of the country no longer under Ukrainian government control. Osnat Lubrani says aid organisations were unable to deliver relief supplies, or get access, to Kherson or Mariupol, and had been unable to get agreement on safe passage to evacuate people to leave Severodonetsk. Russian forces are now in control of both Mariupol and Severodonetsk. ""We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart by this war,"" Lubrani says at a news conference in Kyiv. ""But the Russian Federation, also the Ukrainian government, have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible."" More now on Nato's new strategy towards China. Earlier on, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the new approach reflects Russia and China's use of ""economic leverage, coercion, and hybrid approaches to advance their interests in the region"". But Beijing has called Nato's new strategy irresponsible . China's foreign minister, Zhao Lijian, said ""Nato's so-called new strategy concept document disregards the facts"". Lijian said that the new strategy ""wrongly defines China as posing a strategic challenge and smears China's foreign policy"". He added that it is ""irresponsible, encourages conflict, and is full of Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice"". Earlier this week China criticised the West for arming Ukraine. This video can not be played Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg speaks with the BBC's Frank Gardner While Nato's focus has been on the situation in Ukraine, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also spoken about China. For the first time the defence alliance has decided to talk about what it's been calling ""the challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests and values."" It comes as China's military presence has been growing on the world stage. The country recently launched it's third and most modern aircraft carrier joining a very small group of nations that are capable of fielding these kinds of ships. Taiwan, an island in the East China Sea is seen by China as an integral part of its territory. In recent years Beijing officials have threatened military action if any attempts are made for independence. While emphasizing that Taiwan is not a Nato member, the Nato head admitted that what happens to the island does ""matter to Nato allies"". Stoltenberg made the comments during an interview with the BBC's Frank Gardner where Stoltenberg also discussed China and Russia's development of hypersonic missiles. Both countries have led the way in the development of the weapons that are capable of travelling towards their target at more than five times the speed of sound on a unpredictable flight path. Ukraine says it's introducing a trade embargo against Syria and sanctions targeting Syrian legal entities and individuals. It's in response to Syria's decision to recognise the two Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas region, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has announced. On its website it says it ""strongly condemns"" the decision of the Syrian Arab Republic to recognise ""the so-called independence"" of the ""temporarily occupied territories"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. It called the move an ""unfriendly act"" towards Ukraine and a violation of the principles of international law. On Wednesday, Syria's Foreign Ministry announced that the country - an ally of Russia - had recognised the ""independence and sovereignty of the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky severed diplomatic ties with Syria following the announcement. Chris PartridgeBBC News New satellite imagery taken today shows the aftermath of Ukraineâs attack on Snake Island, which many believe forced Russian troops to leave. Pictures from Maxar Technologies were taken this morning, showing whatâs left of burned vehicles and structures across the north end of the island. Artillery strikes and air attacks delivered the blows to Russian forces, something that has been happening frequently to stop Moscow gaining a permanent foothold. We know at least one Russian Pantsir SA-22 air defence unit with medium-range capability was stationed on the island. Itâs not clear whether it was destroyed in this latest attack, or in any of the strikes before. In this second image, a colour infrared view, the black/grey areas present those which were recently burned. Non-burned vegetation shows up red/pink. More details will likely emerge of what was destroyed, but Ukraine is clear it was enough to drive out Russian forces. âNot withstanding the fire of our artillery, missile strikes and aviation, Russian occupants left Snake Island,â said Brig Gen Oleksiy Hromov, deputy chief of the Main Operations Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Moscow says it left as a âgoodwill gesture.â You can read more about Snake Islandhere Mykolaiv came under heavy shelling on Wednesday Turning to the conflict on the ground now, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the southern city of Mykolaiv yesterday has risen to six, the local emergency services say. Another six people were injured and rescuers are continue to search for bodies at the five-storey residential building which came under attack and was destroyed, they added. The six victims are among 10 civilians reported to have been killed in Russian shelling across yesterday and today. Two were killed in shelling of the Donetsk region, and another person died in an attack on the Izyum district of the Kharkiv region, according to posts from the regional governors on messaging service Telegram. And Russian missiles, mortars and artillery hitting the northern Sumy Region left one person dead, the governor there says. We have more now on that diplomatic telling-off Russia has given to the UK ambassador in Moscow over comments made by UK PM Boris Johnson. Earlier this week Johnson said Vladimir Putin would not have started the war in Ukraine if he was a woman and described the operation as a ""perfect example of toxic masculinity"". Putin has dismissed Johnson's comments as ""incorrect"". In a statement the Russian foreign ministry said that ""in polite society it is customary to apologise for remarks of this kind"", adding that it was ""unacceptable insulting rhetoric"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also accused the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman of ""every week, threatening to nuke everyone or doing something or another"". The Russian foreign ministry underlined it was ""unacceptable"" for British officials ""to share deliberately false information, especially on alleged threats by Russians 'resorting to nuclear arms'"". Russia has summoned the British ambassador in Moscow to protest against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""offensive"" remarks about President Vladimir Putin, a Russian foreign ministry statement said. Deborah Bronnert was told that Russia ""firmly"" opposed the ""openly offensive comments by the British authorities towards Russia, its leader, its officials as well as the Russian people"", the AFP news agency reported the ministry as saying. Reuters reported that the ""offensive"" statements included those about alleged Russian threats to use nuclear weapons. Ukraine has welcomed the release of 144 soldiers in the biggest prisoner swap seen yet in this war. The exchange includes 95 soldiers who defended Mariupol's steelworkers, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said. The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds, blast traumas, burns, fractured bones and amputated limbs, the agency known by the acronym GUR said in a statement on Telegram. There was no comment from Russia about a prisoner swap. But the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine said it had secured the release of 144 soldiers, including its fighters and those of the Russian army. It is the biggest prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia so far The majority of the Ukrainians were badly wounded, Ukraine's military intelligence agency said Ambulances gathered at the site to treat the injured soldiers Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter The Snake Island defenders were depicted in a set of Ukrainian stamps As Russia's troops withdraw from Snake Island, remember the Ukrainian
border guard who went viral when it was first attacked? His name was Roman and he became famous around the world for defiantly swearing at
a Russian warship which had threatened to bomb him and his fellow border guards
on the Black Sea island if they didnât surrender. A recording of the exchange was shared widely on social media in the
early days of the war - and the Ukrainian government declared that Roman and
his comrades had died as national heroes. Romanâs mother Tetyana thought that he had died - but it turned out he
was still alive. I interviewed her forBBC Radio 4âs War on Truth podcast, where she
told me about what it was like being at the heart of the information
war over Ukraine. Her story
tells us a lot about how propaganda battles play out alongside military
action. In
the fog of war, it can be hard to tell what is a concerted effort to mislead -
war strategy and propaganda - and what is just down to confusion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who has met Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin on consecutive days, says his country would like the war to end soon. Speaking at a news conference with Putin in Moscow following their meeting, Widodo said: ""Although the external situation is still difficult, it is still important to move towards a settlement and open dialogue. ""I call on all world leaders to revive the spirit of co-operation,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the talks had been productive, adding: ""I am convinced that the agreements reached today will further strengthen the Russian-Indonesian partnership."" But the Russian leader took the opportunity to blame the West for any potential global food crisis. ""We have repeatedly stressed that the imbalance of food markets is a direct consequence of many years of irresponsible economic policies of a number of countries, uncontrolled emission and accumulation of unsecured debts, and the situation has worsened since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. ""However, Western countries, not wanting to admit the fallacy of their economic course, are further destabilising global agricultural production by imposing restrictions on the supply of Russian and Belarusian fertilisers,"" he said, repeating his claim that sanctions are preventing agricultural exports from leaving the region, rather than Russia's invasion and its blockade of Black Sea ports. Indonesian President Joko Widodo says he has delivered a message from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Widodo met the Ukrainian president on a visit to Kyiv yesterday and has been in Moscow today for a meeting with Putin. ""I conveyed President Zelensky's message to President Putin,"" Widodo said after the Moscow talks. He did not reveal what the message said but added he's expressed his ""readiness"" to help start communication between the two leaders. Widodo said Indonesia will continue to co-operate with Russia, and in turn Putin told reporters that Russia is ready to fulfil Indonesia's need for fertilisers - the supply of which has been affected by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The Indonesian leader is the current president of the G20 group of nations and a member of a United Nations crisis group set up to address the threat of global hunger resulting from the war. Widodo has invited Zelensky to the November G20 summit in Bali. AFP reports the Ukrainian president told Widodo his attendance would depend on who else was there - Russia is a member of the G20 and as such Putin would be expected to attend. Joko Widodo met Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday... Aiden Aslin (left) and Shaun Pinner (centre) were sentenced alongside Moroccan national Brahim Saaudun Russia has been told to prevent the execution of two Britons who were capturedwhile fighting for Ukraine, by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin were sentenced by a Russian proxy  court -which is not internationally recognised - in eastern Ukraine earlier this month. In an emergency ruling, the ECHR said Russia must ensure the death penalty is not carried out, but Russia has dismissed the call for the men to be spared. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""You know that Russia no longer complies with the requirements of the ECHR,"" in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency. He added that the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Earlier this month, the family ofMr Aslin said he had been told that the execution would be carried out. Chris MasonPolitical editor, reporting from Madrid After a public and pretty noisy debate over defence spending
in the last couple of days, there was a striking sentence in UK Prime
Minister Boris Johnson's opening address at his news conference here at the Nato summit in Madrid. ""The logical conclusion of the investments we propose to
embark, these decisions, is that we'll reach 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the
decade,"" he announced. This is well above the 2% demanded by Nato of its members
and I'm told the goal could mean an extra Â£55bn in total for
defence, based on current projections of how the economy might grow over the
next eight years. Other sources acknowledge though that the precise number
can't be known, nor the final costs of various projects or the big decision
points between now and then - what are known as spending reviews. But the prime minister will hope it can help quell at least
some of the public grumbling from those claiming his words and promises don't always match. Lysychansk residents are trying to leave the city for safety by train The city of Lysychansk ""suffers from endless air strikes"", according to the governor of Luhansk region,  Serhiy Haidai. He says in a post on Telegram the Russians are using ""almost all their forces"" to try to capture the city, which is in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region. It stands across the river Siversky Donets from Severodonetsk, which has come under full Russian control in recent days after weeks of fighting. Haidai says ""there is a lot of destruction"" in Lysychansk, the police department has been destroyed and the city's oil refinery damaged. ""It is difficult to find a safe place in the city,"" Haidai says. ""People dream of at least half an hour of silence, but the occupiers do not stop firing from all available weapons."" He says it is difficult to get to and from the city, with roads to Lysychansk ""littered with shell fragments"", and the Russians trying to take control of the highway linking the city with Bakhmut, about 50km away. Many residents who want to leave the city are aiming to do so by train. He says despite this, there are attempts to bring food into the city but adds residents can only access water when it is delivered by the emergency services. Â© 2025 BBC.

Will indyref2 be a re-run of 2014?,"Scotland voted to stay in the UK by 55% to 45% in the 2014 independence referendum Dust off the placards. Unpack the soapbox. Grab your cagoule. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has fired the starting gun in another referendum campaign â so here we go, right? Not so fast. Many supporters of independence describe the run up to the 2014 poll - whenScotland voted to stick with the UKby 55% to 45% - as exhilarating and optimistic. Plenty of their opponents recall feelings of exclusion and sadness. Either way, it is hard to deny that politics came alive that year. For a while the nation crackled with energy as campaigners for and against independence debated poverty and pensions in the nation's parks and plazas. BBC iPlayer - Independence: Why Scotland could vote again Is indyref2 Nicola Sturgeon's biggest political gamble? Some of that enthusiasm persists in regular pro-independence marches and the occasional show of solidarity for the union but the nation is no longer in full-on campaign mode. And even if the Scottish government is able to persuade the UK Supreme Court of its right to hold a referendum - a long shot according to some eminent legal scholars - an exact repeat of 2014 does not seem very likely. Too much has changed. For a start both teams, for and against independence, have splintered. Labour's reputation was damaged by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Conservatives in the Better Together campaign to keep Scotland in the Union. It is very hard to imagine such a cross-party coalition being formed again. Former First Minister Alex Salmond and his successor Nicola Sturgeon are no longer in the same party Their opponents in the Yes Scotland camp have fallen out too, about vision, strategy and tactics, a divide most obvious in the rift between Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond who now leads a separate pro-independence party, Alba. It's not just the players who have evolved since 2014 though. So has the script. A pandemic, a cost of living crisis, war in Ukraine and Brexit have all scrambled the discourse about Scotland's future. While the UK voted to leave by 52% to 48% Scotland voted to remain by 62% to 38%. Independence: Why Scotland could vote again Scottish independence: Is there a mandate for another referendum? Scottish independence: 19 October 2023 proposed as date for referendum The first minister contends that being removed from the European Union against Scotland's will strengthens the democratic case for independence. Scotland is ""not a region questioning its place in a larger unitary state"" she argues but ""a country in a voluntary union of nations"". Of course many of her opponents contend that Brexit weakens the economic case for independence on the grounds that if Scotland were readmitted to the EU it would have to erect a hard border with its largest trading partner â England. Leaving that aside for a moment though, what about the fundamental principle? Does Scotland in fact have a right to leave the Union? Margaret Thatcher speaking at the Conservative conference in 1981 In her 1993 memoirs The Downing Street Years Margaret Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979 - 1990, appeared to accept that it did, writing: ""As a nation, [the Scots] have an undoubted right to national self-determination; thus far they have exercised that right by joining and remaining in the Union. Should they determine on independence no English party or politician would stand in their way, however much we might regret their departure."" The current Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who draws heavy criticism from many Scottish voters for both his policies and his morals, has taken a different tack, repeatedly insisting that now is not the time for another referendum. But Ciaran Martin, the former senior UK civil servant who negotiated the Edinburgh Agreement which formed the basis for the 2014 referendum, now professor of government at Oxford University, draws a distinction between the political argument for Scottish self-determination and the legal case. ""The Supreme Court can absolutely say there's no mechanism to consult the Scottish people on independence without Westminster's consent,"" says Prof Martin. However he adds, if Downing Street refuses to describe another path for Scotland to secede ""you have to give up the pretence that this is a voluntary union, that Scotland is allowed to leave."" Prof Sir Tom Devine has written several books including The Scottish Nation 1700 to 2000 Of course it was not the Scottish people who hitched their wagon to England and Empire in the first place. The historianProf Sir Tom Devine,externalhas described the Scottish nobles who took the decision as ""the elite of an elite,"" an electorate representing 0.06 per cent of the population. It is also true that the Scottish economy was in dire straits after the debacle of the Darien Scheme, a disastrous attempt to establish a colony on the isthmus of Panama which links Central and South America, and bridges the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Nonetheless there was a vote in the Scottish Parliament and the nobles did indeed choose union, which took effect on 1 May 1707. Gradually this United Kingdom grew even closer - trading together, building an empire together and fighting wars together. But long before anyone had heard the word Brexit the relationship was under strain. In the 1960s the US and the UK stationed nuclear weapons on the Clyde, less than 30 miles from Glasgow, bringing jobs but also generating moral outrage. In the 1970s North Sea oil boomed. Energy firms made fortunes and the UK Treasury raked in millions in taxation. But with most of the UK's oil off Scottish shores its discovery fuelled a nationalist movement which wanted all Scots to share in the spoils. The 1980s were the decade of Mrs Thatcher, a Tory prime minister supported by most English voters but rejected by most Scots. Her decision to pioneer the controversial poll tax in Scotland combined with her strategy of forcing old industries to change or die drove many Scottish voters into the arms of her political opponents. Even the arrival of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999 did not ""kill nationalism stone dead"" as Labour's George (now Lord) Robertson had hoped it would. Instead support for independence remained more or less steady and eventually began to rise. ""The parliament took a lot of the sting out of being Scottish and that was really good,"" said the writer and commentator Fiona Rintoul, ""but it set up a scenario where if there was a different government in Westminster...there was going to be a clash."" The decline of the Labour party is a key feature of Scottish politics in the 21st Century, arguably both symptom and cause of the rise in nationalist sentiment. Tony Blair enjoyed a close working relationship with President George W Bush Chris Deerin, Scotland Editor of the New Statesman, argues that in the later years of Tony Blair's 1997-2007 premiership the SNP under Alex Salmond spotted that Labour was becoming fatigued and pounced. ""In a sense they were offering a like-for-like replacement to the Labour Party,"" he said, but further to the left and ""more optimistic."" This shift was accelerated by Mr Blair's decision to join the United States in invading Iraq which was ""the final straw"" for some Labour activists in their move towards embracing independence, according to Mr Deerin. He remains persuaded that there is a strong case for Scotland to stick with the Union, involving the ""common sense"" redistribution of resources within the UK and a seat at the top tables of international institutions but he also worries that Britain has become a ""transactional"" affair, weakening its attraction. Ms Rintoul sees Scotland drifting away from its neighbour, and approves of the direction of travel. ""A result of 45% of people voting to completely overturn the status quo in a non-wartime situation is not a ringing endorsement for the status quo,"" she said, adding that since then Brexit and the pandemic have meant that ""Scottish politics has completely decoupled from British politics."" The turmoil of the past few years has certainly reshaped the debate about Scotland's future. It has generated thorny questions about currency, borrowing, benefits and borders, tax and trade, nuclear weapons and energy. Of course there are options for Scotland other than independence and the Union. After 2014 the Scottish Parliament's tax and benefits powers were expanded and a Labour commission led by the former prime minister Gordon Brown is currently considering whether to go even further, perhaps even advocating a federal UK. For now though, 315 years after the Union was formed; 25 years since Scotland voted for devolution; and eight years on from choosing to remain in the UK, it's independence which still dominates the national conversation. It's just not clear at the moment if or when that conversation will spill out onto the streets in another full-on campaign.

A unique friendship group, forged in the shared experience of being caught up in France's worst peace-time attack six years ago, when Islamist jihadists killed 130 people at locations across Paris, including bars, restaurants, the national football stadium and the Bataclan concert hall. Later on Wednesday, some of thepotageswill file into a specially built courtroom in Paris, to hear verdicts handed down to 20 men accused of involvement in those attacks in November 2015. It is the end of a marathon nine-month process that has left its mark on France. ""The end of the trial is going to mark a new beginning,"" one of the potages, David Fritz Goeppinger, told me. ""I'm not sure how to feel about it."" For him, the most important part of the trial was the testimony of hundreds of victims, including his own. ""For the first time, justice heard us [and] something shifted,"" he said. ""I shared some details that I never shared in my book, or with my wife. I needed to share the entirety of what happened."" David, a photographer, was one of the last hostages to escape the Bataclan that night. He's spent most of the past year taking portraits of victims, police officers, even the former French president, FranÃ§ois Hollande, as they turned up to testify at court. ""For me, it was very, very important not to be passive,"" he said. ""As a victim, going through nine months of the trial, with all that psychological pain, I needed to take the bull by the horns."" Arthur DÃ©nouveaux (L) and Philippe Duperron both run groups for victims of the Paris attacks One of the witnesses David photographed at court was his friend, Arthur DÃ©nouveaux, who escaped from the Bataclan shortly after the gunmen entered, and now heads the victims support group Life for Paris. ""I feel relieved that the trial existed,"" Arthur told me. ""I found some answers. But more than that, I feel a bit disgusted about November 13th, in a sense that we've gone into so much detail that now I'm not really interested in talking about it anymore - and I think that's the best part."" As well as the victims themselves, David has taken portraits of defence lawyers, victims' lawyers, court reporters, expert witnesses, and a member of the band that was playing in the Bataclan on the night of the attacks. The one group he has never asked to photograph is the defendants themselves. The key defendant in this trial is Salah Abdeslam, believed to be the only surviving attacker from the night. Prosecutors have requested life in prison without parole for him, and two others. ""I had only ever seen him on TV and suddenly there he was, in real life,"" David said. ""I remember telling myself, 'Oh, I'm bigger than him.'"" A court sketch shows Salah Abdeslam standing (far R) alongside the other 13 defendants in court this week In his closing statement this week, Salah Abdeslam apologised to victims and said his thinking had ""evolved"" since he first stridently introduced himself to the court as a soldier for the so-called Islamic State group at the start of the trial. ""I made mistakes, it's true,"" he said in his closing remarks to the judges. ""But I'm not a murderer, I'm not a killer - and if you convict me, you will be committing an injustice."" ""It was very brutal, hearing [Salah Abdeslam] say to the court that he was a soldier [of Islamic State],"" David said, ""I thought about taking a picture of him, but I don't know if it's my place to do that. I can't be the victim and also the photographer."" PROFILES: Who were the 130 people killed? TIMELINE: What happened that night in Paris PARIS TRIAL: Survivors describe haunting memories The shift between observer and participant has sometimes been a difficult one for David. Last October, the court played a previously unheard audio recording of one of three attackers inside the Bataclan concert hall. ""The first who gets up, I shoot. The first one who moves, I put a bullet in his head. Is that clear? Whoever tries to be a vigilante, I will kill him. Is that understood?"" The sound recorder was meant to capture the atmosphere of the concert. Instead, it recorded David's exchange with one of the gunmen as they took him and a dozen others hostage. Hearing the recording in court ""changed everything"", David said. ""Because [in that moment] it wasn't just me talking to the terrorist: justice was listening, and the court was listening. It created a tunnel from the Bataclan attack that night to today, and for me that was the most healing experience of all."" Getting the court to agree to play the tape was a months-long battle, led by his friend Arthur DÃ©nouveaux. David (L), seen here with Arthur DÃ©nouveaux, says he has developed friendships from ""something painful"" ""We had psychiatrists saying, 'I'm not sure it's a good idea.' We had lawyers worrying about consequences. We had the court saying, 'maybe it'll be too traumatic',"" Arthur told me. ""And we were saying we can do this. We know what we want."" On the day the audio was played, Arthur says, more victims came to court than during Salah Abdeslam's testimony. ""It proved we were right,"" he says. Of all the hundreds of portraits that David has taken throughout the trial, his favourite is a group shot of thepotages. Seven men and women, who met as hostages, bundled into the upper corridors of the Bataclan, unsure whether they would ever make it out alive. David himself is in the picture, on the far-left-hand side. ""The trial has brought home to me that the friendships I've grown in the last six years came from something painful,"" he said. I ask how his life will be different once the trial is over, and the verdicts are out. ""Technically nothing will change,"" he told me. ""But in our minds, we'll remember that we went through those nine months together. And for the first time, we'll know that we are not alone.""
