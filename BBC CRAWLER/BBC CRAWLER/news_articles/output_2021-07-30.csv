Dina Asher-Smith, Team GB's poster girl of the Games, failed to make the 100m final, and then announced she would be withdrawing from the 200m because of a torn hamstring. Her interview was heartbreaking. The 100m final, the blue riband event, took place later on with a stellar line-up, featuring GB's Daryll Neita. Elaine Thompson-Herah won in a new Olympic record, defending her title from Rio 2016. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson completed a Jamaican one-two-three. In boxing, Great Britain's Karriss Artingstall claimed Olympic bronze in Tokyo after a narrow defeat by Japan's Sena Irie in the semi-finals. She was denied the chance to fight for gold as Irie edged a 3-2 split-decision win at the Kokugikan Arena. Artingstall's flat-mate Lauren Price will also return home with a medal after a dominant win over Panama's Atheyna Bylon earlier on Saturday. The Welsh middleweight won 5-0 to guarantee at least a bronze and book a place in Friday's semi-finals, where she will face Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands. The Olympic debutant is the number one seed having won gold at the 2019 World Championships and the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Price is the fourth member of GB's boxing team for Tokyo 2020 to guarantee a medal, after Artingstall,Pat McCormack and Ben Whittaker. Women's RS:X There was a medal on the waves as GB windsurferEmma Wilson won bronzeon her Olympics debut. The 22-year-old was already guaranteed a medal after winning four of her 12 races heading into Saturday's final, but gold was taken by China's Lu Yunxiu while Rio 2016 champion Charline Picon of France took silver. Wilson's mother, Penny, was world windsurfing champion in 1986, 1990 and 1991, and represented Great Britain at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics. Men's singles In tennis, Novak Djokovic wasn't a happy man.

That triathlon gold was quickly followed by more gold in the pool, as Kathleen Dawson, Adam Peaty, James Guy and Anna Hopkinwon the inaugural 4x100m mixed medley relayin a world-record time. That was Team GB's fourth swimming gold in Tokyo, the first time the swimming team have won four Olympic golds in 113 years. Triathlon mixed relay Saturday got off to a blistering start as GB - Jessica Learmonth, Jonny Brownlee, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yee -won the inaugural triathlon mixed relay. It meant a triumphant Games farewell for Brownlee, who secured his first gold in his third and likely final Olympics. He now has gold, silver and bronze medals from three Olympics. ""The Olympics?

Man sentenced for Prof Chris Whitty park assaultLewis Hughes says he lost his job after assaulting England's chief medical officer in central London.London,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident at about 19:20 BST on 27 June A man has been sentenced for assaulting England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty in central London. Lewis Hughes, 24, from Romford, east London, admitted one charge of assault by beating Prof Whitty in St James's Park on 27 June. He was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years, and a fine of Â£100. Jonathan Chew, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex pleaded not guilty to the same charge of assault by beating. Footage, which was shared on social media, showed two men grabbing Prof Whitty, who struggled to free himself. Hughes was ""unreservedly apologetic"" for the distress caused to Prof Whitty in what had been ""10 seconds of complete and utter madness"", Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Lewis Hughes was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years Prof Whitty described being put into a loose headlock by Hughes and had tried to break free from two men, the court heard. Addressing Hughes, Judge Paul Goldspring said: ""He (Prof Whitty) goes about his very difficult job without the expectation [of] yobs like you accosting him, assaulting him and then to compound it all, he is further humiliated by the video posted. ""I recognise that you did not post it on the internet"". Jonathan Chew pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and will go on trial in November During the same hearing, Mr Chew also denied a second charge of obstructing a police constable in execution of his duty. He was granted bail and was asked to appear at the same court on 23 November for trial where Prof Whitty will be called to give evidence. Prosecutor Luke Staton told the court that England's chief medical officer initially did not want to make a complaint, but when the footage was posted online he pursued the matter. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation after the incident, and officers carried out a welfare check on Prof Whitty, who did not suffer any injuries. Kalsoom Shah, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said Hughes showed ""little regard"" for Prof Whitty or social distancing rules ""when he accosted the government's chief medical officer in the street"". ""His behaviour was both shocking and disgraceful,"" she said. Hughes' barrister, Laurie-Anne Power told the court that her client had recognised Prof Whitty from the television and that he wanted a selfie for his mum. He would have done the same thing if he had seen Justin Bieber in the park, the court heard.

Drug deaths in Scotland reach new record level,"This video can not be played Scottish drug deaths: 'We need more drug users in treatment' More than 1,300 people died of drug misuse in Scotland last year, with the country seeing a record number of deaths for the seventh year in a row. The annual figures showed that there were 1,339 drug deaths last year - an increase of 75 from the 1,264 recorded the previous year. It means Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe. And its rate is more than three-and-a-half times that of England and Wales. The number of drug-related deaths has increased substantially over the past 20 years and is now almost three times higher than it was a decade ago, with the upward trend accelerating since 2013. Five ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis I want my sonâs funeral to be a drug death warning Â£250m pledge to tackle Scots drug deaths 'disgrace' Men were 2.7 times as likely to have a drug-related death than women last year, after adjusting for age. Almost two thirds of the deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54, with the average age increasing from 32 to 43 over the past two decades. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had the highest rate of all health board areas at 30.8 deaths per 100,000 people, followed by Ayrshire and Arran and Tayside with rates of 27.2 and 25.7 respectively. And people in the most deprived parts of the country were 18 times more likely to have a drug-related death as those in the least deprived. The gap has widened significantly since the start of the century, when deaths were 10 times higher in the most deprived areas. Some 93% of the deaths reported in 2020 were as a result of accidental overdoses, while 4% were considered deliberate self-poisoning. The figures showed 1% of deaths were as a result of long-term drug abuse, while 2% were undetermined. More than one drug was found to be present in the body of 93% of those who died, suggesting that many of the deaths were caused by Scotland's ""polydrug"" habit - mixing dangerous street drugs with alcohol and prescription pills. Opiates such as heroin and methadone were implicated in 1,192 deaths while benzodiazepines such as diazepam and etizolam were implicated in 974. Gabapentin or pregabalin were present in the bodies of 502 people who died, and cocaine in 459. There have been large increases in the numbers of deaths where ""street"" benzodiazepines, such as etizolam, were involved in recent years, from 58 in 2015 to 879 last year. The fake Valium - that sells for as little as 50p - is many times stronger than prescription drugs, and is often taken alongside other drugs such as heroin. Three people a day. The highest rate in the UK and in Europe. Looking inwards, a four-fold increase in Scottish drug deaths since the start of the century. And yet, the shock may lie in how much everyone had grimly predicted yet another record year. The pandemic undoubtedly affected addiction services but no one is arguing that, if it hadn't been for Covid, Scotland's drug problem would be solved. Poly-drug use is rife. Those succumbing will mix methadone prescriptions with heroin. They will then take benzodiazepines - likely so-called street Valium counterfeit pills pressed by gangsters and flooding communities at 50p a pop. All of these things come together to slow a person's breathing until it stops. And the poorest are worst hit - those living in a deprived community are 18 times more likely to die of an overdose than those in more affluent areas. How does Scotland tackle this? The Scottish government hopes the investment of Â£250m into innovations such as Naloxone - the overdose reversal drug - and alternatives to methadone may turn the oil tanker around, but it may take time. New treatment standards for addiction services should also have an effect, though questions remain over why these hadn't been in place before. There is a clamour for more radical action now - calls for rights to recovery, more investment in rehab services and big questions for the UK government at Westminster too, over the effectiveness of its 50-year-old Misuse of Drugs Act. But overall, there is now a bitter acknowledgement that those accessing these health services were for too long neglected and underserved. That acknowledgement will be of little comfort to the families of the lost. Opposition parties say cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes by the Scottish government have had a big part to play in the upward trend in the number of deaths in recent years. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously admitted that the number of deaths was ""indefensible"" and ""a national disgrace"", and that her government had not done enough to tackle the problem. The Scottish government has pledged to spend an extra Â£250m over the next five years in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths, including Â£20m a year on increasing the number of residential rehabilitation beds across the country. TheScottish Drug Death Taskforce,external, which was set up in 2019, has also been working to increase the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. Almost two-thirds of ambulance crews are now able to distribute it to people who might need it, and to train them in its use. Responding to the latest figures, Ms Sturgeon tweeted that the number of lives lost to drugs continued to be unacceptable. She said the government ""does not shirk the responsibility"" and is determined to make changes that will save lives, but said the figures predate the actions it had set out at at the start of the year. Public health minister Joe Fitzpatricklost his jobshortly after last year's figures were published, with Ms Sturgeon creating a new post of drugs minister for Angela Constance. Ms Constance said the latest figures were ""heart-breaking"" and that the government was ""working hard to get more people into the treatment that works for them as quickly as possible"". She also announced that data on suspected drug deaths will be published quarterly from September of this year, to ""ensure we can react more quickly and effectively to this crisis and identify any emerging trends"". Ms Constance and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both attended a vigil in Glasgow on Friday that was held to commemorate those who have lost their lives to drugs. Kane Duffy say he can contribute to society now he has turned his life around Kane Duffy, from Edinburgh, has stayed clear of drugs for the last 14 years. He started using heroin when he was 14 and was on a methadone prescription until his early 30s. The 44-year-old broke free from drug use after a stay at the NHS-funded Lothian and Edinburgh Abstinence Project (Leap). He now works as a specialist therapist at the Castle Craig rehab clinic. He said: ""All the time that I had taken from services, everything I was prescribed, every time the police had to intervene in my lifeâ¦ all of these things amount to a huge amount of money. ""I still don't like paying my council taxâ¦ but now I do pay my council tax. I pay my parking fines when I get them. ""I give back to society directly through the work I do and the taxes I provide. I don't cost the state anything now."" Mr Ross said a ""united national effort"" was now needed to tackle the drug deaths crisis, and called on Ms Sturgeon to back his party's proposal for aRight to Recovery Bill,external. The bill, which has been developed with recovery and treatment experts, would enshrine in law that everyone can access the treatment they need, including a residential rehabilitation place. Mr Ross said: ""The drugs crisis is our national shame. It is a stain on Scotland that so many of our most vulnerable people have been left without hope, crushed by a system that is thoroughly broken. ""This is not a day for political posturing but it is a simple fact that the government's small steps are not cutting it. The crisis is getting worse and spiralling out of control."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the deaths were the ""tragic consequences of years of failure to get to grips with this growing crisis in Scotland and to address the threat posed by drugs"". He added: ""We have the same drugs laws as the rest of the UK but three-and-a-half times the rate of drugs deaths. ""We can and must act now, by investing in a range of services and delivering truly person-centred treatment and recovery."" And the Scottish Greens said the approach to drugs by both the Scottish and UK government was wrong, and said it was time to on restoring people's dignity and treating their addiction, rather than criminalising them"".

Israel accuses Iran over deadly oil tanker attack,"Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid blamed the incident on ""Iranian terrorism"" Israel has accused Iran of being behind an attack on an oil tanker in which two crew members - a British national and a Romanian citizen - were killed. The MV Mercer Street, operated by the London-based company Zodiac Maritime, was off Oman's coast in the Arabian Sea when the incident occurred on Thursday. The company, which belongs to Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer, said it was working to establish what had happened. Iran has not commented on the Israeli foreign minister's allegations. In a statement on Friday, Yair Lapid blamed ""Iranian terrorism"". ""Iran is not just an Israeli problem,"" Mr Lapid said, adding: ""The world must not be silent."" However, details of the attack on the Liberian-flagged, Japanese-owned tanker remain unclear. The incident appears to be a serious escalation in tensions in the region, and some reports suggest that a drone was involved. A spokesperson for the UK government said it was also trying to ""urgently establish the facts"". ""Our thoughts are with the loved ones of a British national who has died following an incident on a tanker off the coast of Oman,"" the statement said. It added that vessels ""must be allowed to navigate freely in accordance with international law"". In a statement on Friday, Zodiac Maritime announced the two deaths with ""profound sadness"". It said no other injuries had been reported. The company added that the vessel was now ""sailing under the control of her crew"" and heading to a safe location with a US naval escort. The undeclared ""shadow war"" between Israel and Iran appears to be hotting up. There have been several attacks in recent months on both Israeli and Iranian-operated vessels, with both countries trading accusations and denials. But this attack marks a significant escalation with its human casualties. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapad called for a tough response and said he was in consultation with his British counterpart Dominic Raab, and that the issue would be taken to the UN. An Iranian Arabic-language television station quoted unnamed sources saying the attack was revenge for an alleged Israeli attack on an airport in Syria, an ally of Iran's. An unnamed Israeli official said it would be hard for Israel to turn a blind eye to the attack. EXPLAINED: Iran and Israel's shadow war The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) naval authority said it was investigating the incident, which occurred near the Omani island of Masirah, and confirmed that ""coalition forces"" were assisting the vessel. The US state department said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports and was ""monitoring the situation closely"". The tanker had been travelling in the northern Indian Ocean to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. According to Zodiac Maritime, it had no cargo on board at the time of the incident. A number of previous incidents have been reported on both Israeli and Iranian-owned ships in the area. Vessels have been damaged in these incidents, but casualties are rare.

Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis,"Street Valium is also known as Street Blues Scotland's latest drug death figures are to be published on Friday - with the country expected to still have the highest rate in Europe. Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick lost his job after figures released last year showed that 1,264 people died in 2019, which was even worse than the year before. In January, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced Â£250m in extra funding over five years to tackle the rising number of fatalities after admitting that her government should have done more. But almost three years after the deaths were declared a public health emergency, what can be done to tackle the problem? Opposition parties have accused the Scottish government of cutting rehab programmes in previous years, which they say has had a big part to play in the recent upward trend in the number of deaths. There are currently 408 rehab beds in Scotland, with the Scottish government pledging to spend Â£20m a year for the next five years to increase that number across the country. Castle Craig rehab clinic, aprivate hospital,externalnear West Linton in the Scottish Borders, has treated people for alcohol and drug addiction for 30 years. Of its current patient list of 60, only two are NHS-funded. Around a quarter of its clients are Dutch - reflecting the value placed on its services by insurers in the Netherlands - with the remainder being privately funded or via health insurance. The facility's medical director, Prof Jonathan Chick, said the proportion of Scottish patients - particularly those funded by the Scottish NHS - has fallen in recent years. The weekly cost of treatment at the clinic ranges starts from Â£2,500, which Prof Chick said was out of the reach of most families - but not out of the reach of health services. Castle Craig currently has 60 patients but only two are funded by the NHS He told BBC Scotland: ""They are providing quite expensive treatments for years and years and not looking at other opportunities."" Several frontline charities and critics of the Scottish government's approach to tackling the crisis have backed the Scottish Conservatives'Right to Recovery Bill,external. The Tories say it will enshrine in law individuals' right to their chosen drug treatment, including residential rehabilitation services, which the party says would help get people off drugs and recover rather than simply managing their addictions. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This proposal has the backing of frontline groups and experts across the political spectrum. SNP MSPs are reportedly on board privately. We only need the government to wake up, stop stalling and support it."" Drugs minister Angela Constance said the government was working hard to get more people into treatment that works for them as quickly as possible. She added: ""Without treatment, there is little hope of recovery so we are funding as many community and third-sector initiatives as we can so that individuals have the widest possible choice and can opt for the support which suits them and their family."" Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opiate overdose if used in time The Scottish government set up a drugs deaths taskforce in response to the crisis, which met for the first time in September 2019. It has spent time gathering evidence and proposing changes that it says could quickly save lives. The main focus of this has been the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. Users often die because they are unable to breathe and, if used in time, Naloxone can restore breathing and save their lives. Drug campaigners have been trying to get the kits into the hands of anyone who might have or be a witness to a drug overdose. This is mainly drug users and relatives but could also be anyone involved in services such as hostels or outreach workers. Almost two-thirds of ambulance crews - who have been using Naloxone for many years - are now also able to distribute it to people who might need it, with the remainder due to be trained by the end of this year. Police Scotland has also run a pilot projectfor its officers to carry Naloxone while on patrol. The most significant harm reduction services are methadone and buprenorphine which are offered to heroin addicts to reduce the risk of fatal overdose. Methadone is controversial because it has been implicated in more drug-related deaths than heroin, the drug it is a substitute for. Experts point out that methadone is recognised by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine but say it is not always delivered effectively. David Liddell, of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said there was a ""massive issue"" around people on too low doses. ""We estimated around half of those on methadone are on too low a dose, so what is happening for individuals is they are then forced to top-up on street drugs,"" he said. ""That's fuelling the poly-drug use problem that we have and leading to deaths as a result."" He also said there were problems around access to methadone services and retention of drug users within treatment. He said some countries such as Norway had a policy of ""no unplanned discharges"" and they would actively seek to bring people back into treatment. Earlier this month, it was announced that Buvidal - an alternative to methadone that contains buprenorphine - wouldbe rolled outacross the country after a successful trial in prisons. It allows patients to receive an injection every 28 days instead of having to visit a chemist every day to take their medication. It is hoped this will allow patients to focus on improving their lives and overall health rather than managing their dependence. Scotland's new drug tsar has called for a public health approach All the experts who gave evidence to Westminster's Scottish affairs committee said the stigma around drug addiction was stopping people seeking treatment. Prof Matheson said the people who needed help were the ""most marginalised in Scottish society"". She said they were not willing, interested or engaged with services because they were stigmatised and did not want to come forward. Prof Matheson said only about 40% of people who needed treatment were getting it. She said: ""They don't want to go to their GP if they have health problems, they feel stigmatised if they have a criminal record and they are stigmatised about getting work. ""This is keeping people excluded from the help and the care they need."" Prof Matheson said that, as a result, older drug users - who have a range of respiratory, cardiac, liver and kidney issues - were not seeking treatment and were physically more vulnerable to an overdose. Denmark is among the countries to have introduced fix rooms It is now more than four years since Glasgow City Council first proposed allowing users to take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility in the city. The idea is to encourage users who inject heroin or cocaine on Glasgow's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It is hoped the special room would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. The so-called ""fix rooms"" are already operating in some overseas countries but this would be the first of its kind in the UK. They have the support of the Scottish government but drug laws are reserved to Westminster. The House of Commons committee that investigated Scotland's drug crisisrecommended new legislation to provide for safe drug consumption facilitiesbut it was rejected in the UK government's response to its report. The UK government said: ""We want to do all we can to stop people having access to drugs that could ultimately kill them. No illegal drug-taking can be assumed to be safe and there is no safe way to take them."" Glasgow announced Scotland's first scheme giving drug addicts diamorphine, a pharmaceutical-grade form of heroin, in November 2019. The Enhanced Drug Treatment Service (EDTS) aims to use the medically-licensed drug to treat patients with the most severe, long-standing and complex addictions.Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis They will have to attend the clinic, which has been licensed by the Home Office, twice a day, every day. It is hoped the facility will help reduce street drug use, overdose deaths and the spread of HIV in the city. The Daily Record is campaigning for decriminalisation of drug use The Daily Record newspaper launched a campaign two years agocalling for the decriminalisation of drug use.,external It said Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Canada and, most notably, Portugal were among 25 nations to loosen the punitive attitude to drug possession to enable treatment programmes to succeed. The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) has alsorecently calledfor the Scottish and UK governments to seriously consider decriminalising drug possession. Changing the law to ""decriminalise"" does not mean class A drugs would be legal, but people would not be prosecuted for possession for personal use. All UK drugs misuse legislation is currently reserved to Westminster. The 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act bans the possession, supply, manufacture, import and export of controlled drugs except by licence. A cross-party Westminster committee - chaired by SNP MP Pete Wishart but including four Conservative MPs, three Labour members, two Lib Dems and two other SNP MPs - found that decriminalisation was a ""public health"" approach that could cut the stigma around problem drug use and encourage people to seek treatment. Schemes elsewhere channel drug addicts committing low level crimes into treatment instead of jail. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson called for radical reform, saying politicians should have the ""confidence and courage"" to decriminalise. He said the criminal justice process was actually pushing people into a place where there was more harm. The woman leading the Scottish government's drugs taskforce, Prof Catriona Matheson, told BBC Scotland the evidence for decriminalisation was strong. She said: ""It is about not putting these marginalised drug users into prison because that further marginalises them and that makes the recovery all the more difficult."" The UK government later rejected the report's recommendation to reform the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act and decriminalise drugs for personal use. It said decriminalisation would not ""eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence"". It added: ""There is a strong link between drugs and crime, which is why we reject the assertion that the Department for Health and Social Care should lead on drug misuse. We know that people who regularly use heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine are estimated to commit around 45% of all acquisitive crime."" The Scottish Greens have called for both the UK and Scottish governments to admit that the so-called ""war on drugs"" has failed, and to instead focus on ""restoring people's dignity and treating their addiction, rather than criminalising them"".

"Israel accuses Iran over deadly oil tanker attackThe country's foreign minister blames ""Iranian terrorism"" for an attack that left two people dead.Middle EastMan sentenced for Prof Chris Whitty park assaultLewis Hughes says he lost his job after assaulting England's chief medical officer in central London.London","Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid blamed the incident on ""Iranian terrorism"" Israel has accused Iran of being behind an attack on an oil tanker in which two crew members - a British national and a Romanian citizen - were killed. The MV Mercer Street, operated by the London-based company Zodiac Maritime, was off Oman's coast in the Arabian Sea when the incident occurred on Thursday. The company, which belongs to Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer, said it was working to establish what had happened. Iran has not commented on the Israeli foreign minister's allegations. In a statement on Friday, Yair Lapid blamed ""Iranian terrorism"". ""Iran is not just an Israeli problem,"" Mr Lapid said, adding: ""The world must not be silent."" However, details of the attack on the Liberian-flagged, Japanese-owned tanker remain unclear. The incident appears to be a serious escalation in tensions in the region, and some reports suggest that a drone was involved. A spokesperson for the UK government said it was also trying to ""urgently establish the facts"". ""Our thoughts are with the loved ones of a British national who has died following an incident on a tanker off the coast of Oman,"" the statement said. It added that vessels ""must be allowed to navigate freely in accordance with international law"". In a statement on Friday, Zodiac Maritime announced the two deaths with ""profound sadness"". It said no other injuries had been reported. The company added that the vessel was now ""sailing under the control of her crew"" and heading to a safe location with a US naval escort. The undeclared ""shadow war"" between Israel and Iran appears to be hotting up. There have been several attacks in recent months on both Israeli and Iranian-operated vessels, with both countries trading accusations and denials. But this attack marks a significant escalation with its human casualties. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapad called for a tough response and said he was in consultation with his British counterpart Dominic Raab, and that the issue would be taken to the UN. An Iranian Arabic-language television station quoted unnamed sources saying the attack was revenge for an alleged Israeli attack on an airport in Syria, an ally of Iran's. An unnamed Israeli official said it would be hard for Israel to turn a blind eye to the attack. EXPLAINED: Iran and Israel's shadow war The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) naval authority said it was investigating the incident, which occurred near the Omani island of Masirah, and confirmed that ""coalition forces"" were assisting the vessel. The US state department said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports and was ""monitoring the situation closely"". The tanker had been travelling in the northern Indian Ocean to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. According to Zodiac Maritime, it had no cargo on board at the time of the incident. A number of previous incidents have been reported on both Israeli and Iranian-owned ships in the area. Vessels have been damaged in these incidents, but casualties are rare.

Man sentenced for Prof Chris Whitty park assaultLewis Hughes says he lost his job after assaulting England's chief medical officer in central London.LondonRussians face backlash from Olympic rivalsThe country's athletes face questions from competitors about whether they should be allowed to compete.BBC Sport,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident at about 19:20 BST on 27 June A man has been sentenced for assaulting England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty in central London. Lewis Hughes, 24, from Romford, east London, admitted one charge of assault by beating Prof Whitty in St James's Park on 27 June. He was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years, and a fine of Â£100. Jonathan Chew, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex pleaded not guilty to the same charge of assault by beating. Footage, which was shared on social media, showed two men grabbing Prof Whitty, who struggled to free himself. Hughes was ""unreservedly apologetic"" for the distress caused to Prof Whitty in what had been ""10 seconds of complete and utter madness"", Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Lewis Hughes was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years Prof Whitty described being put into a loose headlock by Hughes and had tried to break free from two men, the court heard. Addressing Hughes, Judge Paul Goldspring said: ""He (Prof Whitty) goes about his very difficult job without the expectation [of] yobs like you accosting him, assaulting him and then to compound it all, he is further humiliated by the video posted. ""I recognise that you did not post it on the internet"". Jonathan Chew pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and will go on trial in November During the same hearing, Mr Chew also denied a second charge of obstructing a police constable in execution of his duty. He was granted bail and was asked to appear at the same court on 23 November for trial where Prof Whitty will be called to give evidence. Prosecutor Luke Staton told the court that England's chief medical officer initially did not want to make a complaint, but when the footage was posted online he pursued the matter. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation after the incident, and officers carried out a welfare check on Prof Whitty, who did not suffer any injuries. Kalsoom Shah, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said Hughes showed ""little regard"" for Prof Whitty or social distancing rules ""when he accosted the government's chief medical officer in the street"". ""His behaviour was both shocking and disgraceful,"" she said. Hughes' barrister, Laurie-Anne Power told the court that her client had recognised Prof Whitty from the television and that he wanted a selfie for his mum. He would have done the same thing if he had seen Justin Bieber in the park, the court heard.

Scotland's seventh drowning victim in a week dies,"Aman Sharma had been enjoying a barbecue with friends near Loch Lubnaig shore. A man has died in hospital after being rescued from Loch Lubnaig on Sunday. Aman Sharma, 34, from Edinburgh, was the seventh person to die in a water-related incident in Scotland since last weekend. His best friend Kawaldeep Singh, who tried to save him, told the BBC Mr Sharma jumped into the water not realising how deep it was. Mr Sharma was airlifted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow where he died on Tuesday. Police Scotland said the death was not being treated as suspicious. Weekend of water deaths 'is worst in memory' Man tried to save wife and son from drowning Boy, 11, dies in river at Lanarkshire park Mr Singh said: ""He was very lovely, very friendly. He was like more than a friend to me, he was like a brother to me. I feel like I've lost my arm. ""It's been a terrible heart-breaking week and it will stay with us all of our lives."" He has warned people to take care in the water and be aware of the dangers, even in calm water. The two men, who had come to Scotland from the same part of India, met in 2012 and both worked in fast food shops. On Sunday, their day off, they took a day trip to the loch near Callander with a group of friends to enjoy the good weather. The group had a barbeque at a busy picnic area and had been paddling and sitting in shallow water at the shore. This video can not be played 'I tried but I couldn't save my friend' At one point Mr Sharma, who could not swim, jumped into the water, not realising how deep it was at that point and was quickly submerged. ""I got under him and lifted him up from his leg and his tummy because he was going badly down. I pushed him up four times,"" Mr Singh said. ""It was very deep. I came up to have a breath and he went down within my hands."" Mr Singh dived under the water again to look for his friend. ""I could not see because the lake was very deep and the water was so dark,"" he recalled. Several people who were on the shore came to help, including two nurses and a firefighter. They gave Mr Sharma CPR in an attempt to revive him when he was pulled from the loch after about 10 minutes underwater. He did not regain consciousness in hospital and died two days later with his friend by his side. Police were called to Loch Lubnaig after a 34-year-old man got into difficulty on Sunday ""I feel really bad because he was my friend, he was my brother, he was my family here,"" Mr Singh said. ""When he drowned down he was in my hands, when he passed away he was in my hands. I took him to Callander, to Lake Lubnaig, it was my car. ""I could not save him but this I can do - I can send his body back to India, his soul will be happy."" Mr Singh has set up a crowdfunding appeal to cover the cost of returning Mr Sharma's body to India where it will be cremated by his family according to Hindu tradition. It has already exceeded its Â£10,000 target with help from Mr Sharma's employers and customers at Kebab Mahal in Dalkeith. Any extra money will be shared between Mr Sharma's eight-year-old daughter in Glasgow and his family in India. Mr Singh urged people to take care in the water. ""Water looks very calm, but nature can be very dangerous,"" he said. About 15 minutes before the accident, the pair had seen the news that six people had died in the water that weekend. ""We never realised that this could happen [to us],"" said Mr Singh. ""People that are going to the water, please take it seriously... because you never know what can happen in the next five minutes."" Rescue teams have described last weekend as ""the worst in memory"" after six other people died in incidents on the water. The Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park Authority said its deepest sympathies were with Mr Sharma's friends and family. It has been holding meetings with a number of other organisations to discuss water safety measures following last weekend's deaths. Chief executive Gordon Watson said: ""The last few days have been devastating and we are thinking of all of those connected to those who have died. ""A series of urgent meetings are being held this week to reflect on these tragedies and discuss potential further actions to improve water safety. ""We are also using our communications to raise awareness of vital water safety advice, particularly around the risks of cold water shock and potential for sudden changes in the depth of water. ""We ask everyone to take a moment to read about these risks and help us spread these important messages to as many people as possible."" Edina Olahova and her nine-year year old son Rana Haris Ali, pictured with husband and father Waris Ali, died in Loch Lomond last weekend Edina Olahova, 29, her nine-year-old son, Rana Haris Ali, and their friend Muhammad Asim Riaz died in Loch Lomond near Ardlui last Saturday evening. Ms Olahova's husband Waris Ali was rescued after trying to save his wife and son. Mr Riaz's seven-year-old son was rescued and taken to hospital in Glasgow where he is in a critical condition. It came hours after the death of an 11-year-old boy in a river near Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire. A 13-year-old boy  also died in the River Clyde near Lanark on Saturday evening, while a 16-year-old boy died near the pier at Balloch Country Park on Friday.

Leg breaks to crowdfunding - Shriever's gold medal story,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Team GB's Bethany Shriever wins gold in BMX final Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Bethany Shriever can count Liam Gallagher as a fan. The ex-Oasis frontman think she's a ""ledge"" and now so too does everyone else. Hers is a name few will have heard before Friday morning but her BMX Olympic gold, and the story behind it, means it is now one that won't be forgotten in a hurry. She could barely stand after ditching her bike, moments after becoming a champion. Team-mate Kye Whyte, who himself had just won silver in the men's event, swept her up in his arms, the pair deservedly milking their moment as they became Britain's first BMX medallists. ""I'm more happy for her than I am for me,"" Whyte said. ""That girl puts in some serious serious graft."" Serious graft, and then some. For Shriever, this was a moment that looked unlikely to ever happen four years ago. After UK Sport said in 2017 it would only fund male riders for the Tokyo 2020 cycle, based on results, Shriever left the national set-up to go solo. Without that funding, she needed to find it elsewhere. Her parents helped as much as they could and she also took a part-time job as a teaching assistant, but still needed to crowdfund Â£50,000 to stand a chance of qualifying for the Olympics. ""It's been a very long and hard journey,"" she told BBC Sport. One of the images of the Games... Beth Shriever: An emotional Dotun Adebayo praises BMX gold medallist Back home in Essex, Shriever's parents - Paul and Kate - and her boyfriend, Brynley, had been up since 1:55. Her first semi-final run was delayed and so her siblings went back to bed for another 45 minutes kip. The delay didn't faze the 22-year-old though, winning all three of her semi-final runs and, when the start gate dropped in the final, she surged to the front, a lead she would never relinquish as she defeated her idol, Colombia's two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon. ""It was emotional, there was not a dry eye in the house,"" Kate told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I think it was all worth it when she got the letter to say she was going to the Olympics. Anything after that was a bonus, she just wanted to race and enjoy the experience. She has loved every minute of it. We all knew no matter what the outcome was we would be 100% proud of her."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Relive how GB's Bethany Shriever and Kye Whyte won historic BMX medals When the family video-called their daughter later, caught by BBC cameras, she was grabbing some food with Whyte, their medals on the table next to them. ""Don't let them out of your sight,"" urged Kate. But Shriever's medal isn't just hers. She was quick to thank her family, one that ""lives and breathes"" BMX racing, according to her dad. ""It's been something we've done as a family, as a unit, and it's bonded us together,"" Paul told BBC Sport. ""We've travelled around some of the world and done it all together."" There have been plenty of ups and downs along the way. She's fractured her wrist three times and, in 2014, Shriever - a former junior world champion - broke her leg, only to do it again on her first training session back. ""She landed a jump and on impact the metal rod in her leg bent and shattered her leg again,"" her mum explained. ""A lot of people had written off her at that point, she was a really good rider but to break her leg twice and be out of the game for about 18 months, but she was determined afterwards."" Even coming into the Tokyo Games, the road hadn't been smooth. She hadn't competed in 18 months owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, and earlier this year, dislocated her shoulder in training. But nothing compared to that hurdle of losing funding four years ago. ""BMX wasn't seen as something worth investing in at that time, and so we funded it and looked after Beth and put what we had behind her,"" Paul said. ""We'd do it again tomorrow. There's no regrets and there's no bad feelings towards anybody, we're just over the moon that she's kept the determination and drive to want to do as well as she can and that she's got where she is now."" In 2019, after her crowdfunding campaign, everything changed when Stephen Park, British Cycling's performance director, recognised Shriever's talent. He persuaded UK Sport to allow them to re-allocate funding, moving Shriever up to Manchester and bringing her back onto the programme. ""For Sparky to see my potential and give me a chance to be a full-time athlete shot me in the right direction,"" Shriever told BBC Sport. ""Look where I am now."" She added: ""I hope it does more for the sport now and in Great Britain. I hope we get more girls involved, and boys as well. Everyone proved that, if you commit to something and have fun doing it, you can be rewarded for it."" For Park, the hope is that Shriever's success - and that of Whyte, who hails from a Peckham housing estate - can open the doors to a new generation of cyclists. ""What we hope from a British Cycling perspective is that people can associate with a Beth Shriever or a Kye Whyte, and we're able to broaden the diversity of the participants in cycling,"" Park said. ""Whether you're all in for the Tour de France, mountain bikes, or BMX hopefully there's something for everyone and that draws more people in to the sport."" He added: ""I would very much hope that from a UK Sport perspective as well as a British Cycling perspective that the idea of trying... to inspire a wider population across our society is better addressed when we've got people winning in the different disciplines."" Shriever and Whyte's success may just be the catalyst for that new era of inspiration. If Gallagher said BMX racing was""blowing his mind"",external, then you never know who else was watching.

Amanda Knox says Damon film 'rips off' her life,"Abigail Breslin (L) is Matt Damon's on-screen daughter in the film Amanda Knox has criticised actor Matt Damon and director Tom McCarthy for ""profiting"" from her wrongful murder conviction. Damon stars in McCarthy's new film, Stillwater, which the director said was inspired by Ms Knox's legal fight. The American was jailed in Italy for four years for the murder of a British student before she was later acquitted. She said the filmmakers ""[ripped] off my story without my consent at the expense of my reputation"". The 34-year-old and her former boyfriend were twice convicted of the 2007 killing of Ms Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy. They were exonerated in 2015. McCarthy has said Ms Knox's case helped inspire his new movie's storyline. Stillwater follows Damon's character as he travels to France after his daughter is imprisoned for murdering her lover. In alengthy blog post,external, Ms Knox complained she continues to be associated with a crime she did not commit. Q&A: Kercher murder court case Amanda Knox: Figure at the centre of a saga In the film, she maintains, the character based on her is made to look as if she really did play a part in her lover's death. She accused Damon and McCarthy of ""profiting by telling a story that distorts my reputation in negative ways"". ""By fictionalising away my innocence, my total lack of involvement, by erasing the role of the authorities in my wrongful conviction, McCarthy reinforces an image of me as a guilty and untrustworthy person,"" she wrote. She said neither Damon nor McCarthy tried to speak to her while they made the film. Ms Kercher, 21, was stabbed to death in the Perugia flat she shared with Ms Knox in November 2007, in a case that made headlines around the world. This video can not be played Amanda Knox in 2019: ""I'm afraid of being framed"" Another man, Rudy Hermann Guede, born in Ivory Coast, was convicted of murder in a separate trial and given a 16-year sentence. Spotlight directorMcCarthy told Vanity Fair,externalthat, after hearing about Ms Knox, he became fascinated by what she went through. He said that his team decided to ""leave the Amanda Knox case behind"". But when making the film they agreed to keep the part about an American student getting mixed up in a crime and being jailed. The BBC has contacted Focus Features, the film's production company, for comment.

Stokes takes break from cricket for mental health,"Stokes has played in 71 Tests, 101 one-day-internationals and 34 Twenty20s for England. Ben Stokes ""will take an indefinite break from all cricket with immediate effect"" and has withdrawn from England's squad for the five-Test series against India. The all-rounder will prioritise his mental wellbeing and rest his left index finger which has not fully healed, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said in a statement. Stokes, 30, will be replaced in the squad by Somerset's Craig Overton. The Test series begins on Wednesday. ""Ben has shown tremendous courage to open up about his feelings and wellbeing,"" Ashley Giles, managing director of England men's cricket, added. ""Our primary focus has always been and will continue to be the mental health and welfare of all of our people. ""The demands on our athletes to prepare and play elite sport are relentless in a typical environment, but the ongoing pandemic has acutely compounded this. ""Spending significant amounts of time away from family, with minimal freedoms, is extremely challenging. The cumulative effect of operating almost continuously in these environments over the last 16 months has had a major impact on everyone's wellbeing. ""Ben will be given as long as he needs, and we look forward to seeing him playing cricket for England in the future."" Stokes recently captained Northern Superchargers in The Hundred The decision comes at the start of a busy period for England. Five Tests against India are quickly followed by the Twenty20 World Cup in October and November and this winter's Ashes series against Australia, which begins in December. Stokes took aperiod of compassionate leavebetween August and October last year, missing two Tests, to be with his father Ged, who died in December last year. He was rested for two Tests in Sri Lanka in January and, after returning for England's series defeat in India, missed the home Test series against New Zealand in June havingbroken his fingerplaying in the Indian Premier League Stokes returned to England duty earlier this month to captain the 50-over side against Pakistan after aCovid outbreak forced England to name an entirely new squad. Having led England to a series win against Pakistan, Stokes most recently captained Northern Superchargers in the opening two games of The Hundred. Stokes' decision comes in a week where two other global stars have spoken out abouttheir mental healthon the biggest sporting stage at the Tokyo Olympics. US gymnastSimone Bilespulled out of the team final on Tuesday to ""focus on her mental health"", saying: ""I just think mental health is more prevalent in sports right now. We have to protect our minds and our bodies and not just go out and do what the world wants us to do."" And Japan's tennis superstar Naomi Osaka said she felt ""a lot of pressure""after her shock exitfrom her home Games, saying it was ""a bit much"". It was Osaka's first tournament after withdrawing from the French Open in June, when she revealed she had ""suffered long bouts of depression"" since winning her first Grand Slam title in 2018. The ECB has requested that privacy is given to Stokes and his family during his absence from the game. England spinner Jack Leach, speaking to BBC Sport All the lads are behind Ben and supporting him where we can. He has shown courage and bravery to prioritise his mental health. He is a focal part of our team and we will miss him. His priority is to take some time out from the game to get better. We can't wait to welcome him back in the near future and see him winning games of cricket for England. Michael Carberry, ex-England batsman and former team-mate of Ben Stokes, on BBC Radio 5 Live I'm still trying to process it. Very sad. Big fan of Stokes, have been since I saw him play as a young man in county cricket. Doesn't matter what's happening. Just a case of reaching out to him as a former colleague to wish him well and a speedy recovery. Hope to see him back doing what he does best. There does seem to be an uptake of mental health issues in high-profile sportspeople. Every situation is different. Maybe it's something governing bodies have to look into. We've been dealing with Covid for a year or so and maybe there's a need for more investment into physiologists with day-to-day bubbles. Must be so hard to compete and be the best they can be in those conditions, seeing time away from family tick by in hotel rooms. Cricket has always notoriously been a sport where you spend a lot of time away from families - a huge sacrifice to be the best we can be. Being locked away in a hotel room is very different though. It'll undoubtedly have an impact on people's mental health. Test Match Special commentator and Daily Telegraph cricket writer Isabelle Westbury on BBC Radio 5 Live It's quite groundbreaking really. To think of somebody of the profile and the achievement of Ben Stokes say something quite so candid, when we associate him, I guess, with feats of great sporting prowess but also being a tough guy. For somebody like that to be able to say 'listen, I'm struggling' is momentous, but I think it's really positive as well. I think it's groundbreaking for a man - and someone who we've got a very specific idea of what they're like in our heads to say this. It will hopefully pave the way for others to say the same.

Dina Asher-Smith, Team GB's poster girl of the Games, failed to make the 100m final, and then announced she would be withdrawing from the 200m because of a torn hamstring. Her interview was heartbreaking. The 100m final, the blue riband event, took place later on with a stellar line-up, featuring GB's Daryll Neita. Elaine Thompson-Herah won in a new Olympic record, defending her title from Rio 2016. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson completed a Jamaican one-two-three. In boxing, Great Britain's Karriss Artingstall claimed Olympic bronze in Tokyo after a narrow defeat by Japan's Sena Irie in the semi-finals. She was denied the chance to fight for gold as Irie edged a 3-2 split-decision win at the Kokugikan Arena. Artingstall's flat-mate Lauren Price will also return home with a medal after a dominant win over Panama's Atheyna Bylon earlier on Saturday. The Welsh middleweight won 5-0 to guarantee at least a bronze and book a place in Friday's semi-finals, where she will face Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands. The Olympic debutant is the number one seed having won gold at the 2019 World Championships and the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Price is the fourth member of GB's boxing team for Tokyo 2020 to guarantee a medal, after Artingstall,Pat McCormack and Ben Whittaker. Women's RS:X There was a medal on the waves as GB windsurferEmma Wilson won bronzeon her Olympics debut. The 22-year-old was already guaranteed a medal after winning four of her 12 races heading into Saturday's final, but gold was taken by China's Lu Yunxiu while Rio 2016 champion Charline Picon of France took silver. Wilson's mother, Penny, was world windsurfing champion in 1986, 1990 and 1991, and represented Great Britain at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics. Men's singles In tennis, Novak Djokovic wasn't a happy man. Hemissed out on a medalin Tokyo, beaten 6-4 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 by Pablo Carreno Busta in the bronze medal match. The Serb then pulled out of his mixed doubles bronze medal match with an injury to leave Tokyo empty-handed. His poor racquet bore the brunt of his frustration. 4x100m mixed medley relay Turns out us Brits are pretty good at mixed events. That triathlon gold was quickly followed by more gold in the pool, as Kathleen Dawson, Adam Peaty, James Guy and Anna Hopkinwon the inaugural 4x100m mixed medley relayin a world-record time. That was Team GB's fourth swimming gold in Tokyo, the first time the swimming team have won four Olympic golds in 113 years. Triathlon mixed relay Saturday got off to a blistering start as GB - Jessica Learmonth, Jonny Brownlee, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yee -won the inaugural triathlon mixed relay. It meant a triumphant Games farewell for Brownlee, who secured his first gold in his third and likely final Olympics. He now has gold, silver and bronze medals from three Olympics. ""The Olympics?

Man sentenced for Prof Chris Whitty park assaultLewis Hughes says he lost his job after assaulting England's chief medical officer in central London.,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident at about 19:20 BST on 27 June A man has been sentenced for assaulting England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty in central London. Lewis Hughes, 24, from Romford, east London, admitted one charge of assault by beating Prof Whitty in St James's Park on 27 June. He was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years, and a fine of Â£100. Jonathan Chew, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex pleaded not guilty to the same charge of assault by beating. Footage, which was shared on social media, showed two men grabbing Prof Whitty, who struggled to free himself. Hughes was ""unreservedly apologetic"" for the distress caused to Prof Whitty in what had been ""10 seconds of complete and utter madness"", Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Lewis Hughes was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years Prof Whitty described being put into a loose headlock by Hughes and had tried to break free from two men, the court heard. Addressing Hughes, Judge Paul Goldspring said: ""He (Prof Whitty) goes about his very difficult job without the expectation [of] yobs like you accosting him, assaulting him and then to compound it all, he is further humiliated by the video posted. ""I recognise that you did not post it on the internet"". Jonathan Chew pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and will go on trial in November During the same hearing, Mr Chew also denied a second charge of obstructing a police constable in execution of his duty. He was granted bail and was asked to appear at the same court on 23 November for trial where Prof Whitty will be called to give evidence. Prosecutor Luke Staton told the court that England's chief medical officer initially did not want to make a complaint, but when the footage was posted online he pursued the matter. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation after the incident, and officers carried out a welfare check on Prof Whitty, who did not suffer any injuries. Kalsoom Shah, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said Hughes showed ""little regard"" for Prof Whitty or social distancing rules ""when he accosted the government's chief medical officer in the street"". ""His behaviour was both shocking and disgraceful,"" she said. Hughes' barrister, Laurie-Anne Power told the court that her client had recognised Prof Whitty from the television and that he wanted a selfie for his mum. He would have done the same thing if he had seen Justin Bieber in the park, the court heard.

'Frightening' Covid surge widens Japan's emergency,"Tokyo is seeing record cases despite being under emergency measures Japan is extending a state of emergency in Tokyo and expanding it to new regions as the Olympic Games host faces a surge in Covid-19 cases. The restrictions are being imposed in areas surrounding the capital as well as in the city of Osaka. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga warned infections were spreading at an unprecedented rate, urging the country to watch the Games from home. New cases are being fuelled by the more infectious Delta variant. ""If the increase of infection does not stop, the severe symptoms cases will increase and the medical system may possibly be further under strain,"" Mr Suga said. Earlier, Health Minister Norihisa Tamura warned that the country had entered a new, ""extremely frightening"", stage of the pandemic. ""I think that people cannot see ahead and, worrying how long this situation will last, they find it unbearable that they cannot return to normal daily life,"" Reuters quoted him as saying. Japan has had some success fighting Covid-19, keeping cases and deaths low for months, but is now seeing record cases. Daily cases nationwide topped 10,000 for the first time on Thursday, more than a third of them in the capital. Tokyo - where the Olympics are mainly taking place - has seen three straight days of record cases, even though it is already under a state of emergency. Hospitals are under increasing pressure in the city. Olympic organisers reported 27 new infections at the Games on Friday, bringing the total since the start of July to more than 200. But with strict rules in place, including a ban on spectators, organisers deny the event is driving the rise in cases. Despite this, some experts worry that holding the Olympics in such circumstances sends a confusing message to the public about the need to limit daily life. Under the state of emergency, bars and restaurants must stop serving alcohol and close early. Three regions, known in Japan as prefectures, along with Osaka, will go under the restrictions from 2-31 August, with the measures in place in Tokyo extended to the end of the month. While other countries have imposed legal restrictions on residents, in Japan people are only advised to work from home, so questions have been raised as to how effective the new measures will be. Tokyo's Governor Yuriko Koike has said the key to controlling the outbreak is young people, urging them to get vaccinated, but the BBC's Mariko Oi says this is a little unfair given the low availability of doses. Less than 30% of the population has been fully vaccinated, with officials aiming to jab all those who want a dose by October or November. Speaking to the BBC, some young Japanese people were sceptical about whether the new measures would work. ""I can sense that we are getting too used to the state of emergency, so it's not stopping people from going out,"" said one. ""If the government really wants to stop the spread of the virus, they have to lock us down and offer financial support,"" said another. Other countries in the region have also tightened rules to halt the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant,with China halting flights in NanjingandAustralia deploying troops in Sydney.

Briton killed in oil tanker attack in Arabian Sea,"Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid blamed the incident on ""Iranian terrorism"" Israel has accused Iran of being behind an attack on an oil tanker in which two crew members - a British national and a Romanian citizen - were killed. The MV Mercer Street, operated by the London-based company Zodiac Maritime, was off Oman's coast in the Arabian Sea when the incident occurred on Thursday. The company, which belongs to Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer, said it was working to establish what had happened. Iran has not commented on the Israeli foreign minister's allegations. In a statement on Friday, Yair Lapid blamed ""Iranian terrorism"". ""Iran is not just an Israeli problem,"" Mr Lapid said, adding: ""The world must not be silent."" However, details of the attack on the Liberian-flagged, Japanese-owned tanker remain unclear. The incident appears to be a serious escalation in tensions in the region, and some reports suggest that a drone was involved. A spokesperson for the UK government said it was also trying to ""urgently establish the facts"". ""Our thoughts are with the loved ones of a British national who has died following an incident on a tanker off the coast of Oman,"" the statement said. It added that vessels ""must be allowed to navigate freely in accordance with international law"". In a statement on Friday, Zodiac Maritime announced the two deaths with ""profound sadness"". It said no other injuries had been reported. The company added that the vessel was now ""sailing under the control of her crew"" and heading to a safe location with a US naval escort. The undeclared ""shadow war"" between Israel and Iran appears to be hotting up. There have been several attacks in recent months on both Israeli and Iranian-operated vessels, with both countries trading accusations and denials. But this attack marks a significant escalation with its human casualties. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapad called for a tough response and said he was in consultation with his British counterpart Dominic Raab, and that the issue would be taken to the UN. An Iranian Arabic-language television station quoted unnamed sources saying the attack was revenge for an alleged Israeli attack on an airport in Syria, an ally of Iran's. An unnamed Israeli official said it would be hard for Israel to turn a blind eye to the attack. EXPLAINED: Iran and Israel's shadow war The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) naval authority said it was investigating the incident, which occurred near the Omani island of Masirah, and confirmed that ""coalition forces"" were assisting the vessel. The US state department said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports and was ""monitoring the situation closely"". The tanker had been travelling in the northern Indian Ocean to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. According to Zodiac Maritime, it had no cargo on board at the time of the incident. A number of previous incidents have been reported on both Israeli and Iranian-owned ships in the area. Vessels have been damaged in these incidents, but casualties are rare.

'EU citizens unaware children need to apply to stay',"Citizens of the European Union, European Economic Area or Switzerland need to apply to remain in the UK Some EU nationals in Wales may not be aware they need to apply for their children to be allowed to stay in the UK, according to charities. Organisations which help applicants to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) also said some parents struggled to provide the necessary documents. The deadline for the EUSS was 30 June, but some applications are still allowed on certain grounds. A Home Office spokesperson said EUSS had been an ""overwhelming success"". The spokesperson added it was ""clear that we will take a pragmatic and flexible approach for considering cases with reasonable grounds for missing the deadline"". By 30 June - the scheme's deadline day - 98,600 had applied for the EUSS in Wales. The Home Office is still accepting late applications, and has published anon-exhaustive list of grounds for doing so,external. Those grounds include children whose parents or guardian were unaware they should apply on their behalf, individuals with a medical condition which prevented them from applying and those who did not have internet access, or access to relevant documents. Daria Grzybowska says she was unaware one of her children, who was born in Wales, needed an application Daria Grzybowska, 35, is a Polish national who has lived in Wrexham for about 10 years. She has two boys, aged seven and 11, the youngest of which was born in the UK. As a result, she was not initially aware they both needed to apply for the EUSS. ""I found out after I applied for myself that I have to do separately for them too,"" she said. ""I was surprised because I am a mother and usually when we do something they are straight away with me with every application, or things like that."" Getting the appropriate documentation for one of her boys has also been ""very difficult"", she said, since she had separated from their father and was not in touch with him. ""I don't know why we have to do this. One of the children was born here and the other has been here since he was one-and-a-half. This is their family home,"" she said. She finally turned to Wrexham's Polish Integration Support Centre (PISC), where she was referred to Newport Mind, which is funded to help applicants across Wales. Ms Grzybowska is not alone, according to Mind Newport's Donald Mutale. ""Unfortunately, we are coming across more and more children who may have been born in the UK and don't have a passport or identity document and have struggled to get one because of the pandemic - embassies not being able to offer appointments or the length of the application process to get their first passport from their country of nationality,"" he explained. ""For children in those circumstances, they are able to make a paper application, however, paper applications take significantly longer than the online applications. ""In addition, we've found that in some cases, EU, EEA and Swiss nationals are unaware that their children need to apply. In some cases, people assume that just because the child was born in the UK, that they are possibly a British national and don't need to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme."" Newport Mind is encouraging EU nationals who have not yet applied, either for themselves or their children, to make a late application and ""take this opportunity to protect their rights in the UK"". 'Worry' as EU settlement scheme deadline nears Up to 6,000 still to apply for EU settled status What happens now that a deal's been done? Other organisations are seeing the same pattern Kate Smart, CEO of Settled, which also helps EU nationals with the EUSS, said: ""Parents are coming to us each day who didn't realise children needed individual applications. ""Some parents have been told they have not provided enough evidence of continuous residency in the UK of very small children before 30 December, but in many cases that is very difficult to prove. ""This may not become a clear issue for many of these families until several years down the line."" Anna Buckley has been working with families in Wrexham to deal with the ""massive pressure"" of the settlement process The EUSS is ""not as easy as [the Home Office] present or publicise"", especially for those with criminal records or a history of homelessness, according to Anna Buckley, of PISC. She said queries about EUSS applications had put ""a massive pressure"" on the voluntary organisation. ""For example, since yesterday we've got 700 emails and part of this is [questions about] we where are with the settled status - 'are we allowed to go to the doctor' or 'are we allowed to go abroad?' There's lots of information which wasn't provided as clearly as it should [have been]."" Thousands of others, like Daria Grzybowska, are still waiting to hear whether their application has been successful. ""I'm still waiting. There's so many question I have and nobody can answer me,"" she said. A Home Office Spokesperson said that the EUSS ""has been an overwhelming success"" and that applicants' rights in the UK are protected if they made an application before 30 June. The Welsh government urged parents to use the services of organisations like Settled, which it has committed to funding for the rest of the year.

Amanda Knox criticises Damon film she inspired,"Abigail Breslin (L) is Matt Damon's on-screen daughter in the film Amanda Knox has criticised actor Matt Damon and director Tom McCarthy for ""profiting"" from her wrongful murder conviction. Damon stars in McCarthy's new film, Stillwater, which the director said was inspired by Ms Knox's legal fight. The American was jailed in Italy for four years for the murder of a British student before she was later acquitted. She said the filmmakers ""[ripped] off my story without my consent at the expense of my reputation"". The 34-year-old and her former boyfriend were twice convicted of the 2007 killing of Ms Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy. They were exonerated in 2015. McCarthy has said Ms Knox's case helped inspire his new movie's storyline. Stillwater follows Damon's character as he travels to France after his daughter is imprisoned for murdering her lover. In alengthy blog post,external, Ms Knox complained she continues to be associated with a crime she did not commit. Q&A: Kercher murder court case Amanda Knox: Figure at the centre of a saga In the film, she maintains, the character based on her is made to look as if she really did play a part in her lover's death. She accused Damon and McCarthy of ""profiting by telling a story that distorts my reputation in negative ways"". ""By fictionalising away my innocence, my total lack of involvement, by erasing the role of the authorities in my wrongful conviction, McCarthy reinforces an image of me as a guilty and untrustworthy person,"" she wrote. She said neither Damon nor McCarthy tried to speak to her while they made the film. Ms Kercher, 21, was stabbed to death in the Perugia flat she shared with Ms Knox in November 2007, in a case that made headlines around the world. This video can not be played Amanda Knox in 2019: ""I'm afraid of being framed"" Another man, Rudy Hermann Guede, born in Ivory Coast, was convicted of murder in a separate trial and given a 16-year sentence. Spotlight directorMcCarthy told Vanity Fair,externalthat, after hearing about Ms Knox, he became fascinated by what she went through. He said that his team decided to ""leave the Amanda Knox case behind"". But when making the film they agreed to keep the part about an American student getting mixed up in a crime and being jailed. The BBC has contacted Focus Features, the film's production company, for comment.

Human remains confirmed as those of missing hiker,"Esther Dingley sent this selfie at the top of a mountain on 22 November Human remains found in the Pyrenees mountains are those of missing hiker Esther Dingley, it has been confirmed. The 37-year-old, from County Durham, had been walking alone near the Spain-France border and was last seen on 22 November. Charity LBT Global, which has been representing her family,said a bone found last week matched Ms Dingley's DNA. Her mother Ria Bryant and boyfriend Dan Colegate said they were ""distraught"". Esther Dingley had been travelling across Europe with her boyfriend, Dan Colegate A joint statement said: ""We have all known for many months that the chance we would get to hug our beloved Esther again, to feel her warm hand in ours, to see her beautiful smile and to watch the room light up again whenever she arrived was tiny, but with this confirmation that small hope has now faded. It is devastating beyond words. ""At this stage, with just a single bone found and no sign of equipment or clothing in the immediate area (which has been closely searched again over several days), the details of what happened and where still remain unknown."" They said rescue teams would continue their search on foot and using drones in a bid to find her equipment ""to understand how this tragedy occurred"". Ms Dingley and Mr Colegate swapped their life in north-east England for an open-ended campervan tour of Europe in 2014. Mr Colegate was house-sitting at a French farmhouse 100 miles (160km) away when his partner of 20 years went missing on a solo hike. Ms Dingley was an experienced hiker She last spoke to him via a WhatsApp video call from atop Pic de Sauvegarde on that date. LBT Global chief executive Matthew Searle said confirmation the remains were those of Ms Dingley was ""the tragic end we have all feared"". ""This is devastating news for Esther's loved ones. Never before have I seen such incredible determination as that showed by Daniel in his relentless physical search of the mountains,"" he said. Mr Colegate used his telescope to scour distant mountains Mr Colegate walked hundreds of miles in the months since his partner's disappearance, searching the mountains for any trace of her. Earlier this monthhe told the BBC he feared she had been the victim of kidnap or an attack, saying: ""The search has now been so prolonged and so intense, that as far as I'm concerned the probability of an accident is now less than the probability of a criminal act."" LBT Global said the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Ms Dingley's death was ""still very much in its infancy"". Spanish and French police havescoured the mountains in the months since her disappearancewith no breakthrough until the remains were reported last week.

NI Protocol issues raised at north-south meeting,"Trucks arriving at Larne port in County Antrim The first minister says a window of opportunity now exists to address issues caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol. Paul Givan spoke after a virtual meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council today. He said the British government recognised the harm it had caused and the EU had suspended legal action. The Protocol was not on the meeting's agenda, but was raised by Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said she had raised it because of concerns coming into autumnwhen the so called grace periods are due to end. She added that those who helped deliver the hardest possible Brexit ""have to shoulder some of the responsibility for where we are"". Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? EU pauses legal action against UK over NI Protocol EU publishes proposals to simplify NI Protocol Mr Givan said there now needs to be ""constructive engagement"" between the two sides. ""Obviously the Irish Government have a very important role in influencing how the European Union conducts is approach to addressing those issues,"" he said. ""The DUP want to see progress over the coming months. There's a window of opportunity for that to happen. ""But where East-West relationships are damaged at a political, economical societal level, of course, that has a knock-on effect when it comes to the way in which the Belfast Agreement was very carefully constructed."" Paul Givan said there needed to be constructive engagement between the UK and EU over the Protocol The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, causing some difficulties in moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. As part of its five point plan to oppose the Protocol the DUP said its involvement in north-south meetings may be affected The party said it was taking part in today's meeting because the Protocol was not on the agenda. The virtual meeting was hosted by Taoiseach MichaÃ©l Martin and the tÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar The TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the Protocol came about because of the decision by the British people to leave the EU and the subsequent commitment by the British government it would not result in a hard border ""and those are just the facts of the situation"". Paul Givan said his family originally came from County Monaghan adding ""we do have those fraternal connections and it's important that they're protected, but the Protocol has caused huge damage and that needs to be addressed"". Friday's virtual gathering was hosted by Taoiseach MichaÃ©l Martin. It heard from both chief medical officers in Belfast and Dublin, and ministers compared notes on restrictions that have been eased. There were also discussions about cross-border infrastructure projects and peace funding. The 26th plenary meeting of the council was due to be held in Armagh in June but it was called off at the last minute after Edwin Poots quit as DUP leader. He was laterreplaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Ahead of the meeting Sir Jeffrey said there could not be a ""business as usual"" approach because of outstanding issues regarding the protocol. ""Whilst this meeting is taking place within the current context, the next few weeks will determine the type of relationship we are able to have north-south,"" he said. ""The Irish government in particular need to understand that the more harm is done to our relationship with the rest of the UK, the more harm will be done to our relationship with them."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's comments were criticised by the Infrastructure Minister and SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon who called them ""disappointing"" and said that they risked undermining powersharing. ""Those who seek to reduce our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and to the public, tread a dangerous path and should think twice before pursuing a reckless strategy,"" she said. ""Powersharing isn't a concept. It is the basis of our peace, in the north, across and between these islands. ""If anyone thinks they can frustrate or undermine it, let them heed this warning, it will be resisted.""

Shriever takes BMX gold as GB claim six medals,"This video can not be played History-making BMX, a third medal for Scott, and Asher-Smith takes to the track Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Bethany Shriever claimed a thrilling BMX gold and Duncan Scott extended his streak in the pool as Great Britain won six Olympic medals on Friday. A silver for Kye Whyte in the BMX men's race was Britain's first in the event at an Olympic Games, and a first gold quickly followed through Shriever in the women's race. Scott claimed his third medal in Tokyo with silver in the men's 200m individual medley, while Luke Greenbank took 200m backstroke bronze. The men's eight won a rowing bronze and Bryony Page added another in the women's trampolining on day seven as Great Britain remained sixth in the medal table. GB finished the Games with two rowing medals, their lowest rowing medal tally at an Olympics since they won two at Atlanta 1996 and the first time they have not won at least one gold since 1980. Friday brought the start of the athletics in Tokyo, with Dina Asher-Smith qualifying second in her opening 100m heat. But there was a shock in the men's tennis as Novak Djokovic's hopes of completing a Golden Slam were ended by Germany's Alexander Zverev in the semi-final.

The 22-year-old, who also worked part-time as a teaching assistant to cover training costs, held off two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon from Colombia towin on her Olympic debut. ""Honestly, I'm in shock. To even be here is an achievement in itself,"" said the Essex cyclist. ""To make a final is another achievement in itself. To win a medal, let alone a gold medal, I'm over the moon."" Shriever's gold meant GB became the third country, after France and the Netherlands, to win in all four cycling disciplines - BMX, mountain bike, road and track. Whyte finished 0.114 seconds behind Dutchman Niek Kimmann to claim silver. Nicknamed the Prince of Peckham, 22-year-old Whyte has fought back from serious injury to earn his place on the Olympic podium. Scott added to his 4x200m freestyle relay gold and 200m freestyle silver by finishing 0.28 seconds behind China's Wang Shun in the200m medley.

Stokes takes break from cricket for mental health reasons,"Stokes has played in 71 Tests, 101 one-day-internationals and 34 Twenty20s for England. Ben Stokes ""will take an indefinite break from all cricket with immediate effect"" and has withdrawn from England's squad for the five-Test series against India. The all-rounder will prioritise his mental wellbeing and rest his left index finger which has not fully healed, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said in a statement. Stokes, 30, will be replaced in the squad by Somerset's Craig Overton. The Test series begins on Wednesday. ""Ben has shown tremendous courage to open up about his feelings and wellbeing,"" Ashley Giles, managing director of England men's cricket, added. ""Our primary focus has always been and will continue to be the mental health and welfare of all of our people. ""The demands on our athletes to prepare and play elite sport are relentless in a typical environment, but the ongoing pandemic has acutely compounded this. ""Spending significant amounts of time away from family, with minimal freedoms, is extremely challenging. The cumulative effect of operating almost continuously in these environments over the last 16 months has had a major impact on everyone's wellbeing. ""Ben will be given as long as he needs, and we look forward to seeing him playing cricket for England in the future."" Stokes recently captained Northern Superchargers in The Hundred The decision comes at the start of a busy period for England. Five Tests against India are quickly followed by the Twenty20 World Cup in October and November and this winter's Ashes series against Australia, which begins in December. Stokes took aperiod of compassionate leavebetween August and October last year, missing two Tests, to be with his father Ged, who died in December last year. He was rested for two Tests in Sri Lanka in January and, after returning for England's series defeat in India, missed the home Test series against New Zealand in June havingbroken his fingerplaying in the Indian Premier League Stokes returned to England duty earlier this month to captain the 50-over side against Pakistan after aCovid outbreak forced England to name an entirely new squad. Having led England to a series win against Pakistan, Stokes most recently captained Northern Superchargers in the opening two games of The Hundred. Stokes' decision comes in a week where two other global stars have spoken out abouttheir mental healthon the biggest sporting stage at the Tokyo Olympics. US gymnastSimone Bilespulled out of the team final on Tuesday to ""focus on her mental health"", saying: ""I just think mental health is more prevalent in sports right now. We have to protect our minds and our bodies and not just go out and do what the world wants us to do."" And Japan's tennis superstar Naomi Osaka said she felt ""a lot of pressure""after her shock exitfrom her home Games, saying it was ""a bit much"". It was Osaka's first tournament after withdrawing from the French Open in June, when she revealed she had ""suffered long bouts of depression"" since winning her first Grand Slam title in 2018. The ECB has requested that privacy is given to Stokes and his family during his absence from the game. England spinner Jack Leach, speaking to BBC Sport All the lads are behind Ben and supporting him where we can. He has shown courage and bravery to prioritise his mental health. He is a focal part of our team and we will miss him. His priority is to take some time out from the game to get better. We can't wait to welcome him back in the near future and see him winning games of cricket for England. Michael Carberry, ex-England batsman and former team-mate of Ben Stokes, on BBC Radio 5 Live I'm still trying to process it. Very sad. Big fan of Stokes, have been since I saw him play as a young man in county cricket. Doesn't matter what's happening. Just a case of reaching out to him as a former colleague to wish him well and a speedy recovery. Hope to see him back doing what he does best. There does seem to be an uptake of mental health issues in high-profile sportspeople. Every situation is different. Maybe it's something governing bodies have to look into. We've been dealing with Covid for a year or so and maybe there's a need for more investment into physiologists with day-to-day bubbles. Must be so hard to compete and be the best they can be in those conditions, seeing time away from family tick by in hotel rooms. Cricket has always notoriously been a sport where you spend a lot of time away from families - a huge sacrifice to be the best we can be. Being locked away in a hotel room is very different though. It'll undoubtedly have an impact on people's mental health. Test Match Special commentator and Daily Telegraph cricket writer Isabelle Westbury on BBC Radio 5 Live It's quite groundbreaking really. To think of somebody of the profile and the achievement of Ben Stokes say something quite so candid, when we associate him, I guess, with feats of great sporting prowess but also being a tough guy. For somebody like that to be able to say 'listen, I'm struggling' is momentous, but I think it's really positive as well. I think it's groundbreaking for a man - and someone who we've got a very specific idea of what they're like in our heads to say this. It will hopefully pave the way for others to say the same.

Storm Evert prompts multiple rescues in South West,"Lifeboats and the Maritime Coastguard Agency helicopter rescued a number of people from yachts Storm Evert has caused significant disruption in the South West, prompting a number of rescues off the Isles of Scilly. The Met Office issued a yellow wind warning for the region, including gusts of up to 75mph (121km/h). Falmouth Coastguard said overnight it responded to more than 20 incidents off the islands, 28 miles (45km) off Cornwall. It said many involved rescuing people from their yachts. Boats on the Isles of Scilly were hit by strong winds overnight Falmouth Coastguard, Paddy Cochran, said: ""When you're on board your yacht and you're being blown towards rocks, it becomes life-threatening very, very quickly,"" he said. The St Mary's and Sennen RNLI lifeboats were in action throughout the night. Mr Cochran said the crews were ""exhausted"". A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts. There have also been reports of fallen trees blocking some roads in Cornwall on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amber warning for Cornwall had initially been issued by the Met Office for Thursday night. Some campsites had relocated guests to try to protect them against the elements, while others were prompted to pack up and leave. Alice Cresswell and her family, who had come to Perranporth from London, were forced to spend the night in the car after their tent was destroyed. ""It's been a stressful night. We've been in the car all night, cold,"" she told the BBC. ""We had to escape the tent because it collapsed in the early hours of the morning. ""It was really scary - it was shaking a lot. We just weren't prepared for it."" This video can not be played A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts Another camper, Matthew Szczepkowski, said the gale force winds had made his night ""absolutely horrendous"". ""The car was moving, everything was blowing about, it was just non-stop,"" he said. ""I thought this morning it might have died down, but obviously it hasn't, it's even worse."" Analysis by BBC meteorologist David Braine Storm Evert is now on its way across to Scandinavia, and it will continue to weaken as it moves east so for us the worst is over. The area of low pressure was named by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office because of its potential to have a high impact on those on holiday - particularly in tents - businesses and infrastructure. In the end the highest gusts were on the Isles of Scilly at 69mph (111km/h), but many other locations had gusts above 50mph (80km/h). Staff at Bryher Campsite worked through the night to keep guests safe Bryher Campsite on the Isles of Scilly was forced to move some campers into a community hall overnight. ""We have had the campsite for six years, it's the worst storm we've ever had,"" said its owner Tom Matthews. ""The strength of the wind and the gusts last night was just something else. ""When it's weather like that and the potential of people in danger we have to do what we have to do."" People were also warned against any early-morning swims. ""It's a risk you don't need to take,"" said Cornwall Coastguard James Instance. ""If the sea is looking choppy, rough, different to what it normally would, there could well be rip currents which could get you into difficulty."" Allow Twitter content?

British Airways owner IAG to ramp up flights,"British Airways owner IAG is ramping up its flight schedules as global air travel restrictions ease. IAG said it would operate at about 45% of passenger capacity between July and September on pre-Covid levels, possibly rising to 75% by the end of 2021. It comes as the company, which also owns Aer Lingus and Iberia, revealed a loss of more than â¬2bn (Â£1.7bn) in the six months to the end of June. But IAG said it was not currently considering further redundancies. The airline group has been hit hard by the coronavirus collapse in travel, with revenues and profits plunging after operators were forced to ground aircraft. Chief executive Luis Gallego said on Friday the company had the ""flexibility to capitalise"" in areas where demand has increased due to travel restrictions easing. However, the company warned that its plans to increase flight numbers ""remain uncertain and subject to ongoing review"". Mr Gallego said: ""We know that recovery will be uneven, but we're ready to take advantage of a surge in air travel demand in line with increasing vaccination rates."" He welcomed the UK's decision that fully-vaccinated travellers fromamber-list countries in the EU and US would no longer be required to quarantine when arrived home. The rule change will come into force at 04:00 BST on Monday. ""We see this as an important first step in fully reopening the transatlantic travel corridor,"" he said. IAG reported total revenues of â¬2.2bn (Â£1.87bn) for the first six months of the year, down from â¬5.3bn for the same period last year, and an operating loss of â¬2.03bn. Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said IAG's management had done a ""terrific job making the most of a bad situation, but added ""you can't dress up the fact that IAG is in a terrible position right now"". She said: ""Long-haul traffic will be last to recover, and IAG's position within Europe means it's at the mercy of many of different government restrictions. ""The group doesn't expect passenger demand to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest, leaving no choice but to continue paring down operations. This will undoubtedly leave scars that will follow the group well into the future."" Mr Gallego said British Airways saw a 95% increase in the number of bookings for flights from the US to the UK shortly after Wednesday's announcement on easing travel rules, compared with the same period last week. Asked if the planned ending of the furlough in September could lead to more UK job losses, he replied: ""What we would like is to have an extension of the furlough scheme until the end of the year."" He added: ""Right now, we are not considering to reduce jobs more, but for sure we need to see the evolution of the situation. ""With the plans that we have right now, our plan is to fly, people want to fly, and for that we're going to need our people."" In April 2020 British Airways announced it would cut up to 12,000 jobs in response to the Covid crisis. Air France-KLM, which compared to BA has benefited from the earlier opening of services from Europe to the US, said it expected third quarter capacity at 60-70% of 2019 levels. Short-haul rivals EasyJet and Ryanair are aiming for 60% summer capacity and July passenger numbers at two-thirds of 2019 levels respectively. Airlines, and the travel industry generally, say they face another lost summer for trading, even if travel restrictions continue to ease. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC on Friday that a decision on France's place in the international travel traffic-light system is not expected until next week. France is currently on the amber-plus list, with holidaymakers returning from the country being required to self-isolate. Asked if that also means waiting to hear whether Spain will join the amber-plus list, Mr Shapps said: ""That's right. I would encourage people to broadly ignore the sort of ongoing speculation as much as is possible."" He added: ""One thing I have seen over the last year with all this going on is that, quite often, the speculation is not all that helpful, or all that accurate indeed.

Breaking|Breaking newsMan pleads guilty to Prof Chris Whitty park assaultLewis Hughes pleads guilty to assaulting England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty in central London.London,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident at about 19:20 BST on 27 June A man has been sentenced for assaulting England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty in central London. Lewis Hughes, 24, from Romford, east London, admitted one charge of assault by beating Prof Whitty in St James's Park on 27 June. He was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years, and a fine of Â£100. Jonathan Chew, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex pleaded not guilty to the same charge of assault by beating. Footage, which was shared on social media, showed two men grabbing Prof Whitty, who struggled to free himself. Hughes was ""unreservedly apologetic"" for the distress caused to Prof Whitty in what had been ""10 seconds of complete and utter madness"", Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Lewis Hughes was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years Prof Whitty described being put into a loose headlock by Hughes and had tried to break free from two men, the court heard. Addressing Hughes, Judge Paul Goldspring said: ""He (Prof Whitty) goes about his very difficult job without the expectation [of] yobs like you accosting him, assaulting him and then to compound it all, he is further humiliated by the video posted. ""I recognise that you did not post it on the internet"". Jonathan Chew pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and will go on trial in November During the same hearing, Mr Chew also denied a second charge of obstructing a police constable in execution of his duty. He was granted bail and was asked to appear at the same court on 23 November for trial where Prof Whitty will be called to give evidence. Prosecutor Luke Staton told the court that England's chief medical officer initially did not want to make a complaint, but when the footage was posted online he pursued the matter. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation after the incident, and officers carried out a welfare check on Prof Whitty, who did not suffer any injuries. Kalsoom Shah, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said Hughes showed ""little regard"" for Prof Whitty or social distancing rules ""when he accosted the government's chief medical officer in the street"". ""His behaviour was both shocking and disgraceful,"" she said. Hughes' barrister, Laurie-Anne Power told the court that her client had recognised Prof Whitty from the television and that he wanted a selfie for his mum. He would have done the same thing if he had seen Justin Bieber in the park, the court heard.

Jonathan Chew pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and will go on trial in November During the same hearing, Mr Chew also denied a second charge of obstructing a police constable in execution of his duty. He was granted bail and was asked to appear at the same court on 23 November for trial where Prof Whitty will be called to give evidence. Prosecutor Luke Staton told the court that England's chief medical officer initially did not want to make a complaint, but when the footage was posted online he pursued the matter. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation after the incident, and officers carried out a welfare check on Prof Whitty, who did not suffer any injuries. Kalsoom Shah, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said Hughes showed ""little regard"" for Prof Whitty or social distancing rules ""when he accosted the government's chief medical officer in the street"". ""His behaviour was both shocking and disgraceful,"" she said. Hughes' barrister, Laurie-Anne Power told the court that her client had recognised Prof Whitty from the television and that he wanted a selfie for his mum. He would have done the same thing if he had seen Justin Bieber in the park, the court heard.

Pandemic response dominates north-south meetingIt comes as the DUP issues a fresh warning over its involvement in north-south engagement.Northern Ireland,"Trucks arriving at Larne port in County Antrim The first minister says a window of opportunity now exists to address issues caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol. Paul Givan spoke after a virtual meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council today. He said the British government recognised the harm it had caused and the EU had suspended legal action. The Protocol was not on the meeting's agenda, but was raised by Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said she had raised it because of concerns coming into autumnwhen the so called grace periods are due to end. She added that those who helped deliver the hardest possible Brexit ""have to shoulder some of the responsibility for where we are"". Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? EU pauses legal action against UK over NI Protocol EU publishes proposals to simplify NI Protocol Mr Givan said there now needs to be ""constructive engagement"" between the two sides. ""Obviously the Irish Government have a very important role in influencing how the European Union conducts is approach to addressing those issues,"" he said. ""The DUP want to see progress over the coming months. There's a window of opportunity for that to happen. ""But where East-West relationships are damaged at a political, economical societal level, of course, that has a knock-on effect when it comes to the way in which the Belfast Agreement was very carefully constructed."" Paul Givan said there needed to be constructive engagement between the UK and EU over the Protocol The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, causing some difficulties in moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. As part of its five point plan to oppose the Protocol the DUP said its involvement in north-south meetings may be affected The party said it was taking part in today's meeting because the Protocol was not on the agenda. The virtual meeting was hosted by Taoiseach MichaÃ©l Martin and the tÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar The TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the Protocol came about because of the decision by the British people to leave the EU and the subsequent commitment by the British government it would not result in a hard border ""and those are just the facts of the situation"". Paul Givan said his family originally came from County Monaghan adding ""we do have those fraternal connections and it's important that they're protected, but the Protocol has caused huge damage and that needs to be addressed"". Friday's virtual gathering was hosted by Taoiseach MichaÃ©l Martin. It heard from both chief medical officers in Belfast and Dublin, and ministers compared notes on restrictions that have been eased. There were also discussions about cross-border infrastructure projects and peace funding. The 26th plenary meeting of the council was due to be held in Armagh in June but it was called off at the last minute after Edwin Poots quit as DUP leader. He was laterreplaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Ahead of the meeting Sir Jeffrey said there could not be a ""business as usual"" approach because of outstanding issues regarding the protocol. ""Whilst this meeting is taking place within the current context, the next few weeks will determine the type of relationship we are able to have north-south,"" he said. ""The Irish government in particular need to understand that the more harm is done to our relationship with the rest of the UK, the more harm will be done to our relationship with them."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's comments were criticised by the Infrastructure Minister and SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon who called them ""disappointing"" and said that they risked undermining powersharing. ""Those who seek to reduce our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and to the public, tread a dangerous path and should think twice before pursuing a reckless strategy,"" she said. ""Powersharing isn't a concept. It is the basis of our peace, in the north, across and between these islands.

Human remains confirmed as those of missing hikerEsther Dingley disappeared in the Pyrenees mountains in November.Tyne & Wear,"Esther Dingley sent this selfie at the top of a mountain on 22 November Human remains found in the Pyrenees mountains are those of missing hiker Esther Dingley, it has been confirmed. The 37-year-old, from County Durham, had been walking alone near the Spain-France border and was last seen on 22 November. Charity LBT Global, which has been representing her family,said a bone found last week matched Ms Dingley's DNA. Her mother Ria Bryant and boyfriend Dan Colegate said they were ""distraught"". Esther Dingley had been travelling across Europe with her boyfriend, Dan Colegate A joint statement said: ""We have all known for many months that the chance we would get to hug our beloved Esther again, to feel her warm hand in ours, to see her beautiful smile and to watch the room light up again whenever she arrived was tiny, but with this confirmation that small hope has now faded. It is devastating beyond words. ""At this stage, with just a single bone found and no sign of equipment or clothing in the immediate area (which has been closely searched again over several days), the details of what happened and where still remain unknown."" They said rescue teams would continue their search on foot and using drones in a bid to find her equipment ""to understand how this tragedy occurred"". Ms Dingley and Mr Colegate swapped their life in north-east England for an open-ended campervan tour of Europe in 2014. Mr Colegate was house-sitting at a French farmhouse 100 miles (160km) away when his partner of 20 years went missing on a solo hike. Ms Dingley was an experienced hiker She last spoke to him via a WhatsApp video call from atop Pic de Sauvegarde on that date. LBT Global chief executive Matthew Searle said confirmation the remains were those of Ms Dingley was ""the tragic end we have all feared"". ""This is devastating news for Esther's loved ones. Never before have I seen such incredible determination as that showed by Daniel in his relentless physical search of the mountains,"" he said. Mr Colegate used his telescope to scour distant mountains Mr Colegate walked hundreds of miles in the months since his partner's disappearance, searching the mountains for any trace of her. Earlier this monthhe told the BBC he feared she had been the victim of kidnap or an attack, saying: ""The search has now been so prolonged and so intense, that as far as I'm concerned the probability of an accident is now less than the probability of a criminal act."" LBT Global said the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Ms Dingley's death was ""still very much in its infancy"". Spanish and French police havescoured the mountains in the months since her disappearancewith no breakthrough until the remains were reported last week.

Storm Evert prompts multiple rescues in South WestThere were more than 20 rescues off the Isles of Scilly where winds reached 69mph (111km/h).,"Lifeboats and the Maritime Coastguard Agency helicopter rescued a number of people from yachts Storm Evert has caused significant disruption in the South West, prompting a number of rescues off the Isles of Scilly. The Met Office issued a yellow wind warning for the region, including gusts of up to 75mph (121km/h). Falmouth Coastguard said overnight it responded to more than 20 incidents off the islands, 28 miles (45km) off Cornwall. It said many involved rescuing people from their yachts. Boats on the Isles of Scilly were hit by strong winds overnight Falmouth Coastguard, Paddy Cochran, said: ""When you're on board your yacht and you're being blown towards rocks, it becomes life-threatening very, very quickly,"" he said. The St Mary's and Sennen RNLI lifeboats were in action throughout the night. Mr Cochran said the crews were ""exhausted"". A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts. There have also been reports of fallen trees blocking some roads in Cornwall on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amber warning for Cornwall had initially been issued by the Met Office for Thursday night. Some campsites had relocated guests to try to protect them against the elements, while others were prompted to pack up and leave. Alice Cresswell and her family, who had come to Perranporth from London, were forced to spend the night in the car after their tent was destroyed. ""It's been a stressful night. We've been in the car all night, cold,"" she told the BBC. ""We had to escape the tent because it collapsed in the early hours of the morning. ""It was really scary - it was shaking a lot. We just weren't prepared for it."" This video can not be played A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts Another camper, Matthew Szczepkowski, said the gale force winds had made his night ""absolutely horrendous"". ""The car was moving, everything was blowing about, it was just non-stop,"" he said. ""I thought this morning it might have died down, but obviously it hasn't, it's even worse."" Analysis by BBC meteorologist David Braine Storm Evert is now on its way across to Scandinavia, and it will continue to weaken as it moves east so for us the worst is over. The area of low pressure was named by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office because of its potential to have a high impact on those on holiday - particularly in tents - businesses and infrastructure. In the end the highest gusts were on the Isles of Scilly at 69mph (111km/h), but many other locations had gusts above 50mph (80km/h). Staff at Bryher Campsite worked through the night to keep guests safe Bryher Campsite on the Isles of Scilly was forced to move some campers into a community hall overnight. ""We have had the campsite for six years, it's the worst storm we've ever had,"" said its owner Tom Matthews. ""The strength of the wind and the gusts last night was just something else. ""When it's weather like that and the potential of people in danger we have to do what we have to do."" People were also warned against any early-morning swims. ""It's a risk you don't need to take,"" said Cornwall Coastguard James Instance. ""If the sea is looking choppy, rough, different to what it normally would, there could well be rip currents which could get you into difficulty."" Allow Twitter content?

Man pleads guilty to Whitty assaultMan pleads guilty to assaulting England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty in central London.EnglandFormer monk to be deported after abuse sentencingFormer Catholic monk Denis Alexander was first named as a paedophile by a BBC Scotland documentary in 2013.Highlands & Islands,"Estate agent Lewis Hughes in video footage from the incident at about 19:20 BST on 27 June A man has been sentenced for assaulting England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty in central London. Lewis Hughes, 24, from Romford, east London, admitted one charge of assault by beating Prof Whitty in St James's Park on 27 June. He was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years, and a fine of Â£100. Jonathan Chew, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex pleaded not guilty to the same charge of assault by beating. Footage, which was shared on social media, showed two men grabbing Prof Whitty, who struggled to free himself. Hughes was ""unreservedly apologetic"" for the distress caused to Prof Whitty in what had been ""10 seconds of complete and utter madness"", Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Lewis Hughes was given an eight-week custodial sentence, suspended for two years Prof Whitty described being put into a loose headlock by Hughes and had tried to break free from two men, the court heard. Addressing Hughes, Judge Paul Goldspring said: ""He (Prof Whitty) goes about his very difficult job without the expectation [of] yobs like you accosting him, assaulting him and then to compound it all, he is further humiliated by the video posted. ""I recognise that you did not post it on the internet"". Jonathan Chew pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and will go on trial in November During the same hearing, Mr Chew also denied a second charge of obstructing a police constable in execution of his duty. He was granted bail and was asked to appear at the same court on 23 November for trial where Prof Whitty will be called to give evidence. Prosecutor Luke Staton told the court that England's chief medical officer initially did not want to make a complaint, but when the footage was posted online he pursued the matter.

""His behaviour was both shocking and disgraceful,"" she said.

"'Frightening' Covid surge widens Japan's emergencyThe Olympics host is facing record Covid case numbers, fuelled by the virulent Delta strain.","Tokyo is seeing record cases despite being under emergency measures Japan is extending a state of emergency in Tokyo and expanding it to new regions as the Olympic Games host faces a surge in Covid-19 cases. The restrictions are being imposed in areas surrounding the capital as well as in the city of Osaka. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga warned infections were spreading at an unprecedented rate, urging the country to watch the Games from home. New cases are being fuelled by the more infectious Delta variant. ""If the increase of infection does not stop, the severe symptoms cases will increase and the medical system may possibly be further under strain,"" Mr Suga said. Earlier, Health Minister Norihisa Tamura warned that the country had entered a new, ""extremely frightening"", stage of the pandemic. ""I think that people cannot see ahead and, worrying how long this situation will last, they find it unbearable that they cannot return to normal daily life,"" Reuters quoted him as saying. Japan has had some success fighting Covid-19, keeping cases and deaths low for months, but is now seeing record cases. Daily cases nationwide topped 10,000 for the first time on Thursday, more than a third of them in the capital. Tokyo - where the Olympics are mainly taking place - has seen three straight days of record cases, even though it is already under a state of emergency. Hospitals are under increasing pressure in the city. Olympic organisers reported 27 new infections at the Games on Friday, bringing the total since the start of July to more than 200. But with strict rules in place, including a ban on spectators, organisers deny the event is driving the rise in cases. Despite this, some experts worry that holding the Olympics in such circumstances sends a confusing message to the public about the need to limit daily life. Under the state of emergency, bars and restaurants must stop serving alcohol and close early. Three regions, known in Japan as prefectures, along with Osaka, will go under the restrictions from 2-31 August, with the measures in place in Tokyo extended to the end of the month. While other countries have imposed legal restrictions on residents, in Japan people are only advised to work from home, so questions have been raised as to how effective the new measures will be. Tokyo's Governor Yuriko Koike has said the key to controlling the outbreak is young people, urging them to get vaccinated, but the BBC's Mariko Oi says this is a little unfair given the low availability of doses. Less than 30% of the population has been fully vaccinated, with officials aiming to jab all those who want a dose by October or November. Speaking to the BBC, some young Japanese people were sceptical about whether the new measures would work. ""I can sense that we are getting too used to the state of emergency, so it's not stopping people from going out,"" said one. ""If the government really wants to stop the spread of the virus, they have to lock us down and offer financial support,"" said another. Other countries in the region have also tightened rules to halt the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant,with China halting flights in NanjingandAustralia deploying troops in Sydney.

"'Frightening' Covid surge widens Japan's emergencyThe Olympics host is facing record Covid case numbers, fuelled by the virulent Delta strain.Asia","Tokyo is seeing record cases despite being under emergency measures Japan is extending a state of emergency in Tokyo and expanding it to new regions as the Olympic Games host faces a surge in Covid-19 cases. The restrictions are being imposed in areas surrounding the capital as well as in the city of Osaka. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga warned infections were spreading at an unprecedented rate, urging the country to watch the Games from home. New cases are being fuelled by the more infectious Delta variant. ""If the increase of infection does not stop, the severe symptoms cases will increase and the medical system may possibly be further under strain,"" Mr Suga said. Earlier, Health Minister Norihisa Tamura warned that the country had entered a new, ""extremely frightening"", stage of the pandemic. ""I think that people cannot see ahead and, worrying how long this situation will last, they find it unbearable that they cannot return to normal daily life,"" Reuters quoted him as saying. Japan has had some success fighting Covid-19, keeping cases and deaths low for months, but is now seeing record cases. Daily cases nationwide topped 10,000 for the first time on Thursday, more than a third of them in the capital. Tokyo - where the Olympics are mainly taking place - has seen three straight days of record cases, even though it is already under a state of emergency. Hospitals are under increasing pressure in the city. Olympic organisers reported 27 new infections at the Games on Friday, bringing the total since the start of July to more than 200. But with strict rules in place, including a ban on spectators, organisers deny the event is driving the rise in cases. Despite this, some experts worry that holding the Olympics in such circumstances sends a confusing message to the public about the need to limit daily life. Under the state of emergency, bars and restaurants must stop serving alcohol and close early. Three regions, known in Japan as prefectures, along with Osaka, will go under the restrictions from 2-31 August, with the measures in place in Tokyo extended to the end of the month. While other countries have imposed legal restrictions on residents, in Japan people are only advised to work from home, so questions have been raised as to how effective the new measures will be. Tokyo's Governor Yuriko Koike has said the key to controlling the outbreak is young people, urging them to get vaccinated, but the BBC's Mariko Oi says this is a little unfair given the low availability of doses. Less than 30% of the population has been fully vaccinated, with officials aiming to jab all those who want a dose by October or November. Speaking to the BBC, some young Japanese people were sceptical about whether the new measures would work. ""I can sense that we are getting too used to the state of emergency, so it's not stopping people from going out,"" said one. ""If the government really wants to stop the spread of the virus, they have to lock us down and offer financial support,"" said another. Other countries in the region have also tightened rules to halt the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant,with China halting flights in NanjingandAustralia deploying troops in Sydney.

"Shriever takes BMX gold as GB claim six medalsBritain's Bethany Shriever, who needed crowdfunding to be able to go to Japan, wins gold in the women's BMX.BBC SportComments","This video can not be played History-making BMX, a third medal for Scott, and Asher-Smith takes to the track Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Bethany Shriever claimed a thrilling BMX gold and Duncan Scott extended his streak in the pool as Great Britain won six Olympic medals on Friday. A silver for Kye Whyte in the BMX men's race was Britain's first in the event at an Olympic Games, and a first gold quickly followed through Shriever in the women's race. Scott claimed his third medal in Tokyo with silver in the men's 200m individual medley, while Luke Greenbank took 200m backstroke bronze. The men's eight won a rowing bronze and Bryony Page added another in the women's trampolining on day seven as Great Britain remained sixth in the medal table. GB finished the Games with two rowing medals, their lowest rowing medal tally at an Olympics since they won two at Atlanta 1996 and the first time they have not won at least one gold since 1980. Friday brought the start of the athletics in Tokyo, with Dina Asher-Smith qualifying second in her opening 100m heat. But there was a shock in the men's tennis as Novak Djokovic's hopes of completing a Golden Slam were ended by Germany's Alexander Zverev in the semi-final.

This beats the 22 medals won in the first seven days of both Rio 2016 and London 2012, the two best Olympics for Great Britain since 1908.

How are Team GB athletes doing in Tokyo? Shriever had to fund her own qualification campaign after UK Sport cut its support for her event following Rio 2016, and two years ago she said she needed to raise a ""worrying"" Â£50,000 through crowdfunding. The 22-year-old, who also worked part-time as a teaching assistant to cover training costs, held off two-time Olympic champion Mariana Pajon from Colombia towin on her Olympic debut. ""Honestly, I'm in shock. To even be here is an achievement in itself,"" said the Essex cyclist. ""To make a final is another achievement in itself. To win a medal, let alone a gold medal, I'm over the moon."" Shriever's gold meant GB became the third country, after France and the Netherlands, to win in all four cycling disciplines - BMX, mountain bike, road and track. Whyte finished 0.114 seconds behind Dutchman Niek Kimmann to claim silver. Nicknamed the Prince of Peckham, 22-year-old Whyte has fought back from serious injury to earn his place on the Olympic podium. Scott added to his 4x200m freestyle relay gold and 200m freestyle silver by finishing 0.28 seconds behind China's Wang Shun in the200m medley. Although the 24-year-old Scot again narrowly missed out on a first individual gold, he could become the first British Olympian to win four medals at a single Games when the 4x100m medley takes place this weekend. ""It was always going to be tight and always going to be exciting. I am really happy with the swim,"" the Glasgow-born swimmer told BBC Sport.

It was Britain's sixth fourth-placed finish at the Sea Forest Waterway, while they won two medals. They were the leading rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016, claiming six, nine and five medals respectively at those Games.

Storm Evert causes disruption in South West,"Lifeboats and the Maritime Coastguard Agency helicopter rescued a number of people from yachts Storm Evert has caused significant disruption in the South West, prompting a number of rescues off the Isles of Scilly. The Met Office issued a yellow wind warning for the region, including gusts of up to 75mph (121km/h). Falmouth Coastguard said overnight it responded to more than 20 incidents off the islands, 28 miles (45km) off Cornwall. It said many involved rescuing people from their yachts. Boats on the Isles of Scilly were hit by strong winds overnight Falmouth Coastguard, Paddy Cochran, said: ""When you're on board your yacht and you're being blown towards rocks, it becomes life-threatening very, very quickly,"" he said. The St Mary's and Sennen RNLI lifeboats were in action throughout the night. Mr Cochran said the crews were ""exhausted"". A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts. There have also been reports of fallen trees blocking some roads in Cornwall on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amber warning for Cornwall had initially been issued by the Met Office for Thursday night. Some campsites had relocated guests to try to protect them against the elements, while others were prompted to pack up and leave. Alice Cresswell and her family, who had come to Perranporth from London, were forced to spend the night in the car after their tent was destroyed. ""It's been a stressful night. We've been in the car all night, cold,"" she told the BBC. ""We had to escape the tent because it collapsed in the early hours of the morning. ""It was really scary - it was shaking a lot. We just weren't prepared for it."" This video can not be played A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts Another camper, Matthew Szczepkowski, said the gale force winds had made his night ""absolutely horrendous"". ""The car was moving, everything was blowing about, it was just non-stop,"" he said. ""I thought this morning it might have died down, but obviously it hasn't, it's even worse."" Analysis by BBC meteorologist David Braine Storm Evert is now on its way across to Scandinavia, and it will continue to weaken as it moves east so for us the worst is over. The area of low pressure was named by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office because of its potential to have a high impact on those on holiday - particularly in tents - businesses and infrastructure. In the end the highest gusts were on the Isles of Scilly at 69mph (111km/h), but many other locations had gusts above 50mph (80km/h). Staff at Bryher Campsite worked through the night to keep guests safe Bryher Campsite on the Isles of Scilly was forced to move some campers into a community hall overnight. ""We have had the campsite for six years, it's the worst storm we've ever had,"" said its owner Tom Matthews. ""The strength of the wind and the gusts last night was just something else. ""When it's weather like that and the potential of people in danger we have to do what we have to do."" People were also warned against any early-morning swims. ""It's a risk you don't need to take,"" said Cornwall Coastguard James Instance. ""If the sea is looking choppy, rough, different to what it normally would, there could well be rip currents which could get you into difficulty."" Allow Twitter content?

"Drug deaths in Scotland reach new record levelThe country continues to have the worst drug death rate in Europe, with a further 1,339 people dying last year.","This video can not be played Scottish drug deaths: 'We need more drug users in treatment' More than 1,300 people died of drug misuse in Scotland last year, with the country seeing a record number of deaths for the seventh year in a row. The annual figures showed that there were 1,339 drug deaths last year - an increase of 75 from the 1,264 recorded the previous year. It means Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe. And its rate is more than three-and-a-half times that of England and Wales. The number of drug-related deaths has increased substantially over the past 20 years and is now almost three times higher than it was a decade ago, with the upward trend accelerating since 2013. Five ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis I want my sonâs funeral to be a drug death warning Â£250m pledge to tackle Scots drug deaths 'disgrace' Men were 2.7 times as likely to have a drug-related death than women last year, after adjusting for age. Almost two thirds of the deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54, with the average age increasing from 32 to 43 over the past two decades. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had the highest rate of all health board areas at 30.8 deaths per 100,000 people, followed by Ayrshire and Arran and Tayside with rates of 27.2 and 25.7 respectively. And people in the most deprived parts of the country were 18 times more likely to have a drug-related death as those in the least deprived. The gap has widened significantly since the start of the century, when deaths were 10 times higher in the most deprived areas. Some 93% of the deaths reported in 2020 were as a result of accidental overdoses, while 4% were considered deliberate self-poisoning. The figures showed 1% of deaths were as a result of long-term drug abuse, while 2% were undetermined. More than one drug was found to be present in the body of 93% of those who died, suggesting that many of the deaths were caused by Scotland's ""polydrug"" habit - mixing dangerous street drugs with alcohol and prescription pills. Opiates such as heroin and methadone were implicated in 1,192 deaths while benzodiazepines such as diazepam and etizolam were implicated in 974. Gabapentin or pregabalin were present in the bodies of 502 people who died, and cocaine in 459. There have been large increases in the numbers of deaths where ""street"" benzodiazepines, such as etizolam, were involved in recent years, from 58 in 2015 to 879 last year. The fake Valium - that sells for as little as 50p - is many times stronger than prescription drugs, and is often taken alongside other drugs such as heroin. Three people a day. The highest rate in the UK and in Europe. Looking inwards, a four-fold increase in Scottish drug deaths since the start of the century. And yet, the shock may lie in how much everyone had grimly predicted yet another record year. The pandemic undoubtedly affected addiction services but no one is arguing that, if it hadn't been for Covid, Scotland's drug problem would be solved. Poly-drug use is rife. Those succumbing will mix methadone prescriptions with heroin. They will then take benzodiazepines - likely so-called street Valium counterfeit pills pressed by gangsters and flooding communities at 50p a pop. All of these things come together to slow a person's breathing until it stops. And the poorest are worst hit - those living in a deprived community are 18 times more likely to die of an overdose than those in more affluent areas. How does Scotland tackle this? The Scottish government hopes the investment of Â£250m into innovations such as Naloxone - the overdose reversal drug - and alternatives to methadone may turn the oil tanker around, but it may take time. New treatment standards for addiction services should also have an effect, though questions remain over why these hadn't been in place before. There is a clamour for more radical action now - calls for rights to recovery, more investment in rehab services and big questions for the UK government at Westminster too, over the effectiveness of its 50-year-old Misuse of Drugs Act. But overall, there is now a bitter acknowledgement that those accessing these health services were for too long neglected and underserved. That acknowledgement will be of little comfort to the families of the lost. Opposition parties say cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes by the Scottish government have had a big part to play in the upward trend in the number of deaths in recent years. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously admitted that the number of deaths was ""indefensible"" and ""a national disgrace"", and that her government had not done enough to tackle the problem. The Scottish government has pledged to spend an extra Â£250m over the next five years in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths, including Â£20m a year on increasing the number of residential rehabilitation beds across the country. TheScottish Drug Death Taskforce,external, which was set up in 2019, has also been working to increase the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. Almost two-thirds of ambulance crews are now able to distribute it to people who might need it, and to train them in its use. Responding to the latest figures, Ms Sturgeon tweeted that the number of lives lost to drugs continued to be unacceptable. She said the government ""does not shirk the responsibility"" and is determined to make changes that will save lives, but said the figures predate the actions it had set out at at the start of the year. Public health minister Joe Fitzpatricklost his jobshortly after last year's figures were published, with Ms Sturgeon creating a new post of drugs minister for Angela Constance. Ms Constance said the latest figures were ""heart-breaking"" and that the government was ""working hard to get more people into the treatment that works for them as quickly as possible"". She also announced that data on suspected drug deaths will be published quarterly from September of this year, to ""ensure we can react more quickly and effectively to this crisis and identify any emerging trends"". Ms Constance and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both attended a vigil in Glasgow on Friday that was held to commemorate those who have lost their lives to drugs. Kane Duffy say he can contribute to society now he has turned his life around Kane Duffy, from Edinburgh, has stayed clear of drugs for the last 14 years. He started using heroin when he was 14 and was on a methadone prescription until his early 30s. The 44-year-old broke free from drug use after a stay at the NHS-funded Lothian and Edinburgh Abstinence Project (Leap). He now works as a specialist therapist at the Castle Craig rehab clinic. He said: ""All the time that I had taken from services, everything I was prescribed, every time the police had to intervene in my lifeâ¦ all of these things amount to a huge amount of money. ""I still don't like paying my council taxâ¦ but now I do pay my council tax. I pay my parking fines when I get them. ""I give back to society directly through the work I do and the taxes I provide.

"Drug deaths in Scotland reach new record levelThe country continues to have the worst drug death rate in Europe, with a further 1,339 people dying last year.Scotland","This video can not be played Scottish drug deaths: 'We need more drug users in treatment' More than 1,300 people died of drug misuse in Scotland last year, with the country seeing a record number of deaths for the seventh year in a row. The annual figures showed that there were 1,339 drug deaths last year - an increase of 75 from the 1,264 recorded the previous year. It means Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe. And its rate is more than three-and-a-half times that of England and Wales. The number of drug-related deaths has increased substantially over the past 20 years and is now almost three times higher than it was a decade ago, with the upward trend accelerating since 2013. Five ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis I want my sonâs funeral to be a drug death warning Â£250m pledge to tackle Scots drug deaths 'disgrace' Men were 2.7 times as likely to have a drug-related death than women last year, after adjusting for age. Almost two thirds of the deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54, with the average age increasing from 32 to 43 over the past two decades. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had the highest rate of all health board areas at 30.8 deaths per 100,000 people, followed by Ayrshire and Arran and Tayside with rates of 27.2 and 25.7 respectively. And people in the most deprived parts of the country were 18 times more likely to have a drug-related death as those in the least deprived. The gap has widened significantly since the start of the century, when deaths were 10 times higher in the most deprived areas. Some 93% of the deaths reported in 2020 were as a result of accidental overdoses, while 4% were considered deliberate self-poisoning. The figures showed 1% of deaths were as a result of long-term drug abuse, while 2% were undetermined. More than one drug was found to be present in the body of 93% of those who died, suggesting that many of the deaths were caused by Scotland's ""polydrug"" habit - mixing dangerous street drugs with alcohol and prescription pills. Opiates such as heroin and methadone were implicated in 1,192 deaths while benzodiazepines such as diazepam and etizolam were implicated in 974. Gabapentin or pregabalin were present in the bodies of 502 people who died, and cocaine in 459. There have been large increases in the numbers of deaths where ""street"" benzodiazepines, such as etizolam, were involved in recent years, from 58 in 2015 to 879 last year. The fake Valium - that sells for as little as 50p - is many times stronger than prescription drugs, and is often taken alongside other drugs such as heroin. Three people a day. The highest rate in the UK and in Europe. Looking inwards, a four-fold increase in Scottish drug deaths since the start of the century. And yet, the shock may lie in how much everyone had grimly predicted yet another record year. The pandemic undoubtedly affected addiction services but no one is arguing that, if it hadn't been for Covid, Scotland's drug problem would be solved. Poly-drug use is rife. Those succumbing will mix methadone prescriptions with heroin. They will then take benzodiazepines - likely so-called street Valium counterfeit pills pressed by gangsters and flooding communities at 50p a pop. All of these things come together to slow a person's breathing until it stops. And the poorest are worst hit - those living in a deprived community are 18 times more likely to die of an overdose than those in more affluent areas. How does Scotland tackle this? The Scottish government hopes the investment of Â£250m into innovations such as Naloxone - the overdose reversal drug - and alternatives to methadone may turn the oil tanker around, but it may take time. New treatment standards for addiction services should also have an effect, though questions remain over why these hadn't been in place before. There is a clamour for more radical action now - calls for rights to recovery, more investment in rehab services and big questions for the UK government at Westminster too, over the effectiveness of its 50-year-old Misuse of Drugs Act. But overall, there is now a bitter acknowledgement that those accessing these health services were for too long neglected and underserved. That acknowledgement will be of little comfort to the families of the lost. Opposition parties say cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes by the Scottish government have had a big part to play in the upward trend in the number of deaths in recent years. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously admitted that the number of deaths was ""indefensible"" and ""a national disgrace"", and that her government had not done enough to tackle the problem. The Scottish government has pledged to spend an extra Â£250m over the next five years in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths, including Â£20m a year on increasing the number of residential rehabilitation beds across the country. TheScottish Drug Death Taskforce,external, which was set up in 2019, has also been working to increase the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. Almost two-thirds of ambulance crews are now able to distribute it to people who might need it, and to train them in its use. Responding to the latest figures, Ms Sturgeon tweeted that the number of lives lost to drugs continued to be unacceptable. She said the government ""does not shirk the responsibility"" and is determined to make changes that will save lives, but said the figures predate the actions it had set out at at the start of the year. Public health minister Joe Fitzpatricklost his jobshortly after last year's figures were published, with Ms Sturgeon creating a new post of drugs minister for Angela Constance. Ms Constance said the latest figures were ""heart-breaking"" and that the government was ""working hard to get more people into the treatment that works for them as quickly as possible"". She also announced that data on suspected drug deaths will be published quarterly from September of this year, to ""ensure we can react more quickly and effectively to this crisis and identify any emerging trends"". Ms Constance and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both attended a vigil in Glasgow on Friday that was held to commemorate those who have lost their lives to drugs. Kane Duffy say he can contribute to society now he has turned his life around Kane Duffy, from Edinburgh, has stayed clear of drugs for the last 14 years. He started using heroin when he was 14 and was on a methadone prescription until his early 30s. The 44-year-old broke free from drug use after a stay at the NHS-funded Lothian and Edinburgh Abstinence Project (Leap). He now works as a specialist therapist at the Castle Craig rehab clinic. He said: ""All the time that I had taken from services, everything I was prescribed, every time the police had to intervene in my lifeâ¦ all of these things amount to a huge amount of money.

Drug deaths in Scotland could rise to new record,"Scotland's drug death total could hit record levels for the seventh year in a row, experts have predicted. Annual statistics for drug-related deaths in Scotland, to be released on Friday, are expected to show a further rise in the number of overdose deaths. Lockdown and the Covid pandemic are expected to have had an impact on the figures for 2020. Some 1,264 people died in 2019 from drug misuse in Scotland - a rate three times higher than the UK as a whole. Prof Catriona Matheson, who chairs a Scottish government-appointed taskforce set up to tackle the crisis, told BBC Scotland she expected to see a small further increase in the number of people who have died from overdoses. Five ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis Scotland's drug deaths rise to new record Drugs tsar says addicts 'neglected and ignored' ""I think it will be a bit higher, but I am not anticipating any huge increase,"" she said. Prof Matheson also expects to see a continuation of some trends, such as mixing drugs including heroin and benzodiazepine tablets. She believes that people in the slightly older age group - those with ""long-term drug use in a difficult and challenging way using several substances at very high risk"" -  will continue to feature in the figures. She also said new treatment standards for drug services would help address inconsistencies in care being offered across the country. Kane Duffy say he can contribute to society now he has turned his life around Kane Duffy, from Edinburgh, has stayed clear of drugs for the last 14 years. He started using heroin when he was 14 and was on a methadone prescription until his early 30s. The 44-year-old broke free from drug use after a stay at the NHS-funded Lothian and Edinburgh Abstinence Project (Leap). He now works as a specialist therapist at the Castle Craig rehab clinic. He said: ""All the time that I had taken from services, everything I was prescribed, every time the police had to intervene in my lifeâ¦ all of these things amount to a huge amount of money. ""I still don't like paying my council taxâ¦ but now I do pay my council tax. I pay my parking fines when I get them. ""I give back to society directly through the work I do and the taxes I provide. I don't cost the state anything now."" Prof Matheson was appointed to theScottish Drug Death Taskforce,externalin 2019. The group has received Â£14m in funding over the last two years to tackle the rising number of overdose deaths. It has introduced: Training for Scottish Ambulance Service personnel in providing Take Home Naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, to 300 families A Police Scotland Naloxone pilot that has seen the drug used 21 times A number of one-stop shops for drug and treatment services and support in Ayrshire, Dundee and Edinburgh However, the country's drug death rate is still expected to be among the worst in Europe. Some frontline charities and critics of the Scottish government's approach to tackling the crisis have backed the Scottish Conservatives'Right to Recovery Bill,external. The Tories say it will enshrine in law individuals' right to their chosen drug treatment, including residential rehabilitation services. Prof Matheson said new medical assisted treatment standards should have an effect in the longer-term. ""It's about rapid access to care on the day of treatment. So if you reach out for treatment, you should be able to access it,"" she said. ""It's also about choice within treatment. So, for example, in some areas you might have only been offered methadone. That's quite limiting and it wouldn't happen in any other area of clinical practice. ""There was a postcode lottery and that's not on, in any area of care."" Prof Catriona Matheson is hopeful new national standards of care will make an impact in the longer term She said this was partly down to resources and the fact that people across the country were not necessarily working together or sharing information. ""Hopefully, we have now been able to galvanise a national response,"" she added. ""The other thing that went wrong in the past was that nobody was held to account for delivering a certain standard of care. ""That will change now there is monitoring and evaluation of what is happening."" However, the task force has not been instructed to look at the effectiveness of residential rehab. There are currently 408 rehab beds in Scotland. The Scottish government says it is studying whether to increase provision by 25% to 50% over the next five years. Prof Jonathan Chick says the services offered by clinics like Castle Craig are out of the reach of most families Castle Craig rehab clinic, aprivate hospital,externalnear West Linton in the Scottish Borders, has treated people for alcohol and drug addiction for 30 years. Of its current patient list of 60, only two are NHS-funded. Around a quarter of its clients are Dutch - reflecting the value placed on its services by insurers in the Netherlands - with the remainder being privately funded or via health insurance. The weekly cost of treatment at the clinic ranges starts from Â£2,500. Prof Jonathan Chick, who worked as a consultant psychiatrist for the NHS in Edinburgh, is now medical director at the facility. Castle Craig currently has 60 patients but only two are funded by the NHS He told the BBC: ""Compared with when Castle Craig was started, the proportion of Scottish patients - particularly those funded by the Scottish NHS - has fallen. ""It's been difficult for drug and alcohol workers to navigate the process which most of the regions have set up for determining who should be given funding for a residential intensive abstinence-oriented treatment. ""They recognise what we offer, they share our views on what is a very ideal and effective treatment for addiction. But they say they have limited funds. ""I think it is a great shame. There are tremendous opportunities here. ""It's out of the reach of most families, obviously, but it is not out of the reach of the services. They are providing quite expensive treatments for years and years and not looking at other opportunities.""

Pandemic response to dominate north-south meetingIt comes as the DUP issues a fresh warning over its involvement in north-south engagement.Northern Ireland,"Trucks arriving at Larne port in County Antrim The first minister says a window of opportunity now exists to address issues caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol. Paul Givan spoke after a virtual meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council today. He said the British government recognised the harm it had caused and the EU had suspended legal action. The Protocol was not on the meeting's agenda, but was raised by Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said she had raised it because of concerns coming into autumnwhen the so called grace periods are due to end. She added that those who helped deliver the hardest possible Brexit ""have to shoulder some of the responsibility for where we are"". Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? EU pauses legal action against UK over NI Protocol EU publishes proposals to simplify NI Protocol Mr Givan said there now needs to be ""constructive engagement"" between the two sides. ""Obviously the Irish Government have a very important role in influencing how the European Union conducts is approach to addressing those issues,"" he said. ""The DUP want to see progress over the coming months. There's a window of opportunity for that to happen. ""But where East-West relationships are damaged at a political, economical societal level, of course, that has a knock-on effect when it comes to the way in which the Belfast Agreement was very carefully constructed."" Paul Givan said there needed to be constructive engagement between the UK and EU over the Protocol The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, causing some difficulties in moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. As part of its five point plan to oppose the Protocol the DUP said its involvement in north-south meetings may be affected The party said it was taking part in today's meeting because the Protocol was not on the agenda. The virtual meeting was hosted by Taoiseach MichaÃ©l Martin and the tÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar The TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the Protocol came about because of the decision by the British people to leave the EU and the subsequent commitment by the British government it would not result in a hard border ""and those are just the facts of the situation"". Paul Givan said his family originally came from County Monaghan adding ""we do have those fraternal connections and it's important that they're protected, but the Protocol has caused huge damage and that needs to be addressed"". Friday's virtual gathering was hosted by Taoiseach MichaÃ©l Martin. It heard from both chief medical officers in Belfast and Dublin, and ministers compared notes on restrictions that have been eased. There were also discussions about cross-border infrastructure projects and peace funding. The 26th plenary meeting of the council was due to be held in Armagh in June but it was called off at the last minute after Edwin Poots quit as DUP leader. He was laterreplaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Ahead of the meeting Sir Jeffrey said there could not be a ""business as usual"" approach because of outstanding issues regarding the protocol. ""Whilst this meeting is taking place within the current context, the next few weeks will determine the type of relationship we are able to have north-south,"" he said. ""The Irish government in particular need to understand that the more harm is done to our relationship with the rest of the UK, the more harm will be done to our relationship with them."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's comments were criticised by the Infrastructure Minister and SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon who called them ""disappointing"" and said that they risked undermining powersharing. ""Those who seek to reduce our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and to the public, tread a dangerous path and should think twice before pursuing a reckless strategy,"" she said. ""Powersharing isn't a concept. It is the basis of our peace, in the north, across and between these islands. ""If anyone thinks they can frustrate or undermine it, let them heed this warning, it will be resisted.""

South West wakes to strong winds and heavy rain,"Lifeboats and the Maritime Coastguard Agency helicopter rescued a number of people from yachts Storm Evert has caused significant disruption in the South West, prompting a number of rescues off the Isles of Scilly. The Met Office issued a yellow wind warning for the region, including gusts of up to 75mph (121km/h). Falmouth Coastguard said overnight it responded to more than 20 incidents off the islands, 28 miles (45km) off Cornwall. It said many involved rescuing people from their yachts. Boats on the Isles of Scilly were hit by strong winds overnight Falmouth Coastguard, Paddy Cochran, said: ""When you're on board your yacht and you're being blown towards rocks, it becomes life-threatening very, very quickly,"" he said. The St Mary's and Sennen RNLI lifeboats were in action throughout the night. Mr Cochran said the crews were ""exhausted"". A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts. There have also been reports of fallen trees blocking some roads in Cornwall on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amber warning for Cornwall had initially been issued by the Met Office for Thursday night. Some campsites had relocated guests to try to protect them against the elements, while others were prompted to pack up and leave. Alice Cresswell and her family, who had come to Perranporth from London, were forced to spend the night in the car after their tent was destroyed. ""It's been a stressful night. We've been in the car all night, cold,"" she told the BBC. ""We had to escape the tent because it collapsed in the early hours of the morning. ""It was really scary - it was shaking a lot. We just weren't prepared for it."" This video can not be played A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts Another camper, Matthew Szczepkowski, said the gale force winds had made his night ""absolutely horrendous"". ""The car was moving, everything was blowing about, it was just non-stop,"" he said. ""I thought this morning it might have died down, but obviously it hasn't, it's even worse."" Analysis by BBC meteorologist David Braine Storm Evert is now on its way across to Scandinavia, and it will continue to weaken as it moves east so for us the worst is over. The area of low pressure was named by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office because of its potential to have a high impact on those on holiday - particularly in tents - businesses and infrastructure. In the end the highest gusts were on the Isles of Scilly at 69mph (111km/h), but many other locations had gusts above 50mph (80km/h). Staff at Bryher Campsite worked through the night to keep guests safe Bryher Campsite on the Isles of Scilly was forced to move some campers into a community hall overnight. ""We have had the campsite for six years, it's the worst storm we've ever had,"" said its owner Tom Matthews. ""The strength of the wind and the gusts last night was just something else. ""When it's weather like that and the potential of people in danger we have to do what we have to do."" People were also warned against any early-morning swims. ""It's a risk you don't need to take,"" said Cornwall Coastguard James Instance. ""If the sea is looking choppy, rough, different to what it normally would, there could well be rip currents which could get you into difficulty."" Allow Twitter content?

'I was asked how often I use the toilet',"Janet Aspin was let down by a prospective employer who couldn't understand her disability Janet Aspin thought it would be difficult entering the jobs market after 25 years at one company. But she didn't expect that she would have to tell her new employers how often she needed the toilet. The 40-year-old, from Darwen in Lancashire, has multiple sclerosis. She said as soon as her disability was discussed, it became less about what she could do and more about what she couldn't do. Janet is now running her own successful personal assistant business. But she was recently let down by a prospective employer who couldn't understand her disability or how to make reasonable adjustments so she could do her job. Janet was made redundant during the pandemic. She said being back in the job market, with a disability, was difficult. ""I have never felt so low,"" she said. ""I applied for a job, got it, but was then told that I would have to do a load of risk assessments because of my disability. ""At one point they wanted to know how many steps I could take and how many times a day I used the toilet. ""It knocked my confidence, you just feel like a failure. I was good enough to get the job, but then all of a sudden, because of my disability, there is this massive barrier."" According to a group of MPs, the government is failing to remove those barriers. The Work and Pensions Committee said the government's work programme needs a ""radical overhaul"". MPs heard evidence from charities, disabled people's organisations, and ministers from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Its remit was to look at the disability employment gap. Currently there are just over 50% of disabled people in work, compared to 81% of non-disabled people. It said the current target of helping one million more disabled into work by 2027 should be scrapped and a different target introduced - halving the disability employment gap. Disabled people forgotten during Covid, BBC research reveals Critics give mixed response to ministers' Â£1.6bn disability strategy The chair of the committee, Labour MP Stephen Timms, said: ""The gap between the proportion of disabled and non-disabled people in work has remained stubbornly high for years. ""The current overly centralised model of support simply isn't working. We need a radical new localised approach."" The committee also heard evidence of the difficulties disabled people face when looking for support through Jobcentre Plus, such as a lack of interpreters or buildings being inaccessible. Katie Cheval said employers see physical disabilities first Katie Cheval managed to enter the Jobcentre Plus building but didn't get much further. The 30-year-old, from Kent, said advisors told her she had too many disabilities to successfully find work. She has mobility issues, fibromyalgia and learning disabilities. Despite the lack of success through her local job centre, she is currently in work, but has felt discriminated against because of her disability throughout her career. In her current role, as an assistant manager in a charity shop, she has had to clear out the disabled toilet and is still waiting for a chair she can use behind the till. She said: ""Employers see the physical disabilities first. When I applied for one job I went in for interview and I was immediately asked, ""Why are you using a crutch""? ""It just makes me feel like I'm not worth anything, and that my disability becomes a huge barrier. I am able, and I am proud to be disabled."" The Committee found: Work capability assessments causing stress and anxiety and pushing claimants further from the labour market Disability Confident, hailed as a flagship programme by the DWP, was described by many as a tick box exercise. The government acknowledged that it was not possible to know whether it was any measurable impact on increasing the number of disabled people in work. Disabled people were more likely to be working in sectors that were forced to close during the pandemic, more likely to be at risk of redundancy, and more likely to be working reduced hours than non-disabled people. Employers not having enough support from the DWP to successfully employ disabled people and in some cases they were either unaware of their legal obligations or were purposefully breaching the Equality Act 2010. Mr Timms also criticised the government's recent National Disability Strategy for a lack of ambition around getting disabled people into work, saying it was a ""major disappointment"". ""We had hoped it would chart a course to a more ambitious and stretching target. But, despite the minister's assurances, there is no new target - nor even a consultation on one."" A spokesperson defended the government's record on getting disabled people into work, saying the latest figures on the disability employment gap showed that it had narrowed. The government is committed to reducing it further by seeing one million more people in work by 2027, the spokesperson said, adding: ""Through our inclusive multi-billion-pound Plan for Jobs we are helping more disabled jobseekers to find, retain and progress in fulfilling work, offering specialist programmes, paired with personal support from our work coaches and disability employment advisers.""

South West wakes to strong winds and heavy rainA yellow warning for strong to gale force winds remains in place as Storm Evert hits the UK.Cornwall,"Lifeboats and the Maritime Coastguard Agency helicopter rescued a number of people from yachts Storm Evert has caused significant disruption in the South West, prompting a number of rescues off the Isles of Scilly. The Met Office issued a yellow wind warning for the region, including gusts of up to 75mph (121km/h). Falmouth Coastguard said overnight it responded to more than 20 incidents off the islands, 28 miles (45km) off Cornwall. It said many involved rescuing people from their yachts. Boats on the Isles of Scilly were hit by strong winds overnight Falmouth Coastguard, Paddy Cochran, said: ""When you're on board your yacht and you're being blown towards rocks, it becomes life-threatening very, very quickly,"" he said. The St Mary's and Sennen RNLI lifeboats were in action throughout the night. Mr Cochran said the crews were ""exhausted"". A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts. There have also been reports of fallen trees blocking some roads in Cornwall on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An amber warning for Cornwall had initially been issued by the Met Office for Thursday night. Some campsites had relocated guests to try to protect them against the elements, while others were prompted to pack up and leave. Alice Cresswell and her family, who had come to Perranporth from London, were forced to spend the night in the car after their tent was destroyed. ""It's been a stressful night. We've been in the car all night, cold,"" she told the BBC. ""We had to escape the tent because it collapsed in the early hours of the morning. ""It was really scary - it was shaking a lot. We just weren't prepared for it."" This video can not be played A coastguard rescue helicopter airlifted people from at least four yachts Another camper, Matthew Szczepkowski, said the gale force winds had made his night ""absolutely horrendous"". ""The car was moving, everything was blowing about, it was just non-stop,"" he said. ""I thought this morning it might have died down, but obviously it hasn't, it's even worse."" Analysis by BBC meteorologist David Braine Storm Evert is now on its way across to Scandinavia, and it will continue to weaken as it moves east so for us the worst is over. The area of low pressure was named by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office because of its potential to have a high impact on those on holiday - particularly in tents - businesses and infrastructure. In the end the highest gusts were on the Isles of Scilly at 69mph (111km/h), but many other locations had gusts above 50mph (80km/h). Staff at Bryher Campsite worked through the night to keep guests safe Bryher Campsite on the Isles of Scilly was forced to move some campers into a community hall overnight. ""We have had the campsite for six years, it's the worst storm we've ever had,"" said its owner Tom Matthews. ""The strength of the wind and the gusts last night was just something else. ""When it's weather like that and the potential of people in danger we have to do what we have to do."" People were also warned against any early-morning swims. ""It's a risk you don't need to take,"" said Cornwall Coastguard James Instance. ""If the sea is looking choppy, rough, different to what it normally would, there could well be rip currents which could get you into difficulty."" Allow Twitter content?

US sailor charged over massive 2020 warship blaze,"US Navy helicopters carried more than 1,500 water bucket drops to contain the raging fire The US Navy has filed charges against a sailor over a massive blaze aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard in 2020 that destroyed the amphibious warship. The sailor, whose name has not been publicly revealed, is accused of starting the fire, says Navy spokesperson Cmdr Sean Robertson. The blaze aboard the warship in San Diego, California, where the vessel was docked, took four days to put out. At least 40 sailors and 23 civilians were injured. In a statement, Cmdr Robertson said the accused sailor ""was a member of Bonhomme Richard's crew at the time"". ""Evidence collected during the investigation is sufficient to direct a preliminary hearing in accordance with due process under the military justice system,"" he said. The fire started on 12 July 2020, and over four days US Navy helicopters carried more than 1,500 water bucket drops and tug boats sprayed water on the $1bn (Â£716m) vessel's side to contain the blaze. The fire sent plumes of black smoke billowing into the air and the ravaged ship's melted aluminium superstructure bent at a 45-degree angle as flames engulfed the ship. The 40,000-ton USS Bonhomme Richard was commissioned in 1998 and was one of the few US amphibious assault vessels from which an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter could take off. But after the blaze the decision was taken to decommission and scrap the vessel because it was too expensive to restore it.

Shriever wins historic BMX racing gold,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Relive how GB's Bethany Shriever and Kye Whyte won historic BMX medals Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Britain's Bethany Shriever won gold in the women's BMX racing final, moments after team-mate Kye Whyte claimed the nation's first Olympic medal in the event with silver in the men's. Shriever, 22, was lifted into the air by Whyte as the pair celebrated their historic achievements in Tokyo. Afterneeding crowdfundingto be able to go to Japan, Shriever held off two-time champion Mariana Pajon to win. In the men's, Whyte was 0.114 seconds behind Dutch rider Niek Kimmann. Watch, listen & follow live text of the day seven action at Tokyo 2020 The pair retained their focus and composure after both finals were delayed by serious crashes. American rider Connor Fields, who was the favourite in the men's race, was taken off the track on a stretcher and then to hospital after a horrible crash in the third and final heat of his semi-final. An American team spokesperson later said Fields was ""awake"" and awaiting further evaluation, although the extent of his injuries was still not clear. Australia's Saya Sakakibara also needed medical attention after crashing in the women's semi-finals. Shriever was regarded as Great Britain BMX's next breakout star after winning the junior world title in 2017 but left the national set-up later that year after UK Sport said - based on results at senior level - it would only fund male riders. She chose to go solo and, as well as launching the crowdfunder in 2019, also worked part-time as a teaching assistant to help fund herself. Later in 2019, she returned to British Cycling with UK Sport's more flexible approach to funding allowing it to invest in her. Her effort and commitment was rewarded by a stunning ride in Tokyo that saw her end the reign of Colombia's Pajon, described by the Briton as her childhood idol. ""Honestly, I'm in shock. To even be here is an achievement in itself,"" said Shriever, who won all three of her semi-final races to qualify for the final. ""To make a final is another achievement in itself. To win a medal, let alone a gold medal, I'm over the moon. ""Winning a medal wasn't my goal - results are out of our control. To keep to my routine and keep cool around the track, I managed to hold and earn the win. It is crazy."" Whyte and Shriever celebrated together after winning medals on their Olympic debuts Both Shriever and 21-year-old Whyte were making their Olympic debuts in the Japanese capital, with Shriever saying she took extra inspiration from seeing her team-mate's success moments earlier. There were jubilant scenes as the pair celebrated their success together, Shriever then dropping to the track in exhaustion. ""I was watching him as I was going up. I was almost crying because he got a silver. I had to keep[ my cool and reset and just dig in. I gave it everything,"" said Shriever. ""I had nothing left, the lactic acid was crazy. I gave it absolutely everything I had."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Kye Whyte wins GB's first BMX medal claiming silver in a thrilling final Whyte has fought back from serious injury to earn his place on the Olympic podium. The rider arrived in Tokyo ranked 12th in the world, having finished fifth at the 2019 World Championships, but was unable to ride the Olympic test event in 2019 because of injury. ""The medal means everything to me,"" he said. ""It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is hard to get to the Olympics in the first place. To do well and get a medal, it is special."" Dubbed the Prince of Peckham, the Londoner looked stunned as he celebrated with his family back home on a video screen at trackside. Whyte later thanked his family - including his brother Tre, who won World Championship bronze in 2014 before retiring in 2020 - and members at the Peckham BMX Club for staying up in the early hours of the morning to watch his success. ""I reckon Trey might cry. My dad definitely did cry and my mum cried too. When I get back it will be crazy,"" said Whyte, who said the heavy medal was ""aching"" his neck. Former British BMX rider Shanaze Reade, who finished sixth in the London 2012 final, said the pair had put in the ""performances of their lives"". ""It is a credit to them both. To go to your first Olympic Games is nerve-wracking; to go to your first Olympic Games and actually win it and get a silver medal is unbelievable,"" said Reade, who is an analyst for BBC television. ""I always say a happy head is fast legs - both of those guys seemed so happy, so relaxed and took it in all stride. Their performances showed that.""

Shriever & Whyte win historic BMX medals,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Relive how GB's Bethany Shriever and Kye Whyte won historic BMX medals Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Britain's Bethany Shriever won gold in the women's BMX racing final, moments after team-mate Kye Whyte claimed the nation's first Olympic medal in the event with silver in the men's. Shriever, 22, was lifted into the air by Whyte as the pair celebrated their historic achievements in Tokyo. Afterneeding crowdfundingto be able to go to Japan, Shriever held off two-time champion Mariana Pajon to win. In the men's, Whyte was 0.114 seconds behind Dutch rider Niek Kimmann. Watch, listen & follow live text of the day seven action at Tokyo 2020 The pair retained their focus and composure after both finals were delayed by serious crashes. American rider Connor Fields, who was the favourite in the men's race, was taken off the track on a stretcher and then to hospital after a horrible crash in the third and final heat of his semi-final. An American team spokesperson later said Fields was ""awake"" and awaiting further evaluation, although the extent of his injuries was still not clear. Australia's Saya Sakakibara also needed medical attention after crashing in the women's semi-finals. Shriever was regarded as Great Britain BMX's next breakout star after winning the junior world title in 2017 but left the national set-up later that year after UK Sport said - based on results at senior level - it would only fund male riders. She chose to go solo and, as well as launching the crowdfunder in 2019, also worked part-time as a teaching assistant to help fund herself. Later in 2019, she returned to British Cycling with UK Sport's more flexible approach to funding allowing it to invest in her. Her effort and commitment was rewarded by a stunning ride in Tokyo that saw her end the reign of Colombia's Pajon, described by the Briton as her childhood idol. ""Honestly, I'm in shock. To even be here is an achievement in itself,"" said Shriever, who won all three of her semi-final races to qualify for the final. ""To make a final is another achievement in itself. To win a medal, let alone a gold medal, I'm over the moon. ""Winning a medal wasn't my goal - results are out of our control. To keep to my routine and keep cool around the track, I managed to hold and earn the win. It is crazy."" Whyte and Shriever celebrated together after winning medals on their Olympic debuts Both Shriever and 21-year-old Whyte were making their Olympic debuts in the Japanese capital, with Shriever saying she took extra inspiration from seeing her team-mate's success moments earlier. There were jubilant scenes as the pair celebrated their success together, Shriever then dropping to the track in exhaustion. ""I was watching him as I was going up. I was almost crying because he got a silver. I had to keep[ my cool and reset and just dig in. I gave it everything,"" said Shriever. ""I had nothing left, the lactic acid was crazy. I gave it absolutely everything I had.""

The rider arrived in Tokyo ranked 12th in the world, having finished fifth at the 2019 World Championships, but was unable to ride the Olympic test event in 2019 because of injury. ""The medal means everything to me,"" he said. ""It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is hard to get to the Olympics in the first place. To do well and get a medal, it is special."" Dubbed the Prince of Peckham, the Londoner looked stunned as he celebrated with his family back home on a video screen at trackside. Whyte later thanked his family - including his brother Tre, who won World Championship bronze in 2014 before retiring in 2020 - and members at the Peckham BMX Club for staying up in the early hours of the morning to watch his success. ""I reckon Trey might cry. My dad definitely did cry and my mum cried too. When I get back it will be crazy,"" said Whyte, who said the heavy medal was ""aching"" his neck. Former British BMX rider Shanaze Reade, who finished sixth in the London 2012 final, said the pair had put in the ""performances of their lives"". ""It is a credit to them both. To go to your first Olympic Games is nerve-wracking; to go to your first Olympic Games and actually win it and get a silver medal is unbelievable,"" said Reade, who is an analyst for BBC television. ""I always say a happy head is fast legs - both of those guys seemed so happy, so relaxed and took it in all stride. Their performances showed that.""

Bumble to give staff unlimited paid holiday,"Dating app Bumble has said its 700 employees can take unlimited paid leave providing their manager approves it. It is understood that the unlimited holiday is contingent on staff still managing to complete their work. The move comes after the firmtemporarily closed its offices in June for a weekto combat workplace stress. The new leave policy was announced alongside a series of other changes, including a plan to shut the office for a week two times a year. Bumble said the pandemic had made it ""reflect on"" the ways staff worked and prompted the change in approach. ""It's becoming increasingly clear that the way that we work, and need to work, has changed and our new policies are a reflection of what really matters and how we can best support our teams in both their work and life,"" said Bumble president Tariq Shaukat. Bumble said when the firm shuts down, some customer staff across its offices in Austin, Barcelona, London and Moscow will still work in case any of the app's users experience issues. All Bumble staff given week off to de-stress The tech billionaire who is putting women first A year of working from home and juggling childcare when schools were closed and other responsibilities mounted, has prompted many businesses to look again at the traditional working week. Accountancy firmPrice WaterhouseCooper said earlier this yearthat staff would be able to work from home a couple of days a week and start as early or late as they wanted. The building society Nationwide also told its staff they can choose whether to work at home or in the office. Oil giant BP has told office staff they can spend two days a week working from home and several banks are examining hybrid home-office arrangements. Pre-pandemic some small firms already offered staff unlimited leave, including theoboss of Virgin Group, Sir Richard Branson, who offered his 170 personal staff as much holiday as they wanted. But critics say it can backfire, with staff actually taking less holiday as a result. This video can not be played CEO Secrets: Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe says don't take yourself too seriously Ben Gately, chief operating officer at UK software firm CharlieHR, ended up offering staff other benefits such as more flexible working hours instead. ""People didn't take enough [holiday],""Ben Gately told the BBC at the time. ""People are pretty bad at taking holiday, we're all scared to do it because we have to do our handovers and pass stuff over and meet deadlines. ""There's a huge amount of anxiety about not knowing the limit. A bunch of our team came to us and said: 'Actually we'd love to know where the line is. Is it okay to take 35 days? Is it okay to take 25 days? Where should I draw the line?' Because the reality is that it's not actually unlimited."" Bumble has said it's also offering staff additional types of paid leave including 20 days for staff who are victims of domestic violence and other violent crimes and a minimum of 15 days bereavement leave for miscarriages. Dating app Bumble tops $13bn in market debut Tinder to introduce in-app background checks Lisa King OBE, director of communications and external relations at domestic abuse charity Refuge, told the BBC more workplaces needed to be empathetic to employees who may be experiencing domestic abuse. ""Domestic abuse is the biggest social issue impacting women and children and it's great to see that companies are beginning to recognise this and place it at the centre of their policies. We hope that other companies follow their lead,"" she continued. Whitney Wolfe Herd launched Bumble in Texas in 2014 Bumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers. With lockdown restrictions, the dating app saw a the number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, up by 30% to 2.8 million, in thethree months to 31 March,external, compared with the same period last year. Its founder Whitney Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. Bumble shares however, have shed 25% since the company's initial public offering in February. Ms Wolfe Herd also co-founded dating app Tinder, but left the firm alleging sexual harassment. Tinder's parent company Match Group Inc, which denied the claims and later tried unsuccessfully to acquire Bumble, paid about $1m to settle the dispute. The company has 42 million monthly users in over 150 countries and recently announced plans for a new cafÃ© and wine bar in New York.

Thornley claims another fourth for GB rowers,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's men's eight crew win bronze in 'incredible' final Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Great Britain failed to win an Olympic rowing gold for the first Games since 1980 as the men's eight crew took bronze in the final race of the Tokyo 2020 regatta. The British eight were pipped to silver by Germany as New Zealand took gold. It was Team GB's second rowing medal in Tokyo - their lowest total at a Games since the same number at Atlanta '96. Earlier, Britain's Vicky Thornley was edged out of a medal despite a late push in the women's single scull. The 33-year-old Welsh rower finished 0.67 seconds behind Austria's Magdalena Lobnig in the race for bronze. Britain finished in fourth place in six events at the Sea Forest Waterway. Team GB was the leading rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016, claiming six, nine and five medals respectively at those Games. Dame Katherine Grainger, Britain's five-time Olympic rowing gold medallist and UK Sport chair, insisted winning only two medals in Tokyo is ""not a disaster"". ""Six fourth places are so close, but so far. We've been spoiled by rowing for so many Games but it takes a while to build and we will build again,"" said Grainger.

Germany finished strongly in the final stages to ensure the British crew of Moe Sbihi, Tom Ford, Josh Bugajski, Jacob Dawson, Tom George, Charles Elwes, Oliver Wynne-Griffith, James Rudkin - plus cox Harry Fieldman - had to settle for bronze. Team GB's only other rowing medal was the silver claimed by Harry Leask, Angus Groom, Tom Barras and Jack Beaumont in a tight men's quadruple sculls race on Wednesday. Two medals is the return from Â£24.66m of funding given to Olympic rowing by UK Sport for Tokyo 2020. ""At a time when the national budget is under pressure from so many areas - is that a good enough investment?"" said two-time Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell. In December it was announced thathad been reduced by about 10% to Â£22.2mduring the Paris 2024 cycle. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Vicky Thornley fourth in single sculls Thornley, who won silver with Grainger in Rio 2016's double sculls, was bidding to become the first British woman to claim a medal in the event. An emotional Thornley said she didn't think she could have ""done anything more"" after switching from the doubles. Her journey to Tokyo was far from smooth, however. The 2017 World Championship silver medallist was unable to defend her title the following year as a result of over-training, then broke her elbow in May last year after being knocked off her bike. Thornley was involved in more road drama in May,having to run for her life,externalseconds before a car collided with another vehicle and caught fire. ""I set out to find out what it takes as an individual and I wanted to have a go in the single,"" she said. ""I've given it absolutely everything I've got in the last five years."" New Zealand's Emma Twigg cruised to gold in the single scull, with Hannah Prakatsen, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, taking silver. ""I knew I was racing for bronze, I'm not going to lie. I didn't think gold or silver were attainable,"" said Thornley. ""It was about me and Lobnig. I thought she would go out hard again but that I could reel her back in. Fair play to her, she's an awesome athlete. ""Maybe I let it get away a bit too much in the first bit but I was confident I could come through in the second half. In the last 100 I just fell away."" Grainger, in her role as an analyst for BBC television, said she was ""so, so proud"" of her former rowing partner. ""A lot of people wouldn't have expected her to get to the final, necessarily,"" said the five-time medallist. ""Although it is a fourth - again - that is history made. It is the highest any female scull has come at the Olympic Games.""
