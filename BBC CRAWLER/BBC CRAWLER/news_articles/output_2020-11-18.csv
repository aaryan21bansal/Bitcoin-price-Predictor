Black cabs kept in fields as demand 'evaporates',"Dozens of black cabs have been stored in a yard in east London after a drop in passengers in the capital One in five black cabs has been taken off London's roads since June due to a lack of passengers during the coronavirus pandemic, research reveals. The number of vehicles fell from 18,900 on 7 June to 15,000 on 8 November, Transport for London (TfL) data shows. Black cab rental firms have had to hire fields and car parks to store vehicles handed back by drivers. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association  (LTDA) says only 20% of drivers still have their vehicles in the capital. General secretary Steve McNamara said London cabbies were earning ""starvation wages"", at around a quarter of normal levels. Drivers ""are doing desperate things"" such as selling their taxis for well below market value to ""get through the next few months"", he added. Many have received ""no income at all"" since March, Mr McNamara said. ""We're in a position now where London could lose this icon,"" he said. ""We're a very viable business. We're an integral part of this city's DNA."" Cab driver Andy Biggs says London is as ""dead as it has ever been"" London cabbie Andy Biggs, 63, said demand had ""evaporated"" and he was lucky if he had three customers a day. ""When we first went back after the initial lockdown, things started to get a little bit better very slowly,"" he said. ""But now it's as dead as it's ever been."" LTDA figures show drivers arriving at Heathrow Airport last month waited an average of nine hours before being dispatched to pick up a passenger. Over 200 unused black cabs parked in a large area of farmland in Epping Forest Howard Taylor, 60, who has been a cab driver in the capital for more than three decades, said he went to work with ""no expectation at all"" of being hailed for a ride. ""I've never seen London like it. In 33 years I've never seen it as quiet, as desolate and depressing."" North London-based rental company GB Taxi Services has seen the occupation rate of its fleet of 100 black cabs drop from 95% before the crisis to just 10%. It is one of two firms using an area of farmland in Epping Forest, Essex, to store about 220 unwanted taxis so they can stop paying to insure them. Taxi rental firm Sherbet London says 2,000 London taxis are currently being kept in fields Another rental firm, Sherbet London, has hired a car park to store 400 cabs, representing two-thirds of its fleet. Chief executive Asher Moses said: ""The whole trade has suffered. There must be 2,000 taxis on fields at the moment."" TfL said it had provided drivers with ""practical advice on a number of issues"" during the crisis, and added that black cabs ""remain an integral part of the transport network"".

Tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as Hurricane Iota hit Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. The rainfall is expected to cause mudslides and potentially deadly flash flooding and river flooding.

McDonald's sorry for stopping couriers using toilets,"McDonald's has apologised to food delivery drivers after they were denied access to its toilets in lockdown. It comes after the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) had to remindrestaurants of their legal obligations,externalfollowing complaints from couriers. Fast food chains KFC, Subway, Nando's and Wagamama have also been accused of blocking access to their facilities. Under health and safety law, restaurants must give drivers access to ""suitable sanitary conveniences"". ""We apologise to any courier that has been affected,"" McDonald's said. ""We are sorry to hear that on some occasions this guidance has not been implemented, and we will be reminding our restaurant teams about the policy."" Should you tip the takeaway delivery driver? The dangerous life of food delivery drivers Takeaway delivery drivers have been crucial through the pandemic to enable restaurants to continue to trade. But the HSE said it had received complaints suggesting some restaurants were breaching the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations of 1992. These not only oblige restaurants to provide toilet access for delivery drivers, but also washing facilities at ""readily accessible places"". Nandos said it was reminding its restaurants of the rules In a joint letter to restaurant chains earlier this month, the HSE and the Department for Transport said: ""Ensuring that hygiene facilities are readily available to visiting drivers is especially important during the current Covid-19 crisis, to avoid unwanted public health implications and to help tackle the spread of the virus."" This was at a time ""when there are fewer locations operating with facilities that drivers can access"", it added. A spokesman for Nando's, which has also been accused to denying toilet access, said its policy was to let delivery drivers use the facilities at all of its restaurants. ""We've reiterated this to all restaurants again [this week],"" he added. A KFC spokesman said guest toilets were available for couriers at its outlets, adding: ""We're ensuring all our team members are aware this is the case."" The BBC has approached Subway and Wagamama for comment. The App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU) called McDonald's apology a ""welcome step"". ""However, the entire process for food pick up at McDonalds is a shambles which needs urgent management attention,"" general secretary James Farrar told the BBC. The Unite union agreed, stressing that fast food chains and restaurants needed to heed their legal obligations to delivery drivers. ""The restaurant's staff will still be able to use the toilets and food couriers have the same legal rights to use the toilets,"" said Unite national officer Adrian Jones. ""McDonald's must end the ban which is endangering the health of the couriers and their customers or the Health and Safety Executive should take immediate action.""

Facebook accused of forcing staff back to offices,"Content moderators say they have Facebook's ""most brutal job"" More than 200 Facebook workers from around the world have accused the firm of forcing its content moderators back to the office despite the risks of contracting coronavirus. The claims came inan open letter,externalthat said the firm was ""needlessly risking"" lives to maintain profits. They called on Facebook to make changes to allow more remote work and offer other benefits, such as hazard pay. Facebook said ""a majority"" of content reviewers are working from home. ""While we believe in having an open internal dialogue, these discussions need to be honest,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""The majority of these 15,000 global content reviewers have been working from home and will continue to do so for the duration of the pandemic."" What does my boss have to do to keep me safe? The people policing the internet's most horrific content Facebook to pay $52m to moderators over PTSD In August, Facebook said staff could work from home until the summer of 2021. But the social media giant relies on thousands of contractors, who officially work for other companies such as Accenture and CPL, to spot materials on the site that violate its policies, such as spam, child abuse and disinformation. The letter comes a day after Mr Zuckerberg was grilled by Washington lawmakers over its handling of problematic posts In the open letter, the workers said the call to return to the office had come after Facebook's efforts to rely more on artificial intelligence to spot problematic posts had come up short. ""After months of allowing content moderators to work from home, faced with intense pressure to keep Facebook free of hate and disinformation, you have forced us back to the office,"" they said. ""Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral."" This letter gives a fascinating behind the scenes glimpse into what is happening at Facebook - and all is not well. Mark Zuckerberg's dream is that AI moderation will one day solve some of the platform's problems. The idea is that machine learning and sophisticated software will automatically pick up and block things like hate speech or child abuse. Facebook claims that nearly 95% of offending posts are picked up before they are flagged. Yet it's still easy to find grim stuff on Facebook. On Monday I published a piece showing the kinds of racist and misogynistic content aimed at Kamala Harris on the platform. Facebook removed some of the content, however even though I flagged it to Facebook, some of it is still there - a week after I reported it. What this letter suggests is that AI is simply not working as Facebook execs would hope. Of course, these are voices of moderators - Facebook will have a different take. You could also argue that human voices may have a vested interest to say AI doesn't work. But clearly, as the spotlight is well and truly on Facebook, there are internal problems that have now spilled out into the open. Facebook said the reviewers have access to health care and that it had ""exceeded health guidance on keeping facilities safe for any in-office work"". But the workers said only those with a doctor's note are currently excused from working in an office and called on Facebook to offer hazard pay and make its contractors full-time staff. ""Before the pandemic, content moderation was easily Facebook's most brutal job. We waded through violence and child abuse for hours on end. Moderators working on child abuse content had targets increased during the pandemic, with no additional support,"" they said. ""Now, on top of work that is psychologically toxic, holding onto the job means walking into a hot zone."" The letter is addressed to Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, as well as the chiefs of Accenture and CPL. It was organised by UK law firm Foxglove, which works on tech policy issues. More than 170 of the signatories were anonymous. Facebook is not the only company to face staff worries about in-person work amid the pandemic. Amazon has also come under fire for conditions in its warehouses, while outbreaks at firms from manufacturers to finance companies have stirred fears. It comes just a day after Washington lawmakers grilled Mr Zuckerberg on the firm's content review policies. What are the new working from home rules?

New York City closes all schools amid Covid spike,"This video can not be played Dr Anthony Fauci asks families to weigh up the risks of their Thanksgiving plans The US has recorded more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, a bleak marker as cases soar once again across the country. According to Johns Hopkins University, the country has now reported 250,029 deaths and nearly 11.5 million cases. It has more reported infections and a higher death toll than any other country worldwide. And cases have once again started to soar throughout the US, hitting new daily highs in the last week. Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, top US infectious diseases Dr Anthony Fauci said the country was ""going in the wrong direction at a very precarious time"", with people more likely to gather inside as the weather gets colder. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? New York City - the epicentre of the US outbreak in the spring - has ordered the closure of its schools from Thursday, amid a spike in cases. The decision to close the US's largest public school system came as positive test rates for the virus surpassed the 3% threshold, officials say. It will affect some 300,000 children. In an interview on the BBC News channel, Dr Fauci warned about the new surge in cases leading to more deaths. ""It's a very serious situation because there are lagging indicators,"" he said. ""So when you see the massive increase in cases as we're seeing now particularly as more and more people are doing things inside, we're in a very difficult situation."" He repeated his call for people to ""double down"" on public health measures, such as wearing face coverings, physical distancing and avoiding crowds. ""They sound so simple and we know they can work. But there's a degree of Covid fatigue - people just are worn out with these restrictions,"" Dr Fauci said. He urged people to ""hold out for just a little longer because help is on the way"" in the form of vaccines. At the end of March - when the US had recorded 2,200 deaths -Dr Fauci predicted the pandemic could kill up to 200,000 Americansand infect millions more. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading On Wednesdaydata released by Pfizer and BioNTechsaid the vaccine they had developed to tackle the virus appeared to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech published preliminary data suggestingthe vaccine offered 90% protection against Covid-19and said there were no safety concerns. This was followed by data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernasuggesting nearly 95% protection andsimilarly promising results from trials of another developed in Russia called Sputnik. A letter from New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza released on Wednesday informed parents that all schools would close and classrooms would immediately shift to online learning ""until further notice"". ""You will hear from your principal shortly about next steps for you and your student. Please note that this is a temporary closure, and school buildings will reopen as soon as it is safe to do so."" The move comes only eight weeks after the school system reopened to students. It is the latest city to close school and shift to online learning after Boston and Detroit, with Las Vegas and Philadelphia delaying plans to return pupils to classrooms. Some pupils in Brooklyn took classes outside in September Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor, said: ""No one is happy about this decision. We all in fact are feeling very sad about this decision because so much good work has been put into keeping the schools open, opening them up to begin with."" However, he said that officials had ""set a very clear standard"" on safety metrics that needed to be met in order for schools to take pupils, ""and we need to stick to that standard"". ""I want to emphasise to parents, to educators, to staff, to kids that we will intend to come back and come back as quickly as possible,"" he said. The school closure is the latest measure amid attempts to curb a fresh outbreak of cases. Last week further restrictions were put into place - including bars and restaurants moving to takeaway-only after 22:00 and parties at private residences being limited to 10 people. Officials in other states are taking similar measures. On Wednesday Minnesota and Kentucky ordered all restaurants and bars to temporarily stop indoor eating. This video can not be played ""I don't need your instruction"": Two US senators clash on wearing face masks in the chamber The decision to close the schools is in contrast to measures in Europe, where businesses have closed but schools largely remain open. The move, which represents a major backslide for the city's coronavirus recovery, has also left parents scrambling for last-minute childcare options. As infections rise throughout the country, the healthcare system is struggling to cope. In the Texan city of El Paso the convention centre was recently converted into a makeshift hospital. Some patients are being airlifted elsewhere in the state due to the overcrowded facilities, and authorities have requested ten refrigerated trailers to use as mobile morgues.

Trump campaign seeks partial recount in Wisconsin,"President Trump's supporters rallied outside the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison as the election results were counted President Donald Trump is to seek a partial recount of votes in the state of Wisconsin, which his rival Joe Biden is projected to win by 20,000 votes. Hours before a Wednesday deadline, the Trump campaign said it wanted a recount in the counties of Milwaukee and Dane, alleging irregularities. Mr Trump has been making unsubstantiated claims of fraud and refusing to initiate a handover. Mr Biden says delaying the transition will damage the US pandemic response. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election The Trump campaign has filed a flurry of lawsuits contesting the results in key states, although election officials say there is no evidence of widespread irregularities. Despite the lack of proof, up to half of Republican voters believe the president's claim that the election was rigged against him, a Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests. President-elect Biden, a Democrat, is projected to have won the popular vote by more than 5.6 million ballots - 3.6 percentage points. In the US electoral college system that decides the presidency, he has 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232. Refuting Trump cost cyber-security official his job No, voting machines didn't delete millions of Trump ballots Obama: One election won't stop US 'truth decay' The president would have to overturn results in at least three states to win the election, which analysts say would be unprecedented. A manual recount has been taking place in Georgia, where Mr Biden is 14,000 votes ahead. Results are expected to be released later on Thursday. Under Wisconsin law, Mr Trump has the right to request a recount because the margin of Mr Biden's win was less than 1% but greater than 0.25%. However, his campaign must first cover the expenses of the operation. State officials said on Wednesday they had received $3m (Â£2.2m) from the Trump campaign to cover the costs of the recount, which is expected to take about two weeks. The Wisconsin Elections Commission said on Monday that a full recount would have cost an estimated $7.9m. In its request for a partial recount, the Trump re-election campaign alleged that absentee ballots - those made by post - had been altered and improperly issued, and voter identity laws had been circumvented. It did not provide any evidence. Milwaukee and Dane, both traditionally Democratic-leaning areas, together represent more than a third of Mr Biden's Wisconsin votes, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. In Milwaukee, Mr Biden won by 317,270 votes to 134,357 while in Dane County the margin was 260,185 to 78,800 in Mr Biden's favour. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Trump campaign lawyers had a one-day window to file for a recount in Wisconsin - and took advantage of it. They only want to review the ballots in two heavily Democratic counties around college-town Madison and big-city Milwaukee, however. That suggests that the real purpose behind the move isn't to arrive at an accurate tabulation of the votes, but rather to find what they allege are incidents of voter fraud in Democratic-dominated areas. Four years ago,a statewide recount funded by the Green Partyresulted in a shift of only a few hundred votes. Given that Trump trails in the state by more than 20,000, any recount - partial or full - seems all but certain to leave Joe Biden still on top when all is said and done. The Trump request, however, allows the campaign to continue to assert that it is doing everything possible to challenge the election results, preserving the hopes of Trump loyalists across the country. The clock is ticking, though. Over the next few weeks, barring a stunning reversal of fortune, states will certify the results. The slow grind toward Biden's inauguration in January will continue, whether the president acknowledges it or not. The latest move in Wisconsin comes a day after Mr Trump fired a top cyber-security official who had contradicted his claims of voter fraud. President Trump said he ""terminated"" Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) chief Chris Krebs for his ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on vote integrity. Refuting Trump cost cyber-security official his job Mr Krebs had reportedly angered the White House over a Cisa website calledRumor Control,external, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by Mr Trump himself. This video can not be played Barack Obama tells the BBC about the ""crazy conspiracies"" and ""truth decay"" in US politics Mr Trump's refusal to acknowledge defeat and initiate a transition of power has infuriated Joe Biden and other Democrats. Mr Biden has warned that without co-ordination over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, ""people may die"" if a smooth transition does not take place. The government agency that launches the process - the General Services Administration (GSA), headed by a Trump appointee - has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as the winners of the 2020 election. The Trump campaign faces a deadline of 8 December to resolve all election disputes. Official results are set to be confirmed when the US Electoral College meets on 14 December. Meanwhile,Georgiaelection officials said a statewide recount due to be announced on Thursday was not expected to overturn Mr Biden's victory in the state, or provide any evidence to back up Mr Trump's claims of fraud. But the audit did find thousands of previously untallied ballots, which the state voting system manager said would pare Mr Biden's lead over Mr Trump from 14,156 to 12,781. A Trump lawsuit filed on 4 November tried to pause the count, alleging problems with ballot processing, but a judge dismissed it the next day. InArizonaon Wednesday, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, said she was receiving escalating threats of violence, as she blamed the president and members of Congress for spreading disinformation about the results. InPennsylvaniaon Wednesday, the Trump campaign asked a judge to allow them to put back into their lawsuit claims that they dropped on Sunday. They want to restore their claim that Republican observers were improperly blocked from watching the vote count. InMichiganon Tuesday, Republican members of a bipartisan election board refused to certify Mr Biden's win in that state, only to back down after an outcry. Joe Biden is due to be inaugurated as the 46th US president on 20 January The two Republicans on the four-member board had objected to minor voting irregularities in Wayne County, home to Detroit. But they relented after Democrats accused them of trying to disenfranchise voters in the majority-black city. As a compromise, the board passed a resolution requesting that Michigan's Democratic secretary of state conduct an audit of the jurisdictions involved. Meanwhile,Nevada'sRepublican party along with the Trump campaign has filed another lawsuit challenging Mr Biden's win there. It claims - without evidence - that ""fraud and abuse renders the purported results of the Nevada election illegitimate"". The latest legal action asks a judge to declare Mr Trump ""winner of the election in Nevada"" or, alternatively, that the results are annulled. What happens now?

Family Christmas get-togethers being considered,"Ministers are looking at how to relax coronavirus restrictions so families can celebrate Christmas together. The government's medical adviser on Covid, Susan Hopkins, said they were working on a plan and wanted Christmas to be ""as close to normal as possible"". She said tough restrictions might be needed before and after the holiday to allow mixing to take place. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said any rule change would be for a limited time, maybe just a few days. The prime minister's official spokesman confirmed ministers were ""looking at ways to ensure that people can spend time with close family over Christmas at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year"". It comes afterthe Sun reported that families may be able to mix indoors,externalfor five days from Christmas Eve. All four UK nations - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - are trying to work out a common approach to Christmas so families spread across the UK can still meet up. Our correspondent said any final decisions would not be made for a few weeks while health chiefs wait to see whether cases have started to come down during the  lockdown in England. But, he said, the advice was likely to urge families not to hold big gatherings and to travel by car, rather than public transport. Scientific advice indicates that for every day that measures are relaxed, five days of tighter restrictions would be needed.

Four UK nations discuss joint Christmas Covid plan Hospitals warn covid admissions 'rapidly rising' The government has recorded another 19,609 Covid cases in the UK and 529 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. England is expected to come out of its second national lockdown on 2 December and return to thetier systemof localised restrictions, with household mixing banned indoors in the top two tiers. This video can not be played 'We're keen to have Christmas as close to normal as possible' Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Dr Hopkins, from Public Health England, suggested restrictions could be needed either side of Christmas if curbs were to be eased over the festive period. She said two days of tighter restrictions would be required for every one day relaxed - although officials later clarified the advice is actually for five days. People would need to be ""very careful"" about the contacts they have in the lead-up to Christmas and would have to be ""responsible"" and reduce contacts again after the festive period, she added. She said she knew ministers were ""working hard to develop an outline"" of what the new tiers would look like after 2 December and what Christmas would look like. The BBC has been told new tougher regional tiers could see pubs and restaurants closed entirely in areas in the top tier throughout the festive period. Strict rules on meeting up and social distancing have meant millions of people have been unable to hug, or sometimes even see, close family for many months. Chris, from Norfolk, said he feared this might be the last Christmas his father, who has advanced cancer, has with his three grandchildren. ""I'm not interested in Christmas as a party or celebration. All I want is one day,""he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Downing Street said Christmas would not be normal but the prime minister would look at the latest data to make decisions and an update would be given next week. Earlier, Cabinet minister Alok Sharma said it was too early for ""conclusions"" but he wanted to see his family for Christmas. Mr Sharma told BBC Breakfast people needed to keep bearing down on the infection and ""do our bit"". Virtual office Christmas parties organised on Zoom Visitor tests in all care homes 'by Christmas' Travel rules changed for Christmas turkey workers On Tuesday, Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, suggested extending support bubbles to up to four households to allow families to celebrate Christmas together. This year, Christmas Eve falls on Thursday and there is a bank holiday on the following Monday, giving most workers at least a four-day break. Prof Ferguson also warned that reopening pubs and restaurants in the run-up to Christmas would be likely to lead to rising infection levels. What to do about Christmas is delicately poised. On the one hand, allowing mixing over the festive period will undoubtedly lead to an increase in infections. What is more, there are concerns the impact of lockdown will be more limited than hoped. We are yet to see infections rates start falling - although it is still early days - so there will be no final decision on Christmas yet. But stamping down on the virus is, of course, not the be all and end all. Providing an opportunity to meet will bring much needed respite from the hard slog of the pandemic. But there is also a widespread recognition that even if the government bans mixing at Christmas, significant numbers of people may well ignore it. The fear is that then starts to normalise breaking the restrictions and will make compliance worse over the rest of winter. The expectation is that there will be some limited relaxation - in the hope that the psychological boost it will give the public and the longer-term goodwill it will engender will outweigh any cost in terms of virus spread. That much was clear from the Downing Street briefing when government advisers admitted publicly for the first time that it may be on the cards. But the pay-off for that could be tighter regional restrictions on hospitality in the areas with the highest rates all through the festive period. There have been calls for a single approach from the devolved administrations in the UK about Christmas - so families who live in different nations can deal with a single set of rules. Welsh ministers have said it could beweeks before an announcement on Covid rules is made, and warned this year's festive period would ""not be like normal"". Ministers in Northern Ireland said they would do all they could to""protect"" as much of Christmas as possible. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidnew, stricter measures announced on Tuesdaywere needed, in part, to allow the possibility of people meeting up over Christmas. ""We are all desperate for some normality around Christmas and I absolutely include myself in that,"" Ms Sturgeon said.

William welcomes inquiry into BBC Diana interview,"Prince William alongside his mother and brother, Princess Diana and Prince Harry, in 1995 The Duke of Cambridge says a new investigation into how the BBC secured an interview with his mother in 1995 is ""a step in the right direction"". The BBC has promised to ""get to the truth"" about the events surrounding the Panorama interview with Princess Diana. Diana's brother has alleged the BBC's Martin Bashir used forged bank statements to convince her to do it. Kensington Palace said in a statement that Prince William ""tentatively welcomed the investigation"". The prince, whose mother died in 1997, added: ""The independent investigation is a step in the right direction. ""It should help establish the truth behind the actions that led to the Panorama interview and subsequent decisions taken by those in the BBC at the time."" BBC vows to 'get to truth' about Diana interview 'Dark cloud over BBC journalism' says Lord Grade Diana's brother makes new BBC interview allegations On Wednesday, the BBC announced that Lord Dyson, one of the country's most senior retired judges and a former Supreme Court judge, had been appointed to lead the inquiry. The BBC's director general, Tim Davie, said: ""The BBC is determined to get to the truth about these events and that is why we have commissioned an independent investigation. ""Lord Dyson is an eminent and highly respected figure who will lead a thorough process."" Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, called for an independent inquiry earlier this month, saying ""sheer dishonesty"" was used to secure the interview with the princess. In a letter to Mr Davie,reported by the Daily Mail,,externalthe earl said Bashir had used forged bank statements - which wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister. Earl Spencer wrote: ""If it were not for me seeing these statements, I would not have introduced Bashir to my sister."" In another Daily Mail interview,,externalhe also alleged that the then Panorama reporter made a number of false and defamatory claims about senior royals during a meeting with him, in order to gain his trust and access to his sister. These claims included that Diana's private correspondence was being opened, her car tracked and phones tapped - described by the Mail as ""preposterous lies"". Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor, is recovering from heart surgery and complications from Covid-19 and has been unable to comment on Earl Spencer's allegations. Martin Bashir left the BBC in 2004 but rejoined in 2016 1. What steps did the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir take with a view to obtaining the Panorama interview in 1995? This will include looking at the mocked up bank statements, alleged payments to members of the royal household, and other issues raised by Earl Spencer. 2. Were those steps appropriate, particularly in regard to the BBC's editorial standards at the time? 3. To what extent did the actions of the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir influence Diana's decision to give an interview? 4. What knowledge did the BBC have in 1995 and 1996 of the relevant evidence, such as the forged bank statements? 5. How effectively did the BBC investigate the circumstances leading to the interview? These terms of reference for the investigation were set by Lord Dyson and agreed by the BBC. The BBC said the investigation would start straight away and it was handing over ""all of its relevant records"". Last week, the broadcaster revealed thata previously missing note from Diana, thought to indicate she was happy with the way her interview by BBC Panorama was obtained, had been found and would be handed over to the investigation. Leading the inquiry will be Lord Dyson, who was Master of the Rolls - the second most senior judge in England and Wales - for four years until he retired in October 2016. His other influential positions have included being a Justice of the UK's Supreme Court - the highest court in the country - and a Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. Dame Melanie Dawes, chief executive of the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, welcomed the inquiry. She saidin a letter sent to Mr Davie,externalthat Ofcom would follow the inquiry and its conclusions closely. Lord John Dyson as Master of the Rolls before his retirement in 2016 Almost 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama programme 25 years ago. In it, the princess famously said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to the Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time, Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. She died on 31 August 1997, aged 36, in a car crash in Paris.

Pfizer vaccine is '94% effective in over-65s',"The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old. More data released from their continuing phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. The companies say they will now apply for authorisation for emergency use of the jab in the US. The trial involved 41,000 people worldwide. Half were given the vaccine, and half a placebo. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech published preliminary data suggestingthe vaccine offered 90% protection against Covid-19and said there were no safety concerns. This was followed by data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernasuggesting nearly 95% protection andsimilarly promising results from trials of another developed in Russia, called Sputnik. Wednesday's data from Pfizer and BioNTech, which builds on last week's data, suggests the vaccine is 95% effective based on 170 cases of Covid-19 developing in volunteers. Just eight were in the group given the vaccine, suggesting it offers good protection. The rest of the cases were in the placebo group given a dummy jab. In older adults, who are most at risk from the virus and have weaker immune systems, the vaccine worked as well as it did in younger people. Scientists said the data was further encouraging news, with Prof Trudie Lang from the University of Oxford describing it as ""a remarkable and very reassuring situation"". ""To go from identifying a new virus to having several vaccines at the point of applying for regulatory approval is an incredible milestone for science,"" she said. Will there be more than one coronavirus vaccine? Is the vaccine safe to take? And other questions Although the full trial data has yet to be published, the companies say there have been no serious safety concerns. But they did notice fatigue in 3.8%  of volunteers given the vaccine and headaches in 2%, both after the second dose, although older people seemed to experience minimal side effects. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? There is also evidence that the vaccine protects against severe Covid - but this is based on only 10 cases. It's still unclear how long protection from the vaccine lasts and if it stops people transmitting the virus. In the trial, 42% of all participants are from diverse ethnic backgrounds and 41% are aged between 56 and 85 years old. More vaccine good news is what we've all been waiting for. This time it's really encouraging to know the Pfizer vaccine seems to work on older people as effectively as in younger ones. But this vaccine is still a long way off widespread use. First, regulators need to be absolutely sure in their own minds that it's safe - not least because Moderna and Pfizer both use an experimental technology that's never been approved before. That process could still take a few weeks. Then there's the massive issue of availability. Pfizer is promising 50 million doses by the end of the year. But remember: it's a two-shot vaccine. Perhaps one of the biggest problems is that wealthy countries have already swooped in to buy up the first batches that will be ready. That's good news for a country such as the UK, but not such good news for developing countries which haven't got the money to place bids. That's why so much hinges on other vaccines such as the Oxford AstraZeneca one, as they may be more scalable, and there are more advanced plans to get it to low- and middle-income countries through a UN-backed project called Covax. The trial, which is testing people at 150 sites in the US, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina, will collect data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for another two years. The companies behind it expect to produce up to 50 million doses of the vaccine this year and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The UK has pre-ordered 40 million doses and should get 10 million by the end of the year. It has also ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is planning to release data from its phase three trial soon. There are hundreds of vaccines in development around the world, and about a dozen in the final stages of testing, known as phase three. The first two to show any results - made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna - both use an experimental approach, called mRNA, which involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system. Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus. The Sputnik vaccine, developed in Russia, has also released early data from phase three based on a smaller number of volunteers and Covid cases. There are some logistical challenges with mRNA vaccines, namely the need to store them at cold temperatures. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored at about minus 80C, although it can be kept in a fridge for five days. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at minus 20C for up to six months and kept in a standard fridge for up to a month. Prof Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the full data would have to be submitted to bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for approval. ""We can expect both agencies to conduct a very careful evaluation and we can rely on their conclusions,"" he said. This process could take several weeks. Correction 26 March 2021: This article was amended to make clear that fatigue was noted in a slightly higher percentage of volunteers than headaches after the second dose.

"Bring back 'persecuted' Corbyn, allies demand","This video can not be played Len McCluskey accuses Labour of a ""witch hunt"" over Jeremy Corbyn Allies of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have called for him to be reinstated as one of the party's MPs, arguing he is being ""persecuted"" by successor Sir Keir Starmer. Unite union leader Len McCluskey described Sir Keir's decision not to bring back Mr Corbyn as ""a witch hunt"". And former Labour chairman Ian Lavery called it ""undemocratic"". But Sir Keir said Mr Corbyn's remarks on the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had ""undermined"" trust. The parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, MP Margaret Hodge, said the decision ""did a lot to restore [Sir Keir's] credibility"" and had stopped her from resigning from the party. ""[Mr Corbyn] is not a victim,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We have been the victim of the anti-Semitism."" But Mr McCluskey told reporters: ""It looks to me very much like a witch-hunt and a persecution of a decent man."" Starmer: Corbyn will not return as Labour MP What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Mr Corbyn was suspended from Labour at the end of October after a damning report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) on the party's response to allegations of anti-Semitism during his tenure as leader. The move followed him saying opponents had ""dramatically overstated"" the scale of the problem within Labour for political gain. The party's ruling body decided on Tuesday to readmit Mr Corbyn as a member. But this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP, and on Wednesday Sir Keir decided not to restore the party whip to his predecessor - meaning he will continue to sit in the House of Commons as an independent. Sir Keir promised to keep the situation under review. There is no doubt Jeremy Corbyn's supporters will keep objecting loudly to what has happened, and that could get extremely bumpy. But cracking down on anti-Semitism is meant to be at the top of Sir Keir Starmer's to-do list. If he wanted to keep the promise he made solemnly to the Jewish community, did he really have any choice? Read Laura's blog in full Board of Deputies of British Jews president Marie van der Zyl said Sir Keir had ""taken the appropriate leadership decision"", adding Mr Corbyn had been ""shameless and remorseless for what he has put the Jewish community through"". Shadow justice minister Peter Kyle tweeted in support of Sir Keir, saying: ""We knew there would be moments that challenge and test us. The last 24 hours were unnecessarily difficult but Keir Starmer has acted authoritatively. We are moving forward."" And fellow Labour MP Margaret Hodge - parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement - said Mr Corbyn had ""refused to himself accept the findings of the EHRC report, refused to apologise for his actions and refused to take any responsibility"". This video can not be played Dame Margaret Hodge: It is right to deny Jeremy Corbyn the Labour whip MPs sitting in the House of Commons on behalf of a party are given what is called ""the party whip"". It allows them to represent their chosen party and stand for them in elections, as well as ensuring they receive a letter about forthcoming parliamentary business, detailing the position the party is taking. Having the whip taken away is considered a serious punishment by a party. While the MP can keep their seat in the House, they are classed as an independent and cannot run for the party in the next election, unless that whip is restored. But allies of Mr Corbyn have urged Sir Keir to change his mind immediately. Mr McCluskey, whose Unite union is one of Labour's biggest financial backers, said he was ""astonished"", adding: ""The continued persecution of Jeremy Corbyn, a politician who inspired millions, by a leadership capitulating to external pressure on party procedures risks destroying the unity and integrity of the party."" Mr Lavery, who served as Labour chairman under Mr Corbyn, leader from 2015 until earlier this year, told the BBC News Channel: ""This is a strange way of rebuilding trust."" He added: ""Does this mean that, for the first time in Labour Party history, we have a leader who overrules who overrules democratic processes... because of what he sees as the right decision?"" Mr Lavery also asked: ""Is this political persecution against the former leader?"" While many Labour MPs have supported Sir Keir's decision,28 MPs and four peers have signed a statement,externalcalling for a ""swift reversal"". This video can not be played Lavery: Corbyn decision causes ""lack of trust"" Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a long-time Corbyn ally, called Sir Keir's decision ""just plain wrong"" and likely to cause ""more division and disunity in the party"". The EHRC's report found Labour had broken the law over its handling of anti-Jewish racism complaints by party members during Mr Corbyn's tenure. On Tuesday, Mr Corbyn attempted to clarify his position in public, saying that ""concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'"". Thelma Walker, Labour MP for Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, from 2017 to 2019, quit the party on Wednesday, saying it had been a ""privilege"" to work with the former leader. Mr McDonnell responded by saying: ""When Thelma Walker, one of Labour's loyalest of the loyal, feels so strongly that she resigns, then it's time voices like hers are listened to.""

Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk,"Winter activities on ice are becoming increasingly dangerous as the world warms, scientists say. When researcherslooked at data on drowning accidents in largely frozen lakes or rivers,external, they saw a ""strong correlation"" to rising temperatures. They found that deaths from drowning were five times higher when warmer weather made the ice thinner and weaker. Children aged under nine years and younger adults were most at risk. World's last-known white giraffe fitted with GPS Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 Small steps taken to make shipping greener For indigenous peoples in many northern regions of the world, livelihoods often depend on access to frozen lakes in winter for hunting, fishing and travel. In countries like the US, Canada and Russia, winter leisure activities such as skating or tobogganing on ice are also hugely popular. But as the world warms, winter ice is becoming less stable and scientists believe it poses a greater threat of accidental drowning. Canadian researchers looked at data on 4,000 drowning events in 10 countries over three decades since the 1990s. They found that higher temperatures were a good predictor of the number of deaths by drowning. ""We can confidently say that there is a quite a strong correlation between warmer winter air temperatures and more winter drownings,"" said study leader Sapna Sharma, from York University in Toronto, Canada. ""Almost half of the winter drownings were associated with warmer temperatures."" The researchers collated data from official sources including coroner's offices. They were able to compare these figures to longstanding records from lakes showing when ice formed and melted each winter. Canada and the US had the highest number of drownings related to ice, an issue that was particularly acute among indigenous communities further north. Ice fishing is very popular in many northern countries The use of snowmobiles on lakes was associated with many of the lake fatalities. One of the saddest aspects of the study was the fact that many of the victims were very young. ""We found that almost half of those drowned in Minnesota where there was no vehicle involved were children under nine years old,"" said Sapna Sharma. ""They were playing on the ice, tobogganing or ice skating and they just weren't able to recognise when the ice was unsafe. They may not have recognised that slushy ice or a little open patch of water could be so fatal."" Even where lake or river accidents weren't deadly, they often had life-changing results. In cold water accidents where children suffered cardiac arrest, some 90% also experienced significant neurological damage - and only 27% were alive a year later. However, some countries have managed to limit the number of drownings during winter, including Germany and Italy. Local laws prohibit the use of snowmobiles on lakes and activities like skating are often limited until local authorities deem the ice to be safe. Education is also seen to be a key element. According to Barbara Byers from the CanadianLifesaving Society,external, people just don't recognise the personal threat that a changing climate can pose. Snowmobiles are widely used on frozen lakes for transport ""People think that ice is ice but appearances can be deceiving,"" she told BBC News. ""People may think it's cold out, the ice must be fine but it really is the quality of the ice or the type of ice that's really important. ""Ice now gets frozen and thawed and when that happens there's water in-between the layers of the ice. So it may look hard and frozen, but it's not."" Researchers say that despite efforts to educate, they expect that drowning events will likely increase in the future. They are particularly worried about this winter, as people may be spending more time outdoors due to the pandemic, with potentially fatal results. ""Everything's closed right now, and more people are spending time in nature and where they might not have done so before,"" said Sapna Sharma. ""This year, it's forecast to be a warmer, wetter winter in Canada, so in combination with more people going outside that could be that could be quite dangerous.""

Lorry driver 'devastated' over container deaths,"The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year The driver who dropped off a lorry container carrying 39 migrants who were later found dead told a court he was ""devastated"" for their families. Eamonn Harrison towed the trailer to a Belgian port, where it was transported to Essex. When opened on 23 October 2019, it was found to have the dead Vietnamese migrants inside. Mr Harrison told jurors at the Old Bailey he did not know they were there. The 23-year-old, of Newry, County Down, denies manslaughter. The court had previously been told the victims, aged 15 to 44, suffocated in the sealed trailer en route from Zeebrugge to Purfleet in Essex. Irish haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, and lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 26, have previously admitted manslaughter. Mr Harrison told a jury he had suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) which meant he struggled at school and found it hard to make friends. However, he added he had ""loved"" his work as a lorry driver, a job he started at the age of 18. He said when he met Mr Hughes he was ""a gentleman"", and he started to work for him. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, were among the victims In May 2019 Mr Harrison crashed his lorry when driving while drunk in Germany, writing off the tractor unit and damaging the load, the court was told. Jurors heard after that he owed Mr Hughes Â£16,000 and he agreed to help with ""stolen goods jobs"", agreeing that he would ""walk away"" when the lorry was being loaded and come back 15 minutes later. Asking about the events of October 2019, Mr Harrison's barrister, Alasdair Williamson QC, said: ""You drove the tractor unit that pulled the trailer that contained 39 people on their way to their deaths. How do you feel about that?"" Mr Harrison replied with an expletive for bad. Asked how he felt for the families, he said: ""Devastated."" Mr Williamson then said: ""Did you know that there was anyone on your trailer?"" The defendant replied: ""No."" Mr Harrison and Gheorge Nica, 43, of Basildon, Essex, deny 39 counts of manslaughter. Mr Harrison, lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, have denied being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy, which Nica has admitted he was involved in.

Arrests of Egypt rights group's staff 'chilling',"Karim Ennarah was reportedly detained while on holiday at a Red Sea resort (family handout) A leading human rights group in Egypt says security forces have detained two members of its staff in recent days. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights reported that its director of criminal justice, Karim Ennarah, was arrested on Wednesday in Dahab and taken to an undisclosed location. Its office manager, Mohammed Basheer, was detained in Cairo on Sunday. Amnesty International condemned what it called the ""chilling escalation"" of a crackdown on civil society in Egypt. Human rights groups say dozens of activists have been targeted with arrests, travel bans and asset freezes,externalunder President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.

Mass testing rolled out to Merthyr Tydfil,"This video can not be played As Merthyr Tydfil prepares to roll out mass testing, there are mixed reactions in the town All people working and living in Merthyr Tydfil will be offered a Covid test from Saturday. The county is the first in Wales to take part in the UK's mass testing scheme, with the help of 165 military personnel. It is hoped people without symptoms who may be infected can be found so they can self-isolate. The area had the highest case rate in UK at the start of November and remains among the worst hit areas in Wales. The first testing site will open at Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre on Saturday, with other sites due to open later this month. A pilot scheme in Liverpoolsaw 23,000 tested and found 154 casesand is planned for67 further areasin England. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Merthyr Tydfil ""will provide further vital information to help inform future rollout of mass testing in Wales"". Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he hoped it will ""reduce the pressure being seen in the Cwm Taf Health Board area, which has been particularly hard hit with hospital-acquired infections and deaths"". But Plaid Cymru called for places such as Merthyr Tydfil to be designated ""Covid special support areas"" with self-isolation payments topped up to Â£800. Merthyr Tydfil Council saideveryone living and working in the county should have two tests,externalover 14 days, or three test over a three-week period, and people can request more if needed. Everyone aged 11 or over can get a test. There is no booking system, and people can just turn up at a testing centre. Mass testing uses lateral flow testswhich intend to produce a result within 20-30 minutes. If an individual tests positive, they will be asked to go home immediately to self-isolate, and will be asked to take a traditional test. The plan is for some sites to stay open until 23 December. Where will mass testing be available? What is the new lateral flow test? Mr Gething said armed forces personnel, some of whom have been in Merthyr Tydfil since last week, will provide ""logistical support"". He added the scheme would ""give us an even greater understanding of prevalence within the community and how many people have Covid"". ""We have chosen Merthyr as it has a high prevalence and this mass testing will also help to slow down the spread of the virus in the area."" Military personnel have been drafted to help at test sites including at Liverpool FC's stadium Welsh Secretary Simon Harttweeted,externalthat he had approved a military request for support. ""We're working hand in hand with Merthyr Tydfil council and Welsh Government to defeat this virus,"" the Conservative UK government minister said. There had been 458 cases in Merthyr Tydfil in the week up to 1 November and the case rate rose as high as 759 cases per 100,000. The proportion of positive results from tests taken was also high - accounting for nearly a third of people tested. Those case rates have since come down and Merthyr Tydfil has been overtaken by Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot. Up to 14 November the case rate was 286.8 per 100,000, with 173 cases across the county but is still above the Wales average. Gurnos, which has had 44 cases in the last week, is still in the highest districts of Wales. Leah and Tannia, from Merthyr, say they would not be queuing for a test on Saturday Tannia from Merthyr, whose mother recently had Covid, said she believed mass testing was a ""waste of resources"". ""I think unless you have got symptoms, I don't see the point in wasting tests,"" she said. Her friend Leah agreed, adding: ""I think you should have symptoms to do a test"". James Regan says Covid deaths are hitting home However, James Regan said: ""We need mass testing and we need to do something more than what we are doing already. People need to do better and try harder to help."" Mr Regan, who had coronavirus and experiences""long Covid"" symptoms, said family friends had died from the virus. ""The deaths are a lot more local now, and it is hitting home a bit harder. You just don't expect anyone to pass from it."" NHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall said Merthyr Tydfil was an ""obvious choice"" for mass testing, given the recent high level of coronavirus infections in the area. He said the Welsh Government was ""appealing to the population"" in the county ""to support us in this initiative to undertake that more repeated testing, whether they have symptoms or not"". The prospect of uncovering asymptomatic cases during mass testing could be a ""deterrent"" to some people coming forward, the Senedd's health committee heard on Wednesday. Devi Sridhar, who is professor and chairman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said self-isolation was ""vital"" but it could also put some people off taking part. ""Isolation is just as vital, there is no point testing if you don't actually isolate people who are positive. Otherwise it is a waste of time to test,"" she said. She was asked about mass testing generally and was not responding specifically to the announcement about Merthyr Tydfil. Merthyr Tydfil council leader Kevin O'Neill said he believed residents would take part: ""I'm confident in the people of Merthyr Tydfil."" He said there would eventually be 14 testing sites - there is only one to start with - and acknowledged the logistics were ""difficult"", but said people would not be discouraged from turning up. ""So if they're going to turn up, they're going to turn up,"" he added. Mass Covid testing for 67 local areas in England Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early?

Twins born to Covid-19 patient in coma,"The babies were delivered at 26 weeks and weighed just 27oz and 30oz A Covid-19 patient whose twins were delivered while she was in an induced coma said she struggled to believe they were hers. Perpetual Uke, a rheumatology consultant at Birmingham City Hospital, began to feel unwell in late March. She was later admitted to a critical care unit, placed on a ventilator and put in an induced coma to help her recover. Her babies were delivered by caesarean section at 26 weeks on 10 April. Sochika Palmer weighed just 770g (27oz) while her brother, Osinachi Pascal, weighed 850g (30oz). Dr Uke remained in her coma for another 16 days. The twins Sochika and Osinachi had progressed well, their mother said - here pictured at 10 weeks old ""It was really terrifying... every passing day I was hoping my wife was not among those who are dead,"" Dr Uke's husband Matthew said. ""We are a team, the idea she might not be there was really difficult to accept."" When Dr Uke regained consciousness, it was the result the family had prayed for, but she said she was suffering ""ICU delirium"" and was ""so confused"". The mother-of-four said waking up two weeks after the delivery ""was unbelievable"" and although hospital staff said the twins were hers, she ""didn't believe"" it.

Hollywood star pays to adapt Wrexham fan's home,"Aiden and his family had been trying to raise money to adapt his bathroom A lifelong Wrexham FC fan said he ""feels amazing"" after the club's new Hollywood star owner donated Â£6,000 to adapt his home. Aiden Stott, who has cerebral palsy, had been trying to raise the cash to get a bathroom so his family could wash him. On Wednesday, he woke up to find the entire sum had been donated by actor Rob McElhenney,who is set to take over the club, alongside Ryan Reynolds. Mr Stott said he ""couldn't believe it"". The football fan, who has been a season ticket holder for several years and is a member of the club's Disabled Supporters' Association, said he was blown away by the generosity of everyone who had donated. Aiden's favourite player is Paul Rutherford and he never misses a home game ""It means the world to me, it really does,"" said Mr Stott. After cuts to his care, the 37-year-old's parents sold their family home to buy a flat for him to live closer to them in Manchester. But after finding out adapting the bathroom to make it safe for Aiden, his family and carers, would cost Â£6,000, the family decided to set up a fundraising campaign. ""I had been deliberating whether to do it or not, because there are so many people in worse positions than us, it's not like Aiden is starving, he's got a roof over his head,"" his sister Cheryl said. This video can not be played ""Wrexham has the potential for growth"" On Monday,Wrexham Supporters Trust (WST) members voted overwhelmingly to back the takeoverby It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star McElhenney and Reynolds. While a number of people had already donated to the fundraising campaign, Cheryl said she was woken up on Wednesday by a friend telling her to look at the page. ""It was there, his name, no message, obviously I wrote a message to him and told him he made my mum cry, but we haven't heard anything from him,"" she said. ""That a Hollywood movie star looked at a picture of my brother and read his little story and what he's going through, it's just incredible. ""It's amazing that he bought the club in the first place, which we are all really excited about, but to do that as well, it just shows his true character and meaning."" Aiden's whole family support Wrexham, Ms Stott, a firefighter, said since the donation, more companies had come forward saying they would adapt the bathroom for a lower price. ""This means we can get him carers quicker as well... it's not just the bath it's being able to employ people to look after him and not to rely on his dad,"" she said. Steve Gilbert, chairman of the club's Disabled Supporters' Association, said everyone was overwhelmed by the star's generosity. Mr Gilbert said he tweeted McElhenney the link to Aiden's campaign on Tuesday in the hope he could generate some interest. ""I am still choked up about it, I still can't really put into words what it means,"" he said. ""Rob contacted us on Twitter five or six weeks ago, he told us he had spoken to Ryan, and he had said accessibility and inclusion was very important to them. ""A day into their ownership and they have already done this, we are just chuffed."" Aiden said the atmosphere at the matches was ""brilliant"" Mr Stott said he would love to meet the club's new owners and thank McElhenney for his lovely gift. ""That would make my day,"" he said.

More restrictions 'inevitable' if Covid cases rise,"Some parts of the south Wales valleys have seen among the highest rates in the UK More restrictions are ""inevitable"" if the current regulations cannot keep coronavirus cases in check, a public health official has warned. Giri Shankar, Public Health Wales' outbreak response director, said the firebreak lockdown achieved its purpose of halting the rapid growth of cases. But he said it was not yet known if the action has been enough. Case data over the next two weeks would indicate if the current downward trend of cases would continue, he added. Mass testing rolled out to Merthyr Tydfil Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""What remains to be seen is whether the reduction is sufficient enough, whether we can sustain it for enough to be able to manage the essential services,"" Dr Shankar said. He emphasised this depended on ""individual and collective responsibility"" in following the national guidelines which came into effect on 9 November and ran for 17 days. ""If there is an uncontrolled spread of the virus and if there is a further increase in cases and that leads to inevitably higher hospitalisations and a proportion of those translate to deaths then it is inevitable at some point that we will have to consider further additional restrictions,"" he added. He said any further restrictions were ultimately the Welsh Government's decision. His warning comes on the day Merthyr Tydfil became the first part of Wales where a mass testing scheme will be rolled out. NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said Merthyr Tydfil was an ""obvious choice"" for mass testing, given the recent high level of Covid-19 infections in the area.

Two government defeats in Lords over Brexit bill,"The government has lost two more votes in the Lords over its Brexit bill. Peers voted by 367 to 209 to amend the Internal Market Bill, after claims that it would allow the UK government to ""shackle"" devolved administrations as powers are returned from Brussels. And they voted by 327 to 223 to curb ministers' powers to rewrite parts of the bill at a later stage. The proposed law aims to create a UK-wide internal market after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. It was approved by the Commons in September but is encountering strong resistance in the Lords, where Boris Johnson's government does not have a majority. Last week, peers defeated the government over plans to allow the UK to override parts of the legally-binding withdrawal agreement that apply to Northern Ireland. Government suffers Lords defeat over Brexit bill What is the row over 'internal markets' all about? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January Once peers have finished debating the bill it will head back to the House of Commons where MPs will decide either to reject or accept the Lords' amendments. In the event of a stalemate between the two Houses, the government has not ruled out forcing through the changes through a rarely-used law known as the Parliament Act, which dates back to 1911. The act, which enshrined the primacy of the elected Commons over the unelected Lords, was used in 2004 by Tony Blair's government to push through a ban on fox and deer hunting and hare-coursing with dogs. In the first of Wednesday's reverses for the government, peers supported an amendment that sought to strengthen the role of the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Speaking in favour of the amendment, Crossbench peer Baroness Finlay of Llandaff said the bill would allow Westminster to bypass the views of devolved governments in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast and consign current arrangements to a ""meaningless sideshow"". She added that the proposed legislation ""shackles the ability of the elected parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to find their own solutions to the problems we face"". And Labour said it would, for example, prevent the Welsh government from banning different types of plastic ahead of the rest of the UK. Speaking for the government, Cabinet Office Minister Lord True said the right place for final decisions on the internal market should be the Westminster Parliament. The Internal Market Bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland once the transition period is over. Currently regulations and standards on issues like animal welfare are agreed and applied across the EU. After the transition period, many of these standards will be directly controlled by the devolved administrations - but the UK government has said they will still have to accept goods and services from all other parts of the UK, even if they have set different standards locally.

UK denies plan to mothball tanks,"The Challenger 2 tank has not been upgraded since 1998 UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has quashed speculation that the Army will mothball all its tanks. Last month,the Times,externalreported military chiefs were considering the idea, under plans to modernise the armed forces. But Mr Wallace told the BBC ""the idea that tanks won't be there for the Army, upgraded and modernised, is wrong"". However, he admitted a government review would mean ""letting go"" of some military equipment to invest in cyber, space and other new technologies. British Army considers a future without tanks Strength of British military falls for ninth year Warning over plans for new Navy aircraft carriers Speaking on a visit to the Middle East, Mr Wallace said there would be a shift to forward-deploy British military forces around the world to protect UK interests and its allies. Mr Wallace said a joint squadron of RAF and Qatar Typhoon jets would be based in Qatar for football's 2022 World Cup. He announced a Â£23.8m investment in a UK logistics hub in the Port of Duqm to support more British army training in Oman, and which could be used to base the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. He also confirmed that RAF jets would continue to target the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, with 23 strikes against extremist targets since March 2020. Last month, the Times reported on plans to mothball the Army's ageing 227 Challenger tanks as part of the government's integrated defence and security review - described as the most important defence review since the end of the Cold War. Mr Wallace confirmed the review would mean ""letting go of some equipment that isn't serving any purpose or overmatched by adversaries"". He said that would mean investing in new equipment for the RAF, Royal Navy and the Army. But he signalled that any cuts would not be as dramatic as some have reported. That still leaves open the possibility of a reduction in the number of tanks. But Mr Wallace said that getting rid of all of them was not going to happen. ""We're going to make sure we have an armed forces fit for the 21st Century and meets our obligations to Nato and elsewhereâ¦ ""We are not scrapping all the British army's tanks and we will make sure the ones we maintain are up to date, lethal and defendable."" Mr Wallace said Britain also needed to meet the threat of long-range artillery and drones, which have recently been used by Russia against Ukraine to destroy its heavy armour. Ben Wallace said his first duty was to make sure he delivered up-to-date equipment The new port facilities at Duqm will triple the size of the existing UK base in Oman. They will also be used for British army training in Oman. There's been speculation that the Army could switch its training for tanks from Canada to the Gulf state. While in Qatar, Mr Wallace also visited the US-led coalition headquarters co-ordinating the air campaign against the group calling itself the Islamic State. Despite IS losing most of its territory in Iraq and Syria, Mr Wallace said the threat was ""not going to go away"".

Military to get biggest spending boost in 30 years,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Defence spending a boost for ""safety of the British people"" A ""once-in-a-generation modernisation"" of the armed forces is required to extend British influence and protect the public, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister told MPs a new four-year funding deal would protect ""hundreds of thousands"" of jobs and create 40,000 new roles. ""I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,"" he said. Labour welcomed more defence spending but asked how it would be funded. Outlining the new package in the Commons, the PM - speaking over video linkas he is self-isolating- said the benefits ""will go far beyond our armed forces"". Mr Johnson described the increase in defence spending as being worth Â£16.5bn in new money over four years. However economist Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said that while this represented a big rise in spending, the figure of Â£16.5bn was a ""misleading way to present this announcement"". He continued: ""It would be more accurate to say that by 2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn higher than it would have been under previous plans."" How will defence spending rise affect armed forces? PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policy UK defence secretary denies plan to mothball tanks Mr Johnson said: ""Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe."" The PM pledged to end defence budget cuts, protect shipping lanes that supply the country, press on with renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent and restore Britain as ""the foremost naval power in Europe"" with a ""renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK"". He also said the funding would allow investment in new technology such as: A new centre dedicated to artificial intelligence The creation of a national cyber force, which he said was already operating against terrorists, organised crime groups and hostile states A new ""RAF space command launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022"" ""From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year - 40,000 in total - levelling-up across our country and reinforcing our union,"" Mr Johnson added. This is a big win for Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who's been fighting hard for a significant increase in defence spending and a long-term financial settlement to end what he calls a cycle of overambitious, under-funded defence reviews of the past. The Treasury had been arguing for a much smaller annual increase. But Mr Wallace found an ally in the PM, who says his first priority is defence of the realm. Boris Johnson also believes it'll boost Britain's place in the world and create jobs. The extra money will be used to modernise the armed forces with more spent on robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber. Despite the palpable relief inside the MoD it still has to fill a Â£13bn black hole in its equipment budget. Difficult decisions about cutting old equipment to fund the new are still to be made. The MoD, which doesn't have a strong track record of balancing its books, now has to prove it can spend wisely. And good news for defence might also mean bad news for other government departments -there's already speculation the international aid budget could be cut. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of making a ""spending announcement without a strategy"" and asked whether the money would be raised through cuts or tax rises, or both. Mr Johnson did not respond to the question but said Sir Keir's record of support for the armed forces was ""very thin indeed"". Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Mr Johnson ""not to listen to any voices in his ear"" saying that cutting international aid could help to fund the increase in defence spending. And Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the international development committee, asked Mr Johnson to ""quash rumours and confirm his manifesto commitment"" of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, ""now and going forwards"". The PM responded by telling the Commons: ""I think we can all be proud of our record on overseas aid and that will continue."" Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" by the announcement. ""But of course we're also conscious that living through this Covid crisis, the armed forces have stepped up to the plate to provide some of the resilience that the nation has needed,"" he added. Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said the ""extraordinary announcement"" would be very good for morale Earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""letting go"" of some older weapons would create ""headroom"" for new investment. He added: ""When I looked across at the armed forces today I saw them with equipment that was out-of-date, I saw our adversaries across the world having better equipment, the ability to attack us and harm us getting wider and wider from our capabilities."" The funding announcement is part of the first conclusions ofthe government's Integrated Reviewwhich looks at security, defence, development and foreign policy. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the extra money would give ""a welcome and long-overdue upgrade to Britain's defences after a decade of decline"". Conservative MP and defence select committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said: ""This is a lot of money but ultimately there are still huge financial pressures facing our armed forces."" But he said the ""key takeaway"" for him was the ""message this sends to the British people, to the MoD as well, that we want to be back as a strong power capability"".

'It means so much to me this year',"Nick's partner Sarah died a few weeks ago - he says Christmas will be horrendous without seeing loved-ones With just over a month to go until Christmas and much of the UK living under some form of coronavirus restrictions, the question on many people's minds is, how best to mark it? While some people say a visit to see family is ""not worth the risk"" of spreading Covid-19, or havealready opted to host Christmas Day over Zoom, others desperately want to see their loved-ones after a tough year. Nick Leader, 33, a regional sales manager from Oxfordshire,told BBC Radio 5 LiveChristmas would be ""horrendous"" if he was alone with his two young children, after his fiance, Sarah, died of cancer just three weeks ago. ""She was 38 and has left behind a seven-year-old and a four-year-old,"" he says. ""We've come through a lot of rubbish through the whole of this year. ""But my children at the moment have been the most amazing people on the planet and they are helping me through this day in and day out. ""I couldn't think of anything worse than being on our own, the three of us, this Christmas. ""My bigger picture is looking after my children's emotions going forward. And to lose a mum, this close to Christmas, to me it just seems too wrong to destroy their special time of Christmas."" Ministersare currently looking at how to relax restrictionsso families can celebrate Christmas together - with discussions happening between all four nations in a bid to strike a common approach. It is thought that any rule change would be for a limited time - maybe just a few days - although final decisions will not be made for a few weeks. Listen to people discussing their Christmas plans 'I'll be hosting my Christmas over Zoom' Travel rules changed for Christmas turkey workers ""It's not so much about the Christmas and the presents, it's about the people,"" saysLisa, who lives in south London. The 39-year-old teacher says the hope of getting family together at Christmas has been like the ""end of the rainbow"" - it's kept her going through a tough year, but feels like it's getting ""further and further away"". Lisa, who's originally from Australia, says Covid restrictions have meant both her mum and dad have had to cancel trips to the UK which had been planned to support her as she and her husband attempted IVF. Lisa had a miscarriage during the UK's national lockdown and has had three further unsuccessful rounds of IVF since then. Social distancing measures mean she hasn't hugged anyone apart from her husband throughout the ""very difficult year"". ""We've gone through that without the support of family around us. You look for that rainbow, you look for that light at the end of the tunnel. And to feel like you're not going to have that Christmas as a family, to hug them... it's hard for all of us,"" she says. Lisa and her husband are hoping they can still host his parents - who live in Southampton - on Christmas Day. ""I'd like to be able to celebrate with them, whether it's in the garden shivering in the cold or not. After this year, I want my family around me."" Meanwhile,Chris, from Norfolk, who did not want us to use his full name, also stresses the need to see family, saying Christmas Day is not about the ""party or celebration"" but about who you spend it with. Chris is sure this year will be the final Christmas he'll be able to spend with his dad, who is very ill with advanced cancer. Chris, 41, is considering putting his immediate family into a self-imposed two-week quarantine so that his children can spend 25 December with their grandad. He says ""sitting round the table, enjoying each other's company"" is what this time of year should be about. ""And that's all I want - just one more chance to create some memories for my children. We've obeyed the rules since the start, all I want is one day."" ButFred Stupple, 68, from Glasgow, disagrees. While he understands the tough situations that people are in, Fred says ""short-term discipline"" is important for the health of the country. Fred urges discipline, saying he has to socially distance from his wife, who is a teacher ""If Chris goes to see his father, which would be lovely and it might be his last time, he could be increasing the risk,"" he says. ""All I would like Chris to think about, and many people throughout the country - short-term discipline. ""If people just think about it and then look to the future, we really have got to be strong now."" Carolinein Norfolk adds: ""I honestly think people have just got to be more responsible. My husband's 83, we've got three daughters in different parts of the country, one in London, one in the North East... and we've got one in Sheffield. ""The girls have said to me, we'd rather have daddy and you alive and be able to enjoy next year rather than risk one day, or one time, to come to Norfolk. ""We're in a low area.

Wales rules 'not agreed for weeks',"This video can not be played We cannot go back to normal, says health minister It could be ""weeks"" before there is an announcement on the Covid rules around Christmas, Wales' health minister has said. Welsh ministers and other UK administrations are in talks over a set of agreed rules for the festive period. Vaughan Gething said whatever happened, the period would ""not be like normal"". ""You shouldn't expect there to be a definitive statement in the next few days or weeks,"" he told a press conference. ""We have quite a long way to go in the course of the pandemic we've been dealing with before we get to the Christmas period."" Students going home should travel by 9 December Not all students in Wales will get Covid tests Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic There had been calls for a single approach from the different UK administrations about Christmas so families who live in different areas can deal with a single set of rules. Vaughan Gething said this Christmas would ""not be like normal"" Mr Gething said discussions were ongoing about what will be in place for travel, ""and we're still looking at the evidence about what we might be able to do around contact"". ""But it does rely on the picture that we'll see in the developing evidence over the coming weeks"", he added. He noted thatother faiths had seen their festivals limited by Covid restrictions, most recently Diwali. Meanwhile Mr Gething said the rate of cases in Wales was continuing to fall, one week after Wales' firebreak lockdown. Cases in Merthyr Tydfil, which has seen the highest case rate of any local authority in the UK, have more than halved, he said. ""On Friday, I said we were starting to see some very early positive signs that cases of coronavirus are beginning to fall. This downward trend is continuing."" The seven-day incidence rate for Wales is now at about 160 cases per 100,000 people - a reduction of 70 from this time last week, he said. He also said people needed to be aware of the differences between coronavirus and seasonal flu, with the former having a higher mortality rate and a greater proportion of sufferers becoming seriously ill. After the news ofanother potentially effective vaccine, Mr Gething said he ""doesn't plan"" to make Covid vaccines mandatory. He said he had never tried to mandate any vaccine, and would not want to do so with Covid. ""I'm interested in people understanding the evidence for the safety of the vaccine , then making the right choice to protect them, their family and their community"" he added. This video can not be played Shoppers are back in Cardiff after lockdown ends On Sunday, Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said it was a""worry"" to see queues of people outside shopsat the weekend. Mr Gething said there had been ""pent-up demand"" after the firebreak, with retailers operating limits on numbers in their stores. While he had seen pictures of people socially-distancing, ""I have seen some images that are more concerning where people have forgotten about social distancing and are returning to a more normal way of behaving. ""Now, if that continues we really will face difficult choices, and we're likely to see the trend that we've already seen with reducing cases - that can easily reverse.""

UK nations discuss Christmas plan,"Discussions have taken place about the four nations of the UK taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish first ministers held a virtual meeting with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and other senior UK officials. It was the first of what UK ministers hope will be weekly meetings. UK government sources said topics including international travel, mass testing and the priority list for vaccinations were also discussed. Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford and Arlene Foster took part in the meeting, as did Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Mr Gove said they all recognised families across the UK ""want to be able to see their loved ones this Christmas"". Students to go home in evacuation-style operation 'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be He added: ""Today my ministerial colleagues and I met with the devolved administrations to work towards that shared aim and to help ensure that our collective response delivers for the public in every part of the UK"". It is understood government officials will now be considering how to put the desire for a ""joint approach to Christmas"" into action. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The four nations call had an initial discussion about a co-ordinated approach to issues such as travel over the Christmas period and discussed recent developments in testing, including the use of lateral flow testing to enable students to return home, and initial lessons from the Liverpool pilot."" Senior UK ministers have warned the situation remains highly volatile, with different levels of restrictions in different parts of the country and high rates of transmissions across the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said recently that people may not be able to gather like normal in large groups while Ms Sturgeon's most senior public health adviser, Jason Leitch, said last month that people should prepare themselves for a ""digital Christmas"". Earlier on Wednesday, a plan was announced to get students in England home safely for Christmas. Students are to be allocated departure dates during a ""student travel window"" between 3 and 9 December, to minimise the risk of them spreading Covid-19. In Wales, they are being asked to travel by 9 December at the latest. The Scottish government wants as many as possible of the 80,000 or so students going home for Christmas to be offered voluntary tests before they travel. Northern Ireland is expected to publish plans for students' return in the coming days. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme?

Man arrested over 1974 Birmingham pub bombings,"Twenty-one people were killed in two blasts on 21 November 1974 A man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of 21 people in the 1974 pub bombings in Birmingham. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, arrested the 65-year-old at his home in Belfast. He was detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Police said the man's home was being searched and he will be interviewed under caution at a police station in Northern Ireland. Birmingham pub bombings: What we know Who were Birmingham pub bombings victims? Latest news from the West Midlands Saturday will mark the 46th anniversary of the bombings. Fresh inquestslast year ruled the victims were unlawfully killed, but did not establish who was responsible. Those hearings came after years of campaigning by families for a full account into what happened that night. Last month, Home Secretary Priti Patelannounced she would be considering the case for a public inquiry into the bombings. The blasts ripped apart the Mulberry Bush pub at the base of the Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street Six men - Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were wrongly jailed for life in 1975 for the bombings. The group, who became known as the Birmingham Six, had their convictions quashed in the appeal court and they were released in 1991. Inquests into the deaths of those killed in the bombings found they were unlawfully killed 21 November 1974: A man telephones the Birmingham Post and Mail to warn two bombs had been planted in the city centre. At 20:17 GMT a bomb exploded in a duffel bag in the Mulberry Bush pub in the Rotunda building, killing 10 people. Minutes later a second bomb went off in the Tavern in the Town leaving 11 more dead. 1975: Six men, Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker, are found guilty of carrying out the bombings. 1985: The World in Action programme names four suspects the production was ""100% sure"" were the true perpetrators, and said they knew the identity of a fifth. 14 March 1991: After 16 years behind bars, the Birmingham Sixhave their convictions quashedand, that year, West Midlands Police begins re-investigating the case. 1994: West Midlands Police says there is insufficient evidence for any prosecutions, butthe case remains open. June 2016: Louise Hunt, senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, saidinquests into the deaths would be reopened.Inquests were opened and adjourned days after the attack but, because the case was subject to a criminal investigation, they were never resumed. July 2017: Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QCdecides the names of the alleged bombers would not be part of the framework of the resumed inquests.. In January, theHigh Court quashed this ruling, but judges at the Court of Appeal ruled in his favour,meaning suspects would not be named. April 2019: The inquestsfind the 21 victims of the pub bombings were unlawfully killed. October 2020: Following calls by the families of those killed in the bombings, Home Secretary Priti Patelagrees to consider the case for a public inquiry. Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the bombings, called the arrest ""the most monumental event"" in the criminal investigation since the quashing of those convictions. She said she broke down in tears when she was told by a senior West Midlands Police officer of the arrest. Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the bombings, said news of the arrest was ""overwhelming"" ""I couldn't speak, I was just inconsolable and was just looking at the picture of Maxine,"" she said. ""It's welcome news. It's overwhelming news. It's tangible progress."" However, Ms Hambleton, who is part of campaign group Justice for the 21, said: ""Having this development - whatever happens - does not in any way lessen our desire for a full public inquiry. ""There are wider issues which need to be examined and so much that went wrong, like why six men were arrested for a crime they didn't commit."" Two bombs detonated within minutes of each other in Birmingham Paul Rowlands, whose father John Rowlands was killed in the Mulberry Bush, said: ""It's a positive step. ""It is, however, just a step and it does not detract from the fact that we need a public inquiry."" By Phil Mackie, BBC Midlands correspondent For a long time the victims' families have felt that not enough effort was being put into the criminal investigation. The most recent review of the evidence by West Midlands Police, which took place before the inquests, came up with nothing new. Campaigners have always believed that if the bombings had happened in London or Manchester the authorities would have made the case a bigger priority, and that's why they've given today's development such a positive reaction. They already believe momentum is with them after Home Secretary Priti Patel announced she was considering allowing a public inquiry into the bombings. It's the first arrest in the case in more than four decades. And 73-year-old Bill Craig, an ex-West Midlands Police officer whose brother James Craig was fatally injured in the bombing, said he welcomed the arrest, adding there were still ""more questions than answers"" surrounding the attacks. George Jones, 72, whose postman father John ""Cliff"" Jones died in the Mulberry Bush blast, said: ""Obviously it's something positive, and it's happened just with the anniversary (of the bombings) coming up. ""I hope this time West Midlands Police is more efficient than the original investigation team were."" Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Baby died while trapped beside mum on sofa,"Sawyer Feasey was 27 days old when he died A baby who was less than a month old died after he became wedged between cushions on a sofa where his mother had fallen asleep, an inquest heard. Sawyer Feasey was found unresponsive when his mother Jessica woke up in the early hours, in March, at their home in Plymouth, Devon. Despite her attempts to resuscitate Sawyer he died at the scene, Plymouth Coroners Court heard. There were no suspicious circumstances around his death, the court was told. Mrs Feasey's health visitor spoke of how she ""presented as a caring mother"" and cared for her children alone. Devon and Cornwall Police also said there was no evidence of smoking, alcohol or drug use in the house. The post-mortem report said Sawyer was a ""well cared for baby"" and there were no suspicious findings. A pathologist's report said it was not possible to give a medical cause of death, but that there was an increased risk associated with infants co-sleeping with adults on sofas. These factors ""could have contributed to his death"", the report stated. A statement from Mrs Feasey indicated how she had gone to bed upstairs but ""ended up downstairs"" with Sawyer after he woke for a feed. Her next memory is waking on the sofa at about 05:15 and not knowing where he was. ""He wasn't there. 'Where the hell is my baby?' I sat up and I saw he was down the side of me,"" she said. ""When I saw him down the side I knew he was gone"". She put him on the floor and attempted CPR but ""nothing I did was working. I just knew he was gone."" A statement from a paramedic said Mrs Feasey ""picked up Sawyer to cuddle him"" before they transferred his body to Derriford Hospital. Senior Coroner Ian Arrow said it was not possible to give a cause of death, returning an open conclusion and adding his ""heartfelt condolences"" to Mrs Feasey.

BBC vows to 'get to truth' about Diana interview,"Almost 23 million people tuned in to watch Bashir's Panorama interview with Princess Diana 25 years ago The BBC has promised to ""get to the truth"" about how it got an interview with Princess Diana as it announced the terms of an independent investigation. It comes after Diana's brother alleged that BBC journalist Martin Bashir used forged bank statements to convince her to do the Panorama interview in 1995. Lord Dyson, one of the country's most senior retired judges, has been appointed to lead the inquiry. A former Supreme Court judge, he retired in 2016. 'Dark cloud over BBC journalism' says Lord Grade Diana's brother makes new BBC interview allegations BBC finds Diana's missing Panorama interview note The BBC's director general, Tim Davie, said: ""The BBC is determined to get to the truth about these events and that is why we have commissioned an independent investigation. ""Lord Dyson is an eminent and highly respected figure who will lead a thorough process."" Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, called for an independent inquiry earlier this month, saying ""sheer dishonesty"" was used to secure the interview with the princess. In a letter to Mr Davie,reported by the Daily Mail,,externalthe earl said Bashir had used forged bank statements, which wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister. Earl Spencer wrote: ""If it were not for me seeing these statements, I would not have introduced Bashir to my sister."" In another Daily Mail interview,,externalhe also alleged that the then Panorama reporter made a number of false and defamatory claims about senior royals during a meeting with him to gain his trust and access to his sister. These claims included that Diana's private correspondence was being opened, her car tracked and phones tapped - described by the Mail as ""preposterous lies"". Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor, is recovering from heart surgery and complications from Covid-19 and has been unable to comment on Earl Spencer's allegations. Martin Bashir left the BBC in 2004 but rejoined in 2016 1. What steps did the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir take with a view to obtaining the Panorama interview in 1995? This will include looking at the mocked up bank statements, alleged payments to members of the royal household, and other issues raised by Earl Spencer. 2. Were those steps appropriate, particularly in regard to the BBC's editorial standards at the time? 3. To what extent did the actions of the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir influence Diana's decision to give an interview? 4. What knowledge did the BBC have in 1995 and 1996 of the relevant evidence, such as the forged bank statements? 5. How effectively did the BBC investigate the circumstances leading to the interview? These terms of reference for the investigation were set by Lord Dyson and agreed by the BBC. The BBC said the investigation would start straight away and it was handing over ""all of its relevant records"". Last week, the broadcaster revealed thata previously missing note from Diana, thought to indicate she was happy with the way her interview by BBC Panorama was obtained, had been found and would be handed over to the investigation. Leading the inquiry will be Lord Dyson, who was Master of the Rolls - the second most senior judge in England and Wales - for four years until he retired in October 2016. His other influential positions have included being a Justice of the UK's Supreme Court - the highest court in the country - and a Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. Lord John Dyson as Master of the Rolls before his retirement in 2016 MP Julian Knight, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS), said the investigation was the right way to proceed ""given the gravity of the subject"". He added: ""The DCMS Committee has no plans to hold its own inquiry into this matter, however we will review the outcome and reserve a decision on whether any further action should be taken at that point."" Almost 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama programme 25 years ago. In it, the princess famously said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to the Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time, Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. She died on 31 August 1997, aged 36, in a car crash in Paris.

Kenya arrests after BBC exposÃ© of baby stealers,"This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings Police in Kenya have arrested four more people for allegedly running a child-trafficking syndicate following a BBC investigation into the theft and sale of babies. BBC Africa Eye revealed children were stolen to order from illegal clinics and at a Nairobi public hospital. Seven people are now in custody in connection with the case including medics and a hospital administrator. The babies were sold for as little as $400 (Â£300). In the wake of the BBC Africa Eye story, police chief Hillary Mutyambai ordered an investigation into hospitals, as well as children's homes in the Kenyan capital. Buying a baby on Nairobi's black market The baby stealers,external Africa Live: More on this and other stories Two hospital administrators, a nurse and a social worker appeared in court on Thursday, adding to the three senior medical officials who were in court on Wednesday. They have not been formally charged and did not enter pleas. BBC Africa Eye uncovered a trade in children stolen from vulnerable mothers living on the streets, as well as the existence of illegal clinics dotted around Nairobi, where babies were being sold. The investigation also revealed alleged corruption at Mama Lucy Kibaki, a public hospital in Nairobi. Three senior medical officers were in court on Wednesday Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at the hospital, is alleged to have facilitated the sale of an abandoned two-week-old baby boy to undercover reporters, later accepting 300,000 shillings ($2,700; Â£2,000) in cash. Both Mr Leparan and Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital declined requests to comment on the investigation's findings. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Kenya's Labour and Social Protection Minister Simon Chelugui said the culprits would face the ""full force of the law"". The suspects have not commented on the allegations against them Mr Chelugui also acknowledged that improvements to some of Kenya's child protection services were needed. His colleague in the Interior Ministry Fred Matiang'i thanked the BBC for exposing the ""rot"" at Mama Lucy hospital. He added that human and drug trafficking were the biggest challenges Kenyan security was dealing with. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in the East African state, but a non-governmental organisation, Missing Child Kenya, said it had been involved in nearly 600 cases in the past three years. Ferdinand Omondi, BBC News, Kenya It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say the BBC exposÃ© caught the government unawares. On the day it was published, state officials including the inspector general of police, the labour and social protection minister and the government spokesman held an emergency meeting. The next day, three arrests were made and police acknowledged there was a crime ring involving medical officers and child traffickers. Three suspects were immediately hauled to court - all medical officers. The interior minister was impressed by this efficiency and praised the decisive action. But Kenyans were livid. Did the police have to wait for the BBC investigate for them? How high does the syndicate go? Will they get convictions? These were some of the questions Kenyans asked, in a guarded response to the legal process which has just began, which many hope will ultimately paralyse one of Kenya's biggest crimes - human trafficking.

Boris Johnson 'proud' of PPE contracts,"Boris Johnson says he is ""proud"" of the way the government got supplies of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. A report by a spending watchdog found suppliers with links to Conservative MPs were given priority. Sir Keir Starmer asked why the usual processes had been bypassed - andÂ£21m had been handed to a ""middle man"". The PM told the Labour leader ""fast"" action had been needed and ""any government"" would have done the same. Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report DHSC adviser's firm took work from Covid company Sir Keir asked about a BBC report that Â£21m in UK taxpayers' cash had been given to Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff. This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer criticises the government's handling of PPE contracts ""I remind the prime minister that a few weeks ago he couldn't find that amount of money for free school meals for kids over half term,"" he told Mr Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions. He also highlighted a National Audit Office report, which showed Â£10.5bn worth of contracts were handed out without competitive tender and ""suppliers with political connections were 10 times more likely to be awarded contracts"". He said: ""Can the prime minister give a cast-iron assurance that from now on all government contracts will be subject to proper process, with full transparency and accountability?"" The prime minister said all government contracts will be published. ""I think it is extraordinary he attacks the government for securing PPE in full quantities,"" he added. ""At the time he bashed the government for not moving fast enough, now, absolutely absurdly, Captain Hindsight is trying to score political points by attacking the government for moving too fast. ""I am proud of securing PPE supplies and any government would have done the same."" The prime minister, who was taking part in PMQs via video link after being asked to self-isolate by NHS Track and Trace, thanked suppliers. And he highlighted calls from Labour's own MPs to get hold of supplies from unusual sources, including, he said, a football agent seeking to supply ventilators, and a ""historical clothing"" company. ""Nobody had enough PPE and we shifted heaven and earth to get 32 billion items of PPE to this country. ""I am very proud of what has been achieved -  70% of PPE is now made in this country, or capable of being made in this country, when it was only 1% at the beginning of the pandemic."" In its report, the National Audit Office said the government was not transparent about suppliers and services, and there were inadequate explanation of key spending decisions. The watchdog also found not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. The findings are part of an NAO investigation into government procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

House prices rise as Covid sparks rural relocation,"House prices in the South West of England have risen fastest in the UK in the last year amid a Covid-related rethink by many homeowners. House prices rose by 6.4% in the year to the end of September, compared with a UK average rise of 4.7%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Land Registry data also shows that detached homes saw the biggest annual price rises in the UK. The pandemic has led some people to move to more rural locations. There was also some pent-up demand during the first national lockdown among those looking to relocate, which was released in the late summer and reflected in these newly-published ONS and Land Registry figures. However, this has tended to focus on the upper-end of the property market, as some people working from home have looked to buy properties with more space, both inside and outside. Detached homes rose in price by 6.7% in a year. âIâm trapped by my mortgage â let me escapeâ Average UK house price hits Â£250,000, says Halifax ""No part of the UK economy has flown over the Covid storm like the property market and the picture in September strengthened across the board,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent group Fine and Country. ""The race for space is still the market's main driver. Price growth for flats and maisonettes is muted compared to larger properties, which have been flourishing amid high demand."" Some have been taking advantage ofa temporary stamp duty holiday across the UKwhich began in the summer. The city of Bath has some attractions for property hunters The annual price rise recorded in the South West of England in September was double the level seen in the region the previous month. Prices rose by at least 3% compared with a year earlier in every nation and region of the UK, except Northern Ireland, which recorded a 2.4% increase. The UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions. Overall, the UK increase in house prices was 4.7% over the year to September, up from 3% in August, with the average home valued at Â£245,000. While property prices may not have risen as fast in London, the city still have the highest average house price, at Â£496,000. For tenants of private landlords, rents in the UK rose by an average of 1.4% in the year to October, the ONS said, London saw its biggest slowdown in private rental prices growth since March 2017, slowing to 0.9% in the year to October, down from a 1.2% rise in September.

Starmer: Corbyn will not return as Labour MP,"Jeremy Corbyn was reinstated as a party member on Tuesday Jeremy Corbyn will not sit as a Labour Party MP in the Commons, Sir Keir Starmer says. The former leader was reinstated as a member of the party on Tuesday, having been suspended over his response to a human rights watchdog report on anti-Semitism in Labour ranks. But his successor said his remarks had ""undermined... our work in restoring trust"" with the Jewish community. Sir Keir said he would keep his decision under review. Board of Deputies of British Jews president, Marie van der Zyl, said Sir Keir had ""taken the appropriate leadership decision"", adding Mr Corbyn had been ""shameless and remorseless for what he has put the Jewish community through"". But former shadow chancellor and close ally of Mr Corbyn, John McDonnell, said the move was ""just plain wrong"" and would cause ""more division and disunity in the party"". While many Labour MPs have supported the decision,28 MPs and four peers have signed a statement,external- including Mr McDonnell - calling for a ""swift reversal"". The Socialist Campaign Group, which includes a number of Mr Corbyn's former shadow cabinet, said the move was ""wrong and damaging"" to the Labour Party. Labour suspends Corbyn over anti-Semitism reaction What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) published a report last month, saying Labour had broken the law over its handling of anti-Jewish racism complaints by party members during Mr Corbyn's tenure. Sir Keir, who took over the party in April, said those who think the issue had been ""exaggerated"" should ""be nowhere near the Labour Party"". But later, Mr Corbyn released a statement, saying the scale of anti-Semitism had been ""dramatically overstated"" by his opponents, and he was suspended by the party. On Tuesday, the former leader attempted to clarify his position in public, saying ""concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'"". Later that day, a panel of five National Executive Committee members met to discuss Mr Corbyn's case and what action to take, before deciding to reinstate him as a member of the party. Despite the decision from the panel of Labour's ruling body, Sir Keir decided not to reinstate the party whip in the Commons for Mr Corbyn. In a statement, the new leader said: ""I have made it my mission to root out anti-Semitism from the Labour Party. I know that I will [be] judged on my actions, not my words. ""The disciplinary process does not have the confidence of the Jewish community. That became clear once again yesterday."" He added: ""Jeremy Corbyn's actions in response to the EHRC report undermined and set back our work in restoring trust and confidence in the Labour Party's ability to tackle anti-Semitism. ""In those circumstances, I have taken the decision not to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn. I will keep this situation under review."" The five-member panel who decided to reinstate Mr Corbyn consisted of only two members who were outright supporters of the former leader. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says he understands that the panel went beyond the recommendations of party officials in insisting that Mr Corbyn be warned about his conduct and reminded of Labour's values - but the decision to reinstate him was unanimous. MPs sitting in the House of Commons on behalf of a party are given what is called ""the party whip"". It allows them to represent their chosen party and stand for them in elections, as well as ensuring they receive a letter about forthcoming parliamentary business, detailing the position the party is taking. Having the whip taken away is considered a serious punishment by a party. While the MP can keep their seat in the House, they are classed as an independent and cannot run for the party in the next election, unless that whip is restored. Shadow justice minister Peter Kyle tweeted in support of his leader, saying: ""We always knew tackling the cultural problems allowing anti-Semitism to exist in Labour would take time. ""We knew there would be moments that challenge and test us. ""The last 24 hours were unnecessarily difficult but Keir Starmer has acted authoritatively. We are moving forward."" Labour MP Margaret Hodge - who is the parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement - also supported the move. She said Mr Corbyn had ""refused to himself accept the findings of the EHRC report, refused to apologise for his actions and refused to take any responsibility"", so it was right to withhold the whip. But her colleague on the backbenches, former shadow justice minister Richard Burgon, said his former boss ""should immediately have the whip restored"". He added: ""At a time of national crisis, division in the Labour Party serves nobody but the Tory government."" And Jon Lansman - who founded the Corbyn-supporting Momentum movement within Labour - said the decision had ""driven a coach and horses through the party's disciplinary process"". He said it made it ""subservient to the parliamentary party"" and ""embedded 'political interference'"", which the party was condemned for in the EHRC report. Sir Keir Starmer was under huge pressure to take further action against Jeremy Corbyn - not just from Jewish groups, but from some of his own MPs. Friends of Margaret Hodge say she was on the verge of resigning yesterday when Mr Corbyn was readmitted to party membership. If a prominent Jewish MP had gone under Sir Keir's ""new leadership"", then his commitment to rooting out anti-Semitism would be questioned. I'm told he didn't take the final decision to suspend the whip until this morning - the decision was then conveyed to the former leader by the chief whip, and the die was cast. The uneasy truce between supporters of the old and new leadership was breached - with Momentum and members of the Socialist Campaign Group denouncing it. Attempts had been made behind the scenes, even from some on the Left, to get Mr Corbyn to apologise for the comments that led to his suspension. That would have made his re-admittance to the Labour's ranks less controversial - but he stopped short at a ""clarification"". So ultimately, Sir Keir had to choose whether he would be more damaged by a row with the party's left or risk the charge that he had gone soft on his pledge of zero tolerance on anti-Semitism. Drawing a line under the anti-Semitism rows is proving far easier said than done. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Boeing's 737 Max wins approval to fly in the US,"Regulators around the world ordered 737 Max grounded after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia US safety regulators have cleared Boeing's 737 Max plane to fly again, lifting grounding orders put in place in March 2019 after two deadly crashes. It marks a milestone for Boeing which was thrust into crisis by the tragedies and investigations that blamed company failures for the accidents. Its financial woes deepened this year as air travel slowed due to the virus. Existing aircraft will need to be modified before going back into service, with changes to their design. Safety regulator, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), said the clearance would not allow the plane to ""return immediately"" to the skies. Alongside the software and wiring changes, pilots will also need training. The FAA said the design changes it had required ""have eliminated what caused these particular accidents"". The boss of the FAA said he was ""100% confident"" in the safety of the plane. ""We've done everything humanly possible to make sure"" these types of crashes do not happen again,"" Steve Dickson said. As well as improvements to the plane, Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun said the company had strengthened its safety practices and culture since the disasters. ""We will never forget the lives lost in the two tragic accidents that led to the decision to suspend operations,"" said Mr Calhoun, who took over when his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, was fired last year. ""These events and the lessons we have learned as a result have reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values of safety, quality and integrity."" Paul Njoroge, who lost his wife, three children and mother-in-law in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, says he lacks confidence in Boeing Wednesday's approval comes roughly a year after Boeing had first hoped, but too soon for many of the families of those killed on the flights. Some expressed ""sheer disappointment"" over the decision, while others said they did not have confidence in regulators or Boeing, which initially sought to pin the crashes on pilot error and is still fighting victims' families in court. ""Who's going to believe them? Not me,"" said Paul Njoroge, whose wife, three children and mother-in-law were killed in the Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crash. Will the 737 Max be safe? Boeing and the FAA insist it will be - and certainly the direct cause of the accidents has now been fixed. Pilots and safety experts seem confident that the changes made to the plane will be effective. But both Boeing and the regulator still have much to prove. For Boeing, that the scathing criticisms of its corporate culture have been addressed, and that safety really is, as it often claims, its number one priority. For the FAA, that it can stand up to the aerospace giant and recover from the failures that allowed a deeply flawed plane into service, resulting in tragedy. The aircraft is coming back, but the world has changed. It was designed for a booming market, in which airlines desperately needed new planes and in which high fuel prices put a premium on efficiency. Now, the aviation industry is on its knees thanks to the Covid crisis. It's no surprise then that some airlines have been cancelling orders. However, the industry looks to the long term. Air traffic will ultimately recover, and pressure to keep costs down will return. Environmental pressures are only going to grow. The 737 Max still has a role to play. The US is the first to reverse the grounding orders, which hit the firm around the world in March 2019. European aviation officials have said they are close to making a similar decision. A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was in charge of re-certification for EU member states, as well as the UK. ""We continue to work closely with EASA on all issues relating to the B737 Max and any EASA decision on a return to service,"" he added. On a briefing with reporters, Mr Dickson said the FAA had been working closely with officials in Europe, Canada and Brazil and he expected them to re-certify the plane in a ""matter of days"". But analysts have said the process in other places, such as China, is likely to take longer. The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia came within five months of each other and together killed 346 people. They have been attributed to flaws in automated flight software called MCAS, which prompted the planes to nosedive shortly after take-off. A Boeing 737 Max, operated by Indonesia's Lion Air, crashed into the sea killing all 189 passengers and crew A US congressional report last month saidBoeing's rush to production, a decision to ignore internal safety concerns and concealment of key changes to the plane, including pilot training needs, contributed to the accidents. It also faulted the FAA for oversight lapses, including ""excessive delegation to Boeing"". Congress has since approved legislation intended to reform the agency. Boeing, which has estimated the cost of the grounding at roughly $20bn, still faces investigations, potential fines and other lawsuits as it tries to rebuild its reputation in the midst of what it has described as an unprecedented downturn in air travel. Before the crashes, Boeing churned out more than 50 of the popular 737 Max per month. But airlines around the world have cancelled and delayed orders since the pandemic. Last month, Boeing said it did not expect its production rate to top 30 planes a month until 2022. It warned investors of a backlog of about 450 737 Max planes, of which only about half of which would be delivered by the end of next year. American Airlines said it expected its first 737 Max flights in the US to resume on 29 December. United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said they planned to put their planes into service next year. But consumer association Which? warned that many passengers may remain uncomfortable with the idea of flying the jet, which is used by airlines such as Tui and Ryanair in the UK. ""Airlines that plan on flying these aircraft should give passengers with existing bookings the option of transferring to another flight for free, while operators should also make clear which planes will be used for future bookings, so people can make an informed choice before travelling,"" travel editor Rory Boland said. John Grant of aviation data firm OAG said upgrades, maintenance and pilot training required by the FAA are a logistical ""nightmare"" for airlines at a time of week demand, making it likely that many jets will not return to the skies soon. The stain on Boeing will linger as well, he warned. ""It's got a bad name and it's going to take some time to recover,"" he said. ""It will do. It's been certified, it's safe, but it's going to take time.""

Baby died when he got wedged beside mum on sofa,"Sawyer Feasey was 27 days old when he died A baby who was less than a month old died after he became wedged between cushions on a sofa where his mother had fallen asleep, an inquest heard. Sawyer Feasey was found unresponsive when his mother Jessica woke up in the early hours, in March, at their home in Plymouth, Devon. Despite her attempts to resuscitate Sawyer he died at the scene, Plymouth Coroners Court heard. There were no suspicious circumstances around his death, the court was told. Mrs Feasey's health visitor spoke of how she ""presented as a caring mother"" and cared for her children alone. Devon and Cornwall Police also said there was no evidence of smoking, alcohol or drug use in the house. The post-mortem report said Sawyer was a ""well cared for baby"" and there were no suspicious findings. A pathologist's report said it was not possible to give a medical cause of death, but that there was an increased risk associated with infants co-sleeping with adults on sofas. These factors ""could have contributed to his death"", the report stated. A statement from Mrs Feasey indicated how she had gone to bed upstairs but ""ended up downstairs"" with Sawyer after he woke for a feed. Her next memory is waking on the sofa at about 05:15 and not knowing where he was. ""He wasn't there. 'Where the hell is my baby?' I sat up and I saw he was down the side of me,"" she said. ""When I saw him down the side I knew he was gone"". She put him on the floor and attempted CPR but ""nothing I did was working. I just knew he was gone."" A statement from a paramedic said Mrs Feasey ""picked up Sawyer to cuddle him"" before they transferred his body to Derriford Hospital. Senior Coroner Ian Arrow said it was not possible to give a cause of death, returning an open conclusion and adding his ""heartfelt condolences"" to Mrs Feasey.

Police fine 29 at Covid-breach wedding party,"Blackburn with Darwen has had one of the highest Covid-19 infections in England Dozens of guests have been fined for travelling from as far as Inverness to an illegal wedding party in Lancashire. People at the event tried to flee when police arrived at the furniture factory in the Mill Hill district of Blackburn on Monday. Officers who rounded up guests, issuing 29 fines, described the scenes as being like ""a game of hide-and-seek"". Sgt Steve Dundon, of Lancashire Police, said the party was a ""slap in the face"" to those following lockdown rules. The force is speaking with Blackburn with Darwen Council to look at taking action against the wedding organiser. Earlier this month, the area had thesecond highest infection rate in the countryat 688 cases per 100,000 people. It has since dropped to 597, based on data between 6 and  12 November. The average cases per 100,000 in the country is 221. In a post on Blackburn Police's Facebook page, the force said officers had been ""shocked to discover what was essentially a wedding function taking place"". Guests had travelled to the party from London, Birmingham, Manchester and Inverness. Sgt Dundon said: ""The blatant disregard for the rules is a slap in the face to those of us who are doing our very best in this current situation."" Seven people caught working out at a gym in Blackburn have also been fined and the gym owner has been reported to the local authority. Sgt Dundon added: ""We urge anyone who is tempted to engage in these kinds of activity to just think twice and consider the serious consequences if they were to catch or spread the virus to a vulnerable person.  Would you really want that on your conscience?""

Thanks for joining us. The coronavirus live page writers today were: Mary O'Connor, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset, Max Matza, George Wright, Alice Evans and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: The doctors on Yemen's front line Olga Robinson and Laura GozziBBC anti-disinformation unit A new French âdocumentaryâ promoting bad medical advice,
misinformation and conspiracy theories about coronavirus has gone viral on
YouTube and other social networks. Over more than two and a half hours, the film - titled Hold Up - promises to reveal the âtruthâ about the virus. Instead, it pushes a slew of previously debunked claims:
allegations that wearing masks is dangerous, claims that Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates predicted the pandemic, and evidence-free assertions that the crisis
was somehow planned by global elites. The film has already been dubbed by some experts as a French
âPlandemicâ â referring to a similar English-language conspiracy videothat was debunked earlier this year. Like its predecessor, Hold Up is spreading rapidly. In the
past few days it has been watched more than a million times on YouTube alone,
despite the video sharing siteâs rules on coronavirus misinformation. Weâve
contacted YouTube for comment. Links to it have also been shared hundreds of times on
Facebook, as well as on Instagram and Reddit. Denmark's Prime Minister
Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster. Read more:Denmark shaken by cull of millions of mink Julian Assange says he and other inmates at Belmarsh prison have been placed into lockdown in their cells after being told there was a Covid-19 outbreak in his block. The WikiLeaks founder says a number of inmates at the London prison have received a letter from the governor notifying them that there had been a number of positive Covid-19 cases. All prisoners and staff are to be swabbed to detect for Covid-19 at the prison in the next 24-48 hours, says Assange. He adds that all exercise has been stopped, showers have been prohibited and meals are to be provided direct to prisoners in their cells. Assange has been held at Belmarsh Prison for the last year and a half and is awaiting the judgement from a US extradition hearing on 4 January. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We've introduced further safety measures following a number of positive cases."" A further 529 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday, bringing the UK total to 53,274,the government has said.,external There were a further 19,609 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 1,430,341 Lamborghinis come at a starting cost of around Â£150,000 ($200,000) A group of seven people from Texas and Illinois are accused of defrauding a US government stimulus programme that was set up to aid struggling small businesses - and using the funds to purchase Porsche and Lamborghini luxury cars. After receiving Â£12m ($16m) in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program of the Cares Act, they allegedly used the funds to write cheques to fake employees, including their own family members. One defendant's 86-year-old mother allegedly received at least six different cheques, as well as unemployment benefits, from a company she had never worked for before. âSome fraudsters create the most complicated schemes to steal money from the taxpayer,"" said US Attorney Ryan K Patrick of the Southern District of Texas. ""Just imagine how productive they could be if they put their creativity and effort into noble and useful work.â Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has largely seen the back of
the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a
version of normal. But thatâs not to say life is as
it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was
captured on surveillance footage helping a child whose mask had broken. On-board CCTV captured a
schoolgirl boarding a bus in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, and apologising,
holding her broken mask up when the driver asked why she wasnât wearing one. âLet me give you one,â the man,
surnamed He, is heard saying, and he is shown fitting a new mask on her face
before letting her board. In an unexpected twist, however,
surveillance footage captured the same girl boarding the bus the following day,
asking another driver if she could pass on a thank you present to him. Millions of social media users in the country have seen a picture that the girl drew, with a big heart, saying âthank you mister for helping meâ with a bar of chocolate and a lollipop. âFor the last two days, all Iâve read is bad news, but I feel warm again after seeing this,â one user of Chinaâs Sina Weibo platform says. This video can not be played Berlin police use water cannon to disperse Covid protest Our Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill reported on the protests in the German capital a little earlier. About 2,000 police officers were deployed to the parliament, or Bundestag, where thousands of protesters had gathered in anger at the latest coronavirus restrictions. Police fired water cannons to disperse those gathered. Germany is currently under a month-long ""lockdown light"", with restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues closed while schools, shops and workplaces remain open. Sean CoughlanBBC News Shane Cocker was once so lonely he began talking to chairs and wondered why they didn't answer him back. âYouâre stuck in four walls and you see nobody. You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,â says the 56-year-old unemployed lorry driver from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire of the creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane says he previously could go a fortnight without talking to anyone, in what became a ""vicious circle"". âYou donât want to admit thereâs a problem, and then things just get worse and worse. You give up on everything,â he says. But not any more, thanks to the efforts of a small Huddersfield-based charity project called Platform 1 and the new friends and purpose it has brought.

Firsat Sofi (R) is seen here distributing face masks in Irbil in June The governor of Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, has died of complications after contracting coronavirus, officials have said. Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000. Figures released by National Records of Scotland showed that the virus had been mentioned on the death certificate of 5,135 people by last Sunday. This included 278 people who had died in the previous week. Scotland recorded itsfirst confirmed coronavirus death- an elderly patient in Lothian with underlying health conditions - on 14 March.

But how does NHS Test and Trace work? If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact.

Hollywood star pays to adapt Wrexham fan's homeAiden Stott had been trying to raise cash to adapt his home when the star left a surprise donation.,"Aiden and his family had been trying to raise money to adapt his bathroom A lifelong Wrexham FC fan said he ""feels amazing"" after the club's new Hollywood star owner donated Â£6,000 to adapt his home. Aiden Stott, who has cerebral palsy, had been trying to raise the cash to get a bathroom so his family could wash him. On Wednesday, he woke up to find the entire sum had been donated by actor Rob McElhenney,who is set to take over the club, alongside Ryan Reynolds. Mr Stott said he ""couldn't believe it"". The football fan, who has been a season ticket holder for several years and is a member of the club's Disabled Supporters' Association, said he was blown away by the generosity of everyone who had donated. Aiden's favourite player is Paul Rutherford and he never misses a home game ""It means the world to me, it really does,"" said Mr Stott. After cuts to his care, the 37-year-old's parents sold their family home to buy a flat for him to live closer to them in Manchester. But after finding out adapting the bathroom to make it safe for Aiden, his family and carers, would cost Â£6,000, the family decided to set up a fundraising campaign. ""I had been deliberating whether to do it or not, because there are so many people in worse positions than us, it's not like Aiden is starving, he's got a roof over his head,"" his sister Cheryl said. This video can not be played ""Wrexham has the potential for growth"" On Monday,Wrexham Supporters Trust (WST) members voted overwhelmingly to back the takeoverby It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star McElhenney and Reynolds. While a number of people had already donated to the fundraising campaign, Cheryl said she was woken up on Wednesday by a friend telling her to look at the page. ""It was there, his name, no message, obviously I wrote a message to him and told him he made my mum cry, but we haven't heard anything from him,"" she said. ""That a Hollywood movie star looked at a picture of my brother and read his little story and what he's going through, it's just incredible. ""It's amazing that he bought the club in the first place, which we are all really excited about, but to do that as well, it just shows his true character and meaning."" Aiden's whole family support Wrexham, Ms Stott, a firefighter, said since the donation, more companies had come forward saying they would adapt the bathroom for a lower price. ""This means we can get him carers quicker as well... it's not just the bath it's being able to employ people to look after him and not to rely on his dad,"" she said. Steve Gilbert, chairman of the club's Disabled Supporters' Association, said everyone was overwhelmed by the star's generosity. Mr Gilbert said he tweeted McElhenney the link to Aiden's campaign on Tuesday in the hope he could generate some interest. ""I am still choked up about it, I still can't really put into words what it means,"" he said. ""Rob contacted us on Twitter five or six weeks ago, he told us he had spoken to Ryan, and he had said accessibility and inclusion was very important to them. ""A day into their ownership and they have already done this, we are just chuffed."" Aiden said the atmosphere at the matches was ""brilliant"" Mr Stott said he would love to meet the club's new owners and thank McElhenney for his lovely gift. ""That would make my day,"" he said.

The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: The doctors on Yemen's front line Olga Robinson and Laura GozziBBC anti-disinformation unit A new French âdocumentaryâ promoting bad medical advice,
misinformation and conspiracy theories about coronavirus has gone viral on
YouTube and other social networks. Over more than two and a half hours, the film - titled Hold Up - promises to reveal the âtruthâ about the virus. Instead, it pushes a slew of previously debunked claims:
allegations that wearing masks is dangerous, claims that Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates predicted the pandemic, and evidence-free assertions that the crisis
was somehow planned by global elites. The film has already been dubbed by some experts as a French
âPlandemicâ â referring to a similar English-language conspiracy videothat was debunked earlier this year. Like its predecessor, Hold Up is spreading rapidly. In the
past few days it has been watched more than a million times on YouTube alone,
despite the video sharing siteâs rules on coronavirus misinformation. Weâve
contacted YouTube for comment. Links to it have also been shared hundreds of times on
Facebook, as well as on Instagram and Reddit. Denmark's Prime Minister
Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster. Read more:Denmark shaken by cull of millions of mink Julian Assange says he and other inmates at Belmarsh prison have been placed into lockdown in their cells after being told there was a Covid-19 outbreak in his block. The WikiLeaks founder says a number of inmates at the London prison have received a letter from the governor notifying them that there had been a number of positive Covid-19 cases. All prisoners and staff are to be swabbed to detect for Covid-19 at the prison in the next 24-48 hours, says Assange. He adds that all exercise has been stopped, showers have been prohibited and meals are to be provided direct to prisoners in their cells. Assange has been held at Belmarsh Prison for the last year and a half and is awaiting the judgement from a US extradition hearing on 4 January. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We've introduced further safety measures following a number of positive cases.""

After receiving Â£12m ($16m) in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program of the Cares Act, they allegedly used the funds to write cheques to fake employees, including their own family members. One defendant's 86-year-old mother allegedly received at least six different cheques, as well as unemployment benefits, from a company she had never worked for before. âSome fraudsters create the most complicated schemes to steal money from the taxpayer,"" said US Attorney Ryan K Patrick of the Southern District of Texas. ""Just imagine how productive they could be if they put their creativity and effort into noble and useful work.â Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has largely seen the back of
the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a
version of normal. But thatâs not to say life is as
it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was
captured on surveillance footage helping a child whose mask had broken. On-board CCTV captured a
schoolgirl boarding a bus in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, and apologising,
holding her broken mask up when the driver asked why she wasnât wearing one. âLet me give you one,â the man,
surnamed He, is heard saying, and he is shown fitting a new mask on her face
before letting her board. In an unexpected twist, however,
surveillance footage captured the same girl boarding the bus the following day,
asking another driver if she could pass on a thank you present to him. Millions of social media users in the country have seen a picture that the girl drew, with a big heart, saying âthank you mister for helping meâ with a bar of chocolate and a lollipop. âFor the last two days, all Iâve read is bad news, but I feel warm again after seeing this,â one user of Chinaâs Sina Weibo platform says.

About 2,000 police officers were deployed to the parliament, or Bundestag, where thousands of protesters had gathered in anger at the latest coronavirus restrictions.

You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,â says the 56-year-old unemployed lorry driver from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire of the creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane says he previously could go a fortnight without talking to anyone, in what became a ""vicious circle"". âYou donât want to admit thereâs a problem, and then things just get worse and worse.

Firsat Sofi (R) is seen here distributing face masks in Irbil in June The governor of Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, has died of complications after contracting coronavirus, officials have said. Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000. Figures released by National Records of Scotland showed that the virus had been mentioned on the death certificate of 5,135 people by last Sunday. This included 278 people who had died in the previous week. Scotland recorded itsfirst confirmed coronavirus death- an elderly patient in Lothian with underlying health conditions - on 14 March.

But how does NHS Test and Trace work? If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact.

Wales rules 'won't be agreed for weeks',"This video can not be played We cannot go back to normal, says health minister It could be ""weeks"" before there is an announcement on the Covid rules around Christmas, Wales' health minister has said. Welsh ministers and other UK administrations are in talks over a set of agreed rules for the festive period. Vaughan Gething said whatever happened, the period would ""not be like normal"". ""You shouldn't expect there to be a definitive statement in the next few days or weeks,"" he told a press conference. ""We have quite a long way to go in the course of the pandemic we've been dealing with before we get to the Christmas period."" Students going home should travel by 9 December Not all students in Wales will get Covid tests Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic There had been calls for a single approach from the different UK administrations about Christmas so families who live in different areas can deal with a single set of rules. Vaughan Gething said this Christmas would ""not be like normal"" Mr Gething said discussions were ongoing about what will be in place for travel, ""and we're still looking at the evidence about what we might be able to do around contact"". ""But it does rely on the picture that we'll see in the developing evidence over the coming weeks"", he added. He noted thatother faiths had seen their festivals limited by Covid restrictions, most recently Diwali. Meanwhile Mr Gething said the rate of cases in Wales was continuing to fall, one week after Wales' firebreak lockdown. Cases in Merthyr Tydfil, which has seen the highest case rate of any local authority in the UK, have more than halved, he said. ""On Friday, I said we were starting to see some very early positive signs that cases of coronavirus are beginning to fall. This downward trend is continuing."" The seven-day incidence rate for Wales is now at about 160 cases per 100,000 people - a reduction of 70 from this time last week, he said. He also said people needed to be aware of the differences between coronavirus and seasonal flu, with the former having a higher mortality rate and a greater proportion of sufferers becoming seriously ill. After the news ofanother potentially effective vaccine, Mr Gething said he ""doesn't plan"" to make Covid vaccines mandatory. He said he had never tried to mandate any vaccine, and would not want to do so with Covid. ""I'm interested in people understanding the evidence for the safety of the vaccine , then making the right choice to protect them, their family and their community"" he added. This video can not be played Shoppers are back in Cardiff after lockdown ends On Sunday, Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said it was a""worry"" to see queues of people outside shopsat the weekend. Mr Gething said there had been ""pent-up demand"" after the firebreak, with retailers operating limits on numbers in their stores. While he had seen pictures of people socially-distancing, ""I have seen some images that are more concerning where people have forgotten about social distancing and are returning to a more normal way of behaving. ""Now, if that continues we really will face difficult choices, and we're likely to see the trend that we've already seen with reducing cases - that can easily reverse.""

'Why it means so much to me this year',"Nick's partner Sarah died a few weeks ago - he says Christmas will be horrendous without seeing loved-ones With just over a month to go until Christmas and much of the UK living under some form of coronavirus restrictions, the question on many people's minds is, how best to mark it? While some people say a visit to see family is ""not worth the risk"" of spreading Covid-19, or havealready opted to host Christmas Day over Zoom, others desperately want to see their loved-ones after a tough year. Nick Leader, 33, a regional sales manager from Oxfordshire,told BBC Radio 5 LiveChristmas would be ""horrendous"" if he was alone with his two young children, after his fiance, Sarah, died of cancer just three weeks ago. ""She was 38 and has left behind a seven-year-old and a four-year-old,"" he says. ""We've come through a lot of rubbish through the whole of this year. ""But my children at the moment have been the most amazing people on the planet and they are helping me through this day in and day out. ""I couldn't think of anything worse than being on our own, the three of us, this Christmas. ""My bigger picture is looking after my children's emotions going forward. And to lose a mum, this close to Christmas, to me it just seems too wrong to destroy their special time of Christmas."" Ministersare currently looking at how to relax restrictionsso families can celebrate Christmas together - with discussions happening between all four nations in a bid to strike a common approach. It is thought that any rule change would be for a limited time - maybe just a few days - although final decisions will not be made for a few weeks. Listen to people discussing their Christmas plans 'I'll be hosting my Christmas over Zoom' Travel rules changed for Christmas turkey workers ""It's not so much about the Christmas and the presents, it's about the people,"" saysLisa, who lives in south London. The 39-year-old teacher says the hope of getting family together at Christmas has been like the ""end of the rainbow"" - it's kept her going through a tough year, but feels like it's getting ""further and further away"". Lisa, who's originally from Australia, says Covid restrictions have meant both her mum and dad have had to cancel trips to the UK which had been planned to support her as she and her husband attempted IVF. Lisa had a miscarriage during the UK's national lockdown and has had three further unsuccessful rounds of IVF since then. Social distancing measures mean she hasn't hugged anyone apart from her husband throughout the ""very difficult year"". ""We've gone through that without the support of family around us. You look for that rainbow, you look for that light at the end of the tunnel. And to feel like you're not going to have that Christmas as a family, to hug them... it's hard for all of us,"" she says. Lisa and her husband are hoping they can still host his parents - who live in Southampton - on Christmas Day. ""I'd like to be able to celebrate with them, whether it's in the garden shivering in the cold or not. After this year, I want my family around me."" Meanwhile,Chris, from Norfolk, who did not want us to use his full name, also stresses the need to see family, saying Christmas Day is not about the ""party or celebration"" but about who you spend it with. Chris is sure this year will be the final Christmas he'll be able to spend with his dad, who is very ill with advanced cancer. Chris, 41, is considering putting his immediate family into a self-imposed two-week quarantine so that his children can spend 25 December with their grandad. He says ""sitting round the table, enjoying each other's company"" is what this time of year should be about. ""And that's all I want - just one more chance to create some memories for my children. We've obeyed the rules since the start, all I want is one day."" ButFred Stupple, 68, from Glasgow, disagrees. While he understands the tough situations that people are in, Fred says ""short-term discipline"" is important for the health of the country. Fred urges discipline, saying he has to socially distance from his wife, who is a teacher ""If Chris goes to see his father, which would be lovely and it might be his last time, he could be increasing the risk,"" he says. ""All I would like Chris to think about, and many people throughout the country - short-term discipline. ""If people just think about it and then look to the future, we really have got to be strong now."" Carolinein Norfolk adds: ""I honestly think people have just got to be more responsible. My husband's 83, we've got three daughters in different parts of the country, one in London, one in the North East... and we've got one in Sheffield. ""The girls have said to me, we'd rather have daddy and you alive and be able to enjoy next year rather than risk one day, or one time, to come to Norfolk. ""We're in a low area. It's just not worth the risk."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

"Swann to bring new Covid proposals to NI ExecutiveThe minister says it's crucial to reduce infection rates, as another 11 people die with the virus.","This video can not be played Robin Swann hopes for 'better Christmas season' Health Minister Robin Swann says he will bring proposals to Thursday's executive meeting setting out options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in NI. Ministers are due to meet for the first time sincelast week's row over extending some restrictions. Mr Swann said his paper would set out measures to ""get us through the difficult weeks ahead"". He will suggest further restrictions and initiatives, in the hopes of reaching consensus, he added. Earlier, First Minister Arlene Foster said it was ""time for the executive to step back"" and collaborate together. Her party, the DUP, faced criticism for using a cross-community mechanism to block two proposals last week from Mr Swann to extend the restrictions - and the party has not ruled out deploying it again. Speaking at a press conference at Stormont on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the ""single biggest priority"" had to be forcing down rates of infection in Northern Ireland. ""Those of us in political leadership have a critical responsibility to take the right decisions - it's tough because all of us around the executive table are taking the decisions,"" he said. ""I will be bringing a paper to tomorrow's executive...detailing a range of options and initiatives to get us through the difficult weeks ahead. ""It can help us achieve a better Christmas season as we look forward to a much better new year."" He said he would not hesitate to recommend more restrictions if required and said there were ""no quick fixes"". NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said NI's R number - or reproduction value of the virus - was sitting ""around one"" - a rise from two weeks ago when it was sitting at about 0.7 for new case numbers. ""There are no new solutions - we all need to limit our mobility and the number of contacts we have with other people and to adhere to other mitigations we've been talking about for so long,"" said Prof Young. Their comments came as another 11 people died in Northern Ireland after contracting Covid-19. In the past day, 518 more people tested positive for the virus. In the Republic of Ireland, a further 12 people died after contracting Covid-19, and 379 new cases were also confirmed. On Wednesday, the health minister visited Whiteabbey Hospital's Nightingale facility, which he said would open on Friday. Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter This was the minister and his advisers setting out their stall ahead of tomorrow's Executive meeting. The words of the Chief Scientific Adviser - ""we have not yet seen the fall we had hoped for"" - were telling. Hospital inpatients are still at a high level, and the rate of transmission, the R number, didn't drop as much as expected while schools were closed.  It's risen since they returned. The trio were asked about mass testing and rapid testing. But that's the tip of a very large iceberg of logistics, reliability and availability. At least 90% of the population would need to be repeatedly tested to allow mass rapid testing to be effective, and the rapid test currently has a 30% failure rate. Dr. Michael McBride spoke of hope being tempered with realism - while spring and summer may present a brighter picture, thanks to developments in testing, vaccination and treatments for the virus, the realistic picture now for the health minister is that more restrictions will be needed before Christmas. The department of health said it will provide enhanced rehabilitation ""step down"" care for Covid patients who are well enough to leave an acute hospital but who would benefit from a period of rehabilitation before discharge. The nightingale will be run by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and will provide an additional 23 beds with further expansion expected. Hairdressing salons are among the businesses that can reopen from Friday Earlier, Mrs Foster said initial discussions had taken place on Tuesday with other executive ministers about trying to reach an earlier decision around current Covid-19 restrictions. Close-contact services, cafes and coffee shops can reopen this Friday but restrictions on pubs, restaurants and hotels are due to expire at midnight next Thursday. ""We're all adults - we recognise last week was not good for the executive,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I hope we will have a press conference tomorrowâ¦ it is our desire to communicate with the public as much as we can. What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate ""It's about preparing the ground this week - we cannot leave it to the way it happened last week, we have to step forward this week."" She repeated her assertion that she wants to find a ""balanced and proportionate approach"" to the restrictions. Mrs Foster added she would need to see the detail from the health minister and assess it with other data before making a decision. Arlene Foster says she wants the executive to step back and try to avoid a repeat of last week's row ""I would love to give certainty to everybody in Northern Ireland but I have to hear what the health minister has to say in relation to all of that,"" said the first minister. ""People need to know what is happening and whatever the decision is I think it is incumbent upon us to communicate that as quickly as we can."" NI's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride told the press conference that officials were looking at the possibility of mass testing for university students, to allow them to come home for Christmas. However, he warned it was not a ""panacea"" for people to ignore other public health guidelines. Mr Swann added that he had written to the British Health Secretary Matt Hancock about rolling out a mass testing programme in Northern Ireland, but he cautioned that discussions were ongoing, would prove resource-intensive and would not be a full solution. Prof Young said the prospect of wider testing was ""exciting"", but that it had limitations. He said where it had been successful, a high number of the population - about 90% or more - needed to be tested, which would present ""enormous logistical challenges"" in Northern Ireland. He added that it would also require repeated testing due to the infectious cycle of the virus, meaning developing the programme itself would be challenging. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Downing Street would talk to the Stormont Executive about the government's plans to roll out more mass testing programmes across the UK. He made the remark in response to DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson during prime minister's questions. Sir Jeffrey said Northern Ireland should be considered for the scheme, which is already operating in Liverpool, due to its population size. The prime minister said he recognised mass testing was a ""powerful weapon"" in the fight against Covid-19 and that talks with the executive would take place. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had spoken to the Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson about thebenefits of mass testing. Allow Twitter content?

How will students get home?,"University students around the UK are beginning their journeys home for Christmas, after mass testing to screen them for coronavirus. Those in England and Wales are being asked to return home during the week-long ''travel window"" starting on Thursday after taking the tests, while Scotland isplanning a more staggered return.,external It is hoped this will reduce the risk of students spreading Covid-19 to their family and friends, following outbreaks on campuses earlier this term. Rapid Covid tests were distributed to universities at the end of November, so that students could be tested at the same time as England's lockdown ended on 2 December. Students who test negative have been asked to travel between 3 and 9 December, while general infection rates are lower. This means students ''pose a much-reduced risk to their loved ones and their community"", Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says. Universities in high-risk areas have been prioritised for testing, with results that can be turned around in an hour. Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus Testing facilities were set up at universities earlier in the year following outbreaks Unless they test positive or develop symptoms, students are encouraged to travel home during this timeframe, with any remaining teaching conducted online. Those found to have coronavirus will have to self-isolate for 10 days, but will still be able to get home in time for Christmas. This video can not be played How will I travel home in time for Christmas? Students are ""strongly advised"" to travel during the window, as they may not make it home for Christmas if they have to self-isolate later. Wales will follow a similar procedure to England,with students asked to travel by 9 December at the latest,and offered a rapid turnaround test before they go. Students in Scotland will be allowed to return homeif they return two negative tests,taken five days apart. Those who test positive would have to self-isolate before going home. The end dates of courses will be staggered to avoid a ""great surge of movement"" in December. The Northern Ireland Executive has not announced any specific plans for the travel windows but is also conducting mass testing of students. Students will havestaggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. Students taking hands-on courses like medicine or performing arts would return from 4 to 18 January, with other subjects initially taught online. Other students would then return between 25 January and 7 February. The other UK nations have yet to publish their plans. Scotland's Universities Minister, Richard Lochhead, said lessons must be learned from outbreaks at the start of term in Augustbefore finalising plans for January. It's not yet known whether teaching in January will move online Most universities went into the new academic year offering a blend of in-person and online teaching. But some -including the two main ones in Manchester- had already suspended in-person teaching, while all universities will finish the autumn term online. Even if you can't attend lectures in person, it is unlikely you will get a refund if you can access your course online. The government has saidstudents shouldn't expect a refund,external''if they are receiving adequate online learning"". However, some MPs have called forstudents to receive discounts,externaland the National Union of Students wants refunds if ''quality of learning is severely impacted''. They may be receiving online tuition, but students have a right to access other resources too. ''If they don't have access to libraries and research facilities, students would have a claim for breach of contract,'' says Boz Michalowska-Howells, head of consumer law at Leigh Day solicitors. Any savings universities make by not providing facilities or through government schemes should be passed on to students via fee reductions, she adds. Higher education regulator the Office for Students (OfS) says it ''can and will investigate'' if it believes universities haven't taken all reasonable steps to protect standards. Some of those who have been told to self-isolate at short notice in halls are eligible for extra support. If someone in your accommodationdevelops coronavirus symptoms- a new, continuous cough, fever or loss of taste or smell - they should self-isolate immediately and arrange to be tested. The rest of their household should also self-isolate - for 14 daysuntil they know whether the test is positive.,externalThere arefines of up to Â£10,000 for failing to do so. What is self-isolation and who has to do it? Government guidance says universities should work with Public Health England to identify what a ""whole household isolation"" means in such circumstances. It says it would normally include ""students living in the same flat or on the same floor who share cooking or washing facilities"". In September, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - which works with the government - warned of ""significant outbreaks associated with higher education"". By early October, almost all of the local areas that had coronavirus case rates of over 1,000 also had high density student populations in England. A Sage paper also identified the end of term in mid-December as likely to lead to ""the peak health impacts of newly seeded infections due to...mass movement [of students]"".

The man who talked to chairs," And how he found a new lease of life By Sean Coughlan By Sean Coughlan by Sean Coughlan “I was having discussions with chairs,” says Shane Cocker, itching with nervous energy. “I was thinking why don’t you answer me?” “You’re stuck in four walls and you see nobody. You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,” says the 56-year-old from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, describing the corrosive, creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane, an unemployed lorry driver, was isolated. Missing his mother who had died, but stoppered up by a lifetime of being told to “man up”. “You don’t want to admit there’s a problem, and then things just get worse and worse. You give up on everything,” he says, tightening his fists at the thought of it. “I was literally just sat there. I got scruffy, I got irritable, I was eating but not properly, I wasn’t able to sleep. I was in denial about everything.” It’s a problem shared by millions during the pandemic. The week when the clocks went back, with evenings getting darker earlier, saw the highest recorded levels of extreme loneliness, since the lockdown began in March. More than four million people were in the category of “always or often” lonely in the week up to 1 November, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures - more than 60% higher than typical pre-lockdown levels. Shane says he could go a fortnight without talking to anyone. “It was a vicious circle.” Social distancing has the best of intentions, but it’s also a slow starvation of the senses. And with winter approaching and the latest restrictions, more people than ever are struggling with this enforced separation. Love will tear us - two metres - apart again. For Shane, it got darker before it got better, much better. “I had nothing at all. I was just ready to jump off the bridge. That was close, very, very close. I’d even decided where I was going to go,” he says quietly. But he’s in a hurry this autumn Friday afternoon, because he’s got people who need his help, and he’s laughing. This isn’t a story about despair, it’s about getting things fixed. A bit of Huddersfield appears as he opens the front door to leave this unusual place. “It’s the Bee Gees story,” he shouts over his shoulder. “We’ve done the Tragedy. Now we’re Stayin’ Alive.” “I was having discussions with chairs,” says Shane Cocker, itching with nervous energy. “I was thinking why don’t you answer me?” “You’re stuck in four walls and you see nobody.

It’s a charity project so called, with Yorkshire literalness, because it’s right beside the town’s railway station. But any commuters looking inside, and seeing Shane and his mates bustling and joking around, are unlikely to see the deadly seriousness of what happens here - and why Friday night has such an uncomfortable significance. This tiny, gritty charity has had to respond to 15 suicide attempts during the pandemic - compared with one for all of last year. The project is on a sliver of ground, with ramshackle offices and a couple of repurposed 1950s railway carriages, that has become a haven for 500 lonely, socially-disconnected men in this part of Yorkshire. Even in the lockdown, there is still a constant flow of people coming in and out. There are work tools, bikes being repaired, a vegetable patch with cabbages, cups of tea being ferried. A big old clock face lies on the ground, maybe where time was literally hanging too heavily. People can turn up without any appointment and get help, advice and company. Shane, himself, fixes bikes for key workers, chats to his friends, and then delivers food to people who cannot get out of their own houses. “It gives us a purpose,” he says, re-energised by the idea of reaching people stuck at home the way he was before. He’s got back his self-esteem and wants to pass on the sense of hope to others still struggling to find theirs. Throughout the pandemic, between two and three million adults have not left their home for any reason during the previous seven days, for even shopping or walking, according to ONS figures.

They are the two grizzled godfathers of this rescue mission. “The need is so intense. You get people getting off the train saying, ‘Here I am, can you help?’,” says 71-year-old Bob. He’s furious that so many people are out there, lost in what he calls “the void”. If you need support for emotional distress, or you know someone else who does,these organisationsmay be able to help. “They are lonely, isolated, in danger of depression and anxiety; people who have been self-medicating; people who have lost loved ones and need some connection,” he says. The project is aimed at helping older men - who are among the most vulnerable to getting cut off and least likely to seek help. “There’s the stereotype of maleness, the stigma of weakness. They’ve been toughing it out. Get over it. Have another drink. Get another bottle,” says Bob. And he’s quick to admit that he has had problems with drink and mental health himself - and so speaks from a position of knowing what it’s like. Before the lockdown, the typical visitor would have been in their 40s, often out of work, without qualifications, living alone, with no spare cash and without access to the internet. They were people that the modern world had built a bypass around. The lockdown has radically changed who now needs help. “The people who are coming to us now are completely different. More professional people. It’s become massive,” says Jez, a feisty 61 year old running an accidental emergency service. “A lot of people who are now in crisis wouldn’t have been before,” says Bob. “They would have been in a work environment and that would have solved a lot of issues about loneliness and connection.” There are more younger people living alone, often dependent on work for their social connections - and whether they have lost their jobs, had their working hours reduced or are working from home, they risk becoming the “new lonely”. The current restrictions, when you can’t even go for a drink or a meal with friends, make it even harder. Jez talks about how workplaces are often no longer communities offering companionship and support. Mining in this area is now a day trip to a nearby mining museum. “People are distrustful of each other.” He taps a laptop and says people want contact and people to confide in, not social media. “You’ve got millions of strangers pretending to be friends.” Shane explains how loneliness can come down like a sudden nightfall. He’d looked after his grandmother until she’d died - and then his mother had been taken to hospital. He was worried about going to visit her, because he had to tell her their dog had died. Instead he was the one who got bad news. “Your mother’s got four days,” he said a doctor told him. “I said ‘No, you’re wrong. You are wrong, mate.’ So within a week I was there on my own. What was I going to do?” In the background there are phone conversations going on all the time. At their centre is the third part of this charity trinity, Bridget Fahy,  a 49 year old whose quiet voice has literally become a matter of life and death. “It’s Friday,” says Jez, who has been keeping an ear to the phone conversations. “The witching hour.” Almost all the attempted suicides here have been late on a Friday night - starting with Bridget getting a phone call. “It’s the fear of the weekend, that extra loneliness,” says Bridget. “You get a phone call where you pick up the phone and all you can hear is a man sobbing at the other end,” says Jez. “And you say, ‘Who is it?’ - and they say, ‘I just want to thank you for everything’.” While Bridget tries to talk to the callers - and it’s her they’ve usually chosen to contact - the police and ambulance services are alerted. Then Bridget and Jez scramble in their cars to reach the person who has rung. Their recent Friday night was talking down a man armed with a weapon and a fighting dog, while keeping the police at a distance. Neither of them expected to be doing this - but it’s been their experience of the lockdown. “There’s something wrong when a man I’ve only known a month puts me down as next of kin,” says Jez.

This is the only data that’s ever made me cry,” says Professor Sarah Garfinkel. And when a neuroscientist who “loves scanning brains” starts to cry over research data about loneliness you know it’s something serious. “I think it is devastating - we’re social beings, we should be together in groups,” says the professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. She has been researching what isolation does to people - and she is passionate that loneliness isn’t seen as something poignant but unimportant. Isolation, which might be interwoven with depression and anxiety, is extremely bad for your health, she says, increasing stress and raising the risk of strokes, heart attacks and ultimately premature death. “When you compare loneliness to other risk factors it’s actually one of the more dominant ones,” she says. Prof Garfinkel warns that loneliness can lead to other destructive “comfort” behaviour such as drinking too much alcohol or over eating. And loneliness goes hand-in-exhausted-hand with not being able to sleep. Prof Garfinkel is trying to look after her own young university students during the pandemic and is desperately worried about them suffering from loneliness and being “stuck on their own”. The pandemic and isolation on such a big scale runs against all our human needs, she says, and our instincts to “huddle together” when facing dangers. Much communication has been switched online, but she says Zoom meetings are a poor substitute for the social benefits of being in company. This might be in a way that we don’t even realise, says Prof Garfinkel. For instance, the size of someone’s pupils might subtly mirror those of another person speaking to them, sending out signals of empathy. With the postage stamp heads on a Zoom meeting that’s impossible and you’re left with a feeling of talking to someone who is not emotionally responding. If loneliness is a serious health problem - then there is an awful lot of it about. It’s like a cobweb getting strung wider and wider. The elderly. Carers. Those shielding. Students. Mothers with young babies. The bereaved. Single people cut off from social lives. Young adults working from home. People with mental health problems. Those cut off in care homes. People with disabilities. Mourners having to sit physically apart at a funeral. Families waving at relatives through glass. It’s not even just about being alone. The pandemic tracking figures show that while some people are suffering from spending too much time on their own, others are miserable from never getting any time to themselves. Loneliness, as well as hell, can be other people. Study after study shows young people feel loneliness more acutely than any other group - they’re aching to get out and connect with friends and have missed so many big bonding events this year, whether it was a school prom, graduation, birthday parties or post-exam festivals. Covid is also the great divider, magnifying differences - and loneliness is not shared evenly. A study from YouGov shows a clear social gap, with poorer people much more likely to be lonely. Renters have higher levels of loneliness than homeowners. Whatever the combination of factors, the start of November saw the highest peak so far in levels of adults who are “always or often” lonely - coinciding with the arrival of longer winter evenings. According to the ONS, in the week up to 1 November there were 4.2 million adults across Britain in this category - compared with 2.6 million in parts of the summer and before the pandemic. These numbers fluctuate and are nudging down from that peak - but the overall trend has shown loneliness at high levels as the seasons change. In August, the broader measure of loneliness, including those who are “sometimes” lonely stood at about 10 million adults - and that had risen to about 14 million in October and November, with the latest figure at about 12.5 million. If those who are “occasionally” lonely are included it’s about half the adult population. Dr Vivian Hill, who has researched isolation in the pandemic for the British Psychological Society, thinks the “descent into winter” is a “very significant factor”, with the weather making it difficult to get outside. But she says loneliness is something that we should be optimistic about tackling. “Many people have adapted, we’re very resilient - and we’ve found other ways to make those social connections,” says Dr Hill. But she says it’s vital to support those people for whom isolation in the pandemic has been a “catastrophe” - and these might be specific groups, such as people with autism whose usual social networks might be out of reach. There have been distinct waves of loneliness during the pandemic, says Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of psychobiology at University College London. And contrary to what might have been expected, the first lockdown in March did not trigger a great surge of loneliness. “Everyone was in the same boat,” says Dr Fancourt, with people feeling part of a great collective effort - clapping on doorsteps and Zoom quizzes. But she says the psychological toll is building up. People are fearful about jobs and money and collectively there are worries gathering below the surface. This sense of burn out is backed by another tracking survey of morale in the pandemic, with the ONS asking people how satisfied they feel with their lives - and the week to 1 November was the lowest it has ever been since it began in March. Baroness Barran, the Minister for Loneliness, puts it simply: “People are tired.” She says the collective mood towards the pandemic has been through its initial “heroic” phase and has the challenge of a phase of “disillusionment”, made more difficult with “shorter days and longer nights”. She says talking to people looking after relatives with dementia, isolated during the pandemic, had been one of the “most painful conversations I’ve had this year”. When Shane opens the front door from Platform 1, the square outside Huddersfield station is almost empty. It’s Covid quiet. The Head of Steam pub is silent and the bronze statue to local boy Harold Wilson is looking out on streets that look weary in the latest lockdown. The pawnbrokers round the corner has a “To Let” sign up. But people are still people and, given a chance, they’ll help others. “When I first went to Platform 1 I wouldn’t talk to anybody,” says Shane. “I just didn’t have the confidence. I’d be stood there stuttering and stammering.” It took him six weeks to come back to life, getting involved in some of the activities here, talking to people, making and repairing things, playing chess, going on trips, gardening. And he’s gone from getting help to being the helper, an ebullient voice for the possibility of change. Shane keeps making the point that there is an answer - there are positive ways of getting support - and there is no need to “totally lose the plot and refuse to come out of the house”. “Rather than talking to chairs and slowly going round the bend you can come in here and you’re not on your own,” he says. But men in particular have to admit to their problems - and need to let the tears start to flow, says Shane. “It’s meant to be unmanly. But it’s not. Now I say, ‘Come in and have a cry. And we turn it around and have a laugh.” Shane says he met Baroness Barran on a visit to Huddersfield  and bent her ear to say he thought there should be more practical approaches to tackle loneliness - such as subsidising bus passes so that people can get to places like Platform 1. She isn’t short of people offering suggestions. She says her ministerial email in-box is filled with a “mixture of lots of people talking about their own ideas of how to help - and others saying how desperately lonely and isolated they feel”. Her department is giving grants to “hyperlocal” community projects that help people to connect with each other. Services can be thinly stretched though. Another middle-aged visitor to Platform 1, a recovering addict trying to reconnect with his family, says he had a “breakdown” during the lockdown and was self-harming. He ended up being treated hundreds of miles away in Surrey. And as he says, that trip cost much more than a bus pass.

Often it’s the fact they have someone to talk to, somewhere to go. A smile and a cup of coffee are absolutely priceless,” says Bob. “It’s so rewarding when you hear someone say I wouldn’t do that if you hadn’t been there,” says Shane. Every one of those 15 people who had attempted suicide were reached in time. It’s getting darker in Huddersfield. The nights are coming in fast. The shops are missing their customers, the roads are missing traffic and people are desperately missing each other.

Foster calls for collaboration over Covid-19 rulesAnother 11 people have died with Covid-19 and 518 more have tested positive for the virus.,"This video can not be played Robin Swann hopes for 'better Christmas season' Health Minister Robin Swann says he will bring proposals to Thursday's executive meeting setting out options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in NI. Ministers are due to meet for the first time sincelast week's row over extending some restrictions. Mr Swann said his paper would set out measures to ""get us through the difficult weeks ahead"". He will suggest further restrictions and initiatives, in the hopes of reaching consensus, he added. Earlier, First Minister Arlene Foster said it was ""time for the executive to step back"" and collaborate together. Her party, the DUP, faced criticism for using a cross-community mechanism to block two proposals last week from Mr Swann to extend the restrictions - and the party has not ruled out deploying it again. Speaking at a press conference at Stormont on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the ""single biggest priority"" had to be forcing down rates of infection in Northern Ireland. ""Those of us in political leadership have a critical responsibility to take the right decisions - it's tough because all of us around the executive table are taking the decisions,"" he said. ""I will be bringing a paper to tomorrow's executive...detailing a range of options and initiatives to get us through the difficult weeks ahead. ""It can help us achieve a better Christmas season as we look forward to a much better new year."" He said he would not hesitate to recommend more restrictions if required and said there were ""no quick fixes"". NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said NI's R number - or reproduction value of the virus - was sitting ""around one"" - a rise from two weeks ago when it was sitting at about 0.7 for new case numbers. ""There are no new solutions - we all need to limit our mobility and the number of contacts we have with other people and to adhere to other mitigations we've been talking about for so long,"" said Prof Young. Their comments came as another 11 people died in Northern Ireland after contracting Covid-19. In the past day, 518 more people tested positive for the virus. In the Republic of Ireland, a further 12 people died after contracting Covid-19, and 379 new cases were also confirmed. On Wednesday, the health minister visited Whiteabbey Hospital's Nightingale facility, which he said would open on Friday. Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter This was the minister and his advisers setting out their stall ahead of tomorrow's Executive meeting. The words of the Chief Scientific Adviser - ""we have not yet seen the fall we had hoped for"" - were telling. Hospital inpatients are still at a high level, and the rate of transmission, the R number, didn't drop as much as expected while schools were closed.  It's risen since they returned. The trio were asked about mass testing and rapid testing. But that's the tip of a very large iceberg of logistics, reliability and availability. At least 90% of the population would need to be repeatedly tested to allow mass rapid testing to be effective, and the rapid test currently has a 30% failure rate. Dr. Michael McBride spoke of hope being tempered with realism - while spring and summer may present a brighter picture, thanks to developments in testing, vaccination and treatments for the virus, the realistic picture now for the health minister is that more restrictions will be needed before Christmas. The department of health said it will provide enhanced rehabilitation ""step down"" care for Covid patients who are well enough to leave an acute hospital but who would benefit from a period of rehabilitation before discharge. The nightingale will be run by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and will provide an additional 23 beds with further expansion expected. Hairdressing salons are among the businesses that can reopen from Friday Earlier, Mrs Foster said initial discussions had taken place on Tuesday with other executive ministers about trying to reach an earlier decision around current Covid-19 restrictions. Close-contact services, cafes and coffee shops can reopen this Friday but restrictions on pubs, restaurants and hotels are due to expire at midnight next Thursday. ""We're all adults - we recognise last week was not good for the executive,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I hope we will have a press conference tomorrowâ¦ it is our desire to communicate with the public as much as we can. What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate ""It's about preparing the ground this week - we cannot leave it to the way it happened last week, we have to step forward this week."" She repeated her assertion that she wants to find a ""balanced and proportionate approach"" to the restrictions. Mrs Foster added she would need to see the detail from the health minister and assess it with other data before making a decision. Arlene Foster says she wants the executive to step back and try to avoid a repeat of last week's row ""I would love to give certainty to everybody in Northern Ireland but I have to hear what the health minister has to say in relation to all of that,"" said the first minister. ""People need to know what is happening and whatever the decision is I think it is incumbent upon us to communicate that as quickly as we can."" NI's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride told the press conference that officials were looking at the possibility of mass testing for university students, to allow them to come home for Christmas. However, he warned it was not a ""panacea"" for people to ignore other public health guidelines. Mr Swann added that he had written to the British Health Secretary Matt Hancock about rolling out a mass testing programme in Northern Ireland, but he cautioned that discussions were ongoing, would prove resource-intensive and would not be a full solution. Prof Young said the prospect of wider testing was ""exciting"", but that it had limitations. He said where it had been successful, a high number of the population - about 90% or more - needed to be tested, which would present ""enormous logistical challenges"" in Northern Ireland. He added that it would also require repeated testing due to the infectious cycle of the virus, meaning developing the programme itself would be challenging. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Downing Street would talk to the Stormont Executive about the government's plans to roll out more mass testing programmes across the UK. He made the remark in response to DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson during prime minister's questions. Sir Jeffrey said Northern Ireland should be considered for the scheme, which is already operating in Liverpool, due to its population size. The prime minister said he recognised mass testing was a ""powerful weapon"" in the fight against Covid-19 and that talks with the executive would take place. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had spoken to the Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson about thebenefits of mass testing. Allow Twitter content?

NHS Test and Trace boss Dido Harding self-isolates,"The head of NHS Test and Trace is self-isolating after receiving a notification from the NHS mobile app. Baroness Dido Harding tweeted that she was ""feeling well"", and added: ""Nothing like personal experience of your own products."" It comes a week after her husband, Conservative MP John Penrose, was told to isolate by the app, and days after PM Boris Johnson began self-isolating. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis also said he was self-isolating. Mr Powis, who appeared at a Downing Street briefing over video call, said he was ""perfectly fine"" but had been told to self-isolate by Test and Trace after a member of his household tested positive for coronavirus. On Sunday, the prime minister was told to stay at home after having a meeting last week with Tory MP Lee Anderson, who then tested positive. Baroness Harding's husband was told to self-isolate on 9 November after potentially coming into contact with someone who had the virus. Why did test-and-trace app contact its boss? Husband of test and trace boss is self-isolating Why does Boris Johnson have to self-isolate? In Baroness Harding's tweet, it showed she had nine days of self-isolation left - having to stay at home until 23:59 GMT on 26 November. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The reason her screenshot shows she has to isolate for nine days - rather than the standard 14 days - is because the 14-day isolation period starts from when the app made the contact. How the app works in England and Wales If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. The app calculates when to send an alert by tallying up points depending on the time spent together and distance. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact. Baroness Harding's tweet indicating she has been told to self-isolate has caused some confusion, highlighting the fact that her team needs to do better in communicating how the app works. Why, some ask, has she been asked to isolate for only nine rather than 14 days? Here's the answer. When an app user starts to feel unwell or gets a Covid test for some other reason, they enter a positive result into the app. They can then choose to share that result with other users. Their phone will have used its Bluetooth connection to record close contacts with other app users - usually involving being within two metres for 15 minutes - over the previous days. Those people will then get an alert in their app to self-isolate but the duration will be 14 days from the last close contact. So if I enter a positive test on a Sunday and I've been in close contact with you the previous Tuesday, you will get an alert on the Sunday to isolate for nine days. Baroness Harding was appointed the head of NHS Test and Trace in May, and has since beenappointed chair of the National Institute for Health Protection- the new agency replacing Public Health England. The 52-year-old is the former head of internet service provider TalkTalk, and for the past three years has been chair of NHS Improvement - focusing on driving up standards across the service. She has come under criticism for her handling of NHS Test and Trace after a raft of issues, including delayed results and test centres struggling to keep up with demand. But Baroness Harding has defended her own performanceafter calls for her to quit, and warned testing is not the""silver bullet to hold back the tide of Covid"". TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Thanks for joining us. The coronavirus live page writers today were: Mary O'Connor, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset, Max Matza, George Wright, Alice Evans and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: The doctors on Yemen's front line Olga Robinson and Laura GozziBBC anti-disinformation unit A new French âdocumentaryâ promoting bad medical advice,
misinformation and conspiracy theories about coronavirus has gone viral on
YouTube and other social networks. Over more than two and a half hours, the film - titled Hold Up - promises to reveal the âtruthâ about the virus. Instead, it pushes a slew of previously debunked claims:
allegations that wearing masks is dangerous, claims that Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates predicted the pandemic, and evidence-free assertions that the crisis
was somehow planned by global elites. The film has already been dubbed by some experts as a French
âPlandemicâ â referring to a similar English-language conspiracy videothat was debunked earlier this year. Like its predecessor, Hold Up is spreading rapidly. In the
past few days it has been watched more than a million times on YouTube alone,
despite the video sharing siteâs rules on coronavirus misinformation. Weâve
contacted YouTube for comment. Links to it have also been shared hundreds of times on
Facebook, as well as on Instagram and Reddit. Denmark's Prime Minister
Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster. Read more:Denmark shaken by cull of millions of mink Julian Assange says he and other inmates at Belmarsh prison have been placed into lockdown in their cells after being told there was a Covid-19 outbreak in his block. The WikiLeaks founder says a number of inmates at the London prison have received a letter from the governor notifying them that there had been a number of positive Covid-19 cases. All prisoners and staff are to be swabbed to detect for Covid-19 at the prison in the next 24-48 hours, says Assange. He adds that all exercise has been stopped, showers have been prohibited and meals are to be provided direct to prisoners in their cells. Assange has been held at Belmarsh Prison for the last year and a half and is awaiting the judgement from a US extradition hearing on 4 January. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We've introduced further safety measures following a number of positive cases."" A further 529 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday, bringing the UK total to 53,274,the government has said.,external There were a further 19,609 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 1,430,341 Lamborghinis come at a starting cost of around Â£150,000 ($200,000) A group of seven people from Texas and Illinois are accused of defrauding a US government stimulus programme that was set up to aid struggling small businesses - and using the funds to purchase Porsche and Lamborghini luxury cars. After receiving Â£12m ($16m) in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program of the Cares Act, they allegedly used the funds to write cheques to fake employees, including their own family members. One defendant's 86-year-old mother allegedly received at least six different cheques, as well as unemployment benefits, from a company she had never worked for before. âSome fraudsters create the most complicated schemes to steal money from the taxpayer,"" said US Attorney Ryan K Patrick of the Southern District of Texas. ""Just imagine how productive they could be if they put their creativity and effort into noble and useful work.â Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has largely seen the back of
the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a
version of normal. But thatâs not to say life is as
it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was
captured on surveillance footage helping a child whose mask had broken. On-board CCTV captured a
schoolgirl boarding a bus in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, and apologising,
holding her broken mask up when the driver asked why she wasnât wearing one. âLet me give you one,â the man,
surnamed He, is heard saying, and he is shown fitting a new mask on her face
before letting her board. In an unexpected twist, however,
surveillance footage captured the same girl boarding the bus the following day,
asking another driver if she could pass on a thank you present to him. Millions of social media users in the country have seen a picture that the girl drew, with a big heart, saying âthank you mister for helping meâ with a bar of chocolate and a lollipop. âFor the last two days, all Iâve read is bad news, but I feel warm again after seeing this,â one user of Chinaâs Sina Weibo platform says. This video can not be played Berlin police use water cannon to disperse Covid protest Our Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill reported on the protests in the German capital a little earlier. About 2,000 police officers were deployed to the parliament, or Bundestag, where thousands of protesters had gathered in anger at the latest coronavirus restrictions. Police fired water cannons to disperse those gathered. Germany is currently under a month-long ""lockdown light"", with restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues closed while schools, shops and workplaces remain open. Sean CoughlanBBC News Shane Cocker was once so lonely he began talking to chairs and wondered why they didn't answer him back. âYouâre stuck in four walls and you see nobody. You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,â says the 56-year-old unemployed lorry driver from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire of the creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane says he previously could go a fortnight without talking to anyone, in what became a ""vicious circle"". âYou donât want to admit thereâs a problem, and then things just get worse and worse. You give up on everything,â he says. But not any more, thanks to the efforts of a small Huddersfield-based charity project called Platform 1 and the new friends and purpose it has brought.

Kolasinac will now miss Wednesday's Nations League match with Italy. The 27-year-old played the full 90 minutes of Bosnia-Herzegovina's defeat to the Netherlands on Sunday. He is the second Arsenal player to test positive this week, afterEgypt midfielder Mohamed Elneny. It means Kolasinac could now miss Arsenalâs Premier League game at Leeds on Sunday (16:30 GMT) and a Europa League tie in Norway against Molde on 26 November (17:55). Read morehere. Firsat Sofi (R) is seen here distributing face masks in Irbil in June The governor of Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, has died of complications after contracting coronavirus, officials have said. Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000. Figures released by National Records of Scotland showed that the virus had been mentioned on the death certificate of 5,135 people by last Sunday. This included 278 people who had died in the previous week. Scotland recorded itsfirst confirmed coronavirus death- an elderly patient in Lothian with underlying health conditions - on 14 March.

Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster.

All prisoners and staff are to be swabbed to detect for Covid-19 at the prison in the next 24-48 hours, says Assange. He adds that all exercise has been stopped, showers have been prohibited and meals are to be provided direct to prisoners in their cells.

the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a

it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was
captured on surveillance footage helping a child whose mask had broken. On-board CCTV captured a
schoolgirl boarding a bus in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, and apologising,
holding her broken mask up when the driver asked why she wasnât wearing one. âLet me give you one,â the man,

Firsat Sofi (R) is seen here distributing face masks in Irbil in June The governor of Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, has died of complications after contracting coronavirus, officials have said. Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000.

"Kenya arrests after BBC exposÃ© of baby stealersThree medical officers were detained for allegedly running a child-trafficking syndicate, police say.","This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings Police in Kenya have arrested four more people for allegedly running a child-trafficking syndicate following a BBC investigation into the theft and sale of babies. BBC Africa Eye revealed children were stolen to order from illegal clinics and at a Nairobi public hospital. Seven people are now in custody in connection with the case including medics and a hospital administrator. The babies were sold for as little as $400 (Â£300). In the wake of the BBC Africa Eye story, police chief Hillary Mutyambai ordered an investigation into hospitals, as well as children's homes in the Kenyan capital. Buying a baby on Nairobi's black market The baby stealers,external Africa Live: More on this and other stories Two hospital administrators, a nurse and a social worker appeared in court on Thursday, adding to the three senior medical officials who were in court on Wednesday. They have not been formally charged and did not enter pleas. BBC Africa Eye uncovered a trade in children stolen from vulnerable mothers living on the streets, as well as the existence of illegal clinics dotted around Nairobi, where babies were being sold. The investigation also revealed alleged corruption at Mama Lucy Kibaki, a public hospital in Nairobi. Three senior medical officers were in court on Wednesday Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at the hospital, is alleged to have facilitated the sale of an abandoned two-week-old baby boy to undercover reporters, later accepting 300,000 shillings ($2,700; Â£2,000) in cash. Both Mr Leparan and Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital declined requests to comment on the investigation's findings. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Kenya's Labour and Social Protection Minister Simon Chelugui said the culprits would face the ""full force of the law"". The suspects have not commented on the allegations against them Mr Chelugui also acknowledged that improvements to some of Kenya's child protection services were needed. His colleague in the Interior Ministry Fred Matiang'i thanked the BBC for exposing the ""rot"" at Mama Lucy hospital. He added that human and drug trafficking were the biggest challenges Kenyan security was dealing with. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in the East African state, but a non-governmental organisation, Missing Child Kenya, said it had been involved in nearly 600 cases in the past three years. Ferdinand Omondi, BBC News, Kenya It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say the BBC exposÃ© caught the government unawares. On the day it was published, state officials including the inspector general of police, the labour and social protection minister and the government spokesman held an emergency meeting. The next day, three arrests were made and police acknowledged there was a crime ring involving medical officers and child traffickers. Three suspects were immediately hauled to court - all medical officers. The interior minister was impressed by this efficiency and praised the decisive action. But Kenyans were livid. Did the police have to wait for the BBC investigate for them? How high does the syndicate go? Will they get convictions? These were some of the questions Kenyans asked, in a guarded response to the legal process which has just began, which many hope will ultimately paralyse one of Kenya's biggest crimes - human trafficking.

The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented.""

Apple slashes fees to indie app developers,"Apple is halving the commission it takes from the sale of apps and virtual goods sold within them from many of the smaller developers using its stores. From January,any existing app-maker who earned $1m (Â£830,000) or less,externalfrom Apple's marketplaces in 2020 will only have to give up a 15% cut in 2021. That compares to the standard rate of 30%. New developers also qualify. It follows widespread criticism by developers of the fees Apple charges, and coincides with anti-trust scrutiny. Chief executive Tim Cook was questioned several times about therates his firm charges when he appeared before US lawmakers at a competition hearing in July. It emerged there that Amazon had negotiated a special 15% rate for in-app charges within its Prime Video app. And the preceding month the European Commission opened its ownprobe into the marketplace's rules. Apple, however, has characterised the move as being a natural evolution of its policies, which it had made after listening to feedback from its developer communities. About 28 million developers use Apple's store, and the firm says the vast majority of those who charge fees will benefit. But it has not provided a figure for how many it forecasts will be affected. One of those who will earn more told the BBC he welcomed the move, but said that might not be true of everyone. ""Earlier in the year, Apple faced a lot of bad PR because it was seen to be capitalising on the pandemic by charging its 30% cut on small businesses - like those offering fitness training or classes - that had gone virtual via an app,"" said Benjamin Mayo, creator of the Daily Dictionary and Bingo Machine apps. ""So they and others of us in the indie community will see this as a good thing. ""But the bigger apps like Spotify and Epic will likely see this as unfair as they're being excluded despite earning the App Store more money."" Video game Fortnite's developer Epic later confirmed this point. ""This would be something to celebrate were it not a calculated move by Apple to divide app creators and preserve their monopoly on stores and payments, again breaking the promise of treating all developers equally,"" said the firm's chief executive Tim Sweeney. By design, the scheme will exclude the highest-earning software creators for Apple products. At present, the only way for developers to offer native apps - rather than those that run via a web browser - for iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and the Apple TV set-top box is via the firm's App Store. By contrast, they can sell their products directly to consumers or via alternative marketplaces on its Mac computers. Apple claims the App Store ecosystem made about $519bn in commerce possible in 2019 Under the new scheme, the 15% rate applies if their total earnings from apps sold via Apple fell below the $1m threshold the previous year. But it rises to 30% again for any additional sales made beyond $1m during 2021. The $1m figure is calculated on the basis of the developers' post-commission earnings rather than the total revenue of their products. And Apple intends to continue the initiative in later years. One quirk of the scheme is that it gives developers an incentive to pull products or make them free towards the end of the year to avoid crossing the cut-off point. This is because if a software-maker earns $1,000,001 they would face the full 30% rate the following year, but if they made $999,999 they would qualify for the discount. An alternative would have been to simply let all developers benefit from the lower rate on the first $1m of their earnings. But the tech giant has indicated it wanted to limit the scheme to its smaller, independent developer community and believed this was the best way to do that. Market research firm Sensor Tower told the BBC its data suggests about 4.9% of the App Store's total revenue in 2019 came via those earning less than $1m. ""Other platform holders who have yet to budge on their own 30% cut will be taking note and may now feel the need to act,"" said Craig Chapple, a strategist at the firm. This is a clever move by Apple to try to show both developers and regulators that it is responding to concerns that it abuses its dominant position in the iOS app market. But there is less to this change than meets the eye. Sure, the cut in commission will probably benefit the vast majority of its 28 million developers. But as Apple won't be transparent about how many of them release paid apps but earn less than $1m a year from them, we can't put a number on how many will be affected. Similarly, the company won't tell us what proportion of its App Store revenue comes from developers earning more than $1m who will continue to pay a 30% commission. What we do know is that services now make a very important contribution to Apple's bottom line and it's thought it earned $50bn from the App Store in 2019. You can bet that this move is not going to affect that flow of cash in any material fashion. Cynics will say this is a divide-and-rule strategy to quieten the complaints from smaller developers. But don't expect the giants - or indeed the EU regulators - to turn down the volume.

Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early?,"This video can not be played Should lockdown continue where cases are high? Lockdown should continue in Merthyr Tydfil ""for weeks, even months"", according to a top doctor. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board consultant Dr Dai Samuel questioned whether current measures were working. Earlier this week, Merthyr had the UK's highest weekly infection rate - but it has dropped in the past few days. The Welsh Government said: ""We are not returning to the network of local restrictions which was in place before the firebreak started."" Merthyr Tydfil has a rate of 639.9 cases for every 100,000 people over the past seven days, up until 3 November. It is a fall in infection rates by 100 in a matter of days, but it still remains one of the worst rates in the UK, and nearly a third of people in the area who were tested returned positive results. Earlier this week, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent were ninth and 10th respectively for infection rates in the UK. Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru, consultant hepatologist Dr Samuel said: ""Everyone's tired of the restrictions but it's hard to say we're going back to normal on Monday when the numbers are still rising. ""Traditionally, places like Merthyr and the valleys pull together in tough times, so I think we all now need to call on our friends and relatives to follow the rules - wear a mask, keep 2m distance and don't go to places that aren't essential. ""A solution might be more fines and asking people 'where did you get Covid?' because at the moment, it's not working."" This video can not be played Watch how the proportion of positive cases has climbed - but may now have reached the summit At the Welsh Government's Friday press briefing, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said extending the firebreak in places such as Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent would be a ""massive breach of trust"". He added: ""It would have much greater consequences for people doing what we all should, in terms of changing the way we live our lives, and the trust people have in government. ""It is always the case, though, that if we see sustained localised increases we'll be prepared to take measures that are appropriate."" He said it would not be possible to see the impact of the firebreak lockdown until two tor three weeks after it ends. Mr Gething also added thatCwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board was ""at the centre"" of ""big pressures and pinch points"" on the NHS. However, in a joint statement, Merthyr Tydfil's MP and MS said the situation in the constituency remained ""alarming enough so as to require further action"". ""We believe that we need an even clearer view on the extent of the virus in the local population and testing needs to increase further,"" said Gerald Jones and Dawn Bowden. ""We must all still try to ensure that our behaviour helps to reduce the spread of the virus and save lives. We are currently discussing the situation with Welsh Government ministers, public health and local authority representatives."" Jamie Jenkins, an independent statistician and former head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics, said data over the coming days would prove crucial in identifying whether the end of the lockdown would ""light the fire again"". The growth in the rate of positive tests is beginning to stall in areas including Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""What we are starting to see for the first time is that the positivity rate is starting to come down in some areas,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""In recent days it has flattened. That's a positive sign, which suggests we are seeing a turning point in the rate of people coming back positive with Covid-19 in the community. We are seeing that in Wales overall, and in Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""Whilst we are stalled, there is a considerable way to come back down."" Merthyr florist owner Suzanne Edwards says people are ""in and out"" of each other's homes Suzanne Edwards, who owns a florists on Brecon Road, Merthyr, said she thinks lockdown rules should continue. ""Two weeks hasn't been long enough and the numbers are still going up, so I don't know what the purpose of this two weeks has been. ""They're in and out of each other's homes, having little get-togethers and they just don't think it's going to happen to them."" Merthyr council leader Kevin O'Neill said people living in the county were ""close emotionally and physically"" which helped the spread of the virus. ""There's a band across the valleys, I think that's also to do with the geography, contained roadways, narrow valleys, lack of facilities, lack of places to go,"" Mr O'Neill added. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Has the firebreak lockdown had an impact? UK coronavirus infections may be 'stabilising' When asked if Merthyr should move out of lockdown with the rest of the country on Monday, he said: ""I think there's a need to graduate some of the release of those regulations, but also the vast majority of the public have complied."" Lee Davies, councillor for the Gurnos, said it was ""always going to be quite difficult in these communities"". ""You are all condensed into one community, there's one shop, and one place that everyone goes to. People are living on top of each other."" This video can not be played A ""number of people"" attended a bonfire on the Gurnos estate, police said Meanwhile, police confirmed that a number of people attended a bonfire on the Gurnos estate on Thursday evening. South Wales Police officers attended to give âsuitable adviceâ and remind them of Covid regulations. Plaid Cymru has called for aLiverpool-style testing regimein areas hit hard by the virus. Rhun ap Iorwerth, the party's health spokesman, said he was ""not satisfied"" with Mr Gething's explanation that the lockdown should be lifted in areas with high incidence and the numbers in places such as Merthyr Tydfil ""ring alarm bells"". Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative's spokesman on health, said: ""If Labour ministers were to apply their Covid logic and policy consistently, they would be reconsidering their decision to ease restrictions in high-incidence areas in counties such as Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent and Rhondda Cynon Taf on Monday. ""Welsh Conservatives have called for targeted intervention in the hot-spot areas in Wales and we once again repeat that call today."" Merthyr remains one of the worst-hit areas in the UK when it comes to cases per 100,000 people First Minister Mark Drakeford said on Mondayhe did not ""intend to step away from"" the bargain he madeto return freedoms after the 17-day firebreak. On Friday, a Welsh Government spokesman said: ""To keep the virus under control, we need to think about our own lives and how we can keep our families safe and stop thinking about the maximum limit of rules and regulations.

Has the firebreak lockdown had an impact?,"Some areas of the south Wales valleys have seen among the highest rates in the UK The 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown started on 23 October but what has been its impact? It covered school half-term and was intended to have an impact on bringing down infections. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""a short, sharp, shock to turn back the clock, slow down the virus and buy us more time"". Earlier this week he said restrictions had ""arrested the speed"" of the rise in cases and efforts had made a ""real and positive difference"" in ensuring the firebreak did not need to be longer and more severe. But there are concerns that some areas of the south Wales valleys have been seeing increasing case rates, with Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent among the highest rates in the UK. So have we seen a difference yet? Here are a few areas we should be looking at. This video can not be played Watch how cases of Covid-19 have changed across Wales during the firebreak The case rates - the number of positive tests per 100,000 people over seven days - help us look at where infections are spreading and how fast. There have been worries over how the number of cases have risen in the heads of the valleys, with Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent seeing cases start to spike and become among the worst in the UK. Wrexham and around Swansea and Neath Port Talbot have also seen rises during the firebreak period. But there are signs of improvement in the most recent sets of figures. Even Merthyr Tydfil, the worst in the UK at one point this week, has seen its case rate drop back. Covid: Lockdown 'should continue for months' in Merthyr Merthyr Tydfil now worst in UK for case rates Royal Glamorgan Hospital staff 'broken' by pandemic deaths This video can not be played Watch how the proportion of positive cases has climbed - but may now have reached the summit The proportion of positive tests is something which health officials and ministers have been keeping a close eye on. Seven local areas in Wales are now above the 20% positivity rate, with nearly a third of all tests in Merthyr Tydfil coming back positive. The World Health Organization has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions. That figure was also part of the calculations behind decisions to put areas into local lockdowns earlier in the autumn. But the worst may be over - although how to make inroads into reducing it is the next challenge. Independent statistician Jamie Jenkins, who was formerly with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said we were starting to see the positivity rate stalling and beginning to come down in some areas. ""That's a positive sign, which suggests we are seeing a turning point in the rate of people coming back positive with Covid-19 in the community. We are seeing that in Wales overall, and in Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf."" But he said the data over the coming days would prove crucial in identifying whether the end of the lockdown would ""light the fire again"". There is some good news in that the proportion of people with Covid infections in Wales is rising less sharply, according to the latest survey by the ONS. It goes out to test thousands of people in Wales, just to see if they have the virus. How we reached lockdown in six charts What do the stats tell us? Analysis of thousands of swab tests can estimate that 26,100 people in Wales had Covid-19 - about 0.89%, or one in 110 people - in the first week of the firebreak. This is only 1,000 more than estimated last week, showing the infection seems to have slowed down. The previous week had seen a rise of 9,400. ""Positivity rates in Wales have increased in recent weeks, but the rate of increase is less steep compared with previous weeks,"" said the ONS. Over a six-week period, it asked 15,844 people in Wales for nose or throat swabs. It tested the results and found 84 positive results, from 64 people from 50 households. One of the ideas behind the firebreak was to take the edge off hospital admissions. The daily average of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 admissions is about the same as when the firebreak began. There were 1,344 patients in hospital with the virus, with 60 in intensive care, according to the latest available figure. But beyond the statistics, hospital doctors are talking about ""immense"" pressure already and starting to become overwhelmed with Covid again. Unlike during the first wave, hospitals are trying to treat as many non-Covid patients as possible, with normal operations continuing. At the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf, they are seeing Covid presenting on top of other conditions they would expect to deal with. Nerys Conway, consultant in acute medicine, said:  ""I can't believe how quickly the second wave has happened and how unwell the patients are, they seem to be sicker this time round than they were last time."" Looking atmobile phone data can tell us how people's behaviouris changing due to various restrictions. When we use phones, go on to Facebook or Google, it is possible to see the sort of trips we make, or whether we spend more time at home. This can help scientists tell whether the measures are working. So if we look at what Google mobility data tells us, there has been a definite drop in those trips to the shops and for recreation. Similar dips can be seen in use of public transport and people not travelling to work. It might seem obvious - but if we did not see that, it would be a signal that the firebreak was failing in its purpose. What we cannot tell is how different things might have been without the firebreak. And although some restrictions will ease from Monday, council leaders and health officials are stressing that everyone still has a part to play to help control the virus's spread.

Suspended prison terms after dumper truck death,"A dumper truck driver lay dead on a building site for two days before his body was discovered by colleagues. David White, 38, was crushed when his vehicle overturned as he worked alone on a weekend shift on a renovation project at an isolated farm property. Mr White's death in October 2016 was outlined at Swansea Crown Court. Two men involved with the firm Mr White worked for - Pro'Conn - pleaded guilty to health and safety charges and were given suspended prison sentences. Project manager and principal designer Graham Kulhamann, 48, of Parcau Road, Bridgend, was sentenced to 21 weeks in prison suspended for 12 months and ordered to pay Â£5,000 towards prosecution costs. Director Kevin March, 59, of Fields Park Road, Cardiff, received 32 weeks in prison suspended for 12 months and has to pay Â£46,270 in costs. Pro'Conn was responsible for the redevelopment at West Aberthaw Farm in the Vale of Glamorgan, but went into liquidation following the incident on 1 October. The court heard the project was behind schedule and people were working weekend shifts to catch up. Simon Morgan, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said grass was found gripped in Mr White's fingers which suggested he had not been killed instantly. Mr Morgan said Mr White had not been wearing a seatbelt - an essential element of the safety of dumper trucks. Following the death the HSE issued a closure notice for the site and launched an investigation. The court heard a catalogue of safety failings and lack of proper plans were found at the site, and that when safety concerns had been raised in the past they had not been acted upon. There had also been a number of ""near misses"" involving vehicles which had not led to action. Mr Morgan said there had been ""insufficient monitoring and supervision"" on the site, which was a failing both defendants shared. Judge Paul Thomas QC told the defendants: ""In law the buck stops with each of you."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

LiveLiveCovid-19: Welsh Government update1 minute ago1 minute ago GoodbyeGoodbye3 minutes ago Where are the deaths in Wales?Where are the deaths in Wales?16 minutes ago 'We're keen to have Christmas as close to normal as possible''We're keen to have Christmas as close to normal as possible',"NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Mass testing of people for Covid-19 will begin in Merthyr Tydfil this Saturday, the Welsh Government confirms A UK minister plays down press reports that families will be allowed to mix for five days over Christmas, saying it is too early to set out the rules The trauma of not being able to visit relatives in care homes will stay with people for years, the older people's commissioner for Wales says Plaid Cymru calls for people self-isolating in Covid hotspots to be given a 'topped-up' grant of Â£800 Another 41 people have died with Covid in Wales, with 640 new cases, Public Health Wales said on Wednesday Natalie Grice, Lola Mayor and Andy Roberts That brings our live coverage of the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales coronavirus updates to a close for today. Here's a reminder of the main points:  Thank you for joining us - until our next live blog you can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good afternoon. Wednesday's report of 41 more deaths related to coronavirus has taken the total to 2,284. Cmw Taf Health Board in south Wales has recorded the highest number overall, at 625. This video can not be played Scientific advisers to the UK government say they hope it will be possible for coronavirus restrictions in England to be relaxed over the Christmas period. The BBC's Hugh Pym asked whether household mixing would be possible and Dr Susan Hopkins said it would require work from everyone in the next few weeks to bring the R number down as low as possible. Both Dr Hopkins and Angela McClean insisted it's a decision only the government can make. The four UK governments have been holding talks with the aim of agreeing a common set of rules on travel and gatherings over the Christmas period. There have been 41 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total number to 2,284, Public Health Wales has reported. There were also a further 640 cases reported, meaning there have now been 68,449 confirmed cases in Wales. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked at Prime Minister's Questions about the spread of disinformation by anti-vaccination activists and whether social media companies should be doing more to remove them. He said the UK government would be responding to the consultation on the ""online harms"" White Paper shortly and will be setting out plans for legislation. News of breakthroughs in coronavirus vaccine development in recent days has prompted a resurgence in false claims about Covid-19 vaccines. These include the baseless conspiracy theory that theyâre part of a secret plan (involving the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates) to implant microchips into humans so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has beeninvestigating this and other vaccine claims here. Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd (MS) Delyth Jewell saidmass testingwould be an ""important first step"" in tackling the spread of Covid-19 but as more cases are identified ""there needs to be additional support to enable people to stay at home safely"". ""Areas such as Merthyr Tydfil, which have had persistently high infection rates for two months, have long been in need of additional support,"" she said. âThis is why Plaid Cymru is calling for such areas to be designated Covid Special Support Areas, for self-isolation payments in these areas to be topped up to Â£800 and for local authorities to receive the extra support they need to help keep people safe. ""With lateral flow tests providing results in 20-30 minutes, this extra support needs to be in place the minute testing begins on Saturday. ""People living in our communities need to receive care, not just a diagnosis.â Dr Giri Shankar, coronavirus incident director for Public Health Wales, has told BBC Wales he is not aware of any definite plan for a post-Christmas lockdown. He said: ""Iâm not aware of any such plan for the firebreaks. ""What we
can say is that if there is an uncontrolled spread of the virus and if there is
a further increase in cases and that leads to inevitably higher
hospitalisations and a proportion of those translate to deaths, then it is
inevitable at some point that we will have to consider further additional restrictions
if the current ones are not enough to keep the virus in check."" The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTechappears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old. More data released from their ongoing phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages, races and ethnicities. The companies say they will now apply for authorisation for emergency use of the jab in the US. The findings are based on two doses given to more than 41,000 people around the world. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech published preliminary data showingthe vaccine offered 90% protection against Covid-19and there were no safety concerns. This was followed by impressive data on another vaccine, made byUS company Moderna, suggesting nearly 95% protection. Mass community testing for coronavirus in Merthyr Tydfil
could be a model expanded to other areas and to specific healthcare settings. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said the trial would mean health officials would be able to get a much quicker picture of where the virus was spreading. He said: âIf we are able to start deploying this kind of
approach and technology, this really starts to change the nature of system, to
be able to rely on a more routine cycle of testing within our communities. âSome of these devices will actually be able to
be rolled out within other settings as well, possibly into other healthcare
settings for example, again to allow for rapid turnaround of testing as well.â People self-isolating in Covid hotspots should be given a ""topped-up"" grant of Â£800,Plaid Cymru has said. It wants a package of extra support for ex-industrial areas with high infection rates, such as Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent and Rhondda Cynon Taf. These areas, the party said, should be prioritised for mass testing, with more resources for test and trace teams. Ministers said they had put national support measures in place and provided an extra Â£15.7m for contact tracing. Anyone in Wales isable to claim Â£500if they have to stay off work due to coronavirus. Plaid Cymru will raise the need for ""Covid Special Support Areas"" in a Senedd debate on Wednesday, saying research from the north of England suggests post-industrial communities may be disproportionately affected by the virus. Rhondda Cynon Taf has one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in Wales The leader of Merthyr Tydfil council, Kevin O'Neill, said confirmation of mass testing of people for Covid-19 was a ""real opportunity to lead the way"". The Welsh Government has confirmed the county as the first in Wales to undergo such a measure, with testing to begin on Saturday. ""We want those people [who are] asymptomatic - those who don't know they have the disease - to come and get tested,"" Mr O'Neill told BBC Wales. He added that people seeing someone they know die is ""hitting home"" and had led to a ""huge improvement"" in people following the rules. ""You can see that in the hard work people have put in for the firebreak and the numbers have come down significantly,"" Mr O'Neill said. ""We are encouraging everyone to come and get tested, allow us to find where this disease is hiding so we can break it down but also so we can get a model that other places can work from. ""We need to be successful so the whole country can be successful."" Kevin O'Neill said the firebreak lockdown had resulted in the rate of infections falling NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall would not be drawn on whether there should be a further Covid firebreak after Christmas. However he has urged people over the festive period to âlimit their social interactionsâ and âmeet other people on a limited basisâ. Dr Goodall said earlier that any further lockdowns would be a matter for the first minister and cabinet to decide. The roll out of a Covid-19 vaccine will be âthe most significant logistic exercise that we will have undertaken under any vaccination programmeâ, according to the boss of the Welsh NHS. Dr Andrew Goodall said any vaccination programme was likely to continue âwell into the spring, and therefore it's really important that we do start with those who are most vulnerable in our societyâ. Speaking to reporters, Dr Goodall explained every health board in Wales was âworking on proposals that will support whatever version of vaccines come through the regulatory processâ. He said the Welsh Blood Service may be asked to provide âspecialist supportâ with storing any vaccine that may need to be kept in certain conditions. âThe opportunity to protect our population, particularly the most vulnerable, allows us to feel that this would really change the nature of our response in Wales, but it will also take us perhaps longer than people want and expect,â Dr Goodall added. A decision on whether or not the Welsh Government will introduce a further ""firebreak"" lockdown shortly after Christmas will be âa matter for the first minister and the Cabinetâ, the head of NHS Wales has said. Dr Andrew Goodall said there had been âencouraging signs that the firebreak has had some influence on our systemâ, with regards to reducing the number of coronavirus cases in the community. He went on to say that early data appeared to show the reproduction rate of Covid-19 had decreased as a result of the 17-day lockdown. âThere are some emerging signs maybe of some stabilisation, in terms of some of the pressures in the hospital side of the system,â Dr Goodall said. âWe currently assess that the reproduction rate is between 0.9 and 1.2, but itâs quite possible that we may see that reduce further as a reflection of the firebreak.â Dr Goodall suggested that was an encouraging sign that similar measures would have an impact, but stopped short of saying that a single lockdown would be enough to keep transmission levels low across the winter. âThey will reinforce that we know that things can make a difference,â he said. âThere will be an evaluation of the data, we will see whether that will be sufficient to manage through, but ultimately that will revert to the ministerial reflections and considerations.â House of CommonsParliament PM Boris Johnson has defended the UK government against Labour accusations of a lack of transparency over the awarding of contracts, particularly for personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer quoteda report by the public spending watchdogwhich said suppliers with political connections were ten times more likely than others to get contracts. ""Can the PM give a cast-iron assurance that from now on all government contracts will be subject to proper process,"" Sir Keir asked. Mr Johnson said all government contracts would be published. However, he added: ""I think it is extraordinary he attacks the government for securing PPE in full quantities. ""At the time he bashed the government for not moving fast enough, now absolutely absurdly Captain Hindsight is trying to score political points by attacking the government for moving too fast. ""I am proud of securing PPE supplies and any government would have done the same."" Boris Johnson took Prime Minister's Questions via video conference as he is self-isolating Testing for Merthyr was announced on Wednesday morning Merthyr Tydfil was an ""obvious choice"" for mass testing, given the recent high level of coronavirus infections in the area, according to the boss of the NHS in Wales. Dr Andrew Goodall said the Welsh Government was ""appealing to the population"" in the county ""to support us in this initiative to undertake that more repeated testing, whether they have symptoms or not"". ""Hopefully that will allow us to make sure that we can demonstrate for this population that there is a way again of having some control and containment of the outbreak of the virus,"" he said. Dr Goodall added that the mass testing ""is also offering a template for how we may want to introduce other local support and interventions across Wales, whatever our national actions are"". This video can not be played When is the vaccine for Covid-19 going to be available? This is the question everyone wants the answer to. In November, both the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccine were found to be more than 90% effective. The latest results of the Oxford vaccine are expected later this month. Without a cure or definitive treatment, a vaccine is seen as a key way to get life back to normal. Scientists only started their research at the beginning of the year and have been working quickly to develop and test vaccines. So when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Who would get it first? BBC health correspondent Laura Foster looks at the situation. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says there has been a big drop in the number of people attending outpatient clinics. âOutpatient services, where we would normally see three million people â equivalent to the population of Wales â every year, have also been affected by the pandemic."" he said. Clinics were seeing around two-thirds fewer people to ensure they comply with social-distancing requirements, Dr Goodall added. âTo complete the cleaning regimes needed between each appointment, these are scheduled for 30 minutes, instead of 15 minutes, to manage infection risk. âBut there are some areas â like ENT [ear, nose and throat] and maxillofacial â where the risk is higher, and an extended wait between appointments is needed."" He said more âvirtualâ consultations were being done but waiting lists were increasing. âUnfortunately, we will see further increases to these waiting times as we continue to respond to coronavirus during this public health emergency."" The head of the NHS in Wales says nearly half of the people admitted to hospital with Covid-19 will be there for more than a week. Dr Andrew Goodall said a quarter would be in hospital for at least 21 days or more. ""Some will need even more time â and expert care â to recover properly,"" he told the press briefing. ""This has a knock-on effect on available bed capacityâ. Dr Goodall said he was concerned about the impact of the demands and pressures on the NHS. âThe NHS remains open for essential and emergency services and also for routine care. âBut with high levels of coronavirus infection in our communities and high levels of people with coronavirus in hospitals, services will find it increasingly difficult to operate normally."" There are 18 hospitals on the two highest levels of escalation in Wales, meaning they are under a lot of pressure from patient numbers and care demands. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said the health service was ""continuing
      to balance winter and emergency pressures with the demands of looking
      after people who are seriously ill with coronavirus"". He added: ""The number of people
admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms has continued to rise. ""There
     are some signs hospital admissions are stabilising but this is not
     sufficient to overcome current pressures."" There are 1,654 Covid-related patients in hospital, a rise of 8% on last week. Of those, 62 are in critical care, which is lower than a week ago. Normal critical care capacity of 152 beds has been exceeded, with 157 people needing care. Dr Goodall said there were plans to expand capacity if required. Â© 2025 BBC.

The man who talked to chairsThe man who talked to chairs," And how he found a new lease of life By Sean Coughlan By Sean Coughlan by Sean Coughlan “I was having discussions with chairs,” says Shane Cocker, itching with nervous energy. “I was thinking why don’t you answer me?” “You’re stuck in four walls and you see nobody. You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,” says the 56-year-old from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, describing the corrosive, creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane, an unemployed lorry driver, was isolated. Missing his mother who had died, but stoppered up by a lifetime of being told to “man up”. “You don’t want to admit there’s a problem, and then things just get worse and worse. You give up on everything,” he says, tightening his fists at the thought of it. “I was literally just sat there. I got scruffy, I got irritable, I was eating but not properly, I wasn’t able to sleep. I was in denial about everything.” It’s a problem shared by millions during the pandemic. The week when the clocks went back, with evenings getting darker earlier, saw the highest recorded levels of extreme loneliness, since the lockdown began in March. More than four million people were in the category of “always or often” lonely in the week up to 1 November, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures - more than 60% higher than typical pre-lockdown levels. Shane says he could go a fortnight without talking to anyone. “It was a vicious circle.” Social distancing has the best of intentions, but it’s also a slow starvation of the senses. And with winter approaching and the latest restrictions, more people than ever are struggling with this enforced separation. Love will tear us - two metres - apart again. For Shane, it got darker before it got better, much better. “I had nothing at all. I was just ready to jump off the bridge. That was close, very, very close. I’d even decided where I was going to go,” he says quietly. But he’s in a hurry this autumn Friday afternoon, because he’s got people who need his help, and he’s laughing. This isn’t a story about despair, it’s about getting things fixed. A bit of Huddersfield appears as he opens the front door to leave this unusual place. “It’s the Bee Gees story,” he shouts over his shoulder. “We’ve done the Tragedy. Now we’re Stayin’ Alive.” “I was having discussions with chairs,” says Shane Cocker, itching with nervous energy. “I was thinking why don’t you answer me?” “You’re stuck in four walls and you see nobody.

It’s a charity project so called, with Yorkshire literalness, because it’s right beside the town’s railway station. But any commuters looking inside, and seeing Shane and his mates bustling and joking around, are unlikely to see the deadly seriousness of what happens here - and why Friday night has such an uncomfortable significance. This tiny, gritty charity has had to respond to 15 suicide attempts during the pandemic - compared with one for all of last year. The project is on a sliver of ground, with ramshackle offices and a couple of repurposed 1950s railway carriages, that has become a haven for 500 lonely, socially-disconnected men in this part of Yorkshire. Even in the lockdown, there is still a constant flow of people coming in and out. There are work tools, bikes being repaired, a vegetable patch with cabbages, cups of tea being ferried. A big old clock face lies on the ground, maybe where time was literally hanging too heavily. People can turn up without any appointment and get help, advice and company. Shane, himself, fixes bikes for key workers, chats to his friends, and then delivers food to people who cannot get out of their own houses. “It gives us a purpose,” he says, re-energised by the idea of reaching people stuck at home the way he was before. He’s got back his self-esteem and wants to pass on the sense of hope to others still struggling to find theirs. Throughout the pandemic, between two and three million adults have not left their home for any reason during the previous seven days, for even shopping or walking, according to ONS figures.

They are the two grizzled godfathers of this rescue mission. “The need is so intense. You get people getting off the train saying, ‘Here I am, can you help?’,” says 71-year-old Bob. He’s furious that so many people are out there, lost in what he calls “the void”. If you need support for emotional distress, or you know someone else who does,these organisationsmay be able to help. “They are lonely, isolated, in danger of depression and anxiety; people who have been self-medicating; people who have lost loved ones and need some connection,” he says. The project is aimed at helping older men - who are among the most vulnerable to getting cut off and least likely to seek help. “There’s the stereotype of maleness, the stigma of weakness. They’ve been toughing it out. Get over it. Have another drink. Get another bottle,” says Bob. And he’s quick to admit that he has had problems with drink and mental health himself - and so speaks from a position of knowing what it’s like. Before the lockdown, the typical visitor would have been in their 40s, often out of work, without qualifications, living alone, with no spare cash and without access to the internet. They were people that the modern world had built a bypass around. The lockdown has radically changed who now needs help. “The people who are coming to us now are completely different. More professional people. It’s become massive,” says Jez, a feisty 61 year old running an accidental emergency service. “A lot of people who are now in crisis wouldn’t have been before,” says Bob. “They would have been in a work environment and that would have solved a lot of issues about loneliness and connection.” There are more younger people living alone, often dependent on work for their social connections - and whether they have lost their jobs, had their working hours reduced or are working from home, they risk becoming the “new lonely”. The current restrictions, when you can’t even go for a drink or a meal with friends, make it even harder. Jez talks about how workplaces are often no longer communities offering companionship and support. Mining in this area is now a day trip to a nearby mining museum. “People are distrustful of each other.” He taps a laptop and says people want contact and people to confide in, not social media. “You’ve got millions of strangers pretending to be friends.” Shane explains how loneliness can come down like a sudden nightfall. He’d looked after his grandmother until she’d died - and then his mother had been taken to hospital. He was worried about going to visit her, because he had to tell her their dog had died. Instead he was the one who got bad news. “Your mother’s got four days,” he said a doctor told him. “I said ‘No, you’re wrong. You are wrong, mate.’ So within a week I was there on my own. What was I going to do?” In the background there are phone conversations going on all the time. At their centre is the third part of this charity trinity, Bridget Fahy,  a 49 year old whose quiet voice has literally become a matter of life and death. “It’s Friday,” says Jez, who has been keeping an ear to the phone conversations. “The witching hour.” Almost all the attempted suicides here have been late on a Friday night - starting with Bridget getting a phone call. “It’s the fear of the weekend, that extra loneliness,” says Bridget. “You get a phone call where you pick up the phone and all you can hear is a man sobbing at the other end,” says Jez. “And you say, ‘Who is it?’ - and they say, ‘I just want to thank you for everything’.” While Bridget tries to talk to the callers - and it’s her they’ve usually chosen to contact - the police and ambulance services are alerted. Then Bridget and Jez scramble in their cars to reach the person who has rung. Their recent Friday night was talking down a man armed with a weapon and a fighting dog, while keeping the police at a distance. Neither of them expected to be doing this - but it’s been their experience of the lockdown. “There’s something wrong when a man I’ve only known a month puts me down as next of kin,” says Jez.

This is the only data that’s ever made me cry,” says Professor Sarah Garfinkel. And when a neuroscientist who “loves scanning brains” starts to cry over research data about loneliness you know it’s something serious. “I think it is devastating - we’re social beings, we should be together in groups,” says the professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. She has been researching what isolation does to people - and she is passionate that loneliness isn’t seen as something poignant but unimportant. Isolation, which might be interwoven with depression and anxiety, is extremely bad for your health, she says, increasing stress and raising the risk of strokes, heart attacks and ultimately premature death. “When you compare loneliness to other risk factors it’s actually one of the more dominant ones,” she says. Prof Garfinkel warns that loneliness can lead to other destructive “comfort” behaviour such as drinking too much alcohol or over eating. And loneliness goes hand-in-exhausted-hand with not being able to sleep. Prof Garfinkel is trying to look after her own young university students during the pandemic and is desperately worried about them suffering from loneliness and being “stuck on their own”. The pandemic and isolation on such a big scale runs against all our human needs, she says, and our instincts to “huddle together” when facing dangers. Much communication has been switched online, but she says Zoom meetings are a poor substitute for the social benefits of being in company. This might be in a way that we don’t even realise, says Prof Garfinkel. For instance, the size of someone’s pupils might subtly mirror those of another person speaking to them, sending out signals of empathy. With the postage stamp heads on a Zoom meeting that’s impossible and you’re left with a feeling of talking to someone who is not emotionally responding. If loneliness is a serious health problem - then there is an awful lot of it about. It’s like a cobweb getting strung wider and wider. The elderly. Carers. Those shielding. Students. Mothers with young babies. The bereaved. Single people cut off from social lives. Young adults working from home. People with mental health problems. Those cut off in care homes. People with disabilities. Mourners having to sit physically apart at a funeral. Families waving at relatives through glass. It’s not even just about being alone. The pandemic tracking figures show that while some people are suffering from spending too much time on their own, others are miserable from never getting any time to themselves. Loneliness, as well as hell, can be other people. Study after study shows young people feel loneliness more acutely than any other group - they’re aching to get out and connect with friends and have missed so many big bonding events this year, whether it was a school prom, graduation, birthday parties or post-exam festivals. Covid is also the great divider, magnifying differences - and loneliness is not shared evenly. A study from YouGov shows a clear social gap, with poorer people much more likely to be lonely. Renters have higher levels of loneliness than homeowners. Whatever the combination of factors, the start of November saw the highest peak so far in levels of adults who are “always or often” lonely - coinciding with the arrival of longer winter evenings. According to the ONS, in the week up to 1 November there were 4.2 million adults across Britain in this category - compared with 2.6 million in parts of the summer and before the pandemic. These numbers fluctuate and are nudging down from that peak - but the overall trend has shown loneliness at high levels as the seasons change. In August, the broader measure of loneliness, including those who are “sometimes” lonely stood at about 10 million adults - and that had risen to about 14 million in October and November, with the latest figure at about 12.5 million. If those who are “occasionally” lonely are included it’s about half the adult population. Dr Vivian Hill, who has researched isolation in the pandemic for the British Psychological Society, thinks the “descent into winter” is a “very significant factor”, with the weather making it difficult to get outside. But she says loneliness is something that we should be optimistic about tackling. “Many people have adapted, we’re very resilient - and we’ve found other ways to make those social connections,” says Dr Hill. But she says it’s vital to support those people for whom isolation in the pandemic has been a “catastrophe” - and these might be specific groups, such as people with autism whose usual social networks might be out of reach. There have been distinct waves of loneliness during the pandemic, says Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of psychobiology at University College London. And contrary to what might have been expected, the first lockdown in March did not trigger a great surge of loneliness. “Everyone was in the same boat,” says Dr Fancourt, with people feeling part of a great collective effort - clapping on doorsteps and Zoom quizzes. But she says the psychological toll is building up. People are fearful about jobs and money and collectively there are worries gathering below the surface. This sense of burn out is backed by another tracking survey of morale in the pandemic, with the ONS asking people how satisfied they feel with their lives - and the week to 1 November was the lowest it has ever been since it began in March. Baroness Barran, the Minister for Loneliness, puts it simply: “People are tired.” She says the collective mood towards the pandemic has been through its initial “heroic” phase and has the challenge of a phase of “disillusionment”, made more difficult with “shorter days and longer nights”. She says talking to people looking after relatives with dementia, isolated during the pandemic, had been one of the “most painful conversations I’ve had this year”. When Shane opens the front door from Platform 1, the square outside Huddersfield station is almost empty. It’s Covid quiet. The Head of Steam pub is silent and the bronze statue to local boy Harold Wilson is looking out on streets that look weary in the latest lockdown. The pawnbrokers round the corner has a “To Let” sign up. But people are still people and, given a chance, they’ll help others. “When I first went to Platform 1 I wouldn’t talk to anybody,” says Shane. “I just didn’t have the confidence. I’d be stood there stuttering and stammering.” It took him six weeks to come back to life, getting involved in some of the activities here, talking to people, making and repairing things, playing chess, going on trips, gardening. And he’s gone from getting help to being the helper, an ebullient voice for the possibility of change. Shane keeps making the point that there is an answer - there are positive ways of getting support - and there is no need to “totally lose the plot and refuse to come out of the house”. “Rather than talking to chairs and slowly going round the bend you can come in here and you’re not on your own,” he says. But men in particular have to admit to their problems - and need to let the tears start to flow, says Shane. “It’s meant to be unmanly. But it’s not. Now I say, ‘Come in and have a cry. And we turn it around and have a laugh.” Shane says he met Baroness Barran on a visit to Huddersfield  and bent her ear to say he thought there should be more practical approaches to tackle loneliness - such as subsidising bus passes so that people can get to places like Platform 1. She isn’t short of people offering suggestions. She says her ministerial email in-box is filled with a “mixture of lots of people talking about their own ideas of how to help - and others saying how desperately lonely and isolated they feel”. Her department is giving grants to “hyperlocal” community projects that help people to connect with each other. Services can be thinly stretched though. Another middle-aged visitor to Platform 1, a recovering addict trying to reconnect with his family, says he had a “breakdown” during the lockdown and was self-harming. He ended up being treated hundreds of miles away in Surrey. And as he says, that trip cost much more than a bus pass.

Often it’s the fact they have someone to talk to, somewhere to go. A smile and a cup of coffee are absolutely priceless,” says Bob. “It’s so rewarding when you hear someone say I wouldn’t do that if you hadn’t been there,” says Shane. Every one of those 15 people who had attempted suicide were reached in time. It’s getting darker in Huddersfield. The nights are coming in fast. The shops are missing their customers, the roads are missing traffic and people are desperately missing each other.

DHSC adviser's firm took work from Covid company,"Lord Feldman, whose PR firm went on to work with a company the government had struck a deal with A public relations firm whose managing partner previously advised ministers on Covid is providing consultancy for a testing company signed up by government. Lord Feldman's PR firm began advising Oxford Nanopore after it struck a Â£28m deal with the Department of Health. He insists he had no involvement in the award of the contract. The Department of Health said it drew on the expertise of private sector partners to help in its Covid response. On 29 October many Westminster journalists were preoccupied with the release of a significant report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Go-between paid Â£21m in taxpayer funds for NHS PPE Who can get a coronavirus test? Some would have missed the publication of dozens of documents on the Cabinet Office website, done under rules designed to make the government more transparent with the public about its spending and conduct. Among the documents was a list of meetings health ministers had held at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. These reveal that on 1 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock met with Oxford Nanopore, a company which makes Covid-19 tests, and Lord Feldman, the former Conservative party chairman. Health Secretary Matt Hancock shared a meeting with Lord Feldman and Oxford Nanopore At the time, Lord Feldman was acting for the government, which had employed him as an unpaid adviser on Covid. He was also a managing partner with the lobbying firm Tulchan Communications. By the date of his next meeting with Oxford Nanopore, six weeks later, the testing firm had agreed a Â£27.9m contract with Mr Hancock's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). This was to supply Covid testing kits, reagents (chemicals needed for testing), training material and support. The firm went on to win a further contract worth more than Â£100m with the department, to supply rapid Covid tests. It has now been confirmed to the BBC, by Tulchan, that it is employed by Oxford Nanopore to do ""PR and public affairs"" for the company. Lobbying rules require companies, such as Tulchan, to disclose publicly any communication they have with ministers or permanent secretaries on behalf of paying clients. BBC News asked the firm whether Lord Feldman had been advising the government when Tulchan was working with Oxford Nanopore, and whether that conflict of interest had been disclosed. Tulchan said that it began an ""advisory role"" with the biotech firm to provide ""communications advice"" on 25 June, a month after Lord Feldman had ceased working as a government adviser, on 15 May.

It added that Oxford Nanopore had already been discussing providing Covid testing solutions to the government before Lord Feldman's meeting with them in April. But the revelations have prompted questions from the opposition. ""This latest story follows a string of troubling incidents where a select group have been given privileged access to the government,"" said Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet office minister. ""The country deserves to have confidence their money is being spent effectively by the government - and to know without doubt that friends and donors to the Conservative Party aren't profiting from this pandemic."" Earlier this month theSunday Times alleged that one lobbyist,external, who had worked on NHS Test and Trace, went on to share information with clients. TheLabour Party has called for an inquiryinto whether lobbyists employed by the government during the Covid response benefited from privileged information. The DHSC said it had ""rightly... drawn on the expertise of a number of private sector partners who provided advice and expertise to assist in the Government's vital work"". ""As a result of the public and private sectors working together at pace, we were able to strengthen our response to the pandemic so we are better prepared for the challenges of the coming months.""

Police issue 210 tougher Covid fines in past week,"The PSNI has issued 210 of the new, tougher Covid penalties of Â£200 since they came into effect six days ago. On Thursday of last week, 'COV4' fines replaced the previous minimum penalty notice of Â£60 for breaches of Covid-19 regulations. Theexecutive agreed on 8 October to raise the minimum fine to Â£200and fines on conviction up to Â£10,000. However,their introduction was delayed until 12 November because of a problem with printing the notices. Since then, the majority of the new notices (77) were issued in Belfast, followed by 48 in the Derry City and Strabane council area and 41 in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon area. None were issued in the Causeway Coast and Glens area, while just one Â£200 notice was issued in Fermanagh and Omagh. Since March, the PSNI has issued a total of 2,101 penalty notices and 48 Â£1,000 fines for failure to isolate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There have been 1,184 Community Resolution Notices (CRN) issued since March. CRNs are not Covid-specific notices but can be issued to anyone over the age of 10. They are designed to act as warnings and do not incur any fines. The latest figures also show that 93 commercial premises and 487 private dwellings were issued prohibition notices by police (580 have been handed out in total). The PSNI has also said that there are currently 509 officers or members of staff absent due to Covid-19, 429 of whom are self-isolating.

Foster calls for collaboration over Covid-19 rules,"This video can not be played Robin Swann hopes for 'better Christmas season' Health Minister Robin Swann says he will bring proposals to Thursday's executive meeting setting out options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in NI. Ministers are due to meet for the first time sincelast week's row over extending some restrictions. Mr Swann said his paper would set out measures to ""get us through the difficult weeks ahead"". He will suggest further restrictions and initiatives, in the hopes of reaching consensus, he added. Earlier, First Minister Arlene Foster said it was ""time for the executive to step back"" and collaborate together. Her party, the DUP, faced criticism for using a cross-community mechanism to block two proposals last week from Mr Swann to extend the restrictions - and the party has not ruled out deploying it again. Speaking at a press conference at Stormont on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the ""single biggest priority"" had to be forcing down rates of infection in Northern Ireland. ""Those of us in political leadership have a critical responsibility to take the right decisions - it's tough because all of us around the executive table are taking the decisions,"" he said. ""I will be bringing a paper to tomorrow's executive...detailing a range of options and initiatives to get us through the difficult weeks ahead. ""It can help us achieve a better Christmas season as we look forward to a much better new year."" He said he would not hesitate to recommend more restrictions if required and said there were ""no quick fixes"". NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said NI's R number - or reproduction value of the virus - was sitting ""around one"" - a rise from two weeks ago when it was sitting at about 0.7 for new case numbers. ""There are no new solutions - we all need to limit our mobility and the number of contacts we have with other people and to adhere to other mitigations we've been talking about for so long,"" said Prof Young. Their comments came as another 11 people died in Northern Ireland after contracting Covid-19. In the past day, 518 more people tested positive for the virus. In the Republic of Ireland, a further 12 people died after contracting Covid-19, and 379 new cases were also confirmed. On Wednesday, the health minister visited Whiteabbey Hospital's Nightingale facility, which he said would open on Friday. Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter This was the minister and his advisers setting out their stall ahead of tomorrow's Executive meeting. The words of the Chief Scientific Adviser - ""we have not yet seen the fall we had hoped for"" - were telling. Hospital inpatients are still at a high level, and the rate of transmission, the R number, didn't drop as much as expected while schools were closed.  It's risen since they returned. The trio were asked about mass testing and rapid testing. But that's the tip of a very large iceberg of logistics, reliability and availability. At least 90% of the population would need to be repeatedly tested to allow mass rapid testing to be effective, and the rapid test currently has a 30% failure rate. Dr. Michael McBride spoke of hope being tempered with realism - while spring and summer may present a brighter picture, thanks to developments in testing, vaccination and treatments for the virus, the realistic picture now for the health minister is that more restrictions will be needed before Christmas. The department of health said it will provide enhanced rehabilitation ""step down"" care for Covid patients who are well enough to leave an acute hospital but who would benefit from a period of rehabilitation before discharge. The nightingale will be run by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and will provide an additional 23 beds with further expansion expected. Hairdressing salons are among the businesses that can reopen from Friday Earlier, Mrs Foster said initial discussions had taken place on Tuesday with other executive ministers about trying to reach an earlier decision around current Covid-19 restrictions. Close-contact services, cafes and coffee shops can reopen this Friday but restrictions on pubs, restaurants and hotels are due to expire at midnight next Thursday. ""We're all adults - we recognise last week was not good for the executive,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I hope we will have a press conference tomorrowâ¦ it is our desire to communicate with the public as much as we can. What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate ""It's about preparing the ground this week - we cannot leave it to the way it happened last week, we have to step forward this week."" She repeated her assertion that she wants to find a ""balanced and proportionate approach"" to the restrictions. Mrs Foster added she would need to see the detail from the health minister and assess it with other data before making a decision. Arlene Foster says she wants the executive to step back and try to avoid a repeat of last week's row ""I would love to give certainty to everybody in Northern Ireland but I have to hear what the health minister has to say in relation to all of that,"" said the first minister. ""People need to know what is happening and whatever the decision is I think it is incumbent upon us to communicate that as quickly as we can."" NI's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride told the press conference that officials were looking at the possibility of mass testing for university students, to allow them to come home for Christmas. However, he warned it was not a ""panacea"" for people to ignore other public health guidelines. Mr Swann added that he had written to the British Health Secretary Matt Hancock about rolling out a mass testing programme in Northern Ireland, but he cautioned that discussions were ongoing, would prove resource-intensive and would not be a full solution. Prof Young said the prospect of wider testing was ""exciting"", but that it had limitations. He said where it had been successful, a high number of the population - about 90% or more - needed to be tested, which would present ""enormous logistical challenges"" in Northern Ireland. He added that it would also require repeated testing due to the infectious cycle of the virus, meaning developing the programme itself would be challenging. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Downing Street would talk to the Stormont Executive about the government's plans to roll out more mass testing programmes across the UK. He made the remark in response to DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson during prime minister's questions. Sir Jeffrey said Northern Ireland should be considered for the scheme, which is already operating in Liverpool, due to its population size. The prime minister said he recognised mass testing was a ""powerful weapon"" in the fight against Covid-19 and that talks with the executive would take place. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had spoken to the Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson about thebenefits of mass testing. Allow Twitter content?

Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority,"80% of the contracts were for personal protective equipment Companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority as the government raced to obtain Personal Protective Equipment, the National Audit Office found. Over half of the Â£18bn spent on pandemic-related contracts was awarded without competitive tender, it said. The spending watchdog said the government was not transparent about suppliers and services. It also found there was inadequate explanation of key spending decisions. The findings are part of an NAO investigation into government procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks The watchdog found not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. It found more than 8,600 coronavirus contracts had been awarded by 31 July, ranging in value from less than Â£100 to Â£410m. Of these, Â£10.5bn-worth (58%) were awarded directly without a competitive tender process. Personal protective equipment (PPE) accounted for 80% of the number of contracts awarded. The report comes after the BBC revealed on Tuesday that a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the pandemicwas paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson had been in line for a further $20m of UK public funds, documents filed in a US court reveal. He worked with Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger who set up a business at the start of the pandemic to supply PPE to governments. Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger set up a business to supply PPE to governments Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called for ministers to ""come clean"" and publish all information about the contracts awarded. The government acknowledged it had procured services with ""extreme urgency"" during the crisis but it said it had ""robust processes in place"". When asked about the $28m paid to the Spanish businessman, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Department of Health did look at that contract at the time."" ""At the time there was huge pressure to get PPE into the system and that's what we did,"" he added. The government is keen to note that the National Audit Office found ""no evidence that ministers had been involved in either the award or management of the contracts"" for Â£18bn of pandemic-related contracts. It was under huge pressure to get more PPE immediately and was bidding against governments all over the world. It's even understandable that most of the contracts were awarded without the normal (and time-consuming) competitive tendering process that is there to ensure value for money for taxpayers - and to eliminate the risk that someone gets a lucrative public sector contract not because of what they offer but because of who they know. But as the NAO points out, if you ditch that competitive process, the remaining safeguards - such as properly documenting what you've done to avoid conflicts of interest  - become all the more important. And if you have a process where companies referred by ministers' offices, MPs, peers and health chiefs get 'fast-tracked' - and are therefore ten times as likely to win a contract - there's an even stronger risk that contracts are seen to be awarded not on merit or value for money but because of personal connections. To eliminate that risk, the public accounts committee chair Meg Hillier is calling for all contracts awarded so far to be published. NAO head Gareth Davies said it remained ""essential that decisions are properly documented and made transparent if government is to maintain public trust"". Ms Hillier, a Labour MP, said the failings uncovered may be the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The government overlooked a serious conflict of interest, paid consultants for months before giving them contracts and purchased masks it knew weren't up to scratch. ""It's bad enough that it set up a 'high-priority lane' to fast-track companies with the right connections. ""But the failure to track how half the companies had ended up on it made it impossible to ensure proper safeguards were in place."" The NAO looked in detail at 20 contracts including: A deal with research firm Public First, whose owners had ""previously advised or worked with"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove. Artificial intelligence company Faculty, which was awarded contracts worth almost Â£3m. Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew owned a Â£90,000 stake in the firm but has since relinquished it. Ayanda Capital supplied 50 million masks that could not be used for their original purpose at a cost of Â£155m. The deal was brokered by a businessman who was an adviser to the government's Board of Trade at the time. PestFix, a pest control company, was given contracts worth Â£350m, which included delivery of 600,000 masks which cannot be used for their original purpose. The NAO concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". The spending watchdog acknowledged the pandemic required acting with ""extreme urgency"" and the Public Contracts Regulations allowed an emergency response, including awarding deals directly without a formal competition. Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez said: ""We have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic that has posed the biggest challenge to the UK in a generation. ""As this report rightly recognises, we needed to procure contracts with extreme urgency to secure the vital supplies required to protect frontline NHS workers and the public and we make no apology for that. ""We have robust processes in place for spending public money to ensure we get critical equipment to where it needs to go as quickly as possible, whilst also ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. ""It is important to maintain the public's confidence in how we manage their money, and we welcome the NAO's scrutiny of our processes and recommendations on how they can be improved."" Tom Sasse from the think tank the Institute for Government, told Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money that procurement processes exist to make sure taxpayers get the best value for money. ""The NAO point to some pretty serious problems with how public procurement has happened during the pandemic,"" he said. ""We've also seen a big story in August around Â£150m that went on PPE that couldn't be used. So there are questions about how this process is working.""

Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel and Richard Morris As we step away from our live coverage today, we leave you with our favourite story today... This week's Beano comic includes a pull-out section called Bean-OLD, designed to cheer up adults in the midst of the pandemic - with a comic strip featuring Boris Johnson, his outgoing aide Dominic Cummings and some other famous faces from 2020. Our colleague Justin Parkinson was given a sneak preview here.  Our reporters on the live page today were Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel, and Richard Morris, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Hope you will join us again next week. That's where we'll pause today's coverage of this weeks virtual sitting of PMQs.  But before we go here's a quick recap of the main points: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent There was some scepticism â and curiosity â about how a virtual PMQs would work. Remember this is the first time ever that a prime minister has dialled in remotely to the Commons chamber. The Downing Street wifi did at least hold up but it was certainly not the liveliest of exchanges. However the traditional âbear pitâ atmosphere (than some like and others loathe) has been lacking for a while since they put limits on the number of MPs allowed in the chamber.  Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about the spread of disinformation by anti-vaccination activists and whether social media companies should be doing more to remove them. The prime minister said the government would be responding to the consultation on the âonline harmsâ white paper shortly and will be setting out plans for legislation. News of breakthroughs in coronavirus vaccine development â in recent days â has seen a resurgence in false claims about Covid-19 vaccines â including the baseless conspiracy theory that theyâre part of a secret plan (involving the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates) to implant microchips into humans - so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has beeninvestigating this and other vaccine claims here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about theNational Audit Office investigationinto the Covid-related contracts the government has been awarding since the start of the pandemic. A lot of them are for PPE â which covers things like masks, goggles and gowns. He said: â70% of PPE is now made in this country or capable of being made in this countryâ This figure is the governmentâs target for December rather than the proportion of PPE manufactured in the UK at the moment. In September, a policy paper published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that UK-based manufacturers are âanticipated to meet 70% of forecasted demand in December for all categories of PPE, excluding glovesâ. (Gloves are excluded as raw materials are not available in the UK.) The target is ambitious, especially because in June,the DHSC said that it was expecting,externalthat only 20% of all PPE will be manufactured in the UK by the end of the year. The figure for the proportion of PPE currently made in the UK is not publicly available at the moment.   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As PMQs ends Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle says he wants to put a ""big thank you"" on record to the staff in parliament's broadcasting unit for ""making today happen"". On his Downing Street video link, the PM calls ""hear hear"". And with that it's over. House of CommonsParliament Asking the final question for this week's session of PMQs, Labour's Bambos Charalambous says black, Asian and minority ethnic people are twice as likely as white people to catch coronavirus. How will the prime minister address ""structural inequalities"" when the vaccine is rolled out, he asks. Boris Johnson replies that the government is ""thinking about this issue right now."" He adds that it has brought forward ""enhanced testing procedures for vulnerable groups"". House of CommonsParliament Scottish Conservatives are out in force today following the row earlier this week over the PM's views on devolution. Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, presses the PM to throw his weight behind growth deals in Scotland. And John Lamont urges the PM to do all he can to resolve a trade dispute between the US and EU which he says is doing serious harm to exports such as such as whisky and cashmere which are being ""hammered"" by tariffs. The PM says the issue continues to be of grave concern and he is raising it with the US on a regular basis to try and get a settlement as soon as possible.  House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Christopher Chope calls for all people who have tested positive for Covid in the past six months and recovered to be exempt from current restrictions, citing research suggesting they have high levels of T-Cell immunity. He says this would show the PM was ""following the science as well as common sense"". The PM thanks the MP for the suggestion but says the evidence points both ways and everyone should continue to self-isolate whatever their historical position. Labour's Chi Onwurah asked the PM about child poverty and calls on the PM to reverse planned cuts to Universal Credit. Mr Johnson says the government wants to tackle child poverty and support people into work. He says 400,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. House of CommonsParliament ""It is extremely concerning that one in five people say they won't take the new vaccine,"" says Conservative Damian Collins. He asks if social media companies should do more to tackle anti-vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories. Boris Johnson says he welcomes Facebook and Google's decision that no company should profit from vaccine disinformation. The government will be setting out plans for legislation on disinformation shortly, he adds. House of CommonsParliament We now have an audio only question from the Independent MP Margaret Ferrier. She was kicked out of the SNP, after travelling to Westminster despite experiencing Covid symptoms. She uses her question to ask about a constituent who applied to the EU resettlement scheme for her and her son in September 2019, but is still waiting for a decision The EU Settlement Scheme allows EU citizens to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021. Boris Johnson says the case is under urgent review and that a decision will be made shortly. Tory Mark Pawsey suggests it is unfair for big supermarkets to be able to continue to sell items like clothing and homeware while specialist retailers are shut during the lockdown. He suggests it would be a good idea for big retailers to help smaller retailers with their tax bills. The PM agrees that there should be a fair playing field. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Graham Brady says ""tens of thousands of jobs have already been lost in aviation and hundreds of thousands hang in the balance"". He ask the prime minister to ensure a testing regime can be implemented to replace the current quarantine arrangements when England comes out of current lockdown restrictions. Boris Johnson said his government is ""working hard to ensure we can replace the quarantine regulations for every category of self isolation"". ""I certainly want to help the airlines,"" he adds. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The SNPâs Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked the PM about devolution. The party has â and will continue â to say that Boris Johnsonâs devolution âdisasterâ remarks reveal what the Prime Minister really thinks. In response, the PM talks about the âbillions and billionsâ of pounds used to help support the economy, across the UK, during the pandemic. And a central part of the case the government makes about the union is what they say is the unmatched âmightâ of the Treasury. That may be an argument of the head, but unionists are also under pressure to come up with an argument that appeals to the heart as well. House of CommonsParliament Ian Blackford hits back, saying the PM's comments earlier this week - when he described Scottish devolution as a disaster, were not a ""slip of the tongue but a slip of the Tory mask"". He says the only way the Scottish people can truly prosper is through taking destiny into their own hands through independence. The PM points out that Scotland voted no to independence in 2014 and ""will almost certainly"" do so again if there is another vote. He goes on to praise the role of the union during the pandemic, including the role of the armed forces and furlough. ""The union has shown its value and will continue to do so."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Kenya arrests after BBC exposÃ© of baby stealersThree medical officers were detained for allegedly running a child-trafficking syndicate, police say.Africa","This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings Police in Kenya have arrested four more people for allegedly running a child-trafficking syndicate following a BBC investigation into the theft and sale of babies. BBC Africa Eye revealed children were stolen to order from illegal clinics and at a Nairobi public hospital. Seven people are now in custody in connection with the case including medics and a hospital administrator. The babies were sold for as little as $400 (Â£300). In the wake of the BBC Africa Eye story, police chief Hillary Mutyambai ordered an investigation into hospitals, as well as children's homes in the Kenyan capital. Buying a baby on Nairobi's black market The baby stealers,external Africa Live: More on this and other stories Two hospital administrators, a nurse and a social worker appeared in court on Thursday, adding to the three senior medical officials who were in court on Wednesday. They have not been formally charged and did not enter pleas. BBC Africa Eye uncovered a trade in children stolen from vulnerable mothers living on the streets, as well as the existence of illegal clinics dotted around Nairobi, where babies were being sold. The investigation also revealed alleged corruption at Mama Lucy Kibaki, a public hospital in Nairobi. Three senior medical officers were in court on Wednesday Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at the hospital, is alleged to have facilitated the sale of an abandoned two-week-old baby boy to undercover reporters, later accepting 300,000 shillings ($2,700; Â£2,000) in cash. Both Mr Leparan and Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital declined requests to comment on the investigation's findings. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Kenya's Labour and Social Protection Minister Simon Chelugui said the culprits would face the ""full force of the law"". The suspects have not commented on the allegations against them Mr Chelugui also acknowledged that improvements to some of Kenya's child protection services were needed. His colleague in the Interior Ministry Fred Matiang'i thanked the BBC for exposing the ""rot"" at Mama Lucy hospital. He added that human and drug trafficking were the biggest challenges Kenyan security was dealing with. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in the East African state, but a non-governmental organisation, Missing Child Kenya, said it had been involved in nearly 600 cases in the past three years. Ferdinand Omondi, BBC News, Kenya It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say the BBC exposÃ© caught the government unawares. On the day it was published, state officials including the inspector general of police, the labour and social protection minister and the government spokesman held an emergency meeting. The next day, three arrests were made and police acknowledged there was a crime ring involving medical officers and child traffickers. Three suspects were immediately hauled to court - all medical officers. The interior minister was impressed by this efficiency and praised the decisive action. But Kenyans were livid. Did the police have to wait for the BBC investigate for them? How high does the syndicate go? Will they get convictions?

LiveLiveVirtual Prime Minister's Questions1 minute ago,"Boris Johnson took this week's PMQs by video link The prime minister is self-isolating in Downing Street having come in to contact with a colleague who later tested positive for coronavirus The PM was tested for coronavirus on Monday which came back negative Both the Labour and SNP party leaders challenged the PM on his comments that devolution in Scotland had been a 'disaster' Boris Johnson defended himself saying the SNP's ""campaign for the break up of our country"" had been the disaster Sir Keir Starmer also questioned the PM on government contracts for PPE supplies Mr Johnson said he is ""proud"" of the way the government got PPE supplies at the start of the coronavirus pandemic Earlier, the Labour party leader rejected allowing Jeremy Corbyn to return to the parliamentary Labour party. Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel and Richard Morris As we step away from our live coverage today, we leave you with our favourite story today... This week's Beano comic includes a pull-out section called Bean-OLD, designed to cheer up adults in the midst of the pandemic - with a comic strip featuring Boris Johnson, his outgoing aide Dominic Cummings and some other famous faces from 2020. Our colleague Justin Parkinson was given a sneak preview here.  Our reporters on the live page today were Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel, and Richard Morris, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Hope you will join us again next week. That's where we'll pause today's coverage of this weeks virtual sitting of PMQs.  But before we go here's a quick recap of the main points: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent There was some scepticism â and curiosity â about how a virtual PMQs would work. Remember this is the first time ever that a prime minister has dialled in remotely to the Commons chamber. The Downing Street wifi did at least hold up but it was certainly not the liveliest of exchanges. However the traditional âbear pitâ atmosphere (than some like and others loathe) has been lacking for a while since they put limits on the number of MPs allowed in the chamber.  Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about the spread of disinformation by anti-vaccination activists and whether social media companies should be doing more to remove them. The prime minister said the government would be responding to the consultation on the âonline harmsâ white paper shortly and will be setting out plans for legislation. News of breakthroughs in coronavirus vaccine development â in recent days â has seen a resurgence in false claims about Covid-19 vaccines â including the baseless conspiracy theory that theyâre part of a secret plan (involving the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates) to implant microchips into humans - so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has beeninvestigating this and other vaccine claims here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about theNational Audit Office investigationinto the Covid-related contracts the government has been awarding since the start of the pandemic. A lot of them are for PPE â which covers things like masks, goggles and gowns. He said: â70% of PPE is now made in this country or capable of being made in this countryâ This figure is the governmentâs target for December rather than the proportion of PPE manufactured in the UK at the moment. In September, a policy paper published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that UK-based manufacturers are âanticipated to meet 70% of forecasted demand in December for all categories of PPE, excluding glovesâ. (Gloves are excluded as raw materials are not available in the UK.) The target is ambitious, especially because in June,the DHSC said that it was expecting,externalthat only 20% of all PPE will be manufactured in the UK by the end of the year. The figure for the proportion of PPE currently made in the UK is not publicly available at the moment.   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As PMQs ends Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle says he wants to put a ""big thank you"" on record to the staff in parliament's broadcasting unit for ""making today happen"". On his Downing Street video link, the PM calls ""hear hear"". And with that it's over. House of CommonsParliament Asking the final question for this week's session of PMQs, Labour's Bambos Charalambous says black, Asian and minority ethnic people are twice as likely as white people to catch coronavirus. How will the prime minister address ""structural inequalities"" when the vaccine is rolled out, he asks. Boris Johnson replies that the government is ""thinking about this issue right now."" He adds that it has brought forward ""enhanced testing procedures for vulnerable groups"". House of CommonsParliament Scottish Conservatives are out in force today following the row earlier this week over the PM's views on devolution. Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, presses the PM to throw his weight behind growth deals in Scotland. And John Lamont urges the PM to do all he can to resolve a trade dispute between the US and EU which he says is doing serious harm to exports such as such as whisky and cashmere which are being ""hammered"" by tariffs. The PM says the issue continues to be of grave concern and he is raising it with the US on a regular basis to try and get a settlement as soon as possible.  House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Christopher Chope calls for all people who have tested positive for Covid in the past six months and recovered to be exempt from current restrictions, citing research suggesting they have high levels of T-Cell immunity. He says this would show the PM was ""following the science as well as common sense"". The PM thanks the MP for the suggestion but says the evidence points both ways and everyone should continue to self-isolate whatever their historical position. Labour's Chi Onwurah asked the PM about child poverty and calls on the PM to reverse planned cuts to Universal Credit. Mr Johnson says the government wants to tackle child poverty and support people into work. He says 400,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. House of CommonsParliament ""It is extremely concerning that one in five people say they won't take the new vaccine,"" says Conservative Damian Collins. He asks if social media companies should do more to tackle anti-vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories. Boris Johnson says he welcomes Facebook and Google's decision that no company should profit from vaccine disinformation. The government will be setting out plans for legislation on disinformation shortly, he adds. House of CommonsParliament We now have an audio only question from the Independent MP Margaret Ferrier. She was kicked out of the SNP, after travelling to Westminster despite experiencing Covid symptoms. She uses her question to ask about a constituent who applied to the EU resettlement scheme for her and her son in September 2019, but is still waiting for a decision The EU Settlement Scheme allows EU citizens to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021. Boris Johnson says the case is under urgent review and that a decision will be made shortly. Tory Mark Pawsey suggests it is unfair for big supermarkets to be able to continue to sell items like clothing and homeware while specialist retailers are shut during the lockdown. He suggests it would be a good idea for big retailers to help smaller retailers with their tax bills. The PM agrees that there should be a fair playing field. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Graham Brady says ""tens of thousands of jobs have already been lost in aviation and hundreds of thousands hang in the balance"". He ask the prime minister to ensure a testing regime can be implemented to replace the current quarantine arrangements when England comes out of current lockdown restrictions. Boris Johnson said his government is ""working hard to ensure we can replace the quarantine regulations for every category of self isolation"". ""I certainly want to help the airlines,"" he adds. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The SNPâs Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked the PM about devolution. The party has â and will continue â to say that Boris Johnsonâs devolution âdisasterâ remarks reveal what the Prime Minister really thinks. In response, the PM talks about the âbillions and billionsâ of pounds used to help support the economy, across the UK, during the pandemic. And a central part of the case the government makes about the union is what they say is the unmatched âmightâ of the Treasury. That may be an argument of the head, but unionists are also under pressure to come up with an argument that appeals to the heart as well. House of CommonsParliament Ian Blackford hits back, saying the PM's comments earlier this week - when he described Scottish devolution as a disaster, were not a ""slip of the tongue but a slip of the Tory mask"". He says the only way the Scottish people can truly prosper is through taking destiny into their own hands through independence. The PM points out that Scotland voted no to independence in 2014 and ""will almost certainly"" do so again if there is another vote. He goes on to praise the role of the union during the pandemic, including the role of the armed forces and furlough. ""The union has shown its value and will continue to do so."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Man arrested over 1974 Birmingham pub bombingsThe 65-year-old was arrested at his home and will be interviewed under caution, police say.","Twenty-one people were killed in two blasts on 21 November 1974 A man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of 21 people in the 1974 pub bombings in Birmingham. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, arrested the 65-year-old at his home in Belfast. He was detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Police said the man's home was being searched and he will be interviewed under caution at a police station in Northern Ireland. Birmingham pub bombings: What we know Who were Birmingham pub bombings victims? Latest news from the West Midlands Saturday will mark the 46th anniversary of the bombings. Fresh inquestslast year ruled the victims were unlawfully killed, but did not establish who was responsible. Those hearings came after years of campaigning by families for a full account into what happened that night. Last month, Home Secretary Priti Patelannounced she would be considering the case for a public inquiry into the bombings. The blasts ripped apart the Mulberry Bush pub at the base of the Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street Six men - Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were wrongly jailed for life in 1975 for the bombings. The group, who became known as the Birmingham Six, had their convictions quashed in the appeal court and they were released in 1991. Inquests into the deaths of those killed in the bombings found they were unlawfully killed 21 November 1974: A man telephones the Birmingham Post and Mail to warn two bombs had been planted in the city centre. At 20:17 GMT a bomb exploded in a duffel bag in the Mulberry Bush pub in the Rotunda building, killing 10 people. Minutes later a second bomb went off in the Tavern in the Town leaving 11 more dead. 1975: Six men, Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker, are found guilty of carrying out the bombings. 1985: The World in Action programme names four suspects the production was ""100% sure"" were the true perpetrators, and said they knew the identity of a fifth. 14 March 1991: After 16 years behind bars, the Birmingham Sixhave their convictions quashedand, that year, West Midlands Police begins re-investigating the case. 1994: West Midlands Police says there is insufficient evidence for any prosecutions, butthe case remains open. June 2016: Louise Hunt, senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, saidinquests into the deaths would be reopened.Inquests were opened and adjourned days after the attack but, because the case was subject to a criminal investigation, they were never resumed. July 2017: Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QCdecides the names of the alleged bombers would not be part of the framework of the resumed inquests.. In January, theHigh Court quashed this ruling, but judges at the Court of Appeal ruled in his favour,meaning suspects would not be named. April 2019: The inquestsfind the 21 victims of the pub bombings were unlawfully killed. October 2020: Following calls by the families of those killed in the bombings, Home Secretary Priti Patelagrees to consider the case for a public inquiry. Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the bombings, called the arrest ""the most monumental event"" in the criminal investigation since the quashing of those convictions. She said she broke down in tears when she was told by a senior West Midlands Police officer of the arrest. Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the bombings, said news of the arrest was ""overwhelming"" ""I couldn't speak, I was just inconsolable and was just looking at the picture of Maxine,"" she said. ""It's welcome news. It's overwhelming news. It's tangible progress."" However, Ms Hambleton, who is part of campaign group Justice for the 21, said: ""Having this development - whatever happens - does not in any way lessen our desire for a full public inquiry. ""There are wider issues which need to be examined and so much that went wrong, like why six men were arrested for a crime they didn't commit."" Two bombs detonated within minutes of each other in Birmingham Paul Rowlands, whose father John Rowlands was killed in the Mulberry Bush, said: ""It's a positive step. ""It is, however, just a step and it does not detract from the fact that we need a public inquiry."" By Phil Mackie, BBC Midlands correspondent For a long time the victims' families have felt that not enough effort was being put into the criminal investigation. The most recent review of the evidence by West Midlands Police, which took place before the inquests, came up with nothing new. Campaigners have always believed that if the bombings had happened in London or Manchester the authorities would have made the case a bigger priority, and that's why they've given today's development such a positive reaction. They already believe momentum is with them after Home Secretary Priti Patel announced she was considering allowing a public inquiry into the bombings. It's the first arrest in the case in more than four decades. And 73-year-old Bill Craig, an ex-West Midlands Police officer whose brother James Craig was fatally injured in the bombing, said he welcomed the arrest, adding there were still ""more questions than answers"" surrounding the attacks. George Jones, 72, whose postman father John ""Cliff"" Jones died in the Mulberry Bush blast, said: ""Obviously it's something positive, and it's happened just with the anniversary (of the bombings) coming up.

"Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030The PM confirms he is bringing the ban forward as he sets out his ""green industrial revolution"".Science & EnvironmentComments","Â£1.3bn will be invested in electric vehicle charging points as part of the plan New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. But some hybrids would still be allowed, he confirmed. It is part of what Mr Johnson calls a ""green industrial revolution"" to tackle climate change and create jobs in industries such as nuclear energy. Critics say the Â£4bn allocated to implement the 10-point plan is far too small for the scale of the challenge. The total amount of new money announced in the package is a 25th of the projected Â£100bn cost of high-speed rail, HS2. UK climate plan: what do the terms mean? A really simple guide to climate change Electric vehicles: Your questions answered Shift to electric cars 'requires Herculean effort' This video can not be played Will the UK be ready for a 2030 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars? Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Breakfast the Â£4bn was part of a broader Â£12bn package of public investment, which ""will help to bring in three times as much in terms of private sector money"". Mr Sharma, who is president of the COP26 international climate summit that the UK will host next year, said the money would also support the creation of 250,000 jobs in parts of the UK ""where we want to see levelling up"". The government hopes that many of those jobs will be in northern England and in Wales, and that 60,000 will be in offshore wind. The government has also given funding to boost cycling and walking Offshore wind:Produce enough offshore wind to power every home in the UK, quadrupling how much it produces to 40 gigawatts by 2030, and supporting up to 60,000 jobs. Hydrogen:Have five gigawatts of ""low carbon"" hydrogen production capacity by 2030 - for industry, transport, power and homes - and develop the first town heated by the gas by the end of the decade. Nuclear:Pushing nuclear power as a clean energy source and including provision for a large nuclear plant, as well as for advanced small nuclear reactors, which could support 10,000 jobs. Electric vehicles:Phasing out sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and investing in grants to help buy cars and charge point infrastructure. Public transport, cycling and walking:Making cycling and walking more attractive ways to travel and investing in zero-emission public transport for the future. Jet zero and greener maritime:Supporting research projects for zero-emission planes and ships. Homes and public buildings:Making homes, schools and hospitals greener, warmer and more energy efficient, including a target to install 600,000 heat pumps every year by 2028. Carbon capture:Developing world-leading technology to capture and store harmful emissions away from the atmosphere, with a target to remove 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 - equivalent to all emissions of the industrial Humber. Nature:Protecting and restoring the natural environment, with plans to include planting 30,000 hectares of trees a year. Innovation and finance:Developing cutting-edge technologies and making the City of London the global centre of green finance. The plan includes provision for a large nuclear plant -likely to be at Sizewell in Suffolk- and for advanced small nuclear reactors, which it is hoped, will create an estimated 10,000 jobs at Rolls-Royce and other firms. The government is close to giving the green light to a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk The plans will also affect some people's homes. The government will bring forward, to 2023, the date by which new homes will need to be warmed without using gas heating. Free home insulation: Too good to be true? Sea's heat to warm historic house Extra Â£40m pledged for green spaces in England Why the UK's carbon-free future will need rules It will aim to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 - these are low-energy electrical devices for warming homes. And it hasextended the Green Homes Grant for home insulationfor a year after the first tranche was massively over-subscribed. Clean hydrogen will be blended into the natural gas supply to reduce overall emissions from gas, and the government wants a town to volunteer for a trial of 100% hydrogen for heat, industry and cooking. The hydrogen - attracting a subsidy of up to Â£500m - will be produced in places such as the North East of England, partly by energy from offshore wind. The prime minister wants his green plan to be powered by wind farms like this one in Redcar, Teesside The government wants to breathe new life into de-industrialised areas by teaming hydrogen production with the manufacture of wind turbines, and with four clusters of firms using carbon capture and storage. Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? UK carbon capture project begins This is when emissions from chimneys are captured and forced into rocks underground. The hope is to transform depressed areas into hi-tech hubs. This will get funding of an extra Â£200m. Another key point of the plan is a Â£1.3bn investment in electric vehicle (EV) charging points. Grants for EV buyers will stretch to Â£582m to help people make the transition. There is also nearly Â£500m for battery manufacture in the Midlands and the north-east of England. Many of the details of the plan will be written into an energy white paper proposing future legislation, which is expected by the end of the month. In the race to clean up motoring, the UK is now in second place after Norway, which has a fossil fuel vehicle abolition date of 2025. UK car makers have warned about the scale of the challenge, but the government believes that forcing technological change can give firms a competitive edge. But will the so-called ""green revolution"" achieve its aim of massive job creation? Experts said the Â£4bn would go a long way if it were spent on labour-intensive insulation, but not far if ploughed into expensive, mechanised carbon capture. The prime minister said: ""My 10-point plan will create, support and protect hundreds of thousands of green jobs, whilst making strides towards net zero by 2050. ""Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the North East, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales, so we can look ahead to a more prosperous, greener future."" Mr Johnson said his plans aimed to create jobs and address climate change at the same time. The UK will host the COP26 UN summit - seen as the most important round of talks to tackle climate change since the Paris Agreement in 2015 - in Glasgow this time next year.It had been due to take place in 2020 but was postponed by 12 months because of the pandemic. The plans are aimed to put the UK on track to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband criticised the plan, saying that the funding ""in this long-awaited"" announcement does not ""remotely meet the scale of what is needed"" to tackle unemployment and the climate emergency. ""Only a fraction of the funding announced today is new."" Mr Miliband, who served as energy and climate change secretary from 2008-10,  said Labour wanted the government to bring forward Â£30bn of capital investment over the next 18 months and invest it in low-carbon sectors to support 400,000 additional jobs. And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas welcomed some measures but said the plan ""completely fails to rise to the gravity of this moment"". ""When you put it in the context of the scale of the climate and nature emergencies that we face, and indeed the scale of the job emergencies that we face, then it's nowhere near ambitious enough, it's not urgent enough, it's not bold enough,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She criticised the Â£4bn allocation, saying ""the resources aren't there in order to make this a really strategic package"". Ms Lucas also said the government's message is ""inconsistent"" and it must make clear  which technologies it wants to invest in. She said nuclear power is ""massively costly"", will not be ""on stream"" until the middle of the 2030s, and risks undermining focus on offshore wind. The Green Party called for a transformation of the entire economy to reduce emissions, including scrapping the Â£27bn road-building programme, which will actually increase emissions. However, Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of energy supplier SSE, told the Today programme he was pleased ""to see this level of ambition from the government"". He said the plan was ""a really important step in getting the green recovery going"" and would ""help create a lot more jobs"". Mike Hulme, professor of human geography at the University of Cambridge, said critics should not ""nit-pick about precise details"" of the plan as it was ""far more important is to endorse the direction of travel that has been set for the next decade"". Tanya Steele from WWF-UK said the government had ""fired the starting gun on the action we need to see"". She added: ""We now need the chancellor to live up to the ambition expressed today through a spending review that tests every line of public spending to ensure it's compatible with meeting our climate goals.""

"Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030The PM confirms he is bringing the ban forward as he sets out his ""green industrial revolution"".Science & EnvironmentCommentsRural broadband 'to be transformed' in Â£165m dealMore than 76,000 premises in NI are set to benefit from access to full-fibre broadband.Northern IrelandComments","Â£1.3bn will be invested in electric vehicle charging points as part of the plan New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. But some hybrids would still be allowed, he confirmed. It is part of what Mr Johnson calls a ""green industrial revolution"" to tackle climate change and create jobs in industries such as nuclear energy. Critics say the Â£4bn allocated to implement the 10-point plan is far too small for the scale of the challenge. The total amount of new money announced in the package is a 25th of the projected Â£100bn cost of high-speed rail, HS2. UK climate plan: what do the terms mean? A really simple guide to climate change Electric vehicles: Your questions answered Shift to electric cars 'requires Herculean effort' This video can not be played Will the UK be ready for a 2030 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars? Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Breakfast the Â£4bn was part of a broader Â£12bn package of public investment, which ""will help to bring in three times as much in terms of private sector money"". Mr Sharma, who is president of the COP26 international climate summit that the UK will host next year, said the money would also support the creation of 250,000 jobs in parts of the UK ""where we want to see levelling up"". The government hopes that many of those jobs will be in northern England and in Wales, and that 60,000 will be in offshore wind. The government has also given funding to boost cycling and walking Offshore wind:Produce enough offshore wind to power every home in the UK, quadrupling how much it produces to 40 gigawatts by 2030, and supporting up to 60,000 jobs. Hydrogen:Have five gigawatts of ""low carbon"" hydrogen production capacity by 2030 - for industry, transport, power and homes - and develop the first town heated by the gas by the end of the decade. Nuclear:Pushing nuclear power as a clean energy source and including provision for a large nuclear plant, as well as for advanced small nuclear reactors, which could support 10,000 jobs. Electric vehicles:Phasing out sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and investing in grants to help buy cars and charge point infrastructure. Public transport, cycling and walking:Making cycling and walking more attractive ways to travel and investing in zero-emission public transport for the future. Jet zero and greener maritime:Supporting research projects for zero-emission planes and ships. Homes and public buildings:Making homes, schools and hospitals greener, warmer and more energy efficient, including a target to install 600,000 heat pumps every year by 2028. Carbon capture:Developing world-leading technology to capture and store harmful emissions away from the atmosphere, with a target to remove 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 - equivalent to all emissions of the industrial Humber. Nature:Protecting and restoring the natural environment, with plans to include planting 30,000 hectares of trees a year. Innovation and finance:Developing cutting-edge technologies and making the City of London the global centre of green finance. The plan includes provision for a large nuclear plant -likely to be at Sizewell in Suffolk- and for advanced small nuclear reactors, which it is hoped, will create an estimated 10,000 jobs at Rolls-Royce and other firms. The government is close to giving the green light to a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk The plans will also affect some people's homes. The government will bring forward, to 2023, the date by which new homes will need to be warmed without using gas heating. Free home insulation: Too good to be true? Sea's heat to warm historic house Extra Â£40m pledged for green spaces in England Why the UK's carbon-free future will need rules It will aim to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 - these are low-energy electrical devices for warming homes. And it hasextended the Green Homes Grant for home insulationfor a year after the first tranche was massively over-subscribed. Clean hydrogen will be blended into the natural gas supply to reduce overall emissions from gas, and the government wants a town to volunteer for a trial of 100% hydrogen for heat, industry and cooking. The hydrogen - attracting a subsidy of up to Â£500m - will be produced in places such as the North East of England, partly by energy from offshore wind. The prime minister wants his green plan to be powered by wind farms like this one in Redcar, Teesside The government wants to breathe new life into de-industrialised areas by teaming hydrogen production with the manufacture of wind turbines, and with four clusters of firms using carbon capture and storage. Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? UK carbon capture project begins This is when emissions from chimneys are captured and forced into rocks underground. The hope is to transform depressed areas into hi-tech hubs. This will get funding of an extra Â£200m. Another key point of the plan is a Â£1.3bn investment in electric vehicle (EV) charging points. Grants for EV buyers will stretch to Â£582m to help people make the transition. There is also nearly Â£500m for battery manufacture in the Midlands and the north-east of England. Many of the details of the plan will be written into an energy white paper proposing future legislation, which is expected by the end of the month. In the race to clean up motoring, the UK is now in second place after Norway, which has a fossil fuel vehicle abolition date of 2025. UK car makers have warned about the scale of the challenge, but the government believes that forcing technological change can give firms a competitive edge. But will the so-called ""green revolution"" achieve its aim of massive job creation? Experts said the Â£4bn would go a long way if it were spent on labour-intensive insulation, but not far if ploughed into expensive, mechanised carbon capture. The prime minister said: ""My 10-point plan will create, support and protect hundreds of thousands of green jobs, whilst making strides towards net zero by 2050. ""Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the North East, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales, so we can look ahead to a more prosperous, greener future."" Mr Johnson said his plans aimed to create jobs and address climate change at the same time. The UK will host the COP26 UN summit - seen as the most important round of talks to tackle climate change since the Paris Agreement in 2015 - in Glasgow this time next year.It had been due to take place in 2020 but was postponed by 12 months because of the pandemic. The plans are aimed to put the UK on track to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband criticised the plan, saying that the funding ""in this long-awaited"" announcement does not ""remotely meet the scale of what is needed"" to tackle unemployment and the climate emergency. ""Only a fraction of the funding announced today is new."" Mr Miliband, who served as energy and climate change secretary from 2008-10,  said Labour wanted the government to bring forward Â£30bn of capital investment over the next 18 months and invest it in low-carbon sectors to support 400,000 additional jobs. And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas welcomed some measures but said the plan ""completely fails to rise to the gravity of this moment"". ""When you put it in the context of the scale of the climate and nature emergencies that we face, and indeed the scale of the job emergencies that we face, then it's nowhere near ambitious enough, it's not urgent enough, it's not bold enough,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She criticised the Â£4bn allocation, saying ""the resources aren't there in order to make this a really strategic package"". Ms Lucas also said the government's message is ""inconsistent"" and it must make clear  which technologies it wants to invest in. She said nuclear power is ""massively costly"", will not be ""on stream"" until the middle of the 2030s, and risks undermining focus on offshore wind. The Green Party called for a transformation of the entire economy to reduce emissions, including scrapping the Â£27bn road-building programme, which will actually increase emissions. However, Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of energy supplier SSE, told the Today programme he was pleased ""to see this level of ambition from the government"". He said the plan was ""a really important step in getting the green recovery going"" and would ""help create a lot more jobs"". Mike Hulme, professor of human geography at the University of Cambridge, said critics should not ""nit-pick about precise details"" of the plan as it was ""far more important is to endorse the direction of travel that has been set for the next decade"". Tanya Steele from WWF-UK said the government had ""fired the starting gun on the action we need to see"". She added: ""We now need the chancellor to live up to the ambition expressed today through a spending review that tests every line of public spending to ensure it's compatible with meeting our climate goals.""

"Rural broadband 'to be transformed' in Â£165m dealMore than 76,000 premises in NI are set to benefit from access to full-fibre broadband.Northern IrelandComments","A Â£165m deal to improve broadband connectivity in Northern Ireland will be ""transformational"" for people living in rural areas, according to the company chosen to carry out the work. The contract for the upgrade work has been awarded by the Department for the Economy to broadband provider Fibrus. The aim of the investment - known as Project Stratum - is improving rural internet connectivity. About 76,000 premises are to benefit from full-fibre broadband access. The total funding for Project Stratum is Â£165m,with Â£150m coming from the confidence-and-supply agreement dealsigned between the DUP and the Conservative Party in 2017. The remaining Â£15m is being provided by Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs. Economy Minister Diane Dodds described the announcement as a ""significant milestone"". ""We are one step closer to bringing next generation broadband services to those businesses and people who need it most,"" she said. ""Fibrus proposes a full-fibre solution, capable of offering speeds of up to one gigabit per second to almost 97% of premises in the target intervention area."" The process is set to run until March 2024. The latest Connected Nations report from Ofcom suggests Northern Ireland has the best full-fibre coverage. Rural areas still lagging behind for broadband ""We ration our internet because of where we live"" Broadband provider Fibrus set to win Â£165m contract However, the September report said the number of premises unable to access decent internet is higher when compared with other UK nations. Fibrus chair Conal Henry said superfast broadband was a vital part of infrastructure and ""key to unlocking the full economic and social potential of our rural communities"". ""This investment enables towns, villages and rural communities to change the narrative, keep people and communities connected and facilitate the increasing demand for working and studying at home,"" he said. ""The benefits of full-fibre broadband are more relevant now in a Covid context than ever before."" Paddy McEldowney, who lives in the Sperrin Mountains outside Draperstown, County Londonderry, is one of those hoping to see a vast improvement in his broadband speed. ""We're getting speeds of probably just less than one megabit per second, which is atrocious when you're trying to live a normal family life,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""It was difficult before lockdown but lockdown just exacerbated everything - working from home and Zoom calls every day and home-schooling on Google classroom, with myself and my wife both working from home and three children. ""We had a situation for a couple of years where we just couldn't be on the internet together - we had to take it in turns, we had to around the house seeing who's on and who's off."" He added: ""My biggest concern about the Project Stratum would be is everyone going to be looked after or are there still going to be in four years' time houses like mine where the broadband is still atrocious?"" Fibrus said it has already invested Â£65m to improve broadband in towns across Northern Ireland. UK Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""This Â£150m investment from the UK Government will help deliver lightning fast gigabit speeds not just to Northern Ireland's towns and cities but also to rural areas stuck in the digital slow lane.""

"Man arrested over 1974 Birmingham pub bombingsThe 65-year-old was arrested at his home and will be interviewed under caution, police say.Birmingham & Black CountryThe man who talked to chairs","Twenty-one people were killed in two blasts on 21 November 1974 A man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of 21 people in the 1974 pub bombings in Birmingham. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, arrested the 65-year-old at his home in Belfast. He was detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Police said the man's home was being searched and he will be interviewed under caution at a police station in Northern Ireland. Birmingham pub bombings: What we know Who were Birmingham pub bombings victims? Latest news from the West Midlands Saturday will mark the 46th anniversary of the bombings. Fresh inquestslast year ruled the victims were unlawfully killed, but did not establish who was responsible. Those hearings came after years of campaigning by families for a full account into what happened that night. Last month, Home Secretary Priti Patelannounced she would be considering the case for a public inquiry into the bombings. The blasts ripped apart the Mulberry Bush pub at the base of the Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street Six men - Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were wrongly jailed for life in 1975 for the bombings. The group, who became known as the Birmingham Six, had their convictions quashed in the appeal court and they were released in 1991. Inquests into the deaths of those killed in the bombings found they were unlawfully killed 21 November 1974: A man telephones the Birmingham Post and Mail to warn two bombs had been planted in the city centre. At 20:17 GMT a bomb exploded in a duffel bag in the Mulberry Bush pub in the Rotunda building, killing 10 people. Minutes later a second bomb went off in the Tavern in the Town leaving 11 more dead. 1975: Six men, Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker, are found guilty of carrying out the bombings. 1985: The World in Action programme names four suspects the production was ""100% sure"" were the true perpetrators, and said they knew the identity of a fifth. 14 March 1991: After 16 years behind bars, the Birmingham Sixhave their convictions quashedand, that year, West Midlands Police begins re-investigating the case. 1994: West Midlands Police says there is insufficient evidence for any prosecutions, butthe case remains open. June 2016: Louise Hunt, senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, saidinquests into the deaths would be reopened.Inquests were opened and adjourned days after the attack but, because the case was subject to a criminal investigation, they were never resumed. July 2017: Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QCdecides the names of the alleged bombers would not be part of the framework of the resumed inquests.. In January, theHigh Court quashed this ruling, but judges at the Court of Appeal ruled in his favour,meaning suspects would not be named. April 2019: The inquestsfind the 21 victims of the pub bombings were unlawfully killed. October 2020: Following calls by the families of those killed in the bombings, Home Secretary Priti Patelagrees to consider the case for a public inquiry. Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the bombings, called the arrest ""the most monumental event"" in the criminal investigation since the quashing of those convictions. She said she broke down in tears when she was told by a senior West Midlands Police officer of the arrest.

Is this really a green revolution?,"Is this the start of a green revolution? Revolutions are often born out of crises and the government's long awaited plan to start a green industrial revolution is a central part of its ambition to ""build back better"" after the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis. But does this plan deliver? The eye-catching and headline-grabbing abolition of new petrol and diesel cars a decade earlier than originally planned has been welcomed by environmental groups. It puts the UK toward the front of the pack in the electric vehicle race and was also widely expected in a year when the UK needed to demonstrate the kind of leadership required of the next hosts of the world's biggest environment summit COP 26. Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 Government to invest Â£4bn in 250,000 green jobs Investment in capturing carbon at the point it is burnt and burying it deep underground has also been seen as an essential part of the roadmap to net zero. There was also money for new nuclear - big and small - and a drive to make new homes more efficient by retro-fitting old ones with better insulation, or replacing old gas boilers with new electric pumps which convert and concentrate heat underground into central heating for our homes. A pilot to replace 600,000 home heating systems a year by 2028 sounds like a lot - but it's hard to exaggerate the scale and cost of the task involved in replacing 25 million gas boilers. If that happens, this will be a revolution that won't be about international summits, climate protests, or huge and distant infrastructure projects. It's a revolution that is coming to our front doors and inside our cupboards. Heating is the single biggest contributor to carbon emissions, and the Committee on Climate Change says this will be the hardest nut to crack and on its own could cost up to Â£500bn. That's the problem for many. Today's commitment of Â£4bn in new money seems like a very small sum to be considered evidence that a ""revolution"" is under way. In its defence, the government will rightly point out that a little bit of government money and political will can generate a lot of private investment. It will also point to the fact that the Covid crisis has limited its ability to commit right now to future spending. Critics cry that if there is a bigger crisis than coronavirus, it is climate change and there are no vaccines for this one on the horizon. But in one way there is a mini-revolution here. In the past, and in the parsimonious eyes of treasury officials, green stuff = cost. There is now a new orthodoxy that green stuff = jobs. The government is very keen for these measures to be seen as not only steps towards hitting a climate target but a way of creating jobs in a post-Covid world. The bigger the project, the more jobs it creates, the more favourably the government will look at it. That's a new shade of green for a Conservative government.

'Weeks' before Christmas rules agreed,"This video can not be played We cannot go back to normal, says health minister It could be ""weeks"" before there is an announcement on the Covid rules around Christmas, Wales' health minister has said. Welsh ministers and other UK administrations are in talks over a set of agreed rules for the festive period. Vaughan Gething said whatever happened, the period would ""not be like normal"". ""You shouldn't expect there to be a definitive statement in the next few days or weeks,"" he told a press conference. ""We have quite a long way to go in the course of the pandemic we've been dealing with before we get to the Christmas period."" Students going home should travel by 9 December Not all students in Wales will get Covid tests Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic There had been calls for a single approach from the different UK administrations about Christmas so families who live in different areas can deal with a single set of rules. Vaughan Gething said this Christmas would ""not be like normal"" Mr Gething said discussions were ongoing about what will be in place for travel, ""and we're still looking at the evidence about what we might be able to do around contact"". ""But it does rely on the picture that we'll see in the developing evidence over the coming weeks"", he added. He noted thatother faiths had seen their festivals limited by Covid restrictions, most recently Diwali. Meanwhile Mr Gething said the rate of cases in Wales was continuing to fall, one week after Wales' firebreak lockdown. Cases in Merthyr Tydfil, which has seen the highest case rate of any local authority in the UK, have more than halved, he said. ""On Friday, I said we were starting to see some very early positive signs that cases of coronavirus are beginning to fall. This downward trend is continuing."" The seven-day incidence rate for Wales is now at about 160 cases per 100,000 people - a reduction of 70 from this time last week, he said. He also said people needed to be aware of the differences between coronavirus and seasonal flu, with the former having a higher mortality rate and a greater proportion of sufferers becoming seriously ill. After the news ofanother potentially effective vaccine, Mr Gething said he ""doesn't plan"" to make Covid vaccines mandatory. He said he had never tried to mandate any vaccine, and would not want to do so with Covid. ""I'm interested in people understanding the evidence for the safety of the vaccine , then making the right choice to protect them, their family and their community"" he added.

Mr Gething said there had been ""pent-up demand"" after the firebreak, with retailers operating limits on numbers in their stores. While he had seen pictures of people socially-distancing, ""I have seen some images that are more concerning where people have forgotten about social distancing and are returning to a more normal way of behaving. ""Now, if that continues we really will face difficult choices, and we're likely to see the trend that we've already seen with reducing cases - that can easily reverse.""

What do the climate terms mean?,"The UK prime minister is set to publish his long-awaited ""net zero"" plan to tackle climate change. He has already backed technologies like carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and small reactors. Here, we break down some of the terms we're likely to hear about in the plan. The world is over-heating fast, thanks to emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases from burning fossil fuels. Another important human-produced heating gas is methane â mostly from farming and landfill. Scientists warn it simply wonât be possible to get emissions of these to zero by the UK's chosen date of 2050. So instead, the government is aiming for a target known as net zero. That means the emissions that canât be avoided by clean technology in 2050 will either be buried using the technology of carbon capture and storage, or soaked up by plants and soils. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) This does what it says on the tin â a technology that employs a chemical process to capture CO2 emissions from industrial chimneys. The gas is then compressed and forced into porous underground rocks. Two decades ago, it was touted as a climate saviour. But it's very expensive and has never really taken off. New technologies can also take waste CO2 and turn it into useful chemicals â but demand is vastly outstripped by the supply of unwanted CO2. Net zero vs carbon neutral Let's take net zero first. It refers to balancing out any greenhouse gas emissions produced by industry, transport or other sources by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. This usually occurs through, for example, planting trees, which sequester carbon in their wood. The terms net zero and carbon neutral are often seen as interchangeable. But while net zero usually refers to all greenhouse gases, Chris Stark, chief executive of the UK government's advisory body the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), said his organisation mostly uses carbon neutral when referring to carbon dioxide emissions only. Jim Watson, professor of energy policy at University College London (UCL), concurred with the CCC's definition but he added that it was ""unfortunate"" there was no universally agreed definition for the terms. Small modular reactors (SMRs) Mr Johnson wants new nuclear power for the UK but history has shown that the construction of large nuclear power plants often goes way over schedule and budget. Several manufacturers are now trying to develop small modular plants as a âkit of partsâ that can be assembled on site. The idea is that factory-built modules will be constructed at scale to drive down costs but some experts are highly sceptical. Supporters say that small nuclear reactors can be unobtrusive and safe Hydrogen power Hydrogen is the lightest element on Earth.When itâs used as a source of energy, it produces no direct carbon emissions. It can be used either in fuel cells, or burned in internal combustion engines. Several industries hope hydrogen will replace the natural gas they burn and some transport experts believe hydrogen fuel cells will increasingly be used to power vehicles. A fuel cell is an ingenious piece of equipment that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. This can be used, say, to power a lorry. Many fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity - with water and heat as by-products. A key question is whether the hydrogen used for energy is itself from fossil gas. A key process for producing hydrogen in this way, known as steam reforming, also emits troublesome carbon dioxide and is expensive. Hydrogen can also be manufactured by âsplittingâ water using wind energy, which is clean but even more costly. Nuclear fusion Conventional nuclear power stations rely on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. But nuclear fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. Iter: the world's biggest nuclear fusion project is under construction in France It's an attempt to replicate the processes of the Sun here on Earth. Nuclear fusion has been a dream of scientists for decades, because, like the Sun, it could act as an almost limitless source of energy. Further attractions include cheap fuel, relatively little radioactive waste and no emissions of greenhouse gases. But getting more energy out than you put in remains immensely challenging and, since the 1950s, it's been touted as being ""30 years away"". COP meetings This time next year â postponed from 2020 because of Covid-19 â the UK will host a crucial meeting of world leaders known as COP26. Itâs where delegates from nations across the globe agree what they're going to do hold back climate change. COP stands for Conference of the Parties.  It will be attended by countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - back in 1992. This year's meeting will be the 26th, which is why it's called COP26. NDCs Next month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will convene a virtual summit where leaders will be asked to offer their NDCs for tackling climate change. NDCs are Nationally Determined Contributions - in other words, voluntary offers by nations to cut their own emissions. The timeframe in focus is up to 2030, and if the UK wants to encourage other countries to make cuts that are equal to the challenge, Mr Johnson must make an ambitious pledge with far-reaching effects across the economy. Carbon budgets This is a restriction that's placed on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted over a set period of time. The UK uses carbon budgets to keep on track with its strategy of switching over to a low-carbon economy. The next budget, to be set next month, will carry Britain through to 2037, by which time it should be on track for net zero in 2050.

Four UK nations discuss joint Christmas plan,"Discussions have taken place about the four nations of the UK taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish first ministers held a virtual meeting with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and other senior UK officials. It was the first of what UK ministers hope will be weekly meetings. UK government sources said topics including international travel, mass testing and the priority list for vaccinations were also discussed. Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford and Arlene Foster took part in the meeting, as did Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Mr Gove said they all recognised families across the UK ""want to be able to see their loved ones this Christmas"". Students to go home in evacuation-style operation 'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be He added: ""Today my ministerial colleagues and I met with the devolved administrations to work towards that shared aim and to help ensure that our collective response delivers for the public in every part of the UK"". It is understood government officials will now be considering how to put the desire for a ""joint approach to Christmas"" into action. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The four nations call had an initial discussion about a co-ordinated approach to issues such as travel over the Christmas period and discussed recent developments in testing, including the use of lateral flow testing to enable students to return home, and initial lessons from the Liverpool pilot."" Senior UK ministers have warned the situation remains highly volatile, with different levels of restrictions in different parts of the country and high rates of transmissions across the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said recently that people may not be able to gather like normal in large groups while Ms Sturgeon's most senior public health adviser, Jason Leitch, said last month that people should prepare themselves for a ""digital Christmas"". Earlier on Wednesday, a plan was announced to get students in England home safely for Christmas. Students are to be allocated departure dates during a ""student travel window"" between 3 and 9 December, to minimise the risk of them spreading Covid-19. In Wales, they are being asked to travel by 9 December at the latest. The Scottish government wants as many as possible of the 80,000 or so students going home for Christmas to be offered voluntary tests before they travel. Northern Ireland is expected to publish plans for students' return in the coming days. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme?

"Too early for Christmas Covid rules, says minister","Ministers are looking at how to relax coronavirus restrictions so families can celebrate Christmas together. The government's medical adviser on Covid, Susan Hopkins, said they were working on a plan and wanted Christmas to be ""as close to normal as possible"". She said tough restrictions might be needed before and after the holiday to allow mixing to take place. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said any rule change would be for a limited time, maybe just a few days. The prime minister's official spokesman confirmed ministers were ""looking at ways to ensure that people can spend time with close family over Christmas at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year"". It comes afterthe Sun reported that families may be able to mix indoors,externalfor five days from Christmas Eve. All four UK nations - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - are trying to work out a common approach to Christmas so families spread across the UK can still meet up. Our correspondent said any final decisions would not be made for a few weeks while health chiefs wait to see whether cases have started to come down during the  lockdown in England. But, he said, the advice was likely to urge families not to hold big gatherings and to travel by car, rather than public transport. Scientific advice indicates that for every day that measures are relaxed, five days of tighter restrictions would be needed. 'Why a family Christmas means so much to me this year' How will students go home for Christmas? Four UK nations discuss joint Christmas Covid plan Hospitals warn covid admissions 'rapidly rising' The government has recorded another 19,609 Covid cases in the UK and 529 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. England is expected to come out of its second national lockdown on 2 December and return to thetier systemof localised restrictions, with household mixing banned indoors in the top two tiers. This video can not be played 'We're keen to have Christmas as close to normal as possible' Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Dr Hopkins, from Public Health England, suggested restrictions could be needed either side of Christmas if curbs were to be eased over the festive period. She said two days of tighter restrictions would be required for every one day relaxed - although officials later clarified the advice is actually for five days. People would need to be ""very careful"" about the contacts they have in the lead-up to Christmas and would have to be ""responsible"" and reduce contacts again after the festive period, she added. She said she knew ministers were ""working hard to develop an outline"" of what the new tiers would look like after 2 December and what Christmas would look like. The BBC has been told new tougher regional tiers could see pubs and restaurants closed entirely in areas in the top tier throughout the festive period. Strict rules on meeting up and social distancing have meant millions of people have been unable to hug, or sometimes even see, close family for many months. Chris, from Norfolk, said he feared this might be the last Christmas his father, who has advanced cancer, has with his three grandchildren. ""I'm not interested in Christmas as a party or celebration. All I want is one day,""he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Downing Street said Christmas would not be normal but the prime minister would look at the latest data to make decisions and an update would be given next week. Earlier, Cabinet minister Alok Sharma said it was too early for ""conclusions"" but he wanted to see his family for Christmas. Mr Sharma told BBC Breakfast people needed to keep bearing down on the infection and ""do our bit"". Virtual office Christmas parties organised on Zoom Visitor tests in all care homes 'by Christmas' Travel rules changed for Christmas turkey workers On Tuesday, Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, suggested extending support bubbles to up to four households to allow families to celebrate Christmas together. This year, Christmas Eve falls on Thursday and there is a bank holiday on the following Monday, giving most workers at least a four-day break. Prof Ferguson also warned that reopening pubs and restaurants in the run-up to Christmas would be likely to lead to rising infection levels. What to do about Christmas is delicately poised. On the one hand, allowing mixing over the festive period will undoubtedly lead to an increase in infections. What is more, there are concerns the impact of lockdown will be more limited than hoped. We are yet to see infections rates start falling - although it is still early days - so there will be no final decision on Christmas yet. But stamping down on the virus is, of course, not the be all and end all. Providing an opportunity to meet will bring much needed respite from the hard slog of the pandemic. But there is also a widespread recognition that even if the government bans mixing at Christmas, significant numbers of people may well ignore it. The fear is that then starts to normalise breaking the restrictions and will make compliance worse over the rest of winter. The expectation is that there will be some limited relaxation - in the hope that the psychological boost it will give the public and the longer-term goodwill it will engender will outweigh any cost in terms of virus spread. That much was clear from the Downing Street briefing when government advisers admitted publicly for the first time that it may be on the cards. But the pay-off for that could be tighter regional restrictions on hospitality in the areas with the highest rates all through the festive period. There have been calls for a single approach from the devolved administrations in the UK about Christmas - so families who live in different nations can deal with a single set of rules. Welsh ministers have said it could beweeks before an announcement on Covid rules is made, and warned this year's festive period would ""not be like normal"". Ministers in Northern Ireland said they would do all they could to""protect"" as much of Christmas as possible. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidnew, stricter measures announced on Tuesdaywere needed, in part, to allow the possibility of people meeting up over Christmas. ""We are all desperate for some normality around Christmas and I absolutely include myself in that,"" Ms Sturgeon said.

Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priorityThe spending watchdog found Â£10.5bn was spent on pandemic-related contracts awarded without competitive tender.,"80% of the contracts were for personal protective equipment Companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority as the government raced to obtain Personal Protective Equipment, the National Audit Office found. Over half of the Â£18bn spent on pandemic-related contracts was awarded without competitive tender, it said. The spending watchdog said the government was not transparent about suppliers and services. It also found there was inadequate explanation of key spending decisions. The findings are part of an NAO investigation into government procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks The watchdog found not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. It found more than 8,600 coronavirus contracts had been awarded by 31 July, ranging in value from less than Â£100 to Â£410m. Of these, Â£10.5bn-worth (58%) were awarded directly without a competitive tender process. Personal protective equipment (PPE) accounted for 80% of the number of contracts awarded. The report comes after the BBC revealed on Tuesday that a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the pandemicwas paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson had been in line for a further $20m of UK public funds, documents filed in a US court reveal. He worked with Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger who set up a business at the start of the pandemic to supply PPE to governments. Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger set up a business to supply PPE to governments Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called for ministers to ""come clean"" and publish all information about the contracts awarded. The government acknowledged it had procured services with ""extreme urgency"" during the crisis but it said it had ""robust processes in place"". When asked about the $28m paid to the Spanish businessman, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Department of Health did look at that contract at the time."" ""At the time there was huge pressure to get PPE into the system and that's what we did,"" he added. The government is keen to note that the National Audit Office found ""no evidence that ministers had been involved in either the award or management of the contracts"" for Â£18bn of pandemic-related contracts. It was under huge pressure to get more PPE immediately and was bidding against governments all over the world. It's even understandable that most of the contracts were awarded without the normal (and time-consuming) competitive tendering process that is there to ensure value for money for taxpayers - and to eliminate the risk that someone gets a lucrative public sector contract not because of what they offer but because of who they know. But as the NAO points out, if you ditch that competitive process, the remaining safeguards - such as properly documenting what you've done to avoid conflicts of interest  - become all the more important. And if you have a process where companies referred by ministers' offices, MPs, peers and health chiefs get 'fast-tracked' - and are therefore ten times as likely to win a contract - there's an even stronger risk that contracts are seen to be awarded not on merit or value for money but because of personal connections. To eliminate that risk, the public accounts committee chair Meg Hillier is calling for all contracts awarded so far to be published. NAO head Gareth Davies said it remained ""essential that decisions are properly documented and made transparent if government is to maintain public trust"". Ms Hillier, a Labour MP, said the failings uncovered may be the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The government overlooked a serious conflict of interest, paid consultants for months before giving them contracts and purchased masks it knew weren't up to scratch. ""It's bad enough that it set up a 'high-priority lane' to fast-track companies with the right connections. ""But the failure to track how half the companies had ended up on it made it impossible to ensure proper safeguards were in place."" The NAO looked in detail at 20 contracts including: A deal with research firm Public First, whose owners had ""previously advised or worked with"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove. Artificial intelligence company Faculty, which was awarded contracts worth almost Â£3m. Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew owned a Â£90,000 stake in the firm but has since relinquished it. Ayanda Capital supplied 50 million masks that could not be used for their original purpose at a cost of Â£155m. The deal was brokered by a businessman who was an adviser to the government's Board of Trade at the time. PestFix, a pest control company, was given contracts worth Â£350m, which included delivery of 600,000 masks which cannot be used for their original purpose. The NAO concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". The spending watchdog acknowledged the pandemic required acting with ""extreme urgency"" and the Public Contracts Regulations allowed an emergency response, including awarding deals directly without a formal competition. Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez said: ""We have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic that has posed the biggest challenge to the UK in a generation. ""As this report rightly recognises, we needed to procure contracts with extreme urgency to secure the vital supplies required to protect frontline NHS workers and the public and we make no apology for that. ""We have robust processes in place for spending public money to ensure we get critical equipment to where it needs to go as quickly as possible, whilst also ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. ""It is important to maintain the public's confidence in how we manage their money, and we welcome the NAO's scrutiny of our processes and recommendations on how they can be improved."" Tom Sasse from the think tank the Institute for Government, told Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money that procurement processes exist to make sure taxpayers get the best value for money. ""The NAO point to some pretty serious problems with how public procurement has happened during the pandemic,"" he said. ""We've also seen a big story in August around Â£150m that went on PPE that couldn't be used. So there are questions about how this process is working.""

Thanks for joining us. The coronavirus live page writers today were: Mary O'Connor, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset, Max Matza, George Wright, Alice Evans and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: The doctors on Yemen's front line Olga Robinson and Laura GozziBBC anti-disinformation unit A new French âdocumentaryâ promoting bad medical advice,
misinformation and conspiracy theories about coronavirus has gone viral on
YouTube and other social networks. Over more than two and a half hours, the film - titled Hold Up - promises to reveal the âtruthâ about the virus. Instead, it pushes a slew of previously debunked claims:
allegations that wearing masks is dangerous, claims that Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates predicted the pandemic, and evidence-free assertions that the crisis
was somehow planned by global elites. The film has already been dubbed by some experts as a French
âPlandemicâ â referring to a similar English-language conspiracy videothat was debunked earlier this year. Like its predecessor, Hold Up is spreading rapidly. In the
past few days it has been watched more than a million times on YouTube alone,
despite the video sharing siteâs rules on coronavirus misinformation. Weâve
contacted YouTube for comment. Links to it have also been shared hundreds of times on
Facebook, as well as on Instagram and Reddit. Denmark's Prime Minister
Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster.

The WikiLeaks founder says a number of inmates at the London prison have received a letter from the governor notifying them that there had been a number of positive Covid-19 cases. All prisoners and staff are to be swabbed to detect for Covid-19 at the prison in the next 24-48 hours, says Assange. He adds that all exercise has been stopped, showers have been prohibited and meals are to be provided direct to prisoners in their cells. Assange has been held at Belmarsh Prison for the last year and a half and is awaiting the judgement from a US extradition hearing on 4 January. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We've introduced further safety measures following a number of positive cases.""

After receiving Â£12m ($16m) in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program of the Cares Act, they allegedly used the funds to write cheques to fake employees, including their own family members. One defendant's 86-year-old mother allegedly received at least six different cheques, as well as unemployment benefits, from a company she had never worked for before. âSome fraudsters create the most complicated schemes to steal money from the taxpayer,"" said US Attorney Ryan K Patrick of the Southern District of Texas. ""Just imagine how productive they could be if they put their creativity and effort into noble and useful work.â Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has largely seen the back of
the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a
version of normal. But thatâs not to say life is as
it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was
captured on surveillance footage helping a child whose mask had broken. On-board CCTV captured a
schoolgirl boarding a bus in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, and apologising,
holding her broken mask up when the driver asked why she wasnât wearing one. âLet me give you one,â the man,
surnamed He, is heard saying, and he is shown fitting a new mask on her face
before letting her board. In an unexpected twist, however,
surveillance footage captured the same girl boarding the bus the following day,
asking another driver if she could pass on a thank you present to him. Millions of social media users in the country have seen a picture that the girl drew, with a big heart, saying âthank you mister for helping meâ with a bar of chocolate and a lollipop. âFor the last two days, all Iâve read is bad news, but I feel warm again after seeing this,â one user of Chinaâs Sina Weibo platform says.

About 2,000 police officers were deployed to the parliament, or Bundestag, where thousands of protesters had gathered in anger at the latest coronavirus restrictions. Police fired water cannons to disperse those gathered. Germany is currently under a month-long ""lockdown light"", with restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues closed while schools, shops and workplaces remain open.

You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,â says the 56-year-old unemployed lorry driver from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire of the creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane says he previously could go a fortnight without talking to anyone, in what became a ""vicious circle"". âYou donât want to admit thereâs a problem, and then things just get worse and worse.

Kolasinac will now miss Wednesday's Nations League match with Italy. The 27-year-old played the full 90 minutes of Bosnia-Herzegovina's defeat to the Netherlands on Sunday. He is the second Arsenal player to test positive this week, afterEgypt midfielder Mohamed Elneny.

Firsat Sofi (R) is seen here distributing face masks in Irbil in June The governor of Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, has died of complications after contracting coronavirus, officials have said. Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000. Figures released by National Records of Scotland showed that the virus had been mentioned on the death certificate of 5,135 people by last Sunday. This included 278 people who had died in the previous week. Scotland recorded itsfirst confirmed coronavirus death- an elderly patient in Lothian with underlying health conditions - on 14 March.

But how does NHS Test and Trace work? If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact.

Virtual Prime Minister's Questions,"Boris Johnson took this week's PMQs by video link The prime minister is self-isolating in Downing Street having come in to contact with a colleague who later tested positive for coronavirus The PM was tested for coronavirus on Monday which came back negative Both the Labour and SNP party leaders challenged the PM on his comments that devolution in Scotland had been a 'disaster' Boris Johnson defended himself saying the SNP's ""campaign for the break up of our country"" had been the disaster Sir Keir Starmer also questioned the PM on government contracts for PPE supplies Mr Johnson said he is ""proud"" of the way the government got PPE supplies at the start of the coronavirus pandemic Earlier, the Labour party leader rejected allowing Jeremy Corbyn to return to the parliamentary Labour party. Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel and Richard Morris As we step away from our live coverage today, we leave you with our favourite story today... This week's Beano comic includes a pull-out section called Bean-OLD, designed to cheer up adults in the midst of the pandemic - with a comic strip featuring Boris Johnson, his outgoing aide Dominic Cummings and some other famous faces from 2020. Our colleague Justin Parkinson was given a sneak preview here.  Our reporters on the live page today were Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel, and Richard Morris, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Hope you will join us again next week. That's where we'll pause today's coverage of this weeks virtual sitting of PMQs.  But before we go here's a quick recap of the main points: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent There was some scepticism â and curiosity â about how a virtual PMQs would work. Remember this is the first time ever that a prime minister has dialled in remotely to the Commons chamber. The Downing Street wifi did at least hold up but it was certainly not the liveliest of exchanges. However the traditional âbear pitâ atmosphere (than some like and others loathe) has been lacking for a while since they put limits on the number of MPs allowed in the chamber.  Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about the spread of disinformation by anti-vaccination activists and whether social media companies should be doing more to remove them. The prime minister said the government would be responding to the consultation on the âonline harmsâ white paper shortly and will be setting out plans for legislation. News of breakthroughs in coronavirus vaccine development â in recent days â has seen a resurgence in false claims about Covid-19 vaccines â including the baseless conspiracy theory that theyâre part of a secret plan (involving the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates) to implant microchips into humans - so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has beeninvestigating this and other vaccine claims here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about theNational Audit Office investigationinto the Covid-related contracts the government has been awarding since the start of the pandemic. A lot of them are for PPE â which covers things like masks, goggles and gowns. He said: â70% of PPE is now made in this country or capable of being made in this countryâ This figure is the governmentâs target for December rather than the proportion of PPE manufactured in the UK at the moment. In September, a policy paper published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that UK-based manufacturers are âanticipated to meet 70% of forecasted demand in December for all categories of PPE, excluding glovesâ. (Gloves are excluded as raw materials are not available in the UK.) The target is ambitious, especially because in June,the DHSC said that it was expecting,externalthat only 20% of all PPE will be manufactured in the UK by the end of the year. The figure for the proportion of PPE currently made in the UK is not publicly available at the moment.   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As PMQs ends Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle says he wants to put a ""big thank you"" on record to the staff in parliament's broadcasting unit for ""making today happen"". On his Downing Street video link, the PM calls ""hear hear"". And with that it's over. House of CommonsParliament Asking the final question for this week's session of PMQs, Labour's Bambos Charalambous says black, Asian and minority ethnic people are twice as likely as white people to catch coronavirus. How will the prime minister address ""structural inequalities"" when the vaccine is rolled out, he asks. Boris Johnson replies that the government is ""thinking about this issue right now."" He adds that it has brought forward ""enhanced testing procedures for vulnerable groups"". House of CommonsParliament Scottish Conservatives are out in force today following the row earlier this week over the PM's views on devolution. Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, presses the PM to throw his weight behind growth deals in Scotland. And John Lamont urges the PM to do all he can to resolve a trade dispute between the US and EU which he says is doing serious harm to exports such as such as whisky and cashmere which are being ""hammered"" by tariffs. The PM says the issue continues to be of grave concern and he is raising it with the US on a regular basis to try and get a settlement as soon as possible.  House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Christopher Chope calls for all people who have tested positive for Covid in the past six months and recovered to be exempt from current restrictions, citing research suggesting they have high levels of T-Cell immunity. He says this would show the PM was ""following the science as well as common sense"". The PM thanks the MP for the suggestion but says the evidence points both ways and everyone should continue to self-isolate whatever their historical position. Labour's Chi Onwurah asked the PM about child poverty and calls on the PM to reverse planned cuts to Universal Credit. Mr Johnson says the government wants to tackle child poverty and support people into work. He says 400,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. House of CommonsParliament ""It is extremely concerning that one in five people say they won't take the new vaccine,"" says Conservative Damian Collins. He asks if social media companies should do more to tackle anti-vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories. Boris Johnson says he welcomes Facebook and Google's decision that no company should profit from vaccine disinformation. The government will be setting out plans for legislation on disinformation shortly, he adds. House of CommonsParliament We now have an audio only question from the Independent MP Margaret Ferrier. She was kicked out of the SNP, after travelling to Westminster despite experiencing Covid symptoms. She uses her question to ask about a constituent who applied to the EU resettlement scheme for her and her son in September 2019, but is still waiting for a decision The EU Settlement Scheme allows EU citizens to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021. Boris Johnson says the case is under urgent review and that a decision will be made shortly. Tory Mark Pawsey suggests it is unfair for big supermarkets to be able to continue to sell items like clothing and homeware while specialist retailers are shut during the lockdown. He suggests it would be a good idea for big retailers to help smaller retailers with their tax bills. The PM agrees that there should be a fair playing field. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Graham Brady says ""tens of thousands of jobs have already been lost in aviation and hundreds of thousands hang in the balance"". He ask the prime minister to ensure a testing regime can be implemented to replace the current quarantine arrangements when England comes out of current lockdown restrictions. Boris Johnson said his government is ""working hard to ensure we can replace the quarantine regulations for every category of self isolation"". ""I certainly want to help the airlines,"" he adds. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The SNPâs Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked the PM about devolution. The party has â and will continue â to say that Boris Johnsonâs devolution âdisasterâ remarks reveal what the Prime Minister really thinks. In response, the PM talks about the âbillions and billionsâ of pounds used to help support the economy, across the UK, during the pandemic. And a central part of the case the government makes about the union is what they say is the unmatched âmightâ of the Treasury. That may be an argument of the head, but unionists are also under pressure to come up with an argument that appeals to the heart as well. House of CommonsParliament Ian Blackford hits back, saying the PM's comments earlier this week - when he described Scottish devolution as a disaster, were not a ""slip of the tongue but a slip of the Tory mask"". He says the only way the Scottish people can truly prosper is through taking destiny into their own hands through independence. The PM points out that Scotland voted no to independence in 2014 and ""will almost certainly"" do so again if there is another vote. He goes on to praise the role of the union during the pandemic, including the role of the armed forces and furlough. ""The union has shown its value and will continue to do so."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Trump fires election official who contradicted him,"Chris Krebs was a Trump appointee Donald Trump says he has fired a top election official who contradicted the US president's claims of voter fraud. President Trump said he ""terminated"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) chief Chris Krebs for his ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on vote integrity. Mr Trump has refused to concede the US election, and has made unsubstantiated claims of ""massive"" voter fraud. Election officials said the vote was the ""most secure"" in US history. Mr Krebs is the latest official to be dismissed by the US president following his defeat, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper also shown the door amid reports Mr Trump doubted the Pentagon chief's loyalty. There is speculation in Washington DC that before Mr Trump leaves office in January, CIA director Gina Haspel and FBI director Christopher Wray could also be for the chopping block. Refuting Trump cost cyber-security official his job No, voting machines didn't delete millions of Trump ballots Obama: One election won't stop US 'truth decay' Why US spy world is feeling so uneasy right now Like many others fired by Mr Trump, Mr Krebs reportedly only learned he was out of a job when he saw the president's tweet on Tuesday. But following his dismissal, the former Microsoft executive appeared to have no regrets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He had run the agency from its inception two years ago in the aftermath of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. To guard against potential cyber-threats, Cisa works with state and local election officials and the private companies that supply voting systems, while monitoring ballot tabulation and the power grid. He had reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over aCisa website called Rumor Control,external, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Hours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Mr Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Mr Biden. Mr Krebs tweeted: ""On allegations that election systems were manipulated, 59 election security experts all agree, 'in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.' #Protect2020"". This post, and others by Mr Krebs dating back to the end of July this year, appear to have been deleted from his Twitter account. He was among senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security who last week declared the 3 November US general election the ""most secure in American history"", while rejecting ""unfounded claims"". Though that statement did not name Mr Trump, on the same day it was published Mr Krebs retweeted a Twitter post by an election law expert saying: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Mr Krebs' dismissal brought outrage from Democrats. A spokesman for President-elect Joe Biden said ""Chris Krebs should be commended for his service in protecting our elections, not fired for telling the truth"". Mr Krebs' firing was the latest - and not necessarily the last - chapter in the long battle between President Trump and his own national security community. At issue from the start has been the legitimacy of both election campaigns he has fought in. His presidency began with him lashing out at his own spies for their assessment that Russia interfered in 2016 to support his candidacy. That began a long tussle in which the president almost appeared to see a zero-sum battle; one in which he sought to undermine the credibility of his own spies to avoid any question being raised about his victory. The tension has ebbed and flowed, with some officials sacked and others walking a fine line to try to protect themselves and their own institutions. But the 2020 election result has led it to explode again. In 2016, Mr Trump was angry at claims there had been election interference. This time his anger is at the refusal of those like Chris Krebs to back up his claims that there was. Mr Krebs is gone and with an uncertain, uneasy transition ahead, he may not be the last. Read the full analysis Mr Trump's campaign and its allies have filed a barrage of lawsuits in battleground states contesting the results, although election officials say no evidence of widespread irregularities has been found. Time is running out. All outstanding election disputes nationwide must be resolved by 8 December. The official results are set to be confirmed when the US Electoral College meets on 14 December. On Tuesday, Republican members of a bipartisan election board in Michigan refused to certify Mr Biden's projected win in that state, only to back down after an outcry. The two Republicans on the four-member board had objected to minor voting irregularities in Wayne County, home to Detroit. But they relented after Democrats accused them of trying to disenfranchise voters in the majority-black city. As a compromise, the board passed a resolution requesting that Michigan's Democratic secretary of state conduct an audit of the jurisdictions involved. This video can not be played Barack Obama tells the BBC about the ""crazy conspiracies"" and ""truth decay"" in US politics Meanwhile, election officials conducting a by-hand recount in Georgia - where a fraction of a percent separates the two rivals - found more uncounted ballots for the second time this week. Almost 2,800 previously untallied ballots were discovered on Tuesday in Fayette County, a day after 2,600 uncounted votes turned up in Floyd County. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system manager, blamed human error. The discoveries are expected to shave Mr Biden's lead in the state to under 13,000, not enough to flip Georgia into Mr Trump's column. There was another setback for Mr Trump on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, where the state supreme court rejected his campaign's argument that its observers had been denied sufficient rights to watch ballot counts in Philadelphia. Also on Tuesday, the Trump campaign, along with Nevada's Republican party, filed another lawsuit challenging that state's election results. Mr Biden is the projected victor in Nevada, but the latest legal action asked a judge to declare Mr Trump the winner, or annul the race altogether. Judges have rejected other Trump campaign lawsuits disputing the tally in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, after ruling there was no evidence to support claims of systemic fraud. What happens now?

LiveLiveUK PM attends first ever video-link PMQsBoris Johnson is self-isolating after contact with an MP who tested positive for coronavirus.World,"The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old UK ministers are considering how to relax coronavirus restrictions so families can celebrate Christmas together UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) with MPs via video link, as he continues to self-isolate The National Audit Office has accused the government of a lack of transparency over its awarding of Â£18bn of Covid-related contracts Top US medical bodies urge President Donald Trump to share Covid data with President-elect Joe Biden The state of South Australia will enter a six-day lockdown to curb the spread of a Covid outbreak found days ago German police fire water cannons at thousands of demonstrators in Berlin protesting against coronavirus restrictions Edited by Sarah Fowler We're now closing our live page for the day but will be back tomorrow. Thanks for joining us. The coronavirus live page writers today were: Mary O'Connor, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset, Max Matza, George Wright, Alice Evans and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented.""

Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster.

the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a

it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was

Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000.

Clothes and food price rises push inflation higher,"Rises in the cost of clothing and food helped to push UK inflation higher-than-expected last month. The UK's inflation rate, which tracks the prices of goods and services, jumped to 0.7% in October from 0.5% in September, official figures show. Second-hand cars and computer games also saw price rises, but these were partially offset by falls in the cost of energy and holidays. Analysts had expected the rate to remain flat at 0.5%. ""The rate of inflation increased slightly as clothing prices grew, returning to their normal seasonal pattern after the disruption this year,"" said Office for National Statistics deputy statistician Jonathan Athow. Normally prices for clothes and shoes fall each year between June and July in summer sales before autumn ranges come in, and then rise before sales towards the end of the year, the ONS said. However, the coronavirus crisis has changed how prices move. Throughout 2020 this pattern has been different, with increased discounting in March and April, probably as a response to lockdown, it said. After a small increase in July and August, prices rose by more than a year ago. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. Food prices rose between September and October, with most of the increase coming in fruit and vegetables, the ONS said. Analyst firm Capital Economics said food price inflation could continue to rise in November as supermarket demand continues to increase during the Covid-19 lockdown. During the first lockdown, there was a fall in the amount of supermarket promotionsas shoppers bulk bought essentials. Some surveys of consumers had suggested renewed stockpiling as health restrictions spread through Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in October. A one-month lockdown was announced for England at the end of the month and started on 5 November. Second-hand car prices also rose in October as people tried to reduce their reliance on public transport. However, car prices may stabilise and fall back in the middle of 2021 should a vaccine become widely available, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. One of the largest downward pressures on inflation came from a fall in household energy prices. Gas prices dropped by 12.3% and electricity prices fell 3.2% between September and October. This was mainly due to energy regulator Ofgem's latest six month energy price cap, which came into effect on 1 October, the ONS said. Inflation may have ticked up in October but delve into the figures and you're reminded: it's not the risk of inflation that looms large right now but the opposite. Services are still rising in price but if you take the price of goods there's been no inflation at all in the past year. The price of energy fell - not only this time because of the price cap, but because anti-virus measures have caused a sharp economic contraction worldwide, cutting global demand and pulling down the wholesale price of oil and gas. Where some prices are slowly rising, the national lockdown measures currently in place can only exert further deflationary pressure. There's not a lot the Bank of England can do here to stimulate activity when the battle against Covid is pulling in the other direction. But if we're to avoid deflation, further fiscal measures may be needed to stimulate and repair a stricken economy once mass vaccination is underway.

Pfizer vaccine is '94% effective in over 65s',"The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old. More data released from their continuing phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. The companies say they will now apply for authorisation for emergency use of the jab in the US. The trial involved 41,000 people worldwide. Half were given the vaccine, and half a placebo. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech published preliminary data suggestingthe vaccine offered 90% protection against Covid-19and said there were no safety concerns. This was followed by data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernasuggesting nearly 95% protection andsimilarly promising results from trials of another developed in Russia, called Sputnik. Wednesday's data from Pfizer and BioNTech, which builds on last week's data, suggests the vaccine is 95% effective based on 170 cases of Covid-19 developing in volunteers. Just eight were in the group given the vaccine, suggesting it offers good protection. The rest of the cases were in the placebo group given a dummy jab. In older adults, who are most at risk from the virus and have weaker immune systems, the vaccine worked as well as it did in younger people. Scientists said the data was further encouraging news, with Prof Trudie Lang from the University of Oxford describing it as ""a remarkable and very reassuring situation"". ""To go from identifying a new virus to having several vaccines at the point of applying for regulatory approval is an incredible milestone for science,"" she said. Will there be more than one coronavirus vaccine? Is the vaccine safe to take? And other questions Although the full trial data has yet to be published, the companies say there have been no serious safety concerns. But they did notice fatigue in 3.8%  of volunteers given the vaccine and headaches in 2%, both after the second dose, although older people seemed to experience minimal side effects. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? There is also evidence that the vaccine protects against severe Covid - but this is based on only 10 cases. It's still unclear how long protection from the vaccine lasts and if it stops people transmitting the virus. In the trial, 42% of all participants are from diverse ethnic backgrounds and 41% are aged between 56 and 85 years old. More vaccine good news is what we've all been waiting for. This time it's really encouraging to know the Pfizer vaccine seems to work on older people as effectively as in younger ones. But this vaccine is still a long way off widespread use. First, regulators need to be absolutely sure in their own minds that it's safe - not least because Moderna and Pfizer both use an experimental technology that's never been approved before. That process could still take a few weeks. Then there's the massive issue of availability. Pfizer is promising 50 million doses by the end of the year. But remember: it's a two-shot vaccine. Perhaps one of the biggest problems is that wealthy countries have already swooped in to buy up the first batches that will be ready. That's good news for a country such as the UK, but not such good news for developing countries which haven't got the money to place bids. That's why so much hinges on other vaccines such as the Oxford AstraZeneca one, as they may be more scalable, and there are more advanced plans to get it to low- and middle-income countries through a UN-backed project called Covax. The trial, which is testing people at 150 sites in the US, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina, will collect data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for another two years. The companies behind it expect to produce up to 50 million doses of the vaccine this year and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The UK has pre-ordered 40 million doses and should get 10 million by the end of the year. It has also ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is planning to release data from its phase three trial soon. There are hundreds of vaccines in development around the world, and about a dozen in the final stages of testing, known as phase three. The first two to show any results - made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna - both use an experimental approach, called mRNA, which involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system. Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus. The Sputnik vaccine, developed in Russia, has also released early data from phase three based on a smaller number of volunteers and Covid cases. There are some logistical challenges with mRNA vaccines, namely the need to store them at cold temperatures. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored at about minus 80C, although it can be kept in a fridge for five days. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at minus 20C for up to six months and kept in a standard fridge for up to a month. Prof Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the full data would have to be submitted to bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for approval. ""We can expect both agencies to conduct a very careful evaluation and we can rely on their conclusions,"" he said. This process could take several weeks.

Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priorityThe spending watchdog found Â£10.5bn was spent on pandemic-related contracts awarded without competitive tender.Business,"80% of the contracts were for personal protective equipment Companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority as the government raced to obtain Personal Protective Equipment, the National Audit Office found. Over half of the Â£18bn spent on pandemic-related contracts was awarded without competitive tender, it said. The spending watchdog said the government was not transparent about suppliers and services. It also found there was inadequate explanation of key spending decisions. The findings are part of an NAO investigation into government procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks The watchdog found not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. It found more than 8,600 coronavirus contracts had been awarded by 31 July, ranging in value from less than Â£100 to Â£410m. Of these, Â£10.5bn-worth (58%) were awarded directly without a competitive tender process. Personal protective equipment (PPE) accounted for 80% of the number of contracts awarded. The report comes after the BBC revealed on Tuesday that a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the pandemicwas paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson had been in line for a further $20m of UK public funds, documents filed in a US court reveal. He worked with Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger who set up a business at the start of the pandemic to supply PPE to governments. Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger set up a business to supply PPE to governments Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called for ministers to ""come clean"" and publish all information about the contracts awarded. The government acknowledged it had procured services with ""extreme urgency"" during the crisis but it said it had ""robust processes in place"". When asked about the $28m paid to the Spanish businessman, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Department of Health did look at that contract at the time."" ""At the time there was huge pressure to get PPE into the system and that's what we did,"" he added. The government is keen to note that the National Audit Office found ""no evidence that ministers had been involved in either the award or management of the contracts"" for Â£18bn of pandemic-related contracts. It was under huge pressure to get more PPE immediately and was bidding against governments all over the world. It's even understandable that most of the contracts were awarded without the normal (and time-consuming) competitive tendering process that is there to ensure value for money for taxpayers - and to eliminate the risk that someone gets a lucrative public sector contract not because of what they offer but because of who they know. But as the NAO points out, if you ditch that competitive process, the remaining safeguards - such as properly documenting what you've done to avoid conflicts of interest  - become all the more important. And if you have a process where companies referred by ministers' offices, MPs, peers and health chiefs get 'fast-tracked' - and are therefore ten times as likely to win a contract - there's an even stronger risk that contracts are seen to be awarded not on merit or value for money but because of personal connections. To eliminate that risk, the public accounts committee chair Meg Hillier is calling for all contracts awarded so far to be published. NAO head Gareth Davies said it remained ""essential that decisions are properly documented and made transparent if government is to maintain public trust"". Ms Hillier, a Labour MP, said the failings uncovered may be the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The government overlooked a serious conflict of interest, paid consultants for months before giving them contracts and purchased masks it knew weren't up to scratch. ""It's bad enough that it set up a 'high-priority lane' to fast-track companies with the right connections. ""But the failure to track how half the companies had ended up on it made it impossible to ensure proper safeguards were in place."" The NAO looked in detail at 20 contracts including: A deal with research firm Public First, whose owners had ""previously advised or worked with"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove. Artificial intelligence company Faculty, which was awarded contracts worth almost Â£3m. Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew owned a Â£90,000 stake in the firm but has since relinquished it. Ayanda Capital supplied 50 million masks that could not be used for their original purpose at a cost of Â£155m. The deal was brokered by a businessman who was an adviser to the government's Board of Trade at the time. PestFix, a pest control company, was given contracts worth Â£350m, which included delivery of 600,000 masks which cannot be used for their original purpose. The NAO concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". The spending watchdog acknowledged the pandemic required acting with ""extreme urgency"" and the Public Contracts Regulations allowed an emergency response, including awarding deals directly without a formal competition. Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez said: ""We have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic that has posed the biggest challenge to the UK in a generation. ""As this report rightly recognises, we needed to procure contracts with extreme urgency to secure the vital supplies required to protect frontline NHS workers and the public and we make no apology for that. ""We have robust processes in place for spending public money to ensure we get critical equipment to where it needs to go as quickly as possible, whilst also ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. ""It is important to maintain the public's confidence in how we manage their money, and we welcome the NAO's scrutiny of our processes and recommendations on how they can be improved."" Tom Sasse from the think tank the Institute for Government, told Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money that procurement processes exist to make sure taxpayers get the best value for money. ""The NAO point to some pretty serious problems with how public procurement has happened during the pandemic,"" he said. ""We've also seen a big story in August around Â£150m that went on PPE that couldn't be used. So there are questions about how this process is working.""

Lockdown plus autumn sends loneliness soaringThe numbers feeling lonely in the pandemic reached a new high point at the start of this month.Family & Education,"Adam Isfendiyar's online photo exhibition in the Being Human Festival records how people have coped in lockdown The week after the clocks went back saw Britain's highest levels of acute loneliness in the pandemic, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. The start of November, with darker evenings, saw 8% of adults who were ""always or often lonely"" - representing 4.2 million people. This was the peak in this measure of loneliness since the lockdown in March. Loneliness Minister Baroness Barran says the next few months will be ""incredibly challenging"". An online photo exhibition shows people in East London who faced isolation during the pandemic Figures also show that 5% of adults - representing 2.6 million people - had not left their home for any reason in the previous seven days. Psychologist Vivian Hill says the ""descent into winter"" can be a ""very significant factor"" in how people feel about loneliness, with less daylight and colder weather reducing the opportunity to get outside.

This video can not be played Marjorie Wells, 91, gives her advice on fighting loneliness The research shows that young people are particularly likely to feel cut off - with 16 to 29-year-olds twice as likely as the over-70s to be experiencing loneliness in the pandemic. Elorm Fiavor from Salford, a young carer looking after her mother who is shielding, said there needed to more recognition of the pressures of loneliness on young people. ""It needs to be OK to talk about it,"" says the 16-year-old, who misses being able to go out with friends and socialising and who is helping a charity, Lonely Not Alone, which tackles isolation among the young. ""There's a lot of stigma attached to it. ""There's a great misconception that when people think of loneliness they only think of older people who are living alone."" Elorm says that there is a misconception that loneliness is only a problem for older people Student Jade Low says he has missed partying and socialising in the pandemic - but the challenge is to ""punch through"" and find ways to keep in touch and stay motivated. ""Everyone feels lonely sometimes,"" says the student at Imperial College London - and to keep himself busy he has taught himself to play the ukulele. The figures from the ONS show about one in four people experiencing some form of loneliness at the start of November. Dr Vivian Hill, who is the British Psychological Society's lead on isolation in the pandemic, says loneliness is a serious problem - and could be made more difficult in winter. Staying in touch with neighbours or making a phone call can help to tackle loneliness But she says it is something that can be tackled and people should be optimistic about being able to make connections and reduce loneliness. Baroness Barran says there are new groups facing loneliness in the pandemic - such as those without internet access and those working from home who would usually rely on workplaces for their social lives. The loneliness minister said there was funding for grassroots community projects to help people stay in touch. But she said it was important not to underestimate the impact of things individuals could do - such as ringing someone up, writing a letter or helping a neighbour. ""It's those simple things that make people feel valued,"" she said.

Thanks for joining us. The coronavirus live page writers today were: Mary O'Connor, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset, Max Matza, George Wright, Alice Evans and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented.""

misinformation and conspiracy theories about coronavirus has gone viral on
YouTube and other social networks. Over more than two and a half hours, the film - titled Hold Up - promises to reveal the âtruthâ about the virus. Instead, it pushes a slew of previously debunked claims:
allegations that wearing masks is dangerous, claims that Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates predicted the pandemic, and evidence-free assertions that the crisis
was somehow planned by global elites. The film has already been dubbed by some experts as a French
âPlandemicâ â referring to a similar English-language conspiracy videothat was debunked earlier this year. Like its predecessor, Hold Up is spreading rapidly. In the

Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster.

All prisoners and staff are to be swabbed to detect for Covid-19 at the prison in the next 24-48 hours, says Assange. He adds that all exercise has been stopped, showers have been prohibited and meals are to be provided direct to prisoners in their cells. Assange has been held at Belmarsh Prison for the last year and a half and is awaiting the judgement from a US extradition hearing on 4 January. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We've introduced further safety measures following a number of positive cases.""

After receiving Â£12m ($16m) in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program of the Cares Act, they allegedly used the funds to write cheques to fake employees, including their own family members. One defendant's 86-year-old mother allegedly received at least six different cheques, as well as unemployment benefits, from a company she had never worked for before. âSome fraudsters create the most complicated schemes to steal money from the taxpayer,"" said US Attorney Ryan K Patrick of the Southern District of Texas. ""Just imagine how productive they could be if they put their creativity and effort into noble and useful work.â Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has largely seen the back of
the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a
version of normal. But thatâs not to say life is as
it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was
captured on surveillance footage helping a child whose mask had broken. On-board CCTV captured a
schoolgirl boarding a bus in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, and apologising,
holding her broken mask up when the driver asked why she wasnât wearing one. âLet me give you one,â the man,
surnamed He, is heard saying, and he is shown fitting a new mask on her face
before letting her board. In an unexpected twist, however,
surveillance footage captured the same girl boarding the bus the following day,
asking another driver if she could pass on a thank you present to him. Millions of social media users in the country have seen a picture that the girl drew, with a big heart, saying âthank you mister for helping meâ with a bar of chocolate and a lollipop. âFor the last two days, all Iâve read is bad news, but I feel warm again after seeing this,â one user of Chinaâs Sina Weibo platform says.

About 2,000 police officers were deployed to the parliament, or Bundestag, where thousands of protesters had gathered in anger at the latest coronavirus restrictions. Police fired water cannons to disperse those gathered. Germany is currently under a month-long ""lockdown light"", with restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues closed while schools, shops and workplaces remain open.

You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,â says the 56-year-old unemployed lorry driver from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire of the creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane says he previously could go a fortnight without talking to anyone, in what became a ""vicious circle"". âYou donât want to admit thereâs a problem, and then things just get worse and worse. You give up on everything,â he says. But not any more, thanks to the efforts of a small Huddersfield-based charity project called Platform 1 and the new friends and purpose it has brought.

Kolasinac will now miss Wednesday's Nations League match with Italy. The 27-year-old played the full 90 minutes of Bosnia-Herzegovina's defeat to the Netherlands on Sunday. He is the second Arsenal player to test positive this week, afterEgypt midfielder Mohamed Elneny. It means Kolasinac could now miss Arsenalâs Premier League game at Leeds on Sunday (16:30 GMT) and a Europa League tie in Norway against Molde on 26 November (17:55). Read morehere. Firsat Sofi (R) is seen here distributing face masks in Irbil in June The governor of Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, has died of complications after contracting coronavirus, officials have said. Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000. Figures released by National Records of Scotland showed that the virus had been mentioned on the death certificate of 5,135 people by last Sunday. This included 278 people who had died in the previous week. Scotland recorded itsfirst confirmed coronavirus death- an elderly patient in Lothian with underlying health conditions - on 14 March.

She joins a host of people in the same situation.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolatingafter meeting a Tory MP on Thursday who later tested positive for Covid-19, while today NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen  Powis, also revealed he was self-isolating after someone in his household tested positive. But how does NHS Test and Trace work? If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact.

The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000. Figures released by National Records of Scotland showed that the virus had been mentioned on the death certificate of 5,135 people by last Sunday. This included 278 people who had died in the previous week. Scotland recorded itsfirst confirmed coronavirus death- an elderly patient in Lothian with underlying health conditions - on 14 March.

She joins a host of people in the same situation.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolatingafter meeting a Tory MP on Thursday who later tested positive for Covid-19, while today NHS England's medical director, Prof Stephen  Powis, also revealed he was self-isolating after someone in his household tested positive. But how does NHS Test and Trace work? If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact.

LiveLiveVirtual Prime Minister's Questions6 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson took this week's PMQs by video link The prime minister is self-isolating in Downing Street having come in to contact with a colleague who later tested positive for coronavirus The PM was tested for coronavirus on Monday which came back negative Both the Labour and SNP party leaders challenged the PM on his comments that devolution in Scotland had been a 'disaster' Boris Johnson defended himself saying the SNP's ""campaign for the break up of our country"" had been the disaster Sir Keir Starmer also questioned the PM on government contracts for PPE supplies Mr Johnson said he is ""proud"" of the way the government got PPE supplies at the start of the coronavirus pandemic Earlier, the Labour party leader rejected allowing Jeremy Corbyn to return to the parliamentary Labour party. Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel and Richard Morris As we step away from our live coverage today, we leave you with our favourite story today... This week's Beano comic includes a pull-out section called Bean-OLD, designed to cheer up adults in the midst of the pandemic - with a comic strip featuring Boris Johnson, his outgoing aide Dominic Cummings and some other famous faces from 2020. Our colleague Justin Parkinson was given a sneak preview here.  Our reporters on the live page today were Gavin Stamp, Kate Whannel, and Richard Morris, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Hope you will join us again next week. That's where we'll pause today's coverage of this weeks virtual sitting of PMQs.  But before we go here's a quick recap of the main points: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent There was some scepticism â and curiosity â about how a virtual PMQs would work. Remember this is the first time ever that a prime minister has dialled in remotely to the Commons chamber. The Downing Street wifi did at least hold up but it was certainly not the liveliest of exchanges. However the traditional âbear pitâ atmosphere (than some like and others loathe) has been lacking for a while since they put limits on the number of MPs allowed in the chamber.  Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about the spread of disinformation by anti-vaccination activists and whether social media companies should be doing more to remove them. The prime minister said the government would be responding to the consultation on the âonline harmsâ white paper shortly and will be setting out plans for legislation. News of breakthroughs in coronavirus vaccine development â in recent days â has seen a resurgence in false claims about Covid-19 vaccines â including the baseless conspiracy theory that theyâre part of a secret plan (involving the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates) to implant microchips into humans - so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has beeninvestigating this and other vaccine claims here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked about theNational Audit Office investigationinto the Covid-related contracts the government has been awarding since the start of the pandemic. A lot of them are for PPE â which covers things like masks, goggles and gowns. He said: â70% of PPE is now made in this country or capable of being made in this countryâ This figure is the governmentâs target for December rather than the proportion of PPE manufactured in the UK at the moment. In September, a policy paper published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that UK-based manufacturers are âanticipated to meet 70% of forecasted demand in December for all categories of PPE, excluding glovesâ. (Gloves are excluded as raw materials are not available in the UK.) The target is ambitious, especially because in June,the DHSC said that it was expecting,externalthat only 20% of all PPE will be manufactured in the UK by the end of the year. The figure for the proportion of PPE currently made in the UK is not publicly available at the moment.   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As PMQs ends Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle says he wants to put a ""big thank you"" on record to the staff in parliament's broadcasting unit for ""making today happen"". On his Downing Street video link, the PM calls ""hear hear"". And with that it's over. House of CommonsParliament Asking the final question for this week's session of PMQs, Labour's Bambos Charalambous says black, Asian and minority ethnic people are twice as likely as white people to catch coronavirus. How will the prime minister address ""structural inequalities"" when the vaccine is rolled out, he asks. Boris Johnson replies that the government is ""thinking about this issue right now."" He adds that it has brought forward ""enhanced testing procedures for vulnerable groups"". House of CommonsParliament Scottish Conservatives are out in force today following the row earlier this week over the PM's views on devolution. Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, presses the PM to throw his weight behind growth deals in Scotland. And John Lamont urges the PM to do all he can to resolve a trade dispute between the US and EU which he says is doing serious harm to exports such as such as whisky and cashmere which are being ""hammered"" by tariffs. The PM says the issue continues to be of grave concern and he is raising it with the US on a regular basis to try and get a settlement as soon as possible.  House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Christopher Chope calls for all people who have tested positive for Covid in the past six months and recovered to be exempt from current restrictions, citing research suggesting they have high levels of T-Cell immunity. He says this would show the PM was ""following the science as well as common sense"". The PM thanks the MP for the suggestion but says the evidence points both ways and everyone should continue to self-isolate whatever their historical position. Labour's Chi Onwurah asked the PM about child poverty and calls on the PM to reverse planned cuts to Universal Credit. Mr Johnson says the government wants to tackle child poverty and support people into work. He says 400,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. House of CommonsParliament ""It is extremely concerning that one in five people say they won't take the new vaccine,"" says Conservative Damian Collins. He asks if social media companies should do more to tackle anti-vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories. Boris Johnson says he welcomes Facebook and Google's decision that no company should profit from vaccine disinformation. The government will be setting out plans for legislation on disinformation shortly, he adds. House of CommonsParliament We now have an audio only question from the Independent MP Margaret Ferrier. She was kicked out of the SNP, after travelling to Westminster despite experiencing Covid symptoms. She uses her question to ask about a constituent who applied to the EU resettlement scheme for her and her son in September 2019, but is still waiting for a decision The EU Settlement Scheme allows EU citizens to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021. Boris Johnson says the case is under urgent review and that a decision will be made shortly. Tory Mark Pawsey suggests it is unfair for big supermarkets to be able to continue to sell items like clothing and homeware while specialist retailers are shut during the lockdown. He suggests it would be a good idea for big retailers to help smaller retailers with their tax bills. The PM agrees that there should be a fair playing field. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Graham Brady says ""tens of thousands of jobs have already been lost in aviation and hundreds of thousands hang in the balance"". He ask the prime minister to ensure a testing regime can be implemented to replace the current quarantine arrangements when England comes out of current lockdown restrictions. Boris Johnson said his government is ""working hard to ensure we can replace the quarantine regulations for every category of self isolation"". ""I certainly want to help the airlines,"" he adds. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The SNPâs Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked the PM about devolution. The party has â and will continue â to say that Boris Johnsonâs devolution âdisasterâ remarks reveal what the Prime Minister really thinks. In response, the PM talks about the âbillions and billionsâ of pounds used to help support the economy, across the UK, during the pandemic. And a central part of the case the government makes about the union is what they say is the unmatched âmightâ of the Treasury. That may be an argument of the head, but unionists are also under pressure to come up with an argument that appeals to the heart as well. House of CommonsParliament Ian Blackford hits back, saying the PM's comments earlier this week - when he described Scottish devolution as a disaster, were not a ""slip of the tongue but a slip of the Tory mask"". He says the only way the Scottish people can truly prosper is through taking destiny into their own hands through independence. The PM points out that Scotland voted no to independence in 2014 and ""will almost certainly"" do so again if there is another vote. He goes on to praise the role of the union during the pandemic, including the role of the armed forces and furlough. ""The union has shown its value and will continue to do so."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Trump fires election official who contradicted himChris Krebs reportedly angered Trump by running a website debunking election misinformation.,"Chris Krebs was a Trump appointee Donald Trump says he has fired a top election official who contradicted the US president's claims of voter fraud. President Trump said he ""terminated"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) chief Chris Krebs for his ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on vote integrity. Mr Trump has refused to concede the US election, and has made unsubstantiated claims of ""massive"" voter fraud. Election officials said the vote was the ""most secure"" in US history. Mr Krebs is the latest official to be dismissed by the US president following his defeat, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper also shown the door amid reports Mr Trump doubted the Pentagon chief's loyalty. There is speculation in Washington DC that before Mr Trump leaves office in January, CIA director Gina Haspel and FBI director Christopher Wray could also be for the chopping block. Refuting Trump cost cyber-security official his job No, voting machines didn't delete millions of Trump ballots Obama: One election won't stop US 'truth decay' Why US spy world is feeling so uneasy right now Like many others fired by Mr Trump, Mr Krebs reportedly only learned he was out of a job when he saw the president's tweet on Tuesday. But following his dismissal, the former Microsoft executive appeared to have no regrets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He had run the agency from its inception two years ago in the aftermath of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. To guard against potential cyber-threats, Cisa works with state and local election officials and the private companies that supply voting systems, while monitoring ballot tabulation and the power grid. He had reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over aCisa website called Rumor Control,external, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Hours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Mr Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Mr Biden. Mr Krebs tweeted: ""On allegations that election systems were manipulated, 59 election security experts all agree, 'in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.' #Protect2020"". This post, and others by Mr Krebs dating back to the end of July this year, appear to have been deleted from his Twitter account. He was among senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security who last week declared the 3 November US general election the ""most secure in American history"", while rejecting ""unfounded claims"". Though that statement did not name Mr Trump, on the same day it was published Mr Krebs retweeted a Twitter post by an election law expert saying: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Mr Krebs' dismissal brought outrage from Democrats. A spokesman for President-elect Joe Biden said ""Chris Krebs should be commended for his service in protecting our elections, not fired for telling the truth"". Mr Krebs' firing was the latest - and not necessarily the last - chapter in the long battle between President Trump and his own national security community. At issue from the start has been the legitimacy of both election campaigns he has fought in. His presidency began with him lashing out at his own spies for their assessment that Russia interfered in 2016 to support his candidacy. That began a long tussle in which the president almost appeared to see a zero-sum battle; one in which he sought to undermine the credibility of his own spies to avoid any question being raised about his victory. The tension has ebbed and flowed, with some officials sacked and others walking a fine line to try to protect themselves and their own institutions. But the 2020 election result has led it to explode again. In 2016, Mr Trump was angry at claims there had been election interference. This time his anger is at the refusal of those like Chris Krebs to back up his claims that there was. Mr Krebs is gone and with an uncertain, uneasy transition ahead, he may not be the last. Read the full analysis Mr Trump's campaign and its allies have filed a barrage of lawsuits in battleground states contesting the results, although election officials say no evidence of widespread irregularities has been found. Time is running out. All outstanding election disputes nationwide must be resolved by 8 December. The official results are set to be confirmed when the US Electoral College meets on 14 December. On Tuesday, Republican members of a bipartisan election board in Michigan refused to certify Mr Biden's projected win in that state, only to back down after an outcry. The two Republicans on the four-member board had objected to minor voting irregularities in Wayne County, home to Detroit. But they relented after Democrats accused them of trying to disenfranchise voters in the majority-black city. As a compromise, the board passed a resolution requesting that Michigan's Democratic secretary of state conduct an audit of the jurisdictions involved. This video can not be played Barack Obama tells the BBC about the ""crazy conspiracies"" and ""truth decay"" in US politics Meanwhile, election officials conducting a by-hand recount in Georgia - where a fraction of a percent separates the two rivals - found more uncounted ballots for the second time this week. Almost 2,800 previously untallied ballots were discovered on Tuesday in Fayette County, a day after 2,600 uncounted votes turned up in Floyd County. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system manager, blamed human error. The discoveries are expected to shave Mr Biden's lead in the state to under 13,000, not enough to flip Georgia into Mr Trump's column. There was another setback for Mr Trump on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, where the state supreme court rejected his campaign's argument that its observers had been denied sufficient rights to watch ballot counts in Philadelphia. Also on Tuesday, the Trump campaign, along with Nevada's Republican party, filed another lawsuit challenging that state's election results. Mr Biden is the projected victor in Nevada, but the latest legal action asked a judge to declare Mr Trump the winner, or annul the race altogether. Judges have rejected other Trump campaign lawsuits disputing the tally in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, after ruling there was no evidence to support claims of systemic fraud. What happens now?

Lockdown plus autumn sends loneliness soaring,"Adam Isfendiyar's online photo exhibition in the Being Human Festival records how people have coped in lockdown The week after the clocks went back saw Britain's highest levels of acute loneliness in the pandemic, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. The start of November, with darker evenings, saw 8% of adults who were ""always or often lonely"" - representing 4.2 million people. This was the peak in this measure of loneliness since the lockdown in March. Loneliness Minister Baroness Barran says the next few months will be ""incredibly challenging"". An online photo exhibition shows people in East London who faced isolation during the pandemic Figures also show that 5% of adults - representing 2.6 million people - had not left their home for any reason in the previous seven days. Psychologist Vivian Hill says the ""descent into winter"" can be a ""very significant factor"" in how people feel about loneliness, with less daylight and colder weather reducing the opportunity to get outside. Beating loneliness Millions of people, young and old, are facing loneliness, isolation and separation during the lockdown. A BBC News project, on TV, radio and online, reveals some of their stories and how they are fighting back.

But in the week up to 1 November the measure of more acute loneliness - those ""always or often"" lonely - reached 8%, the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic, and representing 4.2 million people. Pre-pandemic surveys showed about 5% of adults ""always or often"" lonely - or about 2.6 million people. This video can not be played Marjorie Wells, 91, gives her advice on fighting loneliness The research shows that young people are particularly likely to feel cut off - with 16 to 29-year-olds twice as likely as the over-70s to be experiencing loneliness in the pandemic. Elorm Fiavor from Salford, a young carer looking after her mother who is shielding, said there needed to more recognition of the pressures of loneliness on young people. ""It needs to be OK to talk about it,"" says the 16-year-old, who misses being able to go out with friends and socialising and who is helping a charity, Lonely Not Alone, which tackles isolation among the young. ""There's a lot of stigma attached to it. ""There's a great misconception that when people think of loneliness they only think of older people who are living alone."" Elorm says that there is a misconception that loneliness is only a problem for older people Student Jade Low says he has missed partying and socialising in the pandemic - but the challenge is to ""punch through"" and find ways to keep in touch and stay motivated. ""Everyone feels lonely sometimes,"" says the student at Imperial College London - and to keep himself busy he has taught himself to play the ukulele. The figures from the ONS show about one in four people experiencing some form of loneliness at the start of November. Dr Vivian Hill, who is the British Psychological Society's lead on isolation in the pandemic, says loneliness is a serious problem - and could be made more difficult in winter. Staying in touch with neighbours or making a phone call can help to tackle loneliness But she says it is something that can be tackled and people should be optimistic about being able to make connections and reduce loneliness. Baroness Barran says there are new groups facing loneliness in the pandemic - such as those without internet access and those working from home who would usually rely on workplaces for their social lives. The loneliness minister said there was funding for grassroots community projects to help people stay in touch. But she said it was important not to underestimate the impact of things individuals could do - such as ringing someone up, writing a letter or helping a neighbour. ""It's those simple things that make people feel valued,"" she said.

Doctors spell out how to exit England's lockdown,"Lifting lockdown must be handled better this time round to avoid a surge in Covid that could overwhelm the NHS, doctors say. The British Medical Association has published a blueprint for how it thinks England should proceed with any easing. It includes replacing the ""rule of six"" with a two-households restriction to reduce social mixing and banning travel between different local lockdown tiers. Government has yet to say if or exactly how England will exit on 2 December. It will decide next week, based on whether cases have fallen enough and how much strain hospitals are under. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said ministers want to see a ""significant easing"" of coronavirus controls. But Public Health England medical director and NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser Susan Hopkins said the government would have to look at""strengthening"" the three-tier system introduced in October. And now, the BMA, a trade union for UK doctors, has said robust measures to keep the virus under control must be in place before lockdown ends, including: giving local public health teams more of the oversight and budget of Test and Trace to ensure it is fit for purpose replacing the rule of six, which allowed up to six people from different households to meet with a two-households rule to reduce social mixing banning travel between different local lockdown tiers replacing guidance with rules to ensure workplaces and public areas such as shops and pubs are Covid-secure continuing to encourage people who can to work from home BMA chair of council Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the government must learn from mistakes from the ending of the first lockdown - rapid relaxation and inadequate monitoring, while people had been encouraged to go to the pub and dine out. ""It is unthinkable that we make the same mistakes again,"" he said, ""because this time, the impact will be far worse."" Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the original lockdown in March, has said reopening pubs and restaurants in the run-up to Christmas would likely lead to rising infection levels. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""The big question in practical terms is can we reopen hospitality venues - pubs and restaurants - in the run-up to Christmas and still avoid infection levels increasing? ""I suspect we can't, but the decision may be made to do so anyhow on the basis that any increase will be slow and may be able to be counteracted later."" THREE TIERS:How will the system work? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The NHS was preparing to roll out Covid vaccinations should a jab become available soon, the BMA said. But such a mass immunisation programme must be properly resourced and funded by government. And all of that groundwork should be done now, rather than later. The Department of Health and Social Care said it has invested over Â£230m into manufacturing any successful vaccine and there had been ""an enormous amount of planning and preparation"" for distributing it to the people who needed it. A spokesman said: ""As we've set out, we will seek to ease restrictions on Wednesday 2 December, going back into a tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. ""Guidance on infection control measures such as returning to work, social distancing and household mixing are constantly under review to ensure we can visit loved ones and support the economy whilst controlling the spread of the virus.""

Here's a reminder of the main points:  Thank you for joining us - until our next live blog you can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good afternoon. Wednesday's report of 41 more deaths related to coronavirus has taken the total to 2,284. Cmw Taf Health Board in south Wales has recorded the highest number overall, at 625. This video can not be played Scientific advisers to the UK government say they hope it will be possible for coronavirus restrictions in England to be relaxed over the Christmas period. The BBC's Hugh Pym asked whether household mixing would be possible and Dr Susan Hopkins said it would require work from everyone in the next few weeks to bring the R number down as low as possible. Both Dr Hopkins and Angela McClean insisted it's a decision only the government can make. The four UK governments have been holding talks with the aim of agreeing a common set of rules on travel and gatherings over the Christmas period. There have been 41 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total number to 2,284, Public Health Wales has reported. There were also a further 640 cases reported, meaning there have now been 68,449 confirmed cases in Wales. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked at Prime Minister's Questions about the spread of disinformation by anti-vaccination activists and whether social media companies should be doing more to remove them. He said the UK government would be responding to the consultation on the ""online harms"" White Paper shortly and will be setting out plans for legislation. News of breakthroughs in coronavirus vaccine development in recent days has prompted a resurgence in false claims about Covid-19 vaccines. These include the baseless conspiracy theory that theyâre part of a secret plan (involving the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates) to implant microchips into humans so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has beeninvestigating this and other vaccine claims here. Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd (MS) Delyth Jewell saidmass testingwould be an ""important first step"" in tackling the spread of Covid-19 but as more cases are identified ""there needs to be additional support to enable people to stay at home safely"". ""Areas such as Merthyr Tydfil, which have had persistently high infection rates for two months, have long been in need of additional support,"" she said. âThis is why Plaid Cymru is calling for such areas to be designated Covid Special Support Areas, for self-isolation payments in these areas to be topped up to Â£800 and for local authorities to receive the extra support they need to help keep people safe. ""With lateral flow tests providing results in 20-30 minutes, this extra support needs to be in place the minute testing begins on Saturday. ""People living in our communities need to receive care, not just a diagnosis.â Dr Giri Shankar, coronavirus incident director for Public Health Wales, has told BBC Wales he is not aware of any definite plan for a post-Christmas lockdown. He said: ""Iâm not aware of any such plan for the firebreaks. ""What we
can say is that if there is an uncontrolled spread of the virus and if there is
a further increase in cases and that leads to inevitably higher
hospitalisations and a proportion of those translate to deaths, then it is
inevitable at some point that we will have to consider further additional restrictions
if the current ones are not enough to keep the virus in check."" The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTechappears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old. More data released from their ongoing phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages, races and ethnicities. The companies say they will now apply for authorisation for emergency use of the jab in the US. The findings are based on two doses given to more than 41,000 people around the world. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech published preliminary data showingthe vaccine offered 90% protection against Covid-19and there were no safety concerns. This was followed by impressive data on another vaccine, made byUS company Moderna, suggesting nearly 95% protection. Mass community testing for coronavirus in Merthyr Tydfil
could be a model expanded to other areas and to specific healthcare settings. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said the trial would mean health officials would be able to get a much quicker picture of where the virus was spreading. He said: âIf we are able to start deploying this kind of
approach and technology, this really starts to change the nature of system, to
be able to rely on a more routine cycle of testing within our communities. âSome of these devices will actually be able to
be rolled out within other settings as well, possibly into other healthcare
settings for example, again to allow for rapid turnaround of testing as well.â People self-isolating in Covid hotspots should be given a ""topped-up"" grant of Â£800,Plaid Cymru has said. It wants a package of extra support for ex-industrial areas with high infection rates, such as Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent and Rhondda Cynon Taf. These areas, the party said, should be prioritised for mass testing, with more resources for test and trace teams. Ministers said they had put national support measures in place and provided an extra Â£15.7m for contact tracing. Anyone in Wales isable to claim Â£500if they have to stay off work due to coronavirus. Plaid Cymru will raise the need for ""Covid Special Support Areas"" in a Senedd debate on Wednesday, saying research from the north of England suggests post-industrial communities may be disproportionately affected by the virus. Rhondda Cynon Taf has one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in Wales The leader of Merthyr Tydfil council, Kevin O'Neill, said confirmation of mass testing of people for Covid-19 was a ""real opportunity to lead the way"". The Welsh Government has confirmed the county as the first in Wales to undergo such a measure, with testing to begin on Saturday. ""We want those people [who are] asymptomatic - those who don't know they have the disease - to come and get tested,"" Mr O'Neill told BBC Wales. He added that people seeing someone they know die is ""hitting home"" and had led to a ""huge improvement"" in people following the rules. ""You can see that in the hard work people have put in for the firebreak and the numbers have come down significantly,"" Mr O'Neill said. ""We are encouraging everyone to come and get tested, allow us to find where this disease is hiding so we can break it down but also so we can get a model that other places can work from. ""We need to be successful so the whole country can be successful."" Kevin O'Neill said the firebreak lockdown had resulted in the rate of infections falling NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall would not be drawn on whether there should be a further Covid firebreak after Christmas. However he has urged people over the festive period to âlimit their social interactionsâ and âmeet other people on a limited basisâ. Dr Goodall said earlier that any further lockdowns would be a matter for the first minister and cabinet to decide. The roll out of a Covid-19 vaccine will be âthe most significant logistic exercise that we will have undertaken under any vaccination programmeâ, according to the boss of the Welsh NHS. Dr Andrew Goodall said any vaccination programme was likely to continue âwell into the spring, and therefore it's really important that we do start with those who are most vulnerable in our societyâ. Speaking to reporters, Dr Goodall explained every health board in Wales was âworking on proposals that will support whatever version of vaccines come through the regulatory processâ. He said the Welsh Blood Service may be asked to provide âspecialist supportâ with storing any vaccine that may need to be kept in certain conditions. âThe opportunity to protect our population, particularly the most vulnerable, allows us to feel that this would really change the nature of our response in Wales, but it will also take us perhaps longer than people want and expect,â Dr Goodall added. A decision on whether or not the Welsh Government will introduce a further ""firebreak"" lockdown shortly after Christmas will be âa matter for the first minister and the Cabinetâ, the head of NHS Wales has said. Dr Andrew Goodall said there had been âencouraging signs that the firebreak has had some influence on our systemâ, with regards to reducing the number of coronavirus cases in the community. He went on to say that early data appeared to show the reproduction rate of Covid-19 had decreased as a result of the 17-day lockdown. âThere are some emerging signs maybe of some stabilisation, in terms of some of the pressures in the hospital side of the system,â Dr Goodall said. âWe currently assess that the reproduction rate is between 0.9 and 1.2, but itâs quite possible that we may see that reduce further as a reflection of the firebreak.â Dr Goodall suggested that was an encouraging sign that similar measures would have an impact, but stopped short of saying that a single lockdown would be enough to keep transmission levels low across the winter. âThey will reinforce that we know that things can make a difference,â he said. âThere will be an evaluation of the data, we will see whether that will be sufficient to manage through, but ultimately that will revert to the ministerial reflections and considerations.â House of CommonsParliament PM Boris Johnson has defended the UK government against Labour accusations of a lack of transparency over the awarding of contracts, particularly for personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer quoteda report by the public spending watchdogwhich said suppliers with political connections were ten times more likely than others to get contracts. ""Can the PM give a cast-iron assurance that from now on all government contracts will be subject to proper process,"" Sir Keir asked. Mr Johnson said all government contracts would be published. However, he added: ""I think it is extraordinary he attacks the government for securing PPE in full quantities. ""At the time he bashed the government for not moving fast enough, now absolutely absurdly Captain Hindsight is trying to score political points by attacking the government for moving too fast. ""I am proud of securing PPE supplies and any government would have done the same."" Boris Johnson took Prime Minister's Questions via video conference as he is self-isolating Testing for Merthyr was announced on Wednesday morning Merthyr Tydfil was an ""obvious choice"" for mass testing, given the recent high level of coronavirus infections in the area, according to the boss of the NHS in Wales. Dr Andrew Goodall said the Welsh Government was ""appealing to the population"" in the county ""to support us in this initiative to undertake that more repeated testing, whether they have symptoms or not"". ""Hopefully that will allow us to make sure that we can demonstrate for this population that there is a way again of having some control and containment of the outbreak of the virus,"" he said. Dr Goodall added that the mass testing ""is also offering a template for how we may want to introduce other local support and interventions across Wales, whatever our national actions are"". This video can not be played When is the vaccine for Covid-19 going to be available? This is the question everyone wants the answer to. In November, both the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccine were found to be more than 90% effective. The latest results of the Oxford vaccine are expected later this month. Without a cure or definitive treatment, a vaccine is seen as a key way to get life back to normal. Scientists only started their research at the beginning of the year and have been working quickly to develop and test vaccines. So when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Who would get it first? BBC health correspondent Laura Foster looks at the situation. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says there has been a big drop in the number of people attending outpatient clinics. âOutpatient services, where we would normally see three million people â equivalent to the population of Wales â every year, have also been affected by the pandemic."" he said. Clinics were seeing around two-thirds fewer people to ensure they comply with social-distancing requirements, Dr Goodall added. âTo complete the cleaning regimes needed between each appointment, these are scheduled for 30 minutes, instead of 15 minutes, to manage infection risk. âBut there are some areas â like ENT [ear, nose and throat] and maxillofacial â where the risk is higher, and an extended wait between appointments is needed."" He said more âvirtualâ consultations were being done but waiting lists were increasing. âUnfortunately, we will see further increases to these waiting times as we continue to respond to coronavirus during this public health emergency."" The head of the NHS in Wales says nearly half of the people admitted to hospital with Covid-19 will be there for more than a week. Dr Andrew Goodall said a quarter would be in hospital for at least 21 days or more. ""Some will need even more time â and expert care â to recover properly,"" he told the press briefing. ""This has a knock-on effect on available bed capacityâ. Dr Goodall said he was concerned about the impact of the demands and pressures on the NHS. âThe NHS remains open for essential and emergency services and also for routine care. âBut with high levels of coronavirus infection in our communities and high levels of people with coronavirus in hospitals, services will find it increasingly difficult to operate normally."" There are 18 hospitals on the two highest levels of escalation in Wales, meaning they are under a lot of pressure from patient numbers and care demands. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said the health service was ""continuing
      to balance winter and emergency pressures with the demands of looking
      after people who are seriously ill with coronavirus"". He added: ""The number of people
admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms has continued to rise. ""There
     are some signs hospital admissions are stabilising but this is not
     sufficient to overcome current pressures."" There are 1,654 Covid-related patients in hospital, a rise of 8% on last week. Of those, 62 are in critical care, which is lower than a week ago. Normal critical care capacity of 152 beds has been exceeded, with 157 people needing care. Dr Goodall said there were plans to expand capacity if required. Â© 2025 BBC.

Starmer urged not to restore whip to Corbyn,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is being urged not to let Jeremy Corbyn return to the parliamentary party. It comes after the party readmitted the ex-leader as a member, following his suspension for suggesting political opponents had dramatically overstated the scale of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn issued a statement saying he regretted any ""pain"" caused. Sir Keir is coming under pressure from groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews to take further action. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a decision had not yet been taken on whether to restore the Labour whip to Mr Corbyn, which would allow him to sit once more as one of its MPs. Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour? A panel of five members of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee decided to readmit Mr Corbyn after he had clarified the comments which had led to his suspension, stating that he had not belittled concerns about anti-Semitism. His remarks had been made in response to a damning Equalities and Human Rights Commission report. The former leader's critics have said his case should not have been heard until the party had set up an entirely independent complaints process - as recommended by the human rights watchdog. Following the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir tweeted that it had been a ""painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle anti-Semitism"". He said Mr Corbyn's remarks were ""wrong and completely distracted from a report that identified unlawful conduct in our tackling of racism within the Labour Party"". Sir Keir said he stood by the commitments he made after the report, adding: ""That must mean establishing an independent complaints process as soon as possible in the new year."" He is coming under pressure privately from some of his own MPs - and publicly from the Board of Deputies of British Jews - to take further action. Former Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman, who quit the party over anti-Semitism concerns last year, said the decision was a ""backward step"". ""What Keir Starmer and the chief whip should do now is to refuse to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn, in that way they can show that they are determined, as they have said they are, to rid the party of this dreadful stain,"" she told BBC Newsnight. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says he has been told that at least one Jewish MP is considering resigning if Mr Corbyn is welcomed back at Westminster. Jeremy Corbyn has been readmitted as a Labour party member, but it is not, according to Keir Starmer's team, automatic that he would also be allowed to sit once more as a Labour MP. That is the decision Sir Keir has been trying to make overnight and he is expected to make it this morning. He is going to have to make that decision before Prime Minister's Questions at noon because that is an absolute political gift for the prime minister - who himself has had an absolutely shocking political week. If Sir Keir refuses to allow Mr Corbyn back on the backbenches that would provoke another pretty grim skirmish with those in Mr Corbyn's tribe on the left of the party. But if you allow him to sit again as a Labour MP then you punch the bruise of the Jewish community and infuriate many Labour MPs. Sir Keir was adamant he would not interfere in the process of whether or not Jeremy Corbyn would be allowed back in as a party member. But it was suggested to me he has found himself, from a political point of view, trapped by the process. He was so eager not to interfere, but has now been landed with this other political grenade. In a statement earlier on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who is currently an independent MP - said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and that he regretted the ""pain"" caused. His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" It is not yet clear whether Mr Corbyn will face further sanctions from the party. Its general secretary, David Evans, took the decision to suspend him in October, although Sir Keir endorsed it. The ECHR's report found Labour had breached the Equalities Act over its handling of complaints of anti-Semitism during Mr Corbyn's time in charge. Labour said Mr Corbyn had been suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Following his readmission, the Islington North MP said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government."" But President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews Marie Van Der Zyl described the decision as ""an absolute sham"" and said Mr Corbyn's reinstatement had been ""rushed through and judged by a politicised panel stuffed with his own supporters"". The Jewish Labour Movement called the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn ""extraordinary"", adding: ""After his failure of leadership to tackle anti-Semitism, so clearly set out in the EHRC's report, any reasonable and fair-minded observer would see Jeremy Corbyn's statement today as insincere and wholly inadequate."" Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""What message does this send? Zero tolerance either means zero tolerance or it's meaningless."" The co-chairman of the Conservative Party, MP Amanda Milling, has written to Sir Keir, saying: ""You have claimed that Labour is 'under new leadership', but now is the moment to prove it - Mr Corbyn should be expelled permanently."" However, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Mr Corbyn, called the reinstatement a ""correct, fair and unifying decision"". He said Labour had to ""move forward"" in implementing the EHRC's recommendations and ""redouble our efforts to inspire voters"" about Sir Keir's policies, acting as a ""unified and strong"" party. James Schneider, former director of strategic communications for the ex-Labour leader, argued that Mr Corbyn hadn't said anything that was ""either factually or morally wrong and was not anti-Semitic and did not breach any party rules"". Jenny Manson, co-chairman of pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour, told BBC Newsnight that ""an awful lot of us are very happy he (Mr Corbyn) is back in the party"" and would be ""very sad indeed"" if the whip is taken away from him.

Ban on care home visits 'traumatising relatives',"This video can not be played Sandra Lazarus says she was denied seeing husband before his death due to Covid-19 rules The trauma of not being able to visit relatives in care homes will stay with people ""for years"", the older people's commissioner for Wales has said. Her calls come after the family of John Lazarus, 83, said they were not allowed to be with him before his death, which was not related to Covid-19. Mr Lazarus died last month at Glanffrwd Care Home in Bridgend. The owner, HC-One, said a visit was not allowed as he was not considered to be at the end of his life. Mr Lazarus's wife of 59 years, Sandra, said she knew her husband did not have long to live but not being able to say goodbye made the situation much worse. ""I can't turn back the clock. I can't say, can we have a re-run and let me see him. He's gone now. I missed the boat. I just wanted to tell him we loved him."" John Lazarus, pictured with daughter Claire, was a much-loved husband and father The father-of-three, who served with South Wales Police for 30 years, had Alzheimer's disease. Mrs Lazarus said it ""broke her heart"" when he had to move into the care home at the end of 2019. Before the outbreak of Covid-19, she visited every afternoon and they would have a cup of tea and a ""tot of whisky and Coke"" and watch a film. Visits were cancelled in March, outdoor visits were then permitted in the summer, but in September Bridgend was put under local restrictions. Under Welsh Government policy, end-of-life visits are still allowed regardless of any local restrictions or national lockdown. The Lazarus family said they had been allowed to look through the window at him, but it was difficult as he was deaf and would get distressed and beckon his wife and other family members to come in. ""He'd say 'I don't care about the virus. I just want you in here now',"" said his daughter Claire Jones. John Lazarus with son Mark, daughter Claire, wife Sandra and son Nigel before the pandemic Mrs Lazarus said her husband had stopped eating and drinking and they would drive up past the window to see how he was because they knew his condition was deteriorating. ""I think in his mind he had nothing to live for now,"" she said. ""I'd been with John since I was 17 and we'd always been together, we've done everything together."" On their wedding anniversary a carer held the phone for him. ""He said to me 'I love you'. He said it three times, I'll never forget it. Those were the last words I heard from my husband."" On 19 October, Mr Lazarus was rushed into hospital with a temperature and returned to the home in the middle of the night. Two hours later his family received a call from the home to say he had died. ""I hope he didn't think that we didn't love him and we just left him there and forgot about him,"" Mrs Lazarus said, ""because we didn't and we never will."" Former police officer John Lazarus was a ""proud man"" say his family His wife and daughter were allowed into the home, wearing full PPE, after he died. ""It was horrendous,"" Ms Jones said. ""Giving your dead parent a kiss in PPE with visors is beyond. It's overwhelming."" She said people were being ""kept safe to the detriment of their health"" by not having visitors. She wants rapid testing to be available for relatives so they can care for their loved ones during the final moments of their lives. Mrs Lazarus added: ""They say you can come in at the end of life, but when is 'end of life'? None of us know."" She wants care homes to ""look at this and say 'this person's really not going to last long... they need to be with their families now, not wait until their last breath"". The older people's commissioner Helena Herklots is urging care homes to allow visits for residents, particularly those who are at the end of their lives. ""We know that this can be done safely because care homes are doing it,"" she said. ""So I would urge those that for whatever reason decided they can't to think again."" John Lazarus died in October in his care home in Bridgend A spokesperson for HC-One said that Mr Lazarus was not considered to be at the end of his life, meaning they applied local visiting restrictions from mid-September. ""We would like to express our deepest condolences for the sad passing of Mr Lazarus, who will be dearly missed by those who knew him."" They said that in October they had planned safe weekly window visits for the family, but Mr Lazarus died shortly afterwards. HC-One said it recognised how difficult it was for families to be apart from loved ones and said it had ""done everything we can to keep them connected"". ""We have had to make difficult decisions to ensure a balanced approach is in place that enables residents to spend more time with their loved ones, whilst also ensuring we do everything possible to prevent coronavirus entering our homes.""

Why carbon-free future will need rules,"A 10-point plan aimed at putting the UK on track for a zero emissions economy is due to be unveiled by the prime minister in the coming weeks. Boris Johnson's previous speeches on climate change have given the impressionthe problem can largely be solved by technology- a flash of nuclear, a gust of hydrogen, a blast of offshore wind, a dollop of carbon capture and storage. But a government spokesperson told BBC News we'll all need to ""work together and play our part"". And experts warn the issue's phenomenally complicated - presenting challenges never seen before. Tackling climate change, they say, will need action right across society and the economy - with a host of new incentives, laws, rules, bans, appliance standards, taxes and institutional innovations. Let's examine a few of the issues... Few of the UK's challenges are as complex or weirdly wonderful as the future electricity system, in which millions of generators and users of power will trade with each other via the internet. Already hundreds of thousands of sites are generating energy - from householders with a single rooftop solar panel to mighty Drax power station, in North Yorkshire, with its controversial wood-burners, to giant wind farms floating at sea. It's a far cry from the 1990s when power was delivered on a simple grid dominated by a few dozen coal-fired plants In the coming years, millions of people will want to sell the power they're generating on their roofs. We'll need extra electricity because cars will run on batteries, and homes will be heated by heat pumps (which run like fridges in reverse to suck out warmth from the soil or the air). They don't pollute, unlike gas boilers. But that's not the end of the story. Yes, electric cars will increase demand - but they'll also increase energy storage. Smart car batteries will be programmed to charge themselves when electricity's cheapest, in the middle of the night. The cars can then store the power and sell it back to the grid at a profit when it's needed, at tea time. In other words,owning a car might actually make you money. And here's another chunk of weirdness. Smart washing machines can already turn themselves on to take advantage of cheap, off-peak electricity. You'll save even more money by allowing an invisible hand to briefly switch off your well-insulated smart freezer to save power at a time of peak demand. That'll help save your energy firm generating more electricity, so you'll get paid a little for it.It's called Demand Management. But how will these millions of generators, users, avoiders and storers of power manage to trade with each other? How will electricity systems cope with this level of brain-shredding complexity? Guy Newey from the think tank Energy Systems Catapult, warns: ""There are immense opportunities in our energy future. ""But thinking through the unbelievable complexity is a really tough challenge - and it's not clear that anyone or any organisation in the UK has the responsibility of doing that."" One thing that's crystal clear is that the UK's carbon-free future will need rules. EU standards on appliances like fridges and vacuum cleaners are an unsung energy success story. They oblige manufacturers to make goods that do a task with less energy. It means that although the price of electricity has gone up, consumer bills have fallen, because they're using less. Libby Peake, from the think-tank Green Alliance, said: ""Product standards have slashed the UK's carbon footprint, and saved the average household at least Â£100 a year on their energy bills."" But she warns that shoddy products are slipping on to the market because there aren't enough trading standards officers to enforce the rules. She says things will get worse for people shopping online during lockdown becausethe majority of relevant products online are labelled poorly,external- or not at all. Stricter standards are also needed for new homes. The previous Labour government mandated that all new houses should be zero carbon from 2016. The Conservatives pushed back the date to 2025, but they're under pressure to advance it again - a decision may be announced soon. Many architects also want the UK to follow France and stipulate that 50% of the fabric of new government buildings should be timber - to lock up carbon emissions in the wood. And cars will face new rules too: the proposed ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars will be brought forward to the start of the 2030s - eventually heralding the end of the internal combustion engine. Finance is another area requiring attention. According to Vivid Economics, the government Export Credit Agency - which underwrites British-funded projects abroad - is investing Â£2bn in oil and gas ventures. The Climate Coalition of green groups says this doesn't fit UK priorities. Meanwhile, the UK private finance sector is one of the world's biggest funders of fossil fuels. The former Bank of England head Mark Carney has urged financiers to disclose their assets in dirty industries because they present a business risk in a low-carbon world. The Climate Coalition wants bankers to take a further step to actively shed polluting firms from their portfolios. Kate Levick from the think tank e3g told me: ""There's a real urgency about this. Finance firms are financing projects today that will be contributing to emissions in 30 years' time."" She's calling on the government to legislate to make the transition happen. The coalition also wants the Treasury to set out a climate finance plan to show how ministers will finance the net-zero transition in the UK. While we're talking about money, the government is being urged to reconsider its priorities for expensive infrastructure projects. Some environmentalists argue that given all the concrete needed for the track and tunnels, HS2 won't be carbon neutral by 2050. They want it scrapped. HS2 says it'll save emissions in the long term, but environmentalists say it's diverting Â£100bn from more effective causes. There's a similar dispute about the government's Â£27bn road-building programme. One study - hotly contested by the Department of Transport - estimates that80% of CO2 savings from electric cars will be negated by the planned roads. The government says it's carrying out England's largest ever boost for cyclists and pedestrians, but greens say ministers shouldn't be doing anything that undermines the battle against climate heating. They say when it comes to infrastructure,home insulation offers by far the best value for money, with the greatest number of jobs. Our government spokesperson says it ""wholeheartedly"" agrees with the spirit of greater citizen involvement around climate change recommended by the recentUK Citizens' Assembly- a group brought together to consider how to make changes with least pain. It suggested households will need to insulate their homes, and eventually get rid of polluting gas boilers. That we should gradually eat less meat and dairy produce. It agreed that some journeys now taken by car should be done on foot or by bike - and that the sale of new petrol and diesel cars should be ended soon. Andit wanted frequent fliers to have their wings clipped. But how far will the prime minister's 10-point plan spell out that people - as well as technologies - will have to change if we want to stop damaging the climate?

Thanks for joining us. The coronavirus live page writers today were: Mary O'Connor, Joseph Lee, Victoria Bisset, Max Matza, George Wright, Alice Evans and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler and Suzanne Leigh.  And before we go, here are some of the main UK stories from today. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters took to the streets of Berlin That's almost us done for the day. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments from around the world:  The coronavirus pandemic has hit the music industry hard, with a new report by UK music suggesting thatmusicians will lose two-thirds of their income as a result of Covid-19. The effective shutdown of concerts and festivals will also cause live music revenues to fall by 85% in 2020, the report says. The pandemic has dealt a ""catastrophic blow"" to the music industry, said UK Music's Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. However, he said that music was ""an international success story in normal times"" and can boom again. The report also revealed that music contributed Â£5.8bn to the UK economy in 2019. However, it said Covid-19 had triggered a ""domino effect"" in the music sector, with cancelled concerts depriving artists of money they would have spent on hiring studios to make new records. Reality Check During the course of the pandemic,
misleading videos and messages have travelled between countries and been
translated into different languages. Weâve found a recent example in
India of a message circulating on WhatsApp in Hindi, making false claims concerning
World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The message falsely claims the WHO
has updated its coronavirus advice to say itâs no more of a threat than
seasonal flu, and doesnât require lockdowns and masks. The WHO has made clear to us the
message does not represent its views, and thatadvice on
the wearing of masks and social distancing,externalhas not changed. Official figures released in
October showed that in England and Walesaround three times as many
people had died from Covid-19than from flu and pneumonia this year. The WhatsApp message is accompanied
by a shortened version of a video posted in English on YouTube last month. This video made various false
claims about treatments for coronavirus and was subsequently taken down by
YouTube for violating its policies. According to data collected by
Johns Hopkins University, over 55 million people have been infected globally
with coronavirus, with more than 1.3 million confirmed deaths. An outdoor testing centre in Alhambra, California Oregon is among several US states issuing new coronavirus restrictions as cases rise dangerously and officials warn of a higher risk over the winter months. A ""two week freeze"" ordered by Oregon's governor takes effect on Wednesday. Non-essential businesses must close and social gatherings of more than six people are banned. Previously the rules were ""self-enforced,"" but now police have been cleared to intervene. Minnesota's governor is considering a four-week lockdown that would see gyms, bars and restaurants closed. The state recorded 5,945 new Covid cases on Tuesday, with another 26 deaths. Los Angeles has new lockdown orders coming into effect on Friday. It comes just days after new cases there topped 3,000 for the first time on both Saturday and Sunday. Much of Colorado has new orders coming in on Friday, after high transmission rates pushed several counties into the ""red zone"". The governor's order triggered confusion since ""red zone"" used to be the highest level of severity, but has since been superseded. âWe are adding a new level to the dial in response to out-of-control levels of Covid-19 transmission across the state,â Colorado's director of public health said in a statement, when purple was declared the highest level warning colour. The UN has allocated $100m (Â£75m) in emergency aid to seven countries at high risk of famine. The largest share of the money, $30m, will be given to Yemen, where a five-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The other recipients of the funding are Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia. There have beenrepeated warnings of the risk of famine to vulnerable countriesthis year due to lack of funds and the economic implications of the pandemic. These countries are also vulnerable because of conflict, economic decline and climate change. The UN said in a statement that the money had been released ""alongside a warning that without immediate action, famine could be a reality
in the coming months in parts of Burkina Faso, north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen"". âNo-one should view a slide into famine as an inevitable side effect of this pandemic. If it happens it is
because the world has allowed it to happen,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Famine can be prevented."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: The doctors on Yemen's front line Olga Robinson and Laura GozziBBC anti-disinformation unit A new French âdocumentaryâ promoting bad medical advice,
misinformation and conspiracy theories about coronavirus has gone viral on
YouTube and other social networks. Over more than two and a half hours, the film - titled Hold Up - promises to reveal the âtruthâ about the virus. Instead, it pushes a slew of previously debunked claims:
allegations that wearing masks is dangerous, claims that Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates predicted the pandemic, and evidence-free assertions that the crisis
was somehow planned by global elites. The film has already been dubbed by some experts as a French
âPlandemicâ â referring to a similar English-language conspiracy videothat was debunked earlier this year. Like its predecessor, Hold Up is spreading rapidly. In the
past few days it has been watched more than a million times on YouTube alone,
despite the video sharing siteâs rules on coronavirus misinformation. Weâve
contacted YouTube for comment. Links to it have also been shared hundreds of times on
Facebook, as well as on Instagram and Reddit. Denmark's Prime Minister
Mette Frederiksen is facing calls to resign
after her agriculture minister stepped down over an illegal
order to cull the country's farmed mink amid fears about coronavirus. The Danish government provoked outrage earlier this month when it was revealed that a decision had been made to kill up to 17 million of the animals. It later admitted there were no legal grounds for the order. ""I want the prime minister to do the same,"" opposition
leader Jakob Elleman-Jensen said, in reference to Agriculture Minister Mogens Jensen standing down. ""I want the prime minister to acknowledge that when she
makes a mistake, it's her responsibility."" The cull was ordered over concerns that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine. Mass graves have appeared in the Danish countryside filled with the slaughtered animals. Denmark is home to more than 1,000 mink farms. The head of trade body Kopenhagen Fur has termed the nationwide cull a disaster. Read more:Denmark shaken by cull of millions of mink Julian Assange says he and other inmates at Belmarsh prison have been placed into lockdown in their cells after being told there was a Covid-19 outbreak in his block. The WikiLeaks founder says a number of inmates at the London prison have received a letter from the governor notifying them that there had been a number of positive Covid-19 cases. All prisoners and staff are to be swabbed to detect for Covid-19 at the prison in the next 24-48 hours, says Assange. He adds that all exercise has been stopped, showers have been prohibited and meals are to be provided direct to prisoners in their cells. Assange has been held at Belmarsh Prison for the last year and a half and is awaiting the judgement from a US extradition hearing on 4 January. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We've introduced further safety measures following a number of positive cases."" A further 529 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday, bringing the UK total to 53,274,the government has said.,external There were a further 19,609 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK.

After receiving Â£12m ($16m) in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program of the Cares Act, they allegedly used the funds to write cheques to fake employees, including their own family members. One defendant's 86-year-old mother allegedly received at least six different cheques, as well as unemployment benefits, from a company she had never worked for before. âSome fraudsters create the most complicated schemes to steal money from the taxpayer,"" said US Attorney Ryan K Patrick of the Southern District of Texas. ""Just imagine how productive they could be if they put their creativity and effort into noble and useful work.â Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has largely seen the back of
the coronavirus and is one of the few countries where life has returned to a
version of normal. But thatâs not to say life is as
it was before. Mask-wearing is still very much a part of peopleâs lives, even
children. And today in the country, a bus driver has gone viral, after he was
captured on surveillance footage helping a child whose mask had broken. On-board CCTV captured a
schoolgirl boarding a bus in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, and apologising,
holding her broken mask up when the driver asked why she wasnât wearing one. âLet me give you one,â the man,
surnamed He, is heard saying, and he is shown fitting a new mask on her face
before letting her board. In an unexpected twist, however,
surveillance footage captured the same girl boarding the bus the following day,
asking another driver if she could pass on a thank you present to him. Millions of social media users in the country have seen a picture that the girl drew, with a big heart, saying âthank you mister for helping meâ with a bar of chocolate and a lollipop. âFor the last two days, all Iâve read is bad news, but I feel warm again after seeing this,â one user of Chinaâs Sina Weibo platform says.

About 2,000 police officers were deployed to the parliament, or Bundestag, where thousands of protesters had gathered in anger at the latest coronavirus restrictions. Police fired water cannons to disperse those gathered. Germany is currently under a month-long ""lockdown light"", with restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues closed while schools, shops and workplaces remain open.

You get up the next day and who do you see? Nobody,â says the 56-year-old unemployed lorry driver from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire of the creeping ache of lockdown loneliness. Shane says he previously could go a fortnight without talking to anyone, in what became a ""vicious circle"". âYou donât want to admit thereâs a problem, and then things just get worse and worse. You give up on everything,â he says. But not any more, thanks to the efforts of a small Huddersfield-based charity project called Platform 1 and the new friends and purpose it has brought.

Kolasinac will now miss Wednesday's Nations League match with Italy. The 27-year-old played the full 90 minutes of Bosnia-Herzegovina's defeat to the Netherlands on Sunday. He is the second Arsenal player to test positive this week, afterEgypt midfielder Mohamed Elneny.

Firsat Sofi (R) is seen here distributing face masks in Irbil in June The governor of Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, has died of complications after contracting coronavirus, officials have said. Firsat Sofi, 42, tested positive for the virus in mid-October and was flown to Turkey early this month after his condition deteriorated. He passed away in the early hours of Wednesday. Iraq has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, with around 525,000 cases and 11,752 deaths. The news comes as official figures showed that the number of infections in neighbouring Iran have passed 800,000, following a spike in cases. Almost 43,000 people have died. The spread of coronavirus in Switzerland is leading a shortage of intensive care beds, a senior medical official has said. In an update on Tuesday, Andreas Stettbacher said that practically all of the country's 876 certified ICU beds were occupied, although a further 240 spaces had been created. Sixty percent of those in intensive care are coronavirus patients, the news conference heard. The news came as the Swiss Society for Intensive Medicine advised citizens - and vulnerable populations in particular - to decide whether they would like to receive life support if they became gravely ill. There have been 280,648 coronavirus cases and 3,385 deaths in the Alpine nation since the pandemic began. The number of people who have died with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Scotland has passed 5,000. Figures released by National Records of Scotland showed that the virus had been mentioned on the death certificate of 5,135 people by last Sunday. This included 278 people who had died in the previous week. Scotland recorded itsfirst confirmed coronavirus death- an elderly patient in Lothian with underlying health conditions - on 14 March.

Head of NHS Test and Trace self-isolating,"The head of NHS Test and Trace is self-isolating after receiving a notification from the NHS mobile app. Baroness Dido Harding tweeted that she was ""feeling well"", and added: ""Nothing like personal experience of your own products."" It comes a week after her husband, Conservative MP John Penrose, was told to isolate by the app, and days after PM Boris Johnson began self-isolating. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis also said he was self-isolating. Mr Powis, who appeared at a Downing Street briefing over video call, said he was ""perfectly fine"" but had been told to self-isolate by Test and Trace after a member of his household tested positive for coronavirus. On Sunday, the prime minister was told to stay at home after having a meeting last week with Tory MP Lee Anderson, who then tested positive. Baroness Harding's husband was told to self-isolate on 9 November after potentially coming into contact with someone who had the virus. Why did test-and-trace app contact its boss? Husband of test and trace boss is self-isolating Why does Boris Johnson have to self-isolate? In Baroness Harding's tweet, it showed she had nine days of self-isolation left - having to stay at home until 23:59 GMT on 26 November. Allow Twitter content?

The reason her screenshot shows she has to isolate for nine days - rather than the standard 14 days - is because the 14-day isolation period starts from when the app made the contact. How the app works in England and Wales If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. The app calculates when to send an alert by tallying up points depending on the time spent together and distance. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact. Baroness Harding's tweet indicating she has been told to self-isolate has caused some confusion, highlighting the fact that her team needs to do better in communicating how the app works. Why, some ask, has she been asked to isolate for only nine rather than 14 days? Here's the answer. When an app user starts to feel unwell or gets a Covid test for some other reason, they enter a positive result into the app. They can then choose to share that result with other users. Their phone will have used its Bluetooth connection to record close contacts with other app users - usually involving being within two metres for 15 minutes - over the previous days. Those people will then get an alert in their app to self-isolate but the duration will be 14 days from the last close contact. So if I enter a positive test on a Sunday and I've been in close contact with you the previous Tuesday, you will get an alert on the Sunday to isolate for nine days. Baroness Harding was appointed the head of NHS Test and Trace in May, and has since beenappointed chair of the National Institute for Health Protection- the new agency replacing Public Health England. The 52-year-old is the former head of internet service provider TalkTalk, and for the past three years has been chair of NHS Improvement - focusing on driving up standards across the service. She has come under criticism for her handling of NHS Test and Trace after a raft of issues, including delayed results and test centres struggling to keep up with demand. But Baroness Harding has defended her own performanceafter calls for her to quit, and warned testing is not the""silver bullet to hold back the tide of Covid"". TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Loneliness in lockdown soared as clocks went back,"Adam Isfendiyar's online photo exhibition in the Being Human Festival records how people have coped in lockdown The week after the clocks went back saw Britain's highest levels of acute loneliness in the pandemic, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. The start of November, with darker evenings, saw 8% of adults who were ""always or often lonely"" - representing 4.2 million people. This was the peak in this measure of loneliness since the lockdown in March. Loneliness Minister Baroness Barran says the next few months will be ""incredibly challenging"". An online photo exhibition shows people in East London who faced isolation during the pandemic Figures also show that 5% of adults - representing 2.6 million people - had not left their home for any reason in the previous seven days. Psychologist Vivian Hill says the ""descent into winter"" can be a ""very significant factor"" in how people feel about loneliness, with less daylight and colder weather reducing the opportunity to get outside. Beating loneliness Millions of people, young and old, are facing loneliness, isolation and separation during the lockdown.

But in the week up to 1 November the measure of more acute loneliness - those ""always or often"" lonely - reached 8%, the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic, and representing 4.2 million people. Pre-pandemic surveys showed about 5% of adults ""always or often"" lonely - or about 2.6 million people. This video can not be played Marjorie Wells, 91, gives her advice on fighting loneliness The research shows that young people are particularly likely to feel cut off - with 16 to 29-year-olds twice as likely as the over-70s to be experiencing loneliness in the pandemic. Elorm Fiavor from Salford, a young carer looking after her mother who is shielding, said there needed to more recognition of the pressures of loneliness on young people. ""It needs to be OK to talk about it,"" says the 16-year-old, who misses being able to go out with friends and socialising and who is helping a charity, Lonely Not Alone, which tackles isolation among the young. ""There's a lot of stigma attached to it. ""There's a great misconception that when people think of loneliness they only think of older people who are living alone."" Elorm says that there is a misconception that loneliness is only a problem for older people Student Jade Low says he has missed partying and socialising in the pandemic - but the challenge is to ""punch through"" and find ways to keep in touch and stay motivated. ""Everyone feels lonely sometimes,"" says the student at Imperial College London - and to keep himself busy he has taught himself to play the ukulele. The figures from the ONS show about one in four people experiencing some form of loneliness at the start of November. Dr Vivian Hill, who is the British Psychological Society's lead on isolation in the pandemic, says loneliness is a serious problem - and could be made more difficult in winter. Staying in touch with neighbours or making a phone call can help to tackle loneliness But she says it is something that can be tackled and people should be optimistic about being able to make connections and reduce loneliness. Baroness Barran says there are new groups facing loneliness in the pandemic - such as those without internet access and those working from home who would usually rely on workplaces for their social lives. The loneliness minister said there was funding for grassroots community projects to help people stay in touch. But she said it was important not to underestimate the impact of things individuals could do - such as ringing someone up, writing a letter or helping a neighbour. ""It's those simple things that make people feel valued,"" she said.

"Too early for Christmas Covid rules, says ministerAlok Sharma says he'd like a normal Christmas as papers report plans to let families mix for five days.UK","Ministers are looking at how to relax coronavirus restrictions so families can celebrate Christmas together. The government's medical adviser on Covid, Susan Hopkins, said they were working on a plan and wanted Christmas to be ""as close to normal as possible"". She said tough restrictions might be needed before and after the holiday to allow mixing to take place. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said any rule change would be for a limited time, maybe just a few days. The prime minister's official spokesman confirmed ministers were ""looking at ways to ensure that people can spend time with close family over Christmas at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year"". It comes afterthe Sun reported that families may be able to mix indoors,externalfor five days from Christmas Eve. All four UK nations - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - are trying to work out a common approach to Christmas so families spread across the UK can still meet up. Our correspondent said any final decisions would not be made for a few weeks while health chiefs wait to see whether cases have started to come down during the  lockdown in England. But, he said, the advice was likely to urge families not to hold big gatherings and to travel by car, rather than public transport. Scientific advice indicates that for every day that measures are relaxed, five days of tighter restrictions would be needed.

England is expected to come out of its second national lockdown on 2 December and return to thetier systemof localised restrictions, with household mixing banned indoors in the top two tiers. This video can not be played 'We're keen to have Christmas as close to normal as possible' Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Dr Hopkins, from Public Health England, suggested restrictions could be needed either side of Christmas if curbs were to be eased over the festive period. She said two days of tighter restrictions would be required for every one day relaxed - although officials later clarified the advice is actually for five days. People would need to be ""very careful"" about the contacts they have in the lead-up to Christmas and would have to be ""responsible"" and reduce contacts again after the festive period, she added. She said she knew ministers were ""working hard to develop an outline"" of what the new tiers would look like after 2 December and what Christmas would look like. The BBC has been told new tougher regional tiers could see pubs and restaurants closed entirely in areas in the top tier throughout the festive period. Strict rules on meeting up and social distancing have meant millions of people have been unable to hug, or sometimes even see, close family for many months. Chris, from Norfolk, said he feared this might be the last Christmas his father, who has advanced cancer, has with his three grandchildren. ""I'm not interested in Christmas as a party or celebration. All I want is one day,""he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Downing Street said Christmas would not be normal but the prime minister would look at the latest data to make decisions and an update would be given next week. Earlier, Cabinet minister Alok Sharma said it was too early for ""conclusions"" but he wanted to see his family for Christmas. Mr Sharma told BBC Breakfast people needed to keep bearing down on the infection and ""do our bit"". Virtual office Christmas parties organised on Zoom Visitor tests in all care homes 'by Christmas' Travel rules changed for Christmas turkey workers On Tuesday, Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, suggested extending support bubbles to up to four households to allow families to celebrate Christmas together. This year, Christmas Eve falls on Thursday and there is a bank holiday on the following Monday, giving most workers at least a four-day break. Prof Ferguson also warned that reopening pubs and restaurants in the run-up to Christmas would be likely to lead to rising infection levels. What to do about Christmas is delicately poised. On the one hand, allowing mixing over the festive period will undoubtedly lead to an increase in infections. What is more, there are concerns the impact of lockdown will be more limited than hoped. We are yet to see infections rates start falling - although it is still early days - so there will be no final decision on Christmas yet. But stamping down on the virus is, of course, not the be all and end all. Providing an opportunity to meet will bring much needed respite from the hard slog of the pandemic. But there is also a widespread recognition that even if the government bans mixing at Christmas, significant numbers of people may well ignore it. The fear is that then starts to normalise breaking the restrictions and will make compliance worse over the rest of winter. The expectation is that there will be some limited relaxation - in the hope that the psychological boost it will give the public and the longer-term goodwill it will engender will outweigh any cost in terms of virus spread. That much was clear from the Downing Street briefing when government advisers admitted publicly for the first time that it may be on the cards. But the pay-off for that could be tighter regional restrictions on hospitality in the areas with the highest rates all through the festive period. There have been calls for a single approach from the devolved administrations in the UK about Christmas - so families who live in different nations can deal with a single set of rules. Welsh ministers have said it could beweeks before an announcement on Covid rules is made, and warned this year's festive period would ""not be like normal"". Ministers in Northern Ireland said they would do all they could to""protect"" as much of Christmas as possible. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidnew, stricter measures announced on Tuesdaywere needed, in part, to allow the possibility of people meeting up over Christmas. ""We are all desperate for some normality around Christmas and I absolutely include myself in that,"" Ms Sturgeon said.

"South Australia to enter snap lockdown on 36 casesState officials say a ""six day pause"" on all community activity is crucial to curbing the virus' spread.","South Australians rushed to get tested after new cases were discovered The state of South Australia will enter an immediate six-day lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus outbreak discovered days ago. The state has detected 36 cases since infections were found in Adelaide on Sunday, the first community cases detected in six months. Authorities say the ""circuit breaker"" measures were necessary to stop the virus' spread ""at the beginning"". Australia has previously also responded aggressively to small outbreaks. How Melbourne's long lockdown crushed a second wave Various state governments have at times closed parts of the economy, enforced border restrictions and other measures to stop the virus' spread. The lockdown, to begin at midnight on Wednesday, comes just weeks after neighbouring state Victoria beat a second wave, which caused about 800 deaths. South Australia's restrictions from Thursday 19 November People must stay home and cannot leave for exercise Mask-wearing to be mandatory in public All schools and universities closed except for children of essential workers Shops, restaurants, cafes and pubs closed with no takeaway options Bans on regional travel There would be a further eight days of lesser restrictions following the ""six day pause"", officials said. Almost immediately after the lockdown announcement, images on social media showed people queuing at supermarkets to buy toilet paper and other supplies. Authorities had urged people to avoid panic-buying, confirming supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Australia's Premier Stephen Marshall called on residents to ""rise to the challenge again"" in the sudden, second lockdown. ""We need a circuit breaker to stay ahead of this,"" he said. ""We need breathing space for contact tracing to protect the elderly, to protect the vulnerable, to protect our entire community."" On Wednesday, the state reported two new cases out of 9,500 tests. Officials said it was a ""small but critical"" number. Most Australian states had already moved this week to shut their borders to South Australian residents. Like Victoria's outbreak, the re-emergence of the virus in South Australia has come from a hotel quarantine site. This has prompted re-examination of quarantine safety measures. Officials said a cleaner had become infected and spread it to people in the local community. Australia closed its borders to international travellers in March but has allowed citizens and permanent residents to return home if they undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel. About one-fifth of the country's cases have been found in returning travellers. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said South Australia's speedy move ""draws on lessons from earlier outbreak experiences"". Australia, which has reported 907 deaths and about 28,000 cases had in recent weeks seen its cases drop to near zero after Victoria's successful suppression of the virus. This video can not be played Coping with Melbourne lockdown: 'I cycled every street in my 5km radius' However that effort had required a stringent four-month lockdown of state capital Melbourne, where residents could not freely leave their homes and faced a curfew. The state was able to reduce its case rate to zero from a peak of 700 new cases per day in that period. Its full lockdown began when nearly 100 new cases were being reported per day.

Fibrus wins Â£165m deal to improve rural broadband,"A Â£165m deal to improve broadband connectivity in Northern Ireland will be ""transformational"" for people living in rural areas, according to the company chosen to carry out the work. The contract for the upgrade work has been awarded by the Department for the Economy to broadband provider Fibrus. The aim of the investment - known as Project Stratum - is improving rural internet connectivity. About 76,000 premises are to benefit from full-fibre broadband access. The total funding for Project Stratum is Â£165m,with Â£150m coming from the confidence-and-supply agreement dealsigned between the DUP and the Conservative Party in 2017. The remaining Â£15m is being provided by Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs. Economy Minister Diane Dodds described the announcement as a ""significant milestone"". ""We are one step closer to bringing next generation broadband services to those businesses and people who need it most,"" she said. ""Fibrus proposes a full-fibre solution, capable of offering speeds of up to one gigabit per second to almost 97% of premises in the target intervention area."" The process is set to run until March 2024. The latest Connected Nations report from Ofcom suggests Northern Ireland has the best full-fibre coverage. Rural areas still lagging behind for broadband ""We ration our internet because of where we live"" Broadband provider Fibrus set to win Â£165m contract However, the September report said the number of premises unable to access decent internet is higher when compared with other UK nations. Fibrus chair Conal Henry said superfast broadband was a vital part of infrastructure and ""key to unlocking the full economic and social potential of our rural communities"". ""This investment enables towns, villages and rural communities to change the narrative, keep people and communities connected and facilitate the increasing demand for working and studying at home,"" he said. ""The benefits of full-fibre broadband are more relevant now in a Covid context than ever before."" Paddy McEldowney, who lives in the Sperrin Mountains outside Draperstown, County Londonderry, is one of those hoping to see a vast improvement in his broadband speed. ""We're getting speeds of probably just less than one megabit per second, which is atrocious when you're trying to live a normal family life,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""It was difficult before lockdown but lockdown just exacerbated everything - working from home and Zoom calls every day and home-schooling on Google classroom, with myself and my wife both working from home and three children. ""We had a situation for a couple of years where we just couldn't be on the internet together - we had to take it in turns, we had to around the house seeing who's on and who's off."" He added: ""My biggest concern about the Project Stratum would be is everyone going to be looked after or are there still going to be in four years' time houses like mine where the broadband is still atrocious?"" Fibrus said it has already invested Â£65m to improve broadband in towns across Northern Ireland. UK Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""This Â£150m investment from the UK Government will help deliver lightning fast gigabit speeds not just to Northern Ireland's towns and cities but also to rural areas stuck in the digital slow lane.""

Doctors spell out how to exit England's lockdownThe British Medical Association fears a surge in infections will cripple the NHS if unlocking goes wrong.Health,"Lifting lockdown must be handled better this time round to avoid a surge in Covid that could overwhelm the NHS, doctors say. The British Medical Association has published a blueprint for how it thinks England should proceed with any easing. It includes replacing the ""rule of six"" with a two-households restriction to reduce social mixing and banning travel between different local lockdown tiers. Government has yet to say if or exactly how England will exit on 2 December. It will decide next week, based on whether cases have fallen enough and how much strain hospitals are under. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said ministers want to see a ""significant easing"" of coronavirus controls. But Public Health England medical director and NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser Susan Hopkins said the government would have to look at""strengthening"" the three-tier system introduced in October. And now, the BMA, a trade union for UK doctors, has said robust measures to keep the virus under control must be in place before lockdown ends, including: giving local public health teams more of the oversight and budget of Test and Trace to ensure it is fit for purpose replacing the rule of six, which allowed up to six people from different households to meet with a two-households rule to reduce social mixing banning travel between different local lockdown tiers replacing guidance with rules to ensure workplaces and public areas such as shops and pubs are Covid-secure continuing to encourage people who can to work from home BMA chair of council Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the government must learn from mistakes from the ending of the first lockdown - rapid relaxation and inadequate monitoring, while people had been encouraged to go to the pub and dine out. ""It is unthinkable that we make the same mistakes again,"" he said, ""because this time, the impact will be far worse."" Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the original lockdown in March, has said reopening pubs and restaurants in the run-up to Christmas would likely lead to rising infection levels. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""The big question in practical terms is can we reopen hospitality venues - pubs and restaurants - in the run-up to Christmas and still avoid infection levels increasing? ""I suspect we can't, but the decision may be made to do so anyhow on the basis that any increase will be slow and may be able to be counteracted later."" THREE TIERS:How will the system work? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The NHS was preparing to roll out Covid vaccinations should a jab become available soon, the BMA said. But such a mass immunisation programme must be properly resourced and funded by government. And all of that groundwork should be done now, rather than later. The Department of Health and Social Care said it has invested over Â£230m into manufacturing any successful vaccine and there had been ""an enormous amount of planning and preparation"" for distributing it to the people who needed it. A spokesman said: ""As we've set out, we will seek to ease restrictions on Wednesday 2 December, going back into a tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. ""Guidance on infection control measures such as returning to work, social distancing and household mixing are constantly under review to ensure we can visit loved ones and support the economy whilst controlling the spread of the virus.""

Covid worries help Bitcoin to three-year highThe digital currency is close to an all-time record although experts warn about its volatility.,"Bitcoin, the world's best-known cryptocurrency, has jumped above $17,000 (Â£12,800) to hit a three-year high. The digital currency has suffered plenty of wild price swings since it was launched in 2009. But investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies during the pandemic-driven volatility on global stock markets. However, experts have cautioned about viewing them as a ""safe haven"". Bitcoin - what is it and how do you use it?t PayPal allows Bitcoin and crypto spending Exchange 'blocked 1,000 Twitter hack transactions' On Wednesday, Bitcoin had climbed more than 7% to $17,891, its highest level since December 2017. Some analysts said the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged investors to reassess the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there are still concerns about the fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies following a succession of high-profile hacks. During times of volatility, investors tend to move their money out of shares and into what are considered safer havens, like cash and gold. Some feel cryptocurrencies are now being viewed as a shelter from stock market volatility. ""Covid-19 has disrupted the traditional safe-haven trade and gold's inability to outperform. Periods of extreme risk aversion have forced many traders to diversify into Bitcoin,"" said Edward Moya, at trading firm Oanda. One attraction of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Some feel this scarcity provides an innate value and shields Bitcoin from inflation, which is becoming a worry. But Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, warned about jumping into Bitcoin. ""Its huge volatility hardly makes it a safe haven as a store of value. I have far more confidence in the $50 note in my wallet retaining its value over time than Bitcoin, which seems to bounce around like a yo-yo."" Last month, PayPal announced that its customers will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts, allowing customers to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said. Next year, PayPal plans to allow cryptocurrency to be used as a funding source. But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility. ""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes."" Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO). ""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver. ""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" China is one such country working towards launching its own government-backed digital currency - known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). One trader, Jon Son, told the BBC: ""I think more people are beginning to buy Bitcoin first not to miss the rise and then research into what exactly Bitcoin is.""

Johnson to do Prime Minister's Questions via videoHe is self-isolating after coming into contact with a Tory MP who tested positive for coronavirus.UK Politics,"The prime minister appeared on screen, rather than in person at the dispatch box Boris Johnson has become the first prime minister in history to conduct his weekly question-and-answer session with MPs via video link, as he continues to self-isolate. He is working from 10 Downing Street after coming into contact with fellow Conservative MP Lee Anderson, who later tested positive for coronavirus. The PM decided to take questions rather than see deputy Dominic Raab fill in. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was in the Commons chamber as usual. Up to 50 MPs are currently allowed in at any one time, with remote contributors using Zoom to ask questions and respond to ministerial statements. Starmer accuses Johnson of 'fuelling' UK break-up Boris Johnson 'proud' of PPE contracts PM and Tory MPs self-isolating after No 10 meeting Labour and unions urge return to hybrid Parliament The PM faced a mixture of virtual questions and ones from MPs present in the chamber during the 40-minute session, including from the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford and Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader. As PMQs ended, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he wanted to put a ""big thank you"" on record to the staff in parliament's broadcasting unit for ""making today happen"". On his Downing Street video link, the PM called ""hear hear"". Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was seen to be occupying the PM's normal position during the exchanges The format is set to be repeated at next week's Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson could also make a number of Commons statements via video link before his self-isolation ends on 26 November, including one on Thursday on the government's review of foreign and defence policy. There was some scepticism - and curiosity - about how a virtual PMQs would work. Remember this is the first time ever that a prime minister has dialled in remotely to the Commons chamber. The Downing Street wifi did at least hold up but it was certainly not the liveliest of exchanges. However the traditional ""bear pit"" atmosphere (that some like and others loathe) has been lacking for a while since they put limits on the number of MPs allowed in the chamber. The FDA senior civil servants' union has argued that Mr Johnson's use of a video link to answer questions shows a fully ""hybrid"" Parliament - using video conferencing across all parliamentary business - is possible. National officer Jawad Raza told the BBC it was ""unconscionable that an exception be made to suit the prime minister, but not to protect the health and safety of everyone working across the parliamentary estate"". He added: ""This doesn't just mean MPs, as hundreds of House staff work on the estate to support the work of parliamentarians and facilitate the UK's democratic processes."" On Monday, Mr Rees-Mogg gave way to an appeal from Conservative MP Tracey Crouch - who is receiving treatment for cancer - for more video participation for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. A motion aimed at making this happen will be debated on Wednesday. Self-isolation means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS Covid-19 app,you must self-isolate for 14 days,externalfrom the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus. And if you develop symptoms during the 14-day period, you should get a test as soon as possible. If the result is negative, you should continue isolating for the rest of the 14 days. If positive, you should self-isolate for at least another 10 days from when your symptoms started. How are self-isolating rules enforced? But Mr Rees-Mogg said he was resistant to widening the concession, insisting other MPs must ""behave as other key workers do"". The prime minister - who was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 in April - is working from an office in No 10 that he can reach from his flat in No 11 without coming into contact with Downing Street staff. A government spokesman said the public was ""best served when Parliament meets physically to the fullest extent possible"". He added: ""The [House of Commons] Speaker has worked hard with the House authorities to create a safe Covid-secure workplace for all who need to attend so that, just as teaching and medical professions are working in person to keep the country moving, so are MPs and peers.""

He added: ""This doesn't just mean MPs, as hundreds of House staff work on the estate to support the work of parliamentarians and facilitate the UK's democratic processes."" On Monday, Mr Rees-Mogg gave way to an appeal from Conservative MP Tracey Crouch - who is receiving treatment for cancer - for more video participation for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. A motion aimed at making this happen will be debated on Wednesday. Self-isolation means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS Covid-19 app,you must self-isolate for 14 days,externalfrom the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus. And if you develop symptoms during the 14-day period, you should get a test as soon as possible. If the result is negative, you should continue isolating for the rest of the 14 days. If positive, you should self-isolate for at least another 10 days from when your symptoms started. How are self-isolating rules enforced? But Mr Rees-Mogg said he was resistant to widening the concession, insisting other MPs must ""behave as other key workers do"". The prime minister - who was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 in April - is working from an office in No 10 that he can reach from his flat in No 11 without coming into contact with Downing Street staff. A government spokesman said the public was ""best served when Parliament meets physically to the fullest extent possible"". He added: ""The [House of Commons] Speaker has worked hard with the House authorities to create a safe Covid-secure workplace for all who need to attend so that, just as teaching and medical professions are working in person to keep the country moving, so are MPs and peers.""

South Australia to enter snap lockdown on 36 cases,"South Australians rushed to get tested after new cases were discovered The state of South Australia will enter an immediate six-day lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus outbreak discovered days ago. The state has detected 36 cases since infections were found in Adelaide on Sunday, the first community cases detected in six months. Authorities say the ""circuit breaker"" measures were necessary to stop the virus' spread ""at the beginning"". Australia has previously also responded aggressively to small outbreaks. How Melbourne's long lockdown crushed a second wave Various state governments have at times closed parts of the economy, enforced border restrictions and other measures to stop the virus' spread. The lockdown, to begin at midnight on Wednesday, comes just weeks after neighbouring state Victoria beat a second wave, which caused about 800 deaths. South Australia's restrictions from Thursday 19 November People must stay home and cannot leave for exercise Mask-wearing to be mandatory in public All schools and universities closed except for children of essential workers Shops, restaurants, cafes and pubs closed with no takeaway options Bans on regional travel There would be a further eight days of lesser restrictions following the ""six day pause"", officials said. Almost immediately after the lockdown announcement, images on social media showed people queuing at supermarkets to buy toilet paper and other supplies. Authorities had urged people to avoid panic-buying, confirming supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Australia's Premier Stephen Marshall called on residents to ""rise to the challenge again"" in the sudden, second lockdown. ""We need a circuit breaker to stay ahead of this,"" he said. ""We need breathing space for contact tracing to protect the elderly, to protect the vulnerable, to protect our entire community."" On Wednesday, the state reported two new cases out of 9,500 tests. Officials said it was a ""small but critical"" number. Most Australian states had already moved this week to shut their borders to South Australian residents. Like Victoria's outbreak, the re-emergence of the virus in South Australia has come from a hotel quarantine site. This has prompted re-examination of quarantine safety measures. Officials said a cleaner had become infected and spread it to people in the local community. Australia closed its borders to international travellers in March but has allowed citizens and permanent residents to return home if they undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel. About one-fifth of the country's cases have been found in returning travellers. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said South Australia's speedy move ""draws on lessons from earlier outbreak experiences"". Australia, which has reported 907 deaths and about 28,000 cases had in recent weeks seen its cases drop to near zero after Victoria's successful suppression of the virus. This video can not be played Coping with Melbourne lockdown: 'I cycled every street in my 5km radius' However that effort had required a stringent four-month lockdown of state capital Melbourne, where residents could not freely leave their homes and faced a curfew. The state was able to reduce its case rate to zero from a peak of 700 new cases per day in that period. Its full lockdown began when nearly 100 new cases were being reported per day.

Covid worries help Bitcoin to three-year high,"Bitcoin, the world's best-known cryptocurrency, has jumped above $17,000 (Â£12,800) to hit a three-year high. The digital currency has suffered plenty of wild price swings since it was launched in 2009. But investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies during the pandemic-driven volatility on global stock markets. However, experts have cautioned about viewing them as a ""safe haven"". Bitcoin - what is it and how do you use it?t PayPal allows Bitcoin and crypto spending Exchange 'blocked 1,000 Twitter hack transactions' On Wednesday, Bitcoin had climbed more than 7% to $17,891, its highest level since December 2017. Some analysts said the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged investors to reassess the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there are still concerns about the fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies following a succession of high-profile hacks. During times of volatility, investors tend to move their money out of shares and into what are considered safer havens, like cash and gold. Some feel cryptocurrencies are now being viewed as a shelter from stock market volatility. ""Covid-19 has disrupted the traditional safe-haven trade and gold's inability to outperform. Periods of extreme risk aversion have forced many traders to diversify into Bitcoin,"" said Edward Moya, at trading firm Oanda. One attraction of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Some feel this scarcity provides an innate value and shields Bitcoin from inflation, which is becoming a worry. But Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, warned about jumping into Bitcoin. ""Its huge volatility hardly makes it a safe haven as a store of value. I have far more confidence in the $50 note in my wallet retaining its value over time than Bitcoin, which seems to bounce around like a yo-yo."" Last month, PayPal announced that its customers will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts, allowing customers to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said. Next year, PayPal plans to allow cryptocurrency to be used as a funding source. But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility. ""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes."" Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO). ""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver. ""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" China is one such country working towards launching its own government-backed digital currency - known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). One trader, Jon Son, told the BBC: ""I think more people are beginning to buy Bitcoin first not to miss the rise and then research into what exactly Bitcoin is.""

Starmer pledges new Labour complaints process,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is being urged not to let Jeremy Corbyn return to the parliamentary party. It comes after the party readmitted the ex-leader as a member, following his suspension for suggesting political opponents had dramatically overstated the scale of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn issued a statement saying he regretted any ""pain"" caused. Sir Keir is coming under pressure from groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews to take further action. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a decision had not yet been taken on whether to restore the Labour whip to Mr Corbyn, which would allow him to sit once more as one of its MPs. Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour? A panel of five members of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee decided to readmit Mr Corbyn after he had clarified the comments which had led to his suspension, stating that he had not belittled concerns about anti-Semitism. His remarks had been made in response to a damning Equalities and Human Rights Commission report. The former leader's critics have said his case should not have been heard until the party had set up an entirely independent complaints process - as recommended by the human rights watchdog. Following the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir tweeted that it had been a ""painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle anti-Semitism"". He said Mr Corbyn's remarks were ""wrong and completely distracted from a report that identified unlawful conduct in our tackling of racism within the Labour Party"". Sir Keir said he stood by the commitments he made after the report, adding: ""That must mean establishing an independent complaints process as soon as possible in the new year."" He is coming under pressure privately from some of his own MPs - and publicly from the Board of Deputies of British Jews - to take further action. Former Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman, who quit the party over anti-Semitism concerns last year, said the decision was a ""backward step"". ""What Keir Starmer and the chief whip should do now is to refuse to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn, in that way they can show that they are determined, as they have said they are, to rid the party of this dreadful stain,"" she told BBC Newsnight. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says he has been told that at least one Jewish MP is considering resigning if Mr Corbyn is welcomed back at Westminster. Jeremy Corbyn has been readmitted as a Labour party member, but it is not, according to Keir Starmer's team, automatic that he would also be allowed to sit once more as a Labour MP. That is the decision Sir Keir has been trying to make overnight and he is expected to make it this morning. He is going to have to make that decision before Prime Minister's Questions at noon because that is an absolute political gift for the prime minister - who himself has had an absolutely shocking political week. If Sir Keir refuses to allow Mr Corbyn back on the backbenches that would provoke another pretty grim skirmish with those in Mr Corbyn's tribe on the left of the party. But if you allow him to sit again as a Labour MP then you punch the bruise of the Jewish community and infuriate many Labour MPs. Sir Keir was adamant he would not interfere in the process of whether or not Jeremy Corbyn would be allowed back in as a party member. But it was suggested to me he has found himself, from a political point of view, trapped by the process. He was so eager not to interfere, but has now been landed with this other political grenade. In a statement earlier on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who is currently an independent MP - said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and that he regretted the ""pain"" caused. His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" It is not yet clear whether Mr Corbyn will face further sanctions from the party. Its general secretary, David Evans, took the decision to suspend him in October, although Sir Keir endorsed it. The ECHR's report found Labour had breached the Equalities Act over its handling of complaints of anti-Semitism during Mr Corbyn's time in charge. Labour said Mr Corbyn had been suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Following his readmission, the Islington North MP said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government."" But President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews Marie Van Der Zyl described the decision as ""an absolute sham"" and said Mr Corbyn's reinstatement had been ""rushed through and judged by a politicised panel stuffed with his own supporters"". The Jewish Labour Movement called the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn ""extraordinary"", adding: ""After his failure of leadership to tackle anti-Semitism, so clearly set out in the EHRC's report, any reasonable and fair-minded observer would see Jeremy Corbyn's statement today as insincere and wholly inadequate."" Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""What message does this send? Zero tolerance either means zero tolerance or it's meaningless."" The co-chairman of the Conservative Party, MP Amanda Milling, has written to Sir Keir, saying: ""You have claimed that Labour is 'under new leadership', but now is the moment to prove it - Mr Corbyn should be expelled permanently."" However, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Mr Corbyn, called the reinstatement a ""correct, fair and unifying decision"". He said Labour had to ""move forward"" in implementing the EHRC's recommendations and ""redouble our efforts to inspire voters"" about Sir Keir's policies, acting as a ""unified and strong"" party. James Schneider, former director of strategic communications for the ex-Labour leader, argued that Mr Corbyn hadn't said anything that was ""either factually or morally wrong and was not anti-Semitic and did not breach any party rules"". Jenny Manson, co-chairman of pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour, told BBC Newsnight that ""an awful lot of us are very happy he (Mr Corbyn) is back in the party"" and would be ""very sad indeed"" if the whip is taken away from him.

Lockdown loneliness soared after clocks went back,"Adam Isfendiyar's online photo exhibition in the Being Human Festival records how people have coped in lockdown The week after the clocks went back saw Britain's highest levels of acute loneliness in the pandemic, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. The start of November, with darker evenings, saw 8% of adults who were ""always or often lonely"" - representing 4.2 million people. This was the peak in this measure of loneliness since the lockdown in March. Loneliness Minister Baroness Barran says the next few months will be ""incredibly challenging"". An online photo exhibition shows people in East London who faced isolation during the pandemic Figures also show that 5% of adults - representing 2.6 million people - had not left their home for any reason in the previous seven days. Psychologist Vivian Hill says the ""descent into winter"" can be a ""very significant factor"" in how people feel about loneliness, with less daylight and colder weather reducing the opportunity to get outside. Beating loneliness Millions of people, young and old, are facing loneliness, isolation and separation during the lockdown. A BBC News project, on TV, radio and online, reveals some of their stories and how they are fighting back.

But in the week up to 1 November the measure of more acute loneliness - those ""always or often"" lonely - reached 8%, the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic, and representing 4.2 million people. Pre-pandemic surveys showed about 5% of adults ""always or often"" lonely - or about 2.6 million people. This video can not be played Marjorie Wells, 91, gives her advice on fighting loneliness The research shows that young people are particularly likely to feel cut off - with 16 to 29-year-olds twice as likely as the over-70s to be experiencing loneliness in the pandemic. Elorm Fiavor from Salford, a young carer looking after her mother who is shielding, said there needed to more recognition of the pressures of loneliness on young people. ""It needs to be OK to talk about it,"" says the 16-year-old, who misses being able to go out with friends and socialising and who is helping a charity, Lonely Not Alone, which tackles isolation among the young. ""There's a lot of stigma attached to it. ""There's a great misconception that when people think of loneliness they only think of older people who are living alone."" Elorm says that there is a misconception that loneliness is only a problem for older people Student Jade Low says he has missed partying and socialising in the pandemic - but the challenge is to ""punch through"" and find ways to keep in touch and stay motivated. ""Everyone feels lonely sometimes,"" says the student at Imperial College London - and to keep himself busy he has taught himself to play the ukulele. The figures from the ONS show about one in four people experiencing some form of loneliness at the start of November. Dr Vivian Hill, who is the British Psychological Society's lead on isolation in the pandemic, says loneliness is a serious problem - and could be made more difficult in winter. Staying in touch with neighbours or making a phone call can help to tackle loneliness But she says it is something that can be tackled and people should be optimistic about being able to make connections and reduce loneliness. Baroness Barran says there are new groups facing loneliness in the pandemic - such as those without internet access and those working from home who would usually rely on workplaces for their social lives. The loneliness minister said there was funding for grassroots community projects to help people stay in touch. But she said it was important not to underestimate the impact of things individuals could do - such as ringing someone up, writing a letter or helping a neighbour. ""It's those simple things that make people feel valued,"" she said.

Civil war massacre 'cover-up' exposed by historian,"Savage fights over fortified houses were a feature of the Civil War A ""frenzied"" massacre, which may have included women and children, was the subject of a cover-up, a historian has claimed. About 160 died when Parliamentary troops stormed the Royalist stronghold of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, in 1645. Dr David Appleby believes the presence of ""European Catholics"" among the dead and unease over the bloodshed led to the battle later being hushed up. He said: ""Shelford was covered up by both sides."" ""The Parliamentarians wanted to forget the savagery, the Royalists, the use of unpopular foreign troops,"" he added. Dr Appleby, from the University of Nottingham's history department, said he was prompted to research Shelford as it did not appear in histories of the war, but he noticed it mentioned in contemporary documents asking for financial aid. Shelford was a moated manor between Nottingham and the Royalist fortress of Newark. Thewar began in 1642between supporters of King Charles I's absolute rule and those who believed Parliament should run England. It is believed the nearby church was used as a lookout post In the aftermath of Charles's decisive defeat at Naseby in June 1645, Parliamentary forces looked to mop up areas of resistance. ""Some of Charles' battered army were billeted at Shelford, namely the Queen's Regiment who were mainly European Catholics with a very bad reputation among fellow Royalists, as well as the xenophobic and anti-Catholic parliamentarian press,"" said Dr Appleby. The conflict was a series of civil wars which began in 1642 and ended in 1651. Although usually called the English Civil War, it was a much wider conflict also involving Scotland, Ireland and Wales The first and second wars involved King Charles I, while the third saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of Parliament The war ended in defeat for the Royalists on 3 September 1651, after which the younger Charles fled the country. Dr Appleby said the attackers were ""in a state of frenzy"". ""Records of the Royalist casualties are vague, but it's estimated [the defending commander] died with the bulk of his garrison,"" he said. ""Their bodies were perhaps mutilated after death and buried together in hastily-dug pits somewhere near the battle site. ""There is also a claim in a petition... that several women and children in the garrison had also been murdered."" He believed while some women were soldiers' wives, others joined the Army on the road. ""They worked as nurses, cooks, companions, and it has to be said that prostitution was very common,"" he said. Despite the blood-letting, the battle quickly disappeared from the written record. Dr Appleby said: ""It is... perhaps a reflection of both sides' shame and embarrassment at the bloodshed and viciousness of the supposedly 'civil' Civil Wars.""

Civil Service at 'critical point' over staff level,"The report says Northern Ireland's civil service recruitment system needs to be transformed Northern Ireland's Civil Service is at a ""critical crossroads"" and struggling to cope because of the extra pressure on staffing levels, a report has found. Auditor General Kieran Donnelly said almost 1,500 vacancies have yet to be filled and sickness levels remain the highest in the UK. He also raised concerns about how civil servants are being recruited and called for the system to be transformed. A total of 268,000 days of absences were recorded at a cost of Â£32.9m. Mr Donnelly said to function effectively departments need to have ""the right people in the right place at the right time"" and there has not been the ""strategic focus"" to ensure this is the case. The report notes the latest figures which show, on average, almost 13 working days are lost due to sickness per staff member in Northern Ireland, compared with between seven and eight days in other parts of the UK. ""This high sickness absence level across a head count of 22,000 can only have reduced the strength of Northern Ireland Civil Service's (NICS)  capacity and capability, so addressing the area is clearly a matter of priority,"" the report said. The Northern Ireland Civil Service is still without a leader, months after the retirement of David Sterling Anxiety, stress and depression among staff accounted for almost 40% of the days lost. The report reveals that 4,000 civil service jobs were lost between 2015 and 2019, mainly through a voluntary exit scheme. But the auditor warned the civil service is now facing unprecedented challenges because of welfare reform, preparations for Brexit and dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. There is one glaring vacancy in the civil service, which is proving difficult to fill, and it is the one which will be key to fixing the problems laid bare by the auditor. Northern Ireland's Civil Service is still without a leader almost three months after the previous holder of the post, David Sterling, retired. Three candidates interviewed for the job were not deemed suitable by the first and deputy first ministers. But leaving such a void at a time when civil servants are battling a pandemic and preparing for Brexit is far from suitable and raises big questions about this recruitment process. We may end up with an interim head of the civil service - yet another short-term solution to a long-term problem. The report recognised that NICS staff ""have continued to deliver vital services to the people of Northern Ireland during unprecedented challenging circumstances, including preparing for the exit from the European Union and responding to the Covid-19 pandemic"". However, it added that the NICS ""is now at a critical crossroads, struggling to deal with providing 'business as usual services'"". The auditor's report revealed that in one year only 19 unsatisfactory performance ratings were recorded across a workforce of more than 22,000 people. Alison Millar, the general secretary of the public service union Nipsa, rejected any suggestion that civil servants were under no pressure to perform. She said a ""failure of leadership within the civil service"" had been a significant issue. Alison Millar of Nipsa says the civil service has been hindered by the lack of a successor to David Sterling ""Civil servants delivered through three years when there was no executive in place,"" she said. ""We now have a situation where there are 43 days left to the European exit, again we're left with no certainty in what that is and civil servants have been working incredibly hard in this Brexit world with no leadership."" There are high staff vacancy rates in the civil service, with 1,420 full time posts remaining unfilled. The report also revealed that agency staff costs last year rose from almost Â£18m to Â£45.7m. Mary Madden, a former civil servant who ended her career in the Department of Justice, said that although there is an ""awful lot of hardworking people in the civil service"" it needs to become ""more professional and upskill its workforce"". ""You need to bring in more specialists - most civil servants are generalists and they are dealing with very complex things,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. Ms Madden said that an aging workforce - due to a recent lack of recruitment - meant the service needed a refresh in terms of its staffing. ""It is a natural thing that older people are generally more susceptible to illnesses which take them out of work. ""That is a common theme across all departments - an ageing workforce as well as extra pressure because the numbers were reduced"". The auditor general also found the current recruitment process was ""cumbersome, slow, and did not provide sufficient assurance that the right people are placed in the right posts"". It noted that appointments were made to grades rather than to specific job roles and ""skills and experience most relevant to positions are not always tested"". Stormont's Department of Finance, which has responsibility for the NICS, said it had recently carried out an external recruitment drive, helping to fill about 500 vacancies with more appointments planned. It added that the service recognised the need for ""fundamental change"" and would build on ""progress"" made through the reform of the organisation. ""The Audit Office report acknowledges that the Civil Service has delivered vital services against a backdrop of unprecedented and challenging circumstances and has made progress in many of the areas highlighted in this report,"" added the department.

Care home visit ban 'traumatising relatives',"This video can not be played Sandra Lazarus says she was denied seeing husband before his death due to Covid-19 rules The trauma of not being able to visit relatives in care homes will stay with people ""for years"", the older people's commissioner for Wales has said. Her calls come after the family of John Lazarus, 83, said they were not allowed to be with him before his death, which was not related to Covid-19. Mr Lazarus died last month at Glanffrwd Care Home in Bridgend. The owner, HC-One, said a visit was not allowed as he was not considered to be at the end of his life. Mr Lazarus's wife of 59 years, Sandra, said she knew her husband did not have long to live but not being able to say goodbye made the situation much worse. ""I can't turn back the clock. I can't say, can we have a re-run and let me see him. He's gone now. I missed the boat. I just wanted to tell him we loved him."" John Lazarus, pictured with daughter Claire, was a much-loved husband and father The father-of-three, who served with South Wales Police for 30 years, had Alzheimer's disease. Mrs Lazarus said it ""broke her heart"" when he had to move into the care home at the end of 2019. Before the outbreak of Covid-19, she visited every afternoon and they would have a cup of tea and a ""tot of whisky and Coke"" and watch a film. Visits were cancelled in March, outdoor visits were then permitted in the summer, but in September Bridgend was put under local restrictions. Under Welsh Government policy, end-of-life visits are still allowed regardless of any local restrictions or national lockdown. The Lazarus family said they had been allowed to look through the window at him, but it was difficult as he was deaf and would get distressed and beckon his wife and other family members to come in. ""He'd say 'I don't care about the virus. I just want you in here now',"" said his daughter Claire Jones. John Lazarus with son Mark, daughter Claire, wife Sandra and son Nigel before the pandemic Mrs Lazarus said her husband had stopped eating and drinking and they would drive up past the window to see how he was because they knew his condition was deteriorating. ""I think in his mind he had nothing to live for now,"" she said. ""I'd been with John since I was 17 and we'd always been together, we've done everything together."" On their wedding anniversary a carer held the phone for him. ""He said to me 'I love you'. He said it three times, I'll never forget it. Those were the last words I heard from my husband."" On 19 October, Mr Lazarus was rushed into hospital with a temperature and returned to the home in the middle of the night. Two hours later his family received a call from the home to say he had died. ""I hope he didn't think that we didn't love him and we just left him there and forgot about him,"" Mrs Lazarus said, ""because we didn't and we never will."" Former police officer John Lazarus was a ""proud man"" say his family His wife and daughter were allowed into the home, wearing full PPE, after he died. ""It was horrendous,"" Ms Jones said. ""Giving your dead parent a kiss in PPE with visors is beyond. It's overwhelming."" She said people were being ""kept safe to the detriment of their health"" by not having visitors. She wants rapid testing to be available for relatives so they can care for their loved ones during the final moments of their lives. Mrs Lazarus added: ""They say you can come in at the end of life, but when is 'end of life'? None of us know."" She wants care homes to ""look at this and say 'this person's really not going to last long... they need to be with their families now, not wait until their last breath"". The older people's commissioner Helena Herklots is urging care homes to allow visits for residents, particularly those who are at the end of their lives. ""We know that this can be done safely because care homes are doing it,"" she said. ""So I would urge those that for whatever reason decided they can't to think again."" John Lazarus died in October in his care home in Bridgend A spokesperson for HC-One said that Mr Lazarus was not considered to be at the end of his life, meaning they applied local visiting restrictions from mid-September. ""We would like to express our deepest condolences for the sad passing of Mr Lazarus, who will be dearly missed by those who knew him."" They said that in October they had planned safe weekly window visits for the family, but Mr Lazarus died shortly afterwards. HC-One said it recognised how difficult it was for families to be apart from loved ones and said it had ""done everything we can to keep them connected"". ""We have had to make difficult decisions to ensure a balanced approach is in place that enables residents to spend more time with their loved ones, whilst also ensuring we do everything possible to prevent coronavirus entering our homes.""

Government told to âcome cleanâ over Covid deals,"80% of the contracts were for personal protective equipment Companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority as the government raced to obtain Personal Protective Equipment, the National Audit Office found. Over half of the Â£18bn spent on pandemic-related contracts was awarded without competitive tender, it said. The spending watchdog said the government was not transparent about suppliers and services. It also found there was inadequate explanation of key spending decisions. The findings are part of an NAO investigation into government procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks The watchdog found not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. It found more than 8,600 coronavirus contracts had been awarded by 31 July, ranging in value from less than Â£100 to Â£410m. Of these, Â£10.5bn-worth (58%) were awarded directly without a competitive tender process. Personal protective equipment (PPE) accounted for 80% of the number of contracts awarded. The report comes after the BBC revealed on Tuesday that a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the pandemicwas paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson had been in line for a further $20m of UK public funds, documents filed in a US court reveal. He worked with Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger who set up a business at the start of the pandemic to supply PPE to governments. Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger set up a business to supply PPE to governments Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called for ministers to ""come clean"" and publish all information about the contracts awarded. The government acknowledged it had procured services with ""extreme urgency"" during the crisis but it said it had ""robust processes in place"". When asked about the $28m paid to the Spanish businessman, Business Secretary Alok Sharma told Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Department of Health did look at that contract at the time."" ""At the time there was huge pressure to get PPE into the system and that's what we did,"" he added. The government is keen to note that the National Audit Office found ""no evidence that ministers had been involved in either the award or management of the contracts"" for Â£18bn of pandemic-related contracts. It was under huge pressure to get more PPE immediately and was bidding against governments all over the world. It's even understandable that most of the contracts were awarded without the normal (and time-consuming) competitive tendering process that is there to ensure value for money for taxpayers - and to eliminate the risk that someone gets a lucrative public sector contract not because of what they offer but because of who they know. But as the NAO points out, if you ditch that competitive process, the remaining safeguards - such as properly documenting what you've done to avoid conflicts of interest  - become all the more important. And if you have a process where companies referred by ministers' offices, MPs, peers and health chiefs get 'fast-tracked' - and are therefore ten times as likely to win a contract - there's an even stronger risk that contracts are seen to be awarded not on merit or value for money but because of personal connections. To eliminate that risk, the public accounts committee chair Meg Hillier is calling for all contracts awarded so far to be published. NAO head Gareth Davies said it remained ""essential that decisions are properly documented and made transparent if government is to maintain public trust"". Ms Hillier, a Labour MP, said the failings uncovered may be the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The government overlooked a serious conflict of interest, paid consultants for months before giving them contracts and purchased masks it knew weren't up to scratch. ""It's bad enough that it set up a 'high-priority lane' to fast-track companies with the right connections. ""But the failure to track how half the companies had ended up on it made it impossible to ensure proper safeguards were in place."" The NAO looked in detail at 20 contracts including: A deal with research firm Public First, whose owners had ""previously advised or worked with"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove. Artificial intelligence company Faculty, which was awarded contracts worth almost Â£3m. Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew owned a Â£90,000 stake in the firm but has since relinquished it. Ayanda Capital supplied 50 million masks that could not be used for their original purpose at a cost of Â£155m. The deal was brokered by a businessman who was an adviser to the government's Board of Trade at the time. PestFix, a pest control company, was given contracts worth Â£350m, which included delivery of 600,000 masks which cannot be used for their original purpose. The NAO concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". The spending watchdog acknowledged the pandemic required acting with ""extreme urgency"" and the Public Contracts Regulations allowed an emergency response, including awarding deals directly without a formal competition. Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez said: ""We have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic that has posed the biggest challenge to the UK in a generation. ""As this report rightly recognises, we needed to procure contracts with extreme urgency to secure the vital supplies required to protect frontline NHS workers and the public and we make no apology for that. ""We have robust processes in place for spending public money to ensure we get critical equipment to where it needs to go as quickly as possible, whilst also ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. ""It is important to maintain the public's confidence in how we manage their money, and we welcome the NAO's scrutiny of our processes and recommendations on how they can be improved."" Tom Sasse from the think tank the Institute for Government, told Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money that procurement processes exist to make sure taxpayers get the best value for money. ""The NAO point to some pretty serious problems with how public procurement has happened during the pandemic,"" he said. ""We've also seen a big story in August around Â£150m that went on PPE that couldn't be used. So there are questions about how this process is working.""

German official 'bought gun from far-right man',"Lorenz Caffier has denied any involvement with far-right groups A German regional minister has resigned following criticism over a gun he purchased from someone with suspected links to a far-right group. Lorenz Caffier admitted to the purchase last week, but faced backlash after saying it was a ""private matter"". On Tuesday, Mr Caffier said he no longer had the ""necessary authority"" to continue as interior minister for the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It comes as Germany's government ramps up its efforts to combat the far right. In a statement, Mr Caffier criticised the media's ""uninhibited reporting"", insisting he was stepping down to ""protect"" his family, employees and others around him. He also said suggestions that he was linked to far-right groups himself hurt him ""deeply"". How the far right caused an earthquake in German politics Mr Caffier has admitted to buying a pistol for hunting purposes in 2018 from a man dubbed Frank T, who operated a shooting range. The facility was used to train police special forces, but was also frequented by suspected members of far-right group Nordkreuz. Nordkreuz (German: Northern Cross) is a so-called ""prepper"" organisation whose followers train for doomsday scenarios like the collapse of national order. Several members have had links to the police and military, and the group has been accused of preparing to carry out political assassinations. As interior minister, Mr Caffier was responsible for overseeing all police and intelligence operations against groups like Nordkreuz. He said that, at the time, authorities were unaware of Frank T's alleged links to the group. Frank T has also denied the allegations, and investigations by public prosecutors are ongoing. Germany's government is clamping down on alleged extremism in the military and police In July 2017, a whistleblower spoke to German authorities about the activities of Nordkreuz and mentioned Frank T's involvement, according to local news outlet Tagesschau. However the testimony presented ""no actual evidence of right-wing extremist activities"" by Frank T. Mr Caffier admitted that, ""from today's perspective,"" he should not have bought the gun from him, but stressed that ""it wasn't the acquisition that was a mistake, but my handling of it"". During recent years, the government has sought to clamp down on the emergence of far-right groups around the country, particularly in the police and military. In June 2017, inspections were ordered on all military barracks when Nazi-era memorabilia was found at two of them. Earlier this year, Germany's defence minister alsoordered the partial dissolution of the elite KSK commando forcedue to right-wing extremists in its ranks.

Level 4 lockdown to be imposed in 11 Scottish areasThe move means more than two million people will be living under the country's toughest Covid restrictions.Scotland,"This video can not be played The first minister says level 4 restrictions are 'intended to be short and sharp' More than two million people are to be placed under Scotland's toughest Covid lockdown restrictions from Friday. The move will see level four rules imposed in 11 council areas across western and central Scotland, including Glasgow. It will mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms will have to close, although schools will still be open. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. They will be imposed from 18:00 on Friday in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian will also move to level four - with about 2.3 million people affected across the 11 local authority areas. Live updates on the Covid levels announcement Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? However, East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. Ms Sturgeon also said the existing advice for people in level three or four not to travel outside their own council area except for ""certain essential purposes"" will become law from Friday. This will also mean that people living elsewhere in Scotland must not travel to level three or level four areas, except for essential purposes, and there must be no non-essential travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK. The first minister said there were grounds for ""continued and significant concern"" about levels of the virus in all of the council areas that would be moving to the highest tier of restrictions. She added: ""The infection rate in all of these areas remains stubbornly and worryingly high. ""At these levels, we simply do not have the assurance we need that hospital and ICU services will be able to cope as we go deeper into winter."" You must not visit other people's homes, but can still meet outdoors with up to six people from two households People should stay at or close to home as much as possible Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut But schools will remain open The first minister said people in level four areas should only be going out and about during the three-week period that the restrictions are in place for a limited number of reasons. These include childcare, caring for someone who is vulnerable, exercise or shopping for essential goods. In the seven days up to Friday, Scotland as a whole had just over 140 new cases of Covid per 100,000 people. Ms Sturgeon said all of the areas moving to level four were above that rate - ranging from West Lothian, which saw 158 cases per 100,000, to Glasgow with 277. Restaurants across the Level Four areas will have to shut completely from Friday She said the ""short, sharp"" move to level four would allow restrictions in the affected areas to be eased ""much more quickly"" than they would be if they remained in level three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in the same level as they currently are, although Ms Sturgeon said she hoped that Argyll and Bute could soon move from level two to level one. And she said that people from level one areas will be able to meet outdoors with up to eight people from a maximum of three households from Thursday, rather than the current six people from two households. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And restrictions, including the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants, arein place across Northern Ireland until 26 November. Business leaders had warned ahead of Ms Sturgeon's announcement that the highest tier of restrictions would have a ""severe"" impact on many retailers during the crucial Christmas trading period, and have questioned the scientific evidence for closing many businesses down. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents some of the country's biggest pub and restaurant chains, said the fact that Covid cases in many Level Three areas had not fallen despite licensed premises largely being closed showed that household transmission was the biggest driver of the virus. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce described the news as ""devastating"" and called for more emphasis on mass testing to avoid ""a miserable cycle of lockdowns"" through winter. The EIS teaching union, which is already surveying its members on whether they would consider striking over safety concerns, called for schools in Level Four areas to now move to either blended or remote learning. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said more than 700 Covid patients are in its hospitals and the number has been ""increasing steadily"" in recent weeks. Chief executive Jane Grant said: ""Our staff and services are under the same levels of pressure as they were at the peak of the first Covid wave so we hope these new restrictions will help us to continue to provide vital services and support to our staff, patients and their loved ones."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson gave a cautious welcome to the move on the condition that it allowed a more general easing of restrictions over the festive period. She added: ""However, as has happened on several occasions before, it would be deeply regrettable if these restrictions were to be stretched any further, leaving people in limbo before Christmas and businesses unable to plan"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was a ""stark difference"" between levels three and four, and called on the Scottish government to set out the ""hard data"" that the decisions had been based on. And he questioned why areas such as North and South Lanarkshire had been included at a time when their transmission rates were falling. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said restrictions were being ""ratcheted up in parts of the country where the number of cases is going down"" and said the government was ""shutting down sectors without clear evidence they are the cause of the spread"".

Covid worries help Bitcoin to three-year highThe digital currency is close to an all-time record although experts warn about its volatility.Business,"Bitcoin, the world's best-known cryptocurrency, has jumped above $17,000 (Â£12,800) to hit a three-year high. The digital currency has suffered plenty of wild price swings since it was launched in 2009.

But there are still concerns about the fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies following a succession of high-profile hacks. During times of volatility, investors tend to move their money out of shares and into what are considered safer havens, like cash and gold. Some feel cryptocurrencies are now being viewed as a shelter from stock market volatility. ""Covid-19 has disrupted the traditional safe-haven trade and gold's inability to outperform. Periods of extreme risk aversion have forced many traders to diversify into Bitcoin,"" said Edward Moya, at trading firm Oanda. One attraction of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? Some feel this scarcity provides an innate value and shields Bitcoin from inflation, which is becoming a worry. But Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, warned about jumping into Bitcoin. ""Its huge volatility hardly makes it a safe haven as a store of value. I have far more confidence in the $50 note in my wallet retaining its value over time than Bitcoin, which seems to bounce around like a yo-yo."" Last month, PayPal announced that its customers will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts, allowing customers to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said. Next year, PayPal plans to allow cryptocurrency to be used as a funding source. But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility. ""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes."" Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO). ""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver. ""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" China is one such country working towards launching its own government-backed digital currency - known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). One trader, Jon Son, told the BBC: ""I think more people are beginning to buy Bitcoin first not to miss the rise and then research into what exactly Bitcoin is.""

"No, voting machines didn't delete millions of Trump ballots","Dominion software has been widely used in voting and counting machines in this election President Trump has criticised the use of an electronic voting system widely used by election authorities across the United States, saying it's lost him millions of votes. The machines targeted by Mr Trump were provided by Dominion Voting Systems, and the accusations range from the deletion of votes to inappropriate influence over the company by his political opponents. So what were his claims, and do they stand up? Verdict: There is no evidence to support this claim. The president is referring to a news item on the pro-Trump, conservative news outlet One American News Network (OANN). ""Elections systems across the country are found to have deleted millions of votes cast for President Trump,"" it said. The OANN report referred to an ""unaudited analysis of data"" obtained from an election monitoring group called Edison Research. However, the company's president, Larry Rosin, said: ""Edison Research has produced no such report and we have no evidence of any voter fraud."" OANN did not provide any evidence to back up its claim. President Trump and his supporters have also been sharing a report from Fox News anchor Sean Hannity claiming Dominion voting machines flipped votes in key states from Trump to Biden. The report highlights problems in Antrim County, Michigan, where Dominion machines were used - suggesting there could be widespread software issues in other counties as well. There was an issue in Antrim County, but it wasn't the Dominion software that failed - it was down to a human error,as pointed out by Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.,external The Antrim County clerk at first failed to correctly configure the reporting function in the machine, so the initial results were incorrect, with Mr Biden winning by around 3,000 votes. Election officials noticed this unusual result in a typically Republican area, so they corrected the reporting function and re-ran the count - which showed President Trump winning by around 2,500 votes. Secretary of State Benson said the initial incorrect tally was quickly identified and corrected - and even if it wasn't, it would have been detected at a later stage in the checking process designed to identify such mistakes. She added: ""There is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state."" Mr Hannity also pointed towards potential problems in Georgia where the Dominion machines are widely used -but the Georgia Secretary of State said,externalthat despite some reporting delays, the software accurately counted and reported votes in the state. Dominion Voting Systems has released a statement saying,external: ""Claims about Dominion switching or deleting votes are 100% false."" Verdict: This is not correct - the company is not owned by the ""Radical Left"". It has made donations to both Republicans and Democrats in the past. It's not clear who Trump is referring to when he talks about ownership by the ""Radical Left"". He is probably referring to claims circulating online that the company has links to the Clinton family and other Democratic politicians, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. It is also important to clarify the difference between direct ownership of Dominion as claimed by Mr Trump, and donations made by the company either for philanthropic or lobbying purposes. Dominion has made donations to both Republican and Democratic interests, but it's not uncommon for a company such as this to lobby for government contracts in this way. Dominion Voting hasreleased a statement,externalsaying it is a non-partisan US company and has no company ownership relationships with any member of the Pelosi family or the Clinton Global Initiative. The Clinton Foundation has also issued a statement saying it ""has never had any stake in Dominion Voting Systems; we have never been involved in the company's operations; and we can confirm that we are not currently working together"". The election count Dominion did however donate to the Clinton Foundation in 2014, and made a philanthropic commitment to the foundation to donate election technology to poorer countries. The company has also donated to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Senate Committee. The rumours about Ms Pelosi stem from her former chief of staff, Nadeam Elshami, being hired by Dominion - but it has also hired staff previously associated with the Republican party. The accusations of involvement with Dominion have also extended to members of President-elect Biden's transition team. Posts on social media claim Peter Neffenger, who is a volunteer for Mr Biden's team, is chairman of a subsidiary of Dominion, Smartmatic. Mr Neffenger is chairman of Smartmatic - but it's a competitor - not a subsidiary - of Dominion. Verdict: It's true that Texas did not provide certification for the machines. Their approach is different to other states. The US federal government provides guidelines for certifying voting machines - which is meant to produce a common standard across the country. However, Texashas stipulated additional requirements,external, which the Dominion machines are unable to satisfy, such as that each ballot has a unique number so it can be traced. Not all states put these unique numbers on ballots, such as California, because of concerns over voter privacy. ""If you forbid these unique numbers you create a stronger privacy guarantee for the voter. On the flipside, you are compromising a modest security measure,"" says Dan Wallach, a computer scientist at Rice University in Texas, and an advisor on national guidelines for voting machines. The regulations and rules across each state vary significantly, butthe US government cyber-security agency has expressed its confidence,externalin voting machines used across the country. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."" A simple guide to the US election Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues?

The 'dead voters' who are still alive,"Roberto Garcia told us: ""I'm definitely alive and I definitely voted for Biden!"" Donald Trump's supporters have claimed that thousands of votes were cast in the US election using the names of people who had died. ""I may be 72,"" Maria Arredondo from Michigan told us when we called her. ""But I'm alive and breathing. My mind is working fine and I'm healthy."" Maria said she had voted for Joe Biden and was surprised to hear that her name had appeared on a list of supposedly dead voters in the state. We spoke to other people in similar situations to that of Maria in Michigan and found similar stories. There have been occasions in previous US elections of dead people having apparently voted. This could happen through clerical errors or perhaps other family members with similar names voting with their ballots, but Trump supporters have alleged this has happened on a massive scale at this election. We set out to find out whether there is evidence for this claim. The story starts with a list of around 10,000 names posted on Twitter by a Trump-supporting activist. It purports to be of people who have died, but who have also voted in the presidential election in Michigan. Claims such as this have been repeated many times on different social-media platforms, including by Republican legislators. The list of 10,000 contains the name, zip code, and the date a ballot was received. It then lists a full date of birth and a full date of death. Some of the people supposedly died more than 50 years ago. Michigan has a database that lets you enter someone's name, zip code, month of birth and year of birth and allows you to see if they voted by absentee ballot this year. So you can easily check whether people on the list voted. There are also several US websites that include databases of death records. But there's a fundamental problem with this list of 10,000. With an exercise like this you are going to find false matches - somebody born in January 1940 voted in Michigan in the election, and there was somebody born somewhere else in the US in January 1940 who has the same name and is now dead. This will happen a lot in a country as big as the US (328 million people), and particularly with common names. To test the list, we picked 30 names at random. To this we added the oldest person on the list. Of this list of 31 names, we managed to speak directly to 11 people (or to a family member, neighbour or care home worker) to confirm they were still alive. For 17 others, there was no public record of their death, and we found clear evidence that they were alive after the alleged date of death on the list of 10,000. A clear pattern emerged - the wrong records had been joined together to create a false match. Finally, we found that three people on the list were indeed dead. We examine these cases later. People took to the streets in Detroit, Michigan, claiming the election results were fraudulent The first thing we did was to check the official Michigan electoral database  to see whether our 31 individuals had sent in ballots - they all had. We then looked at the death records and quickly became suspicious on seeing that the vast majority did not die in Michigan, but elsewhere in the US. Supporters of Donald Trump claimed they had a list of dead people who had voted in the election We wondered whether we could find people of the same name currently living in Michigan. Checking Michigan state public records, cross-referencing voter postal codes, we were able to find precise dates of birth for those who had voted - and as we had anticipated, they failed to match the dates of birth on the death records. So we could be confident that we were dealing with two sets of people - those who had voted and those with the same name and age who had died elsewhere. But what we really wanted to do was to speak to the voters themselves. We called Roberto Garcia, a retired teacher in Michigan. He told us: ""I'm definitely alive and I definitely voted for Biden - I would have to have been dead to vote for Trump."" We also found a 100-year-old woman who, according to the ""dead voter"" list, had died in 1982. She was alive and is currently living in a nursing home in Michigan. But the results of our search weren't always so straightforward. When we looked for another centenarian, who according to the list had died in 1977, we found that she had still been alive when her postal ballot was returned in September. However, a neighbour told us the woman had died just a few weeks ago. We also found a matching obituary from October to confirm this. If a voter dies before election day after submitting their ballot, the Michigan authoritiessay the ballot will be rejected,external. We have not been able to establish whether her ballot was counted. Votes were still being tallied as unproven claims of fraud went viral For those we couldn't reach by phone, we wanted to use other means to confirm they were alive. These included public records of, for example, business activities, from state and local authorities. For one woman who was supposed to have died in 2006 we found an annual company statement signed under her name from January 2020. Two other men on our list of 31 died some time ago, yet votes had been cast in their names - with the correct postcodes and years of birth - according to the voting database. We found that for both men, there were sons with the same name currently registered at the same address as their deceased fathers. In both cases, a ballot was sent in for the dead fathers. Local election officials told us that one of the votes had been counted but there was no record of the son having voted. In the other, it was the son who actually voted, but it had been recorded as the father's due to a clerical error. Michigan residents came out to celebrate Joe Biden's election success Our selection of 31 cases is only a small sample of the 10,000 names on the list, but it has clearly revealed the flaws in the database shared by Trump supporters. From our investigation it's clear that in almost all of our 31 test cases, the data for genuine voters in Michigan has been combined with records of dead people with the same name and birth month and year from across the United States to yield false matches. ""If the lists are linked based on name and birth date alone, in a state the size of Michigan, you're guaranteed to get false positives,"" says Prof Justin Levitt, an expert on the law of democracy. It's known asthe birthday problem,external- the high probability that two students in the same class share the same birthday. So if you compare millions of voters in Michigan with a database of deaths across the United States you're bound to find cross-over, particularly if the voter database doesn't include the day of the month on which a person is born. ""It's simply a matter of statistics that if you cross-reference millions of records with millions of other records, you'll get a sizable number of false positive matches.  We've seen this before,"" says Prof Justin Levitt. With her vote safely cast, and counted, Maria Arredondo tells us she's looking forward to the new administration. ""He was a great vice-president under Obama. I'm so pleased. A weight has lifted off my shoulders."" A simple guide to the US election Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues?

"Peer retires from Parliament days before expulsionLord Nazir Ahmed sexually and emotionally exploited a vulnerable woman, a conduct report concludes.UK Politics","The Lords Conduct Committee concluded Lord Ahmed emotionally and sexually exploited a vulnerable woman A member of the House of Lords retired from Parliament after seeing a conduct report recommending he be expelled for sexually exploiting a vulnerable woman. TheLords Conduct Committee,externalconcluded Lord Ahmed of Rotherham emotionally and sexually exploited Tahira Zaman, who came to him for help in 2017. The inquiry into his behaviour followed a BBC Newsnight investigation. Lord Ahmed said the allegations in the report were not true and he would appeal against the decision. Ms Zaman said she was ""elated and relieved"" at the report's findings. The Lords Conduct Committee report concluded Lord Ahmed had exploited Ms Zaman, despite knowing she was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression. The Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, said this ""exacerbates the seriousness"" of his breaches of the code of conduct. Ms Zaman told Newsnight last year: ""I was looking for help and he took advantage of me, he abused his power."" She said she had approached Lord Ahmed because she thought he could help her get the Metropolitan Police to investigate a faith healer who she believed was exploiting women. Lord Ahmed wrote to the Met Police Commissioner on headed paper on 2 March, and he and Ms Zaman met at a restaurant in east London in February 2017 to discuss the case. After dinner, Ms Zaman alleged that Lord Ahmed groped her upper thigh. On the balance of probabilities, the Commissioner for Standards' investigation found that Lord Ahmed had sexually assaulted her. Ms Zaman says she was shocked by his behaviour and broke off contact. But, encouraged by a friend, she messaged Lord Ahmed on 14 July that year to ask if he had received a reply from the police. He said he had and they arranged to meet at his house in east London to discuss it. She told Newsnight last year: ""He was saying I'm beautiful and, you know, he really likes me."" Later that evening, in September 2017, they had sex. The Commissioner for Standards concludes: ""I find that it is more likely than not that Ms Zaman went to Lord Ahmed's house at his invitation to discuss the offer made by the police to meet her. ""However, he had no intention of forwarding her concerns to the police and his use of the offer of a meeting made in the letter from the police to lure Ms Zaman to his house was dishonest."" Tahira Zaman complained about Lord Ahmed's behaviour to the Lords' Commissioner for Standards Lord Ahmed continued to pursue her and Ms Zaman felt they were entering into a relationship. But Ms Zaman says that after two months the relationship ended. She says she realised she had been exploited. Ms Zaman first complained to the House of Lords about Lord Ahmed's behaviour in January 2018. She approached Newsnight after the Commissioner for Standards told her Lord Ahmed could not be investigated because the code of conduct only covered his parliamentary ""duties"" - mainly proceedings of the House of Lords. Newsnight began to investigate the Lords' decision not to accept Ms Zaman's complaint, for a film broadcast in February last year. Interviewed by Newsnight, Lord Carlile QC, a former deputy high court judge, said the Commissioner for Standards had ""got it wrong"", adding: ""If someone comes to you for help, particularly if they're vulnerable and you form a sexual relationship, actually that's disgraceful."" The Commissioner for Standards denied this, telling Newsnight that was a misunderstanding of the code of conduct. Ten weeks after the film was broadcast, the House of Lords changed the wording of the code to cover parliamentary ""activities"", rather than just ""duties"". It was retrospective and so covered Lord Ahmed's behaviour. Ms Zaman re-submitted her complaint, which led to a detailed investigation by the Commissioner for Standards. Responding to the report, Ms Zaman said: ""I feel elated and relieved because the whole experience for me was quite traumatising. I'm still digesting, digesting it. ""I keep on telling myself that I've got what I wanted - I wanted justice."" Lord Ahmed said: ""I am extremely disappointed by the report of the conduct committee, which is based on a flawed and unfair investigation process. ""I have always said, and maintain, that the allegations contained in the report are not true. ""Given this, I am now going to continue pursuing my appeal to the European Court of Human Rights to remedy this injustice."" You can see Newsnight's update on its investigation at 22:45 GMT.

Labour readmits Corbyn after anti-Semitism row,"Labour has readmitted former leader Jeremy Corbyn as a member following his suspension last month. He was punished after saying the scale of anti-Semitism in the party had been ""overstated"", in response to a damning report by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Mr Corbyn issued a statement earlier saying he regretted any ""pain"" caused. But current leader Sir Keir Starmer maintained Mr Corbyn's initial reaction to the report had been ""wrong"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a decision had not yet been taken on whether to restore the Labour whip to Mr Corbyn, which would allow him to sit once more as one of its MPs. Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour? A panel made up of members of the party's National Executive Committee met on Tuesday to decide whether to take further disciplinary action against him or to lift the suspension. After it decided to readmit Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir tweeted that it had been a ""painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle anti-Semitism"". He added: ""Jeremy Corbyn's statement in response to the EHRC report was wrong and completely distracted from a report that identified unlawful conduct in our tackling of racism within the Labour Party. This should shame us all."" When Labour acted swiftly and decisively to suspend Jeremy Corbyn, it was seen as a signal the party wanted to distance itself from a toxic period in its recent past. Sir Keir Starmer said he hadn't instigated the action but he supported it. But whatever decision was reached on Tuesday, criticism would have followed. Mr Corbyn didn't apologise for suggesting the scale of anti-Semitism had been overstated by political opponents, which was the reason for his suspension. He simply clarified what he had meant. So reinstating him was bound to attract criticism from those cheered by his suspension. Not to have reinstated him, however, would most likely have fuelled a factional war between those supportive of the Starmer leadership and those - including some union leaders - who remain close to Mr Corbyn. Sir Keir reiterated his commitment to an independent complaints process in the New Year - an Equality and Human Rights Commission recommendation. But putting Labour under fresh leadership hasn't silenced or banished those still supportive of the old leadership. And the line Sir Keir wants to draw under the anti-Semitism rows hasn't been fully drawn. In a statement earlier on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who is currently an independent MP - said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and that he regretted the ""pain"" caused. His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" It is not yet clear whether Mr Corbyn will face further sanctions from the party. Its general secretary, David Evans, took the decision to suspend him in October, although Sir Keir endorsed it. The ECHR's report found Labour had breached the Equalities Act over its handling of complaints of anti-Semitism during Mr Corbyn's time in charge. Labour said Mr Corbyn had been suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Following his readmission, the Islington North MP said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government."" But the Jewish Labour Movement called the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn ""extraordinary"", adding: ""After his failure of leadership to tackle anti-Semitism, so clearly set out in the EHRC's report, any reasonable and fair-minded observer would see Jeremy Corbyn's statement today as insincere and wholly inadequate."" Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""What message does this send? Zero tolerance either means zero tolerance or it's meaningless."" The co-chairman of the Conservative Party, MP Amanda Milling, has written to Sir Keir, saying: ""You have claimed that Labour is 'under new leadership', but now is the moment to prove it - Mr Corbyn should be expelled permanently."" Former Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman, who quit the party over anti-Semitism concerns last year, said the decision was a ""backward step"". ""What Keir Starmer and the chief whip should do now is to refuse to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn, in that way they can show that they are determinedâ¦ to rid the party of this dreadful stain,"" she told BBC Newsnight. However, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Mr Corbyn, called the reinstatement a ""correct, fair and unifying decision"". He said Labour had to ""move forward"" in implementing the EHRC's recommendations and ""redouble our efforts to inspire voters"" about Sir Keir's policies, acting as a ""unified and strong"" party. And Jenny Manson, co-chairman of pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour, told BBC Newsnight that ""an awful lot of us are very happy he (Mr Corbyn) is back in the party"" and would be ""very sad indeed"" if the whip is taken away from him.

Alarm as Trump cuts troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,"US troops have been involved in the fight against the Islamic State jihadist group in Iraq Senior Republicans and US allies have voiced alarm at the announcement that a large number of American troops will be removed from Afghanistan and Iraq. The US is to withdraw 2,500 troops from both countries by mid-January, the US Department of Defense confirmed. President Donald Trump has long called for troops to come home and has criticised US interventions abroad. The head of Nato warned of a ""very high price"". Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the plan ""a mistake"". Mr McConnell - usually a staunch defender of Mr Trump - also warned the president against making ""any earth-shaking changes in regards to defence and foreign policy"" before leaving the White House. Mr Trump is yet to concede to Democrat Joe Biden, and the cuts are scheduled to take place five days before Mr Biden takes office on 20 January 2021. Fighting for a future in a war without end How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? The Afghan war: The short and long story The president-elect has said he is ""rightly weary of our longest war"" in Afghanistan but also said there was a need to ""end the war responsibly, in a manner that ensures we both guard against threats to our homeland and never have to go back"". The Biden transition team has not yet commented on the announcement. In Iraq, the number of US troops will be cut by 500 to 2,500, while the number of service personnel in Afghanistan will fall from 4,500 to about 2,500. Acting US Defense Secretary Chris Miller - who was installed last week after Mr Trump abruptly fired Mark Esper - said the move reflected the president's policy ""to bring the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to a successful and responsible conclusion and to bring our brave service members home"". ""We will protect our children from the heavy burden and toll of perpetual war, and we will honour the sacrifices made in the services of peace and stability in Afghanistan, Iraq and around the world,"" he said. He did not confirm if the drawdown plan had been endorsed by Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but said the decision followed ""continuous engagement with the president's national security cabinet"". Until Mr Esper's removal, the Pentagon had said the Taliban had not met pledges to reduce violence, which has soared since the militants began peace talks with the Afghan government in September. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? Mr Miller said the US had met its goal of defeating extremists and helping ""local partners and allies to take the lead in the fight"". US officials said the withdrawal plans had yet to be hammered out in detail and it was not yet clear which troops would be pulled out, Reuters news agency reports. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman said he and Mr Miller had spoken on the phone about ""continued meaningful US military support to the Afghan Security and Defence Forces"". Shortly after the announcement, several rockets were fired into the Green Zone in Baghdad and landed near the US embassy. It is the first such attack since Iraqi militias linked to Iran agreed to stop targeting the embassy compound last month. The Iraqi military said an Iraqi child was killed and five civilians were wounded. By Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan and Pakistan correspondent President Trump has been determined to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. There were even fears he might try to recall all remaining forces before Joe Biden assumes office. That hasn't happened, but this cut in troop numbers will reduce the leverage the Biden administration will have over the Taliban. Under the US-Taliban agreement signed in February, all US forces will be withdrawn by May 2021, but, in theory, only if the Taliban fulfil certain conditions. Those don't seem to have been met yet. Talks between the Taliban and Afghan officials have finally begun, but progress has been slow, and violence has been intensifying. Meanwhile, many in the intelligence community still haveconcerns about the Taliban's continuing links with al-Qaeda. Mr Biden has also signalled his intent to eventually withdraw forces, but the expectation is he may be willing to proceed more slowly, and place the Taliban under greater scrutiny. He has also talked of a desire to leave a small counter-terrorism force in the country. The Taliban, however, could react violently to that proposal or any change in the withdrawal schedule. Afghan forces face losing crucial US firepower in the air US forces have been in Afghanistan since 2001. A US-led coalition ousted the Taliban weeks after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US by al-Qaeda, which was then based in Afghanistan The Taliban regrouped and became an insurgent force that by 2018 was active in more than two-thirds of the country The US started withdrawing troops from Afghanistanas part of an agreement signed by the US and the militants in February this year. But violence in the country has increased recently as the group steps up its offensives amid stalled negotiations with the Afghan government Thousands of US forces are in Iraq as part of an international coalition to fight against the Islamic State (IS) group Along with Mr McConnell, several other senior Republicans also voiced concerns. Texas Republican congressman Mac Thornberry called the move a ""mistake"", saying cutting troop numbers would ""undercut negotiations"" currently under way aiming to bring an end to fighting in Afghanistan. And Senator Ben Sasse, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it was a ""weak retreat"" and that it was ""not grounded in reality and will make the world a more dangerous place."" Nato Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg, in a rare public show of concern, said ""the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high"". In a statement, he added that Afghanistan risked once again becoming a platform for international militants to organise attacks. The alliance relies heavily on the US forces for logistical support in Afghanistan. They form the bulk ofabout 12,000 troops from 38 Nato allies and partner countries, including the UK,external, serving in the country. Afghan fears rise as US ends its longest war Afghans dare to hope for peace Has Trump kept his promises on the military? Some analysts say the sharp, fast reduction of troops would weaken the Afghan government's ability to deal with a resurgent Taliban. ""The US is only going to be able to focus on counter-terrorism operation - it's really going to have to cut back its train, advise and assist mission which means the Afghan government is going to feel the brunt of this,"" said Seth Jones, senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. This video can not be played ""The violence must come down"" says US General Miller But at least one Democratic politician supported President Trump's move. Adam Smith - the chair of the House Armed Services Committee - said it was ""the right policy decision"". ""While the history of conflict in the region is complex and predates our direct involvement, after nearly 20 years of armed conflict, Americans and Afghans alike are ready for the violence to end,"" he wrote in a statement. People in Afghanistan are desperate for an end to war - but many analysts fear the Afghan army is not strong enough to fight on its own if violence continues after foreign troops have left.

"More than 70,000 excess deaths during the pandemicRising Covid-19 deaths push the total number of UK deaths further above expected levelsHealthComments","Rising numbers of Covid-19 deaths have pushed the total number of UK deaths further above the expected level for this time of year. 2,225 deaths involving Covid-19 were registered in the week of 6 November, up by 628 in a week. Deaths registered for any reason were 15% above the level expected at this time of year. The total number of ""excess"" deaths, those above expected levels, since the start of the pandemic is now 70,839 Most of these deaths occurred in the first wave: the weeks since the start of October account for just over 5,500 of that total. ""Excess"" deaths are the difference between the deaths seen this year (the height of the shaded area in the chart above) and the average over the previous five years for the same weeks (shown by the dashed line). It includes people whose Covid-19 wasn't confirmed by a positive test and people who died because of the strain the pandemic has put on the NHS and society. The weekly number of excess deaths is rising. In the most recent set of figures, deaths were 15% above expected levels compared to 11% above expected levels the week before. In the most recent week of data, London saw no deaths above the average level for this time of year. But the North West of England saw 1,900 deaths in a single week, nearly 500 more than would be expected. The North West and Northern Ireland have consistently seen the highest levels of excess deaths in the UK in recent weeks. The figures for Wales have risen sharply in the last two weeks.

German official 'bought gun from far-right man'Lorenz Caffier denies any involvement with extremist groups he was in charge of fighting.Europe,"Lorenz Caffier has denied any involvement with far-right groups A German regional minister has resigned following criticism over a gun he purchased from someone with suspected links to a far-right group. Lorenz Caffier admitted to the purchase last week, but faced backlash after saying it was a ""private matter"". On Tuesday, Mr Caffier said he no longer had the ""necessary authority"" to continue as interior minister for the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It comes as Germany's government ramps up its efforts to combat the far right. In a statement, Mr Caffier criticised the media's ""uninhibited reporting"", insisting he was stepping down to ""protect"" his family, employees and others around him. He also said suggestions that he was linked to far-right groups himself hurt him ""deeply"". How the far right caused an earthquake in German politics Mr Caffier has admitted to buying a pistol for hunting purposes in 2018 from a man dubbed Frank T, who operated a shooting range. The facility was used to train police special forces, but was also frequented by suspected members of far-right group Nordkreuz. Nordkreuz (German: Northern Cross) is a so-called ""prepper"" organisation whose followers train for doomsday scenarios like the collapse of national order. Several members have had links to the police and military, and the group has been accused of preparing to carry out political assassinations. As interior minister, Mr Caffier was responsible for overseeing all police and intelligence operations against groups like Nordkreuz. He said that, at the time, authorities were unaware of Frank T's alleged links to the group. Frank T has also denied the allegations, and investigations by public prosecutors are ongoing. Germany's government is clamping down on alleged extremism in the military and police In July 2017, a whistleblower spoke to German authorities about the activities of Nordkreuz and mentioned Frank T's involvement, according to local news outlet Tagesschau. However the testimony presented ""no actual evidence of right-wing extremist activities"" by Frank T. Mr Caffier admitted that, ""from today's perspective,"" he should not have bought the gun from him, but stressed that ""it wasn't the acquisition that was a mistake, but my handling of it"". During recent years, the government has sought to clamp down on the emergence of far-right groups around the country, particularly in the police and military. In June 2017, inspections were ordered on all military barracks when Nazi-era memorabilia was found at two of them. Earlier this year, Germany's defence minister alsoordered the partial dissolution of the elite KSK commando forcedue to right-wing extremists in its ranks.

Doctors spell out how to exit England's lockdownThe British Medical Association fears a surge in infections that will cripple the NHS if unlocking goes wrong.Health,"Lifting lockdown must be handled better this time round to avoid a surge in Covid that could overwhelm the NHS, doctors say. The British Medical Association has published a blueprint for how it thinks England should proceed with any easing. It includes replacing the ""rule of six"" with a two-households restriction to reduce social mixing and banning travel between different local lockdown tiers. Government has yet to say if or exactly how England will exit on 2 December. It will decide next week, based on whether cases have fallen enough and how much strain hospitals are under. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said ministers want to see a ""significant easing"" of coronavirus controls. But Public Health England medical director and NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser Susan Hopkins said the government would have to look at""strengthening"" the three-tier system introduced in October. And now, the BMA, a trade union for UK doctors, has said robust measures to keep the virus under control must be in place before lockdown ends, including: giving local public health teams more of the oversight and budget of Test and Trace to ensure it is fit for purpose replacing the rule of six, which allowed up to six people from different households to meet with a two-households rule to reduce social mixing banning travel between different local lockdown tiers replacing guidance with rules to ensure workplaces and public areas such as shops and pubs are Covid-secure continuing to encourage people who can to work from home BMA chair of council Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the government must learn from mistakes from the ending of the first lockdown - rapid relaxation and inadequate monitoring, while people had been encouraged to go to the pub and dine out. ""It is unthinkable that we make the same mistakes again,"" he said, ""because this time, the impact will be far worse."" Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the original lockdown in March, has said reopening pubs and restaurants in the run-up to Christmas would likely lead to rising infection levels. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""The big question in practical terms is can we reopen hospitality venues - pubs and restaurants - in the run-up to Christmas and still avoid infection levels increasing? ""I suspect we can't, but the decision may be made to do so anyhow on the basis that any increase will be slow and may be able to be counteracted later."" THREE TIERS:How will the system work? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The NHS was preparing to roll out Covid vaccinations should a jab become available soon, the BMA said. But such a mass immunisation programme must be properly resourced and funded by government. And all of that groundwork should be done now, rather than later. The Department of Health and Social Care said it has invested over Â£230m into manufacturing any successful vaccine and there had been ""an enormous amount of planning and preparation"" for distributing it to the people who needed it. A spokesman said: ""As we've set out, we will seek to ease restrictions on Wednesday 2 December, going back into a tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. ""Guidance on infection control measures such as returning to work, social distancing and household mixing are constantly under review to ensure we can visit loved ones and support the economy whilst controlling the spread of the virus.""
