I had to wait 11 days to be told of my daughter's death,"When Sarah Jenkins saw pictures of distraught mothers appealing for information about missing children after the Manchester bombing, it reminded her of her own experience 12 years ago. After the 7/7 attacks in London she had to wait 11 awful days for confirmation that her daughter Emily had died. She now campaigns for victims' relatives to be kept better informed. ""Emily was my fourth child, so the baby of the family. She could be naughty sometimes, but a great joy. All children are,"" says Sarah. On the morning of 7 July 2005, Emily, aged 24, was on her way to work in London. ""She was staying in North London with a new boyfriend and I had no idea she was there so I didn't really prick up my ears or alert to the fact she was missing until my older daughter rang and said, 'We're all absolutely fine, Emily's late for work.' But there was nothing new in that, she was very often late for work,"" Sarah says. But when she still hadn't heard from Emily by lunchtime, she began to suspect that something might be terribly wrong. Sarah had spent the morning drawing in Clapham, south London, and walked with an awful sickness in her stomach towards the station, where she met one of her sons. The two of them went into a bar to watch live coverage of the bombing on a large TV screen. ""The first thing you do is ring helplines,"" she says. ""They give you very little information because they have no information."" Every time they rang they spoke to a different person, and were asked the same questions. Sarah was also constantly ringing Emily's mobile phone and leaving messages. Sarah Jenkins spoke to Eddie Mair on PM, on BBC Radio 4 -click here to listen online Click hereto listen to John Ramsbottom on the iPM podcast By late afternoon she and all three of her other children had gathered together, but were not quite sure what to do. They called the police, who told them to call the helpline, which they did, constantly. ""I remember phoning all through that first night - of course one didn't sleep - so I was constantly phoning the helpline to get the same, 'Have you contacted her friends?' ""I could scream,"" Sarah says. Her son James came up with the idea of going to the hospitals to look for Emily, but hospital staff just showed them into a room and asked to wait. ""The last thing they wanted was relatives there,"" Sarah says. They also knew that Emily would have been travelling south on the Piccadilly line, so they visited King's Cross and Russell Square stations in the hope of picking up information. Again, without success. One of the things Sarah remembers most clearly about this period, as the family waited together, was how her son Barnaby would go to buy pizza in the evening, which no-one could eat. Every day they threw away boxes of uneaten pizza. Sarah wondered what the rubbish collectors would think. Although she knew that the helpline staff were taking her concerns seriously, she says it wasn't made clear to the family that they had been logged as a priority case. So they kept ringing back to check for information, not knowing that they would in fact have been contacted as soon there was something to report. All this time, Sarah hoped that Emily might still be alive. ""As a mother you have that absolute thing of (a) it should have been me and (b) I should have protected her and so she must be still alive. It can't be my child who's died,"" she says. After three days, Sarah's family was finally put in touch with a Family Liaison Officer. This was progress, but Sarah could still not understand why her daughter could not be identified. Emily had been carrying credit cards with her that day and a tube pass. She had been wearing a distinctive ring, and had a tattoo on her back, both of which Sarah carefully described. ""The other victims were identified slowly but not as slowly as us,"" she says. ""Emily was the last to be identified."" Later Sarah found out that her daughter had been one of the first victims to be taken out of the tube carriage. ""The only thing that it (the bomb) had done was it had blown her legs off. She was absolutely fine apart from that,"" Sarah says. Finally, a full 11 days after the bombing, the Family Liaison Officer visited the family to give them the bad news about Emily's death. Sarah later campaigned to improve the information given to victim's families after a major incident, and worked with a government department on plans for an official website that would tell families which hospitals were treating victims, and provide help to arrange funerals and claim compensation. She says she received a promise that the website would be launched, but after the Manchester bombing it was clear to her that little or nothing had changed. ""People were still visiting hospitals with no results. Mothers were still crying in the streets with photographs of their daughters, saying frantically, 'Has anyone seen this child?' ""I don't think anybody in the day and age of fast communication should be out on the street with a photograph of their daughter or son."" John Ramsbottom, a retired police inspector, says the length of time it takes to identify a body after a bombing has to do with the complexity of the police operation. ""Two people are key at the scene,"" he says. ""The first one is the Senior Investigating Officer. This person is concerned with investigating the crime and extracting from the scene all the evidence that will enable us to come to the conclusion of what happened that day. The second person at the scene is the Senior Identification Manager. They are responsible with the recovery of the dead and the identification of the dead."" Each time a body part is removed from the scene it must be properly bagged and logged, generating large amounts of paperwork. Sarah now wears the ring Emily was wearing on the day she died ""A large number of them are going to have fragments of the bomb in them, so we've got to gather from them forensic evidence as well as identification evidence,"" he says. In many cases the body parts will be moved to a temporary mortuary, where work will be done to reassemble the bodies of the dead. The goal is to ensure that no parts are wrongly allocated, and that ""the body we give back to the family is absolutely as pure as that body as we can possibly make it"". There are only four ways to definitively identify a body, Ramsbottom says - through fingerprints, DNA, dental records and surgical implants, such as a hip joint or a pace-maker with a unique serial number. Wallets and ID documents are not considered strong enough evidence. And ""if we don't know, we say nothing,"" he says. ""Do the police say to somebody, 'We are 90% sure we found them'? But then we leave them with 10% hope. Is it worse later if we destroy that 10% hope or not? ""That's not a legal or police question, it's a human-being question and I don't have the answer to it."" He adds: ""The only thing we console ourselves with is that when we've done what we've done, we've got absolutely the right body, and that the dead person there has told their story to the police and coroner, and that story becomes part of the narrative of the incident."" Sarah understands that information can be given out only when it is confirmed to be true, and that ""wrong information is worse than anything else"". But she says she is angry that families are still going through the enormous stress that she endured 12 years ago. She would like a central co-ordinating body to be created, to provide families with information after a major incident. ""But if they cannot do that, or nobody thinks it's a good idea, then I will compromise with a website."" Until that website exists, she is not going to let it lie, she says. ""I expect letters back from the Home Office."" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Macron: Birth of the anti-Trump?,"Emmanuel Macron has just won the rare distinction of being the most re-tweeted French person in history. In less than 24 hours, his Trump-defying message ""make our planet great again"" was shared more than 140,000 times, easily ousting the previous record-holder, the rather less high-minded TV presenter Cyril Hanouna.  One fifth of the re-tweets were in the US. It is proof yet again that what we witnessed from the Elysee on Thursday was a master class in communications. In giving his TV reaction to the US president, not only did Macron break brazenly with longstanding convention, according to which French presidents never speak publicly in English, but he even had the chutzpah to subvert the US leader's personal campaign slogan. ""Make our planet great again"" was a provocation dressed up as a call to virtue. As a catchphrase for the faithful, it was irresistible. By tweeting it, Macron took one more step down his road to investiture as that long-awaited international figure: the anti-Trump. The French leader has a growing fan club: in France, the US and across the globe, among people who see him as the polar opposite,  the perfect antithesis of his counterpart in the White House. These people love the fact that with the arrival of Macron,  the existing order appears to have been turned on its head. Dismay as Trump signals exit from accord Five effects of US pullout from Paris The world's not laughing, Donald, it's crying It used to be France that was old, inward-looking and incapable of regeneration, and America that was the land of youth, energy and leadership. But where is that caricature now? This video can not be played Donald Trump's handshakes with world leaders, including President Macron, have been closely watched And they adore the way that Macron had the nerve to face down Trump in the Brussels handshake. At last, they feel, we have a champion with the guts and the conviction to challenge the Trumpian order. Macron himself never planned any of this. When he first thought of running for the presidency, the chances of a Trump in the White House seemed too ludicrous to contemplate. Who is Emmanuel Macron? But not for the first time, the stars seem to have aligned for France's boy-prodigy. Just as in domestic politics doors seemed to open miraculously for President Macron, so in the world of international affairs shifts of power and ideology are also working in his favour - for now. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron says Paris agreement will ""make the planet great again"" The tilt towards nationalist interests exemplified by Trump's America has created a clear leadership space for someone who will fly the other flag. Providential or not, Macron has come to power just as a reaction sets in against the populist tide of the last few years - and he is poised to reap the reward. With its perpetual harping on about ideals and morals, France's capacity to irritate is prodigious. Perhaps it will not be long before Macron loses his touch and the world starts panting for his comeuppance. But right now, with Trump in the White House, French preachiness doesn't appear to raise as many heckles as it used to. Having a quotable charmer for a president certainly helps.

Reality Check: Can we be self-sufficient in renewables?,"The claim:The UK can make itself energy self-sufficient in renewables. Reality Check verdict:This is not the policy in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which pledges to get 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Being self-sufficient and having all energy coming from renewables would require considerable development of storage technology to avoid having to use non-renewable sources or energy bought from overseas as back-up sources. In Wednesday night's debate, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said that the UK could become energy self-sufficient in renewable energy. It came after he had said: ""If it is simply for hair shirt, muesli-eating, Guardian readers to solve climate change... we're all stuffed."" Becoming energy self-sufficient in renewables is not current Liberal Democrat policy, although Mr Farron described it in aspeech in February,externalas being a ""patriotic endeavour"". The manifesto,externalsays the party would: ""Expand renewable energy, aiming to generate 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030."" A party spokeswoman described the leader's statement in the debate as ""visionary as opposed to completely literal"". The problem with being entirely self-sufficient is that many renewable sources of energy cannot generate power all of the time (the notable exception being the burning of biomass), so if you are using a very high proportion of renewables you rely on interconnectedness (buying electricity from another country where the wind is blowing), storage (batteries in the short-term, some sort of gas storage in the longer term) or a back-up system using gas-fired power stations or nuclear energy. The Liberal Democrat manifesto talks about investing in interconnectors, which would be unnecessary if the country was to become self-sufficient. There are already private plans in place to increase the amount of electricity that may be bought from France via interconnectors. It may be that when he said self-sufficient he meant that we should not have a trade deficit in energy, so it would be OK to buy energy from other countries when we needed it as long as we sold the same amount to other countries when they needed it. While therehave been suggestions that,externalmarine energy could make the UK a net exporter of electricity, being self-sufficient and generating 100% of energy from renewables is considerably more challenging than, for example, 90%, mainly because of the challenges of storage. The development of a smart grid, which co-ordinates renewable energy supplies depending on demand, may also be needed for a 100% renewable system. Also, while the Liberal Democrat manifesto targets 60% of electricity, Mr Farron was talking about all energy, which means, for example, that all cars have to run on renewable energy and all buildings have to be heated by it. So in 2016, the UK generated24.4% of its electricity from renewables,external, but in 2015 (the latest year available) it was only producing8.8% of energy from renewables,external. The UK has an obligation under European Union rules to derive30% of electricity from renewables by 2020,external, which it is on the way to achieving (although the UK is currently scheduled to have left the EU by then). But the other two parts of the targets are 12% of heat and 10% of transport to be powered by renewables, which we are less likely to achieve. The Labour manifesto,externalpledges to get 60% of energy from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030. The Conservative manifesto,externallooks at it in a different way, saying that ""energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives"". So they say that the focus will not be on how the energy is generated but on achieving, ""reliable and affordable energy, seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents and meeting our global commitments on climate change"". The Green Party would have a target of near-100% renewable electricity generation by 2030 with significant investment in electric vehicles and lower-carbon sources of heating. It supports self-sufficiency and a decentralised system of communities owning their own generation systems, but would also invest in interconnectors to allow for co-operation with other countries.

Seven stars who refused to be body shamed,"Chloe Moretz wasn't happy with the way her Snow White film was advertised Stories about ""body shaming"" are nothing new - but more and more celebrities are starting to fight back against the trend. Earlier this week, actress Chloe Moretz said she was""appalled and angry""over the marketing for her new animated Snow White film. A poster for Red Shoes & The 7 Dwarfs showed a tall woman next to a shorter, heavier version of herself. The caption read: ""What if Snow White was no longer beautiful and the 7 dwarfs not so short?"" After plus-size model Tess Holliday tweeted a photo of the poster, Moretzapologised,externalto her fans and said shehadn't approved the marketing,external. The film's producers withdrew the ad campaign. And last week, Modern Family actressSarah Hyland took to social mediaafter suggestions she looked anorexic in a recent photo. Here are seven other stars who hit back after criticism over the way they look. Lady Gaga came in for criticism after she wore a crop top during her performance at this year's Super Bowl. More than 100 million people watched the legendary half-time show worldwide, but some made cruel remarks about her stomach and said she ""wasn't fit enough"". The singertook to Instagram,externalto respond with an empowering message to her fans. ""I heard my body is a topic of conversation so I wanted to say, I'm proud of my body and you should be proud of yours too,"" she said. ""I could give you a million reasons why you don't need to cater to anyone or anything to succeed. Be you, and be relentlessly you."" The comedian and actress has memorably taken on body shamers on more than one occasion. When the advert for her film Trainwreck was released in 2015,one critic,externalreferred to her as a new member of director Judd Apatow's ""Funny-Chubby Community"". Posting a photo of herself almost naked on Twitter, Schumer wrote: ""I am a size 6 and have no plans of changing. This is it. Stay on or get off. Kisses!"" There was more to come. At the end of 2016, she responded to social media ""fat shamers"" who questioned whether she was an appropriate choice to play Barbie in a forthcoming film. Alongside a photo of herself in a swimsuit,external, she said she was honoured to be considered to play ""an important and evolving icon"". ""Is it fat shaming if you know you're not fat and have zero shame in your game?"" she asked. ""I don't think so. I am strong and proud of how I live my life and say what I mean and fight for what I believe in and I have a blast doing it with the people I love. ""Where's the shame? It's not there. It's an illusion. When I look in the mirror I know who I am."" (Schumer has since left the Barbie projectover a scheduling conflict.,external) In 2016, the singer made her record label take down the new video for her Me Too single after she noticed she'd been digitally altered. Or to use her words, ""they photoshopped the crap out of me"". Trainor took to Snapchat to tell her fans: ""I'm so sick of it, and I'm over it, so I took it down until they fix it."" She added: ""My waist is not that teeny, I had a bomb waist that night. I don't know why they didn't like my waist, but I didn't approve that video, and it went out for the world, so I'm embarrassed..."" A day later,the video reappeared,externalwith Trainor restored to her rightful size. In March this year, the star and creator of HBO's Girls responded to criticism about her recent weight loss. Dunham had attracted headlines about her dramatic new look. But ina lengthy Instagram post,externalwhich referred to her struggle to control her endometriosis, she said: ""My weight loss isn't a triumph and it also isn't some sign I've finally given in to the voices of trolls."" The actress said she had made it clear over the years that she didn't care what anyone else felt about her body. ""I've gone on red carpets in couture as a size 14. I've done sex scenes days after surgery, mottled with scars. I've accepted that my body is an ever changing organism, not a fixed entity - what goes up must come down and vice versa."" Back in 2013, Jennifer Lawrence said she thought ""it should be illegal to call someone fat on TV"" after red carpet criticism of her own figure. Speaking to US host Barbara Walters, The Hunger Games star said she was worried about how the media's attitude affected young people. ""The media needs to take responsibility for the effect that it has on our younger generation, on these girls who are watching these television shows, and picking up how to talk and how to be cool,"" Lawrence said. She added: ""I mean, if we're regulating cigarettes and sex and cuss words, because of the effect they have on our younger generation, why aren't we regulating things like calling people fat?"" The actress, who won an Oscar for her performance in Silver Linings Playbook, had previously spoken out against gossip magazines and TV shows which criticise the way women look. She told the December 2012 issue of Elle magazine that ""in Hollywood, I'm obese. I'm considered a fat actress"". The Titanic star and Oscar-winning actress has spoken on occasions about how she was bullied at school and called ""Blubber"". ""I was even told that I 'might be lucky with my acting, if I was happy to settle for the fat girl parts',"" she saidduring a speech this year,externalfor the WE charity at London's Wembley Arena. ""I felt that I wasn't enough, I wasn't good enough. I didn't look right... and all because I didn't fit into someone else's idea of 'perfect.' I didn't have the perfect body."" The star said her love of acting meant she was always auditioning for roles - however small. ""I would often get cast as the crocodile, or the scarecrow, or the dark fairy, I was even a dancing frog once. But it didn't matter. I still loved it... I wanted to be great and I was determined to keep learning."" Kate, who made her film debut aged 17 in 1994's Heavenly Creatures, shot to global stardom three years later as Rose in James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic. She said: ""The most unlikely candidate, Kate from the sandwich shop in Reading, [was] suddenly acting in one of the biggest movies ever made!"" It's not just women who get criticised for how they look. Vin Diesel found that out in 2015 after the publication of unflattering pap shots of him shirtless in Miami. Some comments on social media referred to his ""dad bod"". The Fast and Furious star responded byposting a photo on Instagram,externalwhich showed off his muscular physique. He said one journalist, during an interview for his film The Last Witch Hunter, had even asked to see the ""dad bod"". ""Haha,"" Diesel wrote. ""I am wondering if I should show the picture...

The 100 words that triggered the opioid crisis,"Canadian researchers have traced the origins of the opioid crisis to one letter published almost 40 years ago. The letter, which said opioids were not addictive, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1980. Dr David Juurlink says the journal's prestige helped fuel the misguided belief that opioids were safe. His research found that the letter was cited more than 600 times, usually to argue that opioids were not addictive. On Wednesday, the NEJM published Dr Juurlink's rebuttal to the 1980 letter, along with his team's analysis of the number of times the letter was cited by other researchers. ""I think it's fair to say that this letter went quite a long way,"" Dr Juurlink, who is head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. This video can not be played Mike John said heroin is ""one of the biggest challenges"" facing Ohio The original letter, titled ""Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics"", was just a paragraph long. The lone evidence cited was an anecdote that out of 11,882 hospitalised patients were treated with narcotics, only four patients with no history of addiction became addicted. This paragraph should have triggered a host of red flags, says Dr Juurlink. The letter only described the effects on hospitalised patients, not on patients who had chronic pain and would need to take painkillers regularly. It also only described the effects of narcotics that are no longer used today - and yet it was cited by many as proof that modern drugs such as OxyContin were safe outside of the hospital setting. ""I don't think it mattered that it didn't say much, what mattered was its title and its publication, and those two things went a long way,"" Dr Juurlink said. It is now widely accepted by medical researchers that opioids are highly addictive, he said. In 2016, the British Medical Journal urged doctors tolimit opioid prescriptions,externalin order to combat the overdose crisis in the US and other parts of the world. Nine die in Vancouver in 24 hours from fentanyl opioid overdose Smack in the suburbs In 2007, the makers of OxyContin pleaded guilty in federal court to ""misbranding"" by falsely claiming OxyContin was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications. OxyContin maker settles Canadian class action for C$20m This week, Ohio became the second state after Mississippi tosue opioid manufacturers,externalfor unleashing ""a health care crisis that has had far-reaching financial, social, and deadly consequences"". The letter's author, Dr Hershel Jick, says he never intended for the article to justify widespread opioid use, and has testified for the government about how these drugs are marketed. ""I'm essentially mortified that that letter to the editor was used as an excuse to do what these drug companies did,"" Jick told The Associated Press. ""They used this letter to spread the word that these drugs were not very addictive."" Dr Juurlink believes that the misinformation that resulted after the letter's publication would not happen today. Back then, he said, if you wanted to read the original letter, you would need to go to a library. Many of the people who cited the 1980 letter were just plain ""sloppy"" he said and didn't do their diligence. Now, it's easy to read theoriginal 1980 letter,externalonline, as well asDr Juurlink's rebuttal,external. ""It would be taken apart overnight on Twitter"", he said. There is now an editor's note on the original letter in the NEJM: ""For reasons of public health, readers should be aware that this letter has been 'heavily and uncritically cited' as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.""

Listen - Epsom Derby preview Dettori: 'Winning Epsom Derby is the best feeling ever' Victory for Cracksman would seal Gosden a third Derby success, after Benny The Dip in 1997 and Golden Horn two years ago. The son of Frankel won his only start as a juvenile at Newmarket and then beat fellow Derby contender Permian in a trial at Epsom in April. ""Cracksman has pleased me a lot, but he's light on experience,"" Gosden said. ""We'll probably find a champion at the end of it, but at the moment no-one can quite find that diamond in the rough. ""We like this horse a lot, but he is a different type altogether to Golden Horn, who was a very strong favourite."" Dettori said: ""He is not Golden Horn by any means, but potentially he could be anything on Saturday and we will find out."" Ryan Moore won the Epsom Derby in 2010 and 2013 O'Brien, who has saddled five previous winners of the race but had to settle for second in the Oaks with hot favourite Rhododendron, has Dee Stakes winner Cliffs Of Moher leading his team. Two-time Derby winner Ryan Moore will ride the current 4-1 joint favourite. ""Cliffs Of Moher was a little bit slowly away [at Chester] and Ryan got him into a good position fairly quick,"" O'Brien said. ""He's a horse that always showed plenty of pace, so we weren't even sure about going up to a mile and a half, but he galloped out well to the line at Chester."" O'Brien's daughter Ana will ride his three-year-old colt The Anvil to become only the third female jockey to ever race in the Derby. Another of O'Brien's horses, Finn McCool, was the only withdrawal at the final declaration stage. The total purse is set to be Â£1.625m, the richest race ever staged in Britain, with the winner receiving Â£920,913 and prize money then paid down to sixth place, which will net Â£21,922.

Uefa would support British World Cup bid,"This video can not be played British football deserves World Cup - Uefa president A British bid for the 2030 World Cup would be ""strongly supported"" and the tournament should not be sold to the country ""who wants to pay the most"", says Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin. This week,Vivo became the third Chinese company,externalto sponsor Fifa, with a suggestionChina could bid for 2030.,external But, with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, that would go against the governing body's continental rotation policy. Ceferin says rules ""cannot change just because we have some big sponsors"". Speaking to BBC Sport in Cardiff before the Champions League final, he added: ""It's simply time for us [Europe] to host the World Cup in 2030. ""I cannot say which country will place a bid from Europe, but we cannot just sell the World Cup to the ones who want to pay the most."" Asked about China's commercial grip on Fifa, Ceferin told BBC Sport: ""I didn't want to speak just about China, but the most important thing is that the World Cup should go to the country that has the best bid."" Russia will host the next World Cup in 2018, making a European bid for the 2030 tournament viable. Ceferin says an English or pan-British bid would be welcomed. ""It just has to be a decision not just of the FA, probably also the government and others too. But they deserve to have a World Cup in the near future,"" the head of European football's governing body said. ""They are capable of organising the World Cup, of that I'm sure. If they decide to go, we will strongly support them."" England hosted the only World Cup to be played in Britain, winning the tournament in 1966 Cerefin was speaking the day before Cardiff hosts the Champions League final and said Wales hosting the final was ""very important for the development of football"". ""For Cardiff, it's a fantastic experience,"" he added. ""For us it's a bit of a challenge in terms of infrastructure and hotels but I'm sure Wales will never forget the event. ""It's very important for the development of football. [Wales] made some fantastic results last year [at Euro 2016], they have one of the best players in the world - for a small country it is a fantastic result."" Gianni Infantino, head of world governing body Fifa, has also called for more transparency around transfers, and his Uefa counterpart Ceferin agrees. The issue of agents' fees has been in the spotlight after claimsMino Raiola earned Â£41mfrom Paul Pogba's world record move to Manchester United last summer. ""First of all, there's crazy money around,"" said Ceferin. ""But we have to speak to all the stakeholders and to speak to Fifa and in the end, it has to be a Fifa decision. ""We were the ones who were pushing against third-party ownership [of players] and we succeeded with that, so we will have to work on this as usual. It's a problem."" However, Ceferin says it is ""not a simple decision"". ""As a lawyer, if somebody agrees to an agreement about a certain amount it's hard to say he cannot get it,"" he added. ""I don't have a miracle solution but we have to react, otherwise hundreds of millions of money goes out of football.""
