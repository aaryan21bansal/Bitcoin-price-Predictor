Agentina cup final postponed after fan violence,"This video can not be played Football final postponed after team bus attack A ""shameful"" attack on the Boca Juniors team bus by River Plate supporters has led to the postponement of the final of the Copa Libertadores second leg. The game between the two fierce Argentine rivals will now take place on Sunday at 20:00 GMT in Buenos Aires, 24 hours later than originally scheduled. The announcement -made by River Plate on Twitter,external- came after more than two hours of confusion at River's Monumental stadium, during which the kick-off was put back twice - first to 21:00 GMT and then to 22:15 GMT. Boca players suffered cuts from the glass from broken windows and were also affected by the tear gas used by police to disperse the crowds. A number of players, including Boca's former Manchester City, Manchester United and Juventus striker Carlos Tevez, reportedly suffered from dizziness and vomiting and were being treated by club doctors. Boca Juniors midfielder Pablo Perez (centre) and defender Leonardo Balerdi were pictured wearing eye patches Footage apparently from inside the Boca dressing room showed the players groggy and disorientated. Reports said Boca's Pablo Perez and Gonzalo Lamardo had been taken by ambulance to hospital, the former with slivers of broken glass in his eyes and the latter a cut on his head. ""Pablo has just returned from hospital and has a bandage on his eye,"" Tevez told reporters before the postponement was confirmed. ""Other team-mates have cuts. We've only just been able to breathe well because we were affected by the gas. We can't play like this,"" he added. ""In these conditions the game was distorted. One team couldn't play and the other doesn't want to play against a rival that isn't in the right conditions,"" explained Alejandro Dominguez, the head of South American football's governing body, Conmebol. ""This should shame us as a society and I find it very sad that we have to reschedule such an important match,"" said Boca president Daniel Angelici. ""It's not easy to take this decision when there are 60,000 people in the stadium and the television rights have been sold to a ton of countries. But the most important thing is to look after the physical and psychological condition of the team."" River president Rodolfo D'Onofrio added: ""As an Argentine and as a football leader, I find this shameful. [But] it's the right decision and we hope to be able to play in peace on Sunday."" The attack occurred as the team made its way to River's Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires for the second leg of the final. Last week's first leg at Boca's groundended in a 2-2 draw. Former Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta,externalalso branded the scenes ""shameful"", saying on Twitter: ""Another opportunity lost in front of the whole world that observes us, shameful, lamentable."" The Copa Libertadores is the showpiece club competition in South America, equivalent to the Champions League in Europe. The clubs had agreed to a ban on away fans which mirrors an existing ban in domestic football in Argentina. Three years ago, a last-16 Copa tie between River and Boca at the latter's La Bombonera ground was abandoned at half-time after Boca fans attacked the River players with pepper spray in the tunnel. Boca were kicked out of the competition, while River were given a bye into the quarter-finals. River fans were left waiting for updates inside the stadium following the attack on the Boca bus BBC Americas editor Leonardo Rocha reports: The head of South America's football confederation, Alejandro Dominguez, said several players had been injured and officials from both River Plate and Boca Juniors agreed to postpone the match. This was the most anticipated game in the history of the two Argentine football giants. They were facing each other for the first time in a big South American final. But there's a sense of frustration and embarrassment now in Buenos Aires. And concern about the prospect of further violence. The whole world was watching, wrote one of the country's main newspapers, and Argentina showed them the ugliest side of its football. There was a very heavy police presence outside the stadium World Service radio producer Richard Padula at the Estadio Monumental: It was the final nobody wanted - a rivalry too intense for a match this big. Three hours before kick-off, the stadium was almost full. The songs were loud and heartfelt. But slowly the news of the attack on the Boca team bus began to filter through. And then the pictures. No announcements, just rumours on social media. Kick-off was delayed. But, we were told, the game would go on. Time passed. Still no sign of the players or team sheets. At one stage cones and balls were laid out for the pre-match warm-up. But the warm-up never took place - and neither did the match. Overseas visitors love Argentine football. The passion, the fervour, the colour, the characters. It's easy to romanticise the game here. But for those who live with it everyday it can be tiresome, dangerous and idiotic. And now this. The Superclasico between Buenos Aires clubs River and Boca is regarded as one of the most famous derbies in world football. Their bitter rivalry dates back to when the two clubs where situated just a few miles from one another - in the city's La Boca region - between 1905 and 1923. When football in Argentina became professional in 1931, River - who had relocated to Buenos Aires' Recoleta district eight years earlier - opted to spend big on new acquisitions, earning themselves the nickname 'Los Millonarios'. River's spending only stoked the already heated rivalry between themselves and Boca, who have never left the city's working-class La Boca neighbourhood. Since then, the two clubs have collected 69 league titles between them - River have won the Argentine top flight 36 times, while Boca have 33 titles to their name. This is the first time in the 58-year history of the Copa Libertadores the two teams have faced each other in the final of the competition.

Director Nicolas Roeg dies aged 90,"Director Nicolas Roeg, whose films include Don't Look Now and Performance, has died at the age of 90. In a career spanning six decades, he was celebrated for his original and controversial film-making. His 1973 psychological thriller Don't Look Now caused controversy for its graphic sex scenes. Roeg also directed Mick Jagger in the crime drama Performance and David Bowie in the science fiction movie The Man Who Fell To Earth. His son, Nicolas Roeg Jr, said his father died on Friday night. ""He was a genuine dad,"" he said. ""He just had his 90th birthday in August,"" he added. Donald Sutherland, who starred in Don't Look Now and named one of his sons Roeg, paid tribute to him. ""He is a fearless visionary, always was, always will be,"" he said. ""He was a liberating joy to work for. I fell in love with him then and will love him forever."" Nicholas Roeg in London in 1991 Nicolas Roeg was one of the most original film-makers the UK has ever produced. His early experience as a cinematographer brought a stunning visual quality to his work. He often exasperated the critics and gained a reputation as being hard on his actors. And he took a delight in jumbling scenes and time to both bewitch and bewilder his audiences. Read the full obituary here Born in St John's Wood in north London in 1928, Roeg started in the film industry making tea and operating the clapper board at Marylebone Studios. His directorial debut came in 1970 when he filmed Performance, sharing the director's role with Donald Cammell. The explicit scenes of violence and drug-taking caused the film's release to be delayed by two years. Speaking to the BBC's Front Row in 2013, he said false rumours that Don't Look Now included a real sex scene were ""very flattering"" because it meant audiences thought the film was authentic. ""What you are looking for in anything is some sort of truth,"" he said. Edgar Wright, the British director of Shaun of the Dead and Baby Driver, was among those who paid tribute to ""a master of the art"". Allow Twitter content?

Police clash with Paris fuel protesters,"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon fired on fuel price protesters by Paris police Police in Paris have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters, in a second weekend of demonstrations sparked by rising fuel prices. Violence erupted on the Champs-ElysÃ©es as protesters tried to get through a security cordon around sensitive sites. About 5,000 protesters had converged on the avenue. Dozens of people were arrested after clashing with police. Organisers of the ""yellow vest"" movement billed the latest protests as ""act two"" in their rolling campaign. Named after their distinctive high-visibility attire, the protesters oppose an increase in fuel duty on diesel. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work More than 100,000 took part in Saturday's protests across the country. They passed off largely peacefully - except in the capital, where 8,000 demonstrators gathered. Five thousand police had been deployed in the Paris area. They had set up metal barriers around the Champs ÃlysÃ©es to stop protesters reaching key buildings such as the president's office and the national assembly. Most demonstrators insisted that they were peaceful. ""We are not here to pick a fight with cops, We just want the government to listen to us,"" one of their spokespeople, Laetitia Dewalle, told AFP news agency. Some though tried to break through the police cordon. They lit fires, tore down street signs, erected barricades, pulled up paving stones and threw them at police while shouting slogans against President Emmanuel Macron. About 5,000 protesters marched down the Champs-ElysÃ©es The chaos continued into late afternoon. But by the evening police had cleared most of the area. Officials say 19 people were injured in the clashes, including four officers. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner accused protesters of being influenced by the leader of the far-right National Rally party, Marine Le Pen. But she accused him, on Twitter, of dishonesty. Demonstrations were staged around in the country. Roadblocks were set up to slow down traffic. Some motorway toll booths were taken over to let vehicles through. There were a number of minor clashes. Overall 130 arrests were made. The protests and the violence were on a much smaller scale than the previous week. Last Saturday more than 280,000 people took part, more than 600 people were injured and two people were killed. Meanwhile a march against sexual violence was kept well away from the latest unrest in Paris. Many of those demonstrating against sexual violence wore violet, the colour of a social media movement for women Similar protests took place across France, ahead of the UN's day for the elimination of violence against women on Sunday. Analysis by Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris The spark for the protest is clear, but there's not much that unites the ""yellow vests"" beyond their high-visibility gear and their anger at rising taxes and living costs. In a country where protests are often tightly managed by one political party or trade union, this is a movement with no recognised national leader, no formal structure or affiliation, which unites voters of all ages, from the far-left, the far-right, even those who once supported President Macron. Their new co-operation is a sign that Mr Macron has failed to restore their faith in politicians, and that deep divisions remain. These are not France's most marginalised citizens, but those who say they struggle even while working, who feel they're bearing the brunt of France's economic problems, while businesses and the rich get tax breaks. The government has blamed ultra-right gangs for the violence in Paris, but there are many peaceful citizens - both at the barricades and at home - who support the movement too. Its diversity and democracy has been its strength so far, but also makes its ultimate vision unclear, and its membership hard to control. All drivers in France have to carry the vests in their cars as part of safety equipment for use in a breakdown. Along with the familiar red reflective triangle which must be placed behind a broken-down vehicle on the side of a road, the high-visibility vest - or ""gilet jaune"" - must be worn by the driver outside the car. Failure to wear the vest after a breakdown or accident can result in a â¬135 (Â£120; $153) fine under a law introduced in 2008. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters?

"'Shame' on Paris protesters, says Macron","This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon fired on fuel price protesters by Paris police French President Emmanuel Macron has lashed out at demonstrators who clashed with police in Paris during the latest protests sparked by rising fuel prices. ""Shame on those who attacked"" officers, he tweeted,external. ""There is no place for violence in the [French] Republic."" There was chaos on the Champs-ElysÃ©es on Saturday as police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters. The demonstrations had been billed by the ""yellow vest"" movement as ""act two"" in a campaign that began a week ago. Named after their distinctive high-visibility attire, the protests initially focused on a rise in a fuel duty on diesel. They later grew to reflect anger at rising living costs, particularly in rural areas, and other grievances against President Macron's policies. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work More than 100,000 people took part in about 1,600 protests across France on Saturday, the interior ministry said. Most passed off peacefully - except in the capital, where 8,000 demonstrators gathered. On Tuesday, Mr Macron is due to address the nation and announce new measures as part of a speech on ecological transition. He is expected to mention the protests and call for nationwide ""grassroot debates"" on government policies. Five thousand police had been deployed in Paris. They had set up metal barriers around the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es to stop protesters reaching key buildings such as the president's office and the national assembly. A spokesperson for the demonstrators insisted that they were peaceful. ""We are not here to pick a fight with cops.

They lit fires, tore down street signs, erected barricades, pulled up paving stones and hurled them at police while shouting slogans against Mr Macron. The chaos continued into the evening, when police cleared most of the area. Protesters gathered on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es many demanding Mr Macron's resignation Officials say 19 people were injured in the clashes, including four officers. Forty people were arrested. Demonstrations were staged around the country. Roadblocks were set up to slow down traffic. Some motorway toll booths were taken over to let vehicles through. There were a number of minor clashes. Overall 130 arrests were made. The protests and the violence were on a much smaller scale than the previous week. Last Saturday more than 280,000 people took part, two people were killed and more than 600 people injured. The barricades were still burning into the evening In his tweet, the president praised the security forces for ""their courage and their professionalism"". He added: ""Shame on those who attacked them. Shame on those who assaulted other citizens and journalists."" French state media reported that several reporters had been attacked in the southern cities of Toulouse and BÃ©ziers. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner accused the protesters of being influenced by the leader of the far-right National Rally party, Marine Le Pen. But she accused him, on Twitter, of dishonesty. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP reports. World oil prices did rise before falling back again, but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. The president has blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise. He also said more tax on fossil fuels was needed to fund renewable energy investments.

Police link crime rise with benefits changes,"Universal credit has proved controversial since it was introduced Police Scotland has claimed UK government benefit changes may be linked to a rise in robberies. A force report,externalsaid welfare reform, including the introduction of universal credit, may have helped push robberies up by 30% over the five-year average. There were 880 robberies throughout Scotland between April and June, an increase of 12% on the previous summer. The Department for Work and Pensions said there was ""no firm evidence"" to link any trends to changes in welfare. All 13 Police Scotland divisions produced ""robbery problem profiles"" as part of its overall crime report for April to September. What is universal credit - and what's the problem? It said robberies were up by 8.4% (68 crimes) on the previous year and up 23.3% (166 crimes) on the five-year average. However, that was an improvement on the April to June period, when robberies were up 12.5% (50 crimes) on the previous year and up 30.5% (105 crimes) on the five-year average. The Scottish Police Authority report says an increase in the price of illegal drugs also contributed to the rise in robbery rates. It states: ""Analysis conducted during August 2018 has not identified a discernible pattern, although anecdotal evidence from intelligence suggests that a combination of increased drug prices due to police enforcement, and changes to welfare systems, may have contributed to an increase in crimes of dishonesty and robbery."" Universal credit, which is being rolled out across the UK, has proved controversial with reports of IT issues, massive overspends and administrative problems. Concerns have been raised that 3.2 million working families will lose Â£48 a week - about Â£2,500 a year- compared with the old system. The Department for Work and Pensions said the police report was ""purely based on anecdotal evidence"".

Ex-Zimbabwe President Mugabe 'can't walk',"Ex-President Robert Mugabe went to vote in July's elections with his wife Grace (left) Zimbabwe's former President Mugabe, 94, is unable to walk because of ill health, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said. Mr Mugabe has been in Singapore for treatment for an undisclosed illness for the past two months, he added. The former president also made several medical trips there towards the end of his time in power. Mr Mnangagwa became head of state a year ago afterMr Mugabe was ousted following the intervention of the army. Up to that point, Mr Mugabe had been in power for 37 years, first as prime minister, then as president. He led the movement for Zimbabwean independence from white minority rule. President Emmerson Mnangagwa told supporters that his predecessor would be back in the country next week President Mnangagwa was addressing a rally in his predecessor's home area when he talked about the former leader's health. ""He is now old. Of course, he now is unable to walk but whatever he asks for we will provide,"" the AFP news agency quotes him as saying. When Mr Mugabe was in power officials said he was being treated for eye problems, denying rumours that he had cancer. Despite being unable to walk, Mr Mnangagwa said the former leader was feeling better and would be back in the country next week. ""We are looking after him. He is the founding father of the nation of Zimbabwe. He is our founding father of free Zimbabwe,"" the president added, AFP reports. The government is paying for Mr Mugabe's treatment.

Trapped children rescued from sea cave,"The Dunbar inshore lifeboat approaches the cave before picking up the children Three children have been rescued after being cut off by the tide in a sea cave in East Lothian. The 12-year-old boy and two girls aged 11 and 12 had been playing in the Eye Cave at Dunbar when the tide came in and started to flood it. They were trapped for nearly two hours before the boy called the police on 999 and the Coastguard was alerted. The children were up to their ankles in water by the time two rescue teams reached them shortly after 14:30. The Dunbar inshore lifeboat brought them to shore where they were reunited with their parents. The children were brought back to shore to be reunited with their parents A spokesman for Dunbar RNLI said: ""This incident showed how easy it can be to be cut off by the tide. ""The children were aware of the risks and usually checked the tide times but on this occasion they forgot. However they did the right thing by dialling 999 and asking for the Coastguard."" He added: ""Getting cut off by the tide contributes to a significant number of RNLI rescues every year. ""The RNLI encourages everyone to enjoy the coastline safely and advises to check weather and tides before you set out, wear appropriate clothing and footwear and make sure you have a charged mobile phone with you.""

'The first time I had sex I contracted HIV',"A teenage Nathaniel Hall at about the time of his HIV diagnosis The first time Nathaniel Hall had sex, he contracted HIV. He was 16 years old and had only recently come out as gay. Fear, shame and self-loathing caused him to keep his diagnosis a secret from his family for the next 14 years. He ""came out"" for the second time in his life last year and took back control by writing a play about his experience. Nathaniel, a 32-year-old theatre practitioner from Manchester, hopes his one-man show will spark a conversation about representations of HIV in popular culture. Nathaniel explains how he coped with learning he was HIV positive while he was still a child. ""He told me that he had been tested and that he had a clean bill of health... at 16 you don't really have the capacity to challenge that"" I knew I was gay from around 13 or 14 but in 2003 it was a very different time. It wasn't even an option in school. It was all secret... to sort of find out who else was gay. And then this guy... I was 16, he was older than me - in his early to mid-20s. All of a sudden this older gay man gave me some attention and almost validated me - it was very intoxicating. So we started seeing each other. That relationship didn't last long; it was only a couple of months, really. It all happened in the summer - between school and college - a summer romance, as it were. And then we kind of went our separate ways. When I told him [about the HIV diagnosis], I got messages from his friends - bearing in mind they were older than me - saying I was just a silly little boy and I was making it up and worse than that. So I just really wanted him to get tested and get the treatment required so that he wouldn't pass it on, because most infections come from people who don't know they have the virus. But I never found out whether he knew. He told me that he had been tested and that he had a clean bill of health... at 16 you don't really have the capacity to challenge that. Nathaniel, pictured when he was a teenager and more recently, is now in long-term relationship I had just turned 17 when I got the diagnosis. I remember them being very, very kind to me in the clinic and I don't really remember much else, other than getting the news. Then going back home and having to make this decision... I made the snap decision to go into my bedroom and close the door, instead of going and saying what had happened. It felt like being hit by busâ¦ because when I try and recall it, it's almost a physical sensation of being hit quite hard. I remember crying. What I was told was very different to what you get told today. It certainly wasn't the era of the Aids epidemic... medication was around and they were good and improving, but I was told the prognosis was around 37 years. So to actually have a figure put on that at that age was quite a heavy thing to deal with. I did have counselling through my college and did have support and I kind of thought I was OK until late last year when I had a bit of a breakdown. I think shame is the big one... it's really the only disease where there is a moral judgement attached to it and even - to a certain degree - a self-judgement. I was gay... but you grow up in a straight world. You hear that you are morally wrong, or what you do is dirty and you should be ashamed of it. So I was becoming really acutely aware of that. Then you hear those kind of warnings - ""oh, you are going to be punished"". So it was kind of like those prophecies were coming true, right at that moment, and it was a very powerful - and that was the shame that I put on to myself. My boyfriend gave me HIV - here's how I got justice 'I didn't worry about getting HIV' Gay, Muslim and living with HIV When I was at school the only sex education we had about a gay relationship was a video that we watched in which a gay man was dying from Aids. It was completely out of date and so these messages that I was getting - that I was somehow secondary or that what I was doing was wrong or immoral or whatever - they weren't coming from my family but they were coming from all around me. They sink in over time and then all of a sudden, I kind of became that stereotype. So I think that shame really, really controlled me. Allow Twitter content?

I think the key moment was when I was still up two days after a party and I had not really slept at all. I looked at myself in the mirror and I didn't recognise who that person was. I realised at that point that drugs and alcohol had... not necessarily taken over my life... but I had abused them in a way that was not good for me any more. It was in no way a heavy addiction or anything like that but I was self-medicating through alcohol. I was just trying to get rid of this low-level anxiety and stress that had built up over the years. I realised that if I didn't do something about it then, it could escalate into a real and serious problem. Something had to change. Nathaniel in the First Time I needed to tell my family. I had tried many, many times before but it never happened and never came out. So I started on the journey of making the play and I started to write stuff and make sense of things through my writing. Then I decided to write a letter to my parents and brothers and sisters. I gave myself an afternoon to write everything down that I wanted to say. I told myself that I didn't necessarily need to send it, I just needed to get it written down and then see how I felt about it. But after writing it, I actually felt quite calm so I just put them in envelopes straight away and got them posted before I could change my mind. I did it that way because I had tried so many times to say it and I couldn't. And I also didn't think I could do it four times in a row without just being an emotional wreck by the end of it. The response was quite underwhelming, to be honest! It was a little bit like how I know a lot of gay people feel before they come out. This fear of what might happen but... everyone sent me text messages and called me and they were absolutely fine. They were just sorry that I felt I had to keep it secret for this long. My mum came over the next day and we had a chat. My big thing was that they would be upset that I had not told them and kept this really big thing from them. But my mum said: ""I'm just upset my son was struggling with this for so long on his own."" It was the fear. There was some internalised homophobia that lots of gay men have and then this other layer of shame and the fear builds on top of that, and all of that is really powerful. Even if you have a really loving family, you struggle to tell them. Nathaniel is looking forward to the future It's not like all of a sudden everything is fixed. But writing and working on the show has taken me to some difficult places and that's been hard. But I have felt a lot lighter and a lot more able to deal with things and some of the anxiety that had built up. I used to wake up every morning with a knot in my heart, in my chest. I never used to think that it had affected me but after I told my family it released a little a bit and I thought, ""oh my gosh, you lived with this almost crippling anxiety"". Every morning, the first thing I felt was fear in my chest, tightness - and I can feel it now as I'm talking about it. But since I've gone on that journey, admitting about that breakdown and some of the bad choices I have made and making peace with that, I don't need to be the perfect person I was trying to be - and that was very freeing and very liberating. Told through a series of personal letters, poems, confessions and Nathaniel's drag alter-ego, Sue, First Time is about growing up gay and HIV positive. The play is part of a series of events atWaterside Arts, Sale,externalto mark 30 years since the first World Aids Day. Held in conjunction with the Greater ManchesterPaSH Partnership,external(Passionate about Sexual Health), the weekend will also feature creative workshops, a gallery exhibition, free HIV testing and a ""coming out"" party to raise money for HIV charities.

Amazon deforestation 'worst in 10 years',"The government blamed illegal logging for the rise Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has hit its highest rate in a decade, according to official data. About 7,900 sq km (3,050 sq miles) of the world's largest rainforest was destroyed between August 2017 and July 2018 - an area roughly five times the size of London. Environment Minister Edson Duarte said illegal logging was to blame. The figures come amid concerns about the policies of Brazil's newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro. During the 2018 election campaign, Mr Bolsonaro pledged to limit fines for damaging forestry and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. An aide for the president-elect has also announced the administration will merge the agriculture and environment ministries, which critics say could endanger the rainforest. Bolsonaro merger plan 'threat to Amazon' Amazon forest safeguards relaxed in Brazil Is the Amazon facing new dangers? The latest government data,externalsays most of the deforestation occurred in the states of Mato Grosso and ParÃ¡, and marked a 13.7% rise over last year's figures. Mato Grosso is the top producer of grains in Brazil, and critics say expanding agriculture is also encroaching on the rainforest. Mr Duarte blamed ""an upsurge in organised crime"" for the illegal deforestation, and said the country must broaden the fight against ""environmental violations and in defence of sustainable development of the biome"". The Amazon is sometimes called the lungs of the planet Satellite data from the deforestation monitoring project known as Prodes,externalinformed the annual survey. While the rate does mark a significant rise from last year, whenthe rate of deforestation dropped 16% in a 12-month period, it still marks a 72% drop from 2004, when the Brazilian federal government launched measures to combat deforestation. In that year, an area the size of Haiti - more than 27,000 sq km - was cleared from the rainforest. The Amazon region holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world and is home to plant and animal species that are still being discovered by scientists. Most of its millions of square kilometres are inside Brazil, where under laws dating back to 1965, landowners must keep a percentage of their property forested.

EU won't offer 'better deal' - May,"This video can not be played Michael: ""What in your honest opinion is better for the UK, your deal or the deal we had if we stayed in the EU?"" Theresa May has said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement. She told a BBC phone-in that there would be just ""more division and uncertainty"" if Parliament voted against the agreement next month. But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"". A summit of EU leaders to sign off the deal will go ahead on Sunday despite ""unresolved"" issues over Gibraltar. Spain is seeking written assurances from the UK that it will be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory. Its prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said he won't decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until these are provided. DUP may revisit Tory deal, says Foster What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? The withdrawal agreement - what it all means He has said his backing for the overall deal cannot be taken for granted although no one country can block the withdrawal agreement on its own at this stage. Meanwhile, the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster,has said she will ""look again"" at her party's dealwith the Conservatives if Mrs May's Brexit bill passes through parliament. ""But we are not there yet,"" Mrs Foster added. This video can not be played Watch in full: Prime Minister Theresa May takes calls on the BBC News Channel and BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Emma Barnett: The PM didn't give clear answers on Brexit Mrs May told the Emma Barnett Show that her job was to persuade MPs to back her but also to ""explain"" the merits of the deal to the public. Asked what her plan B was, if MPs rejected the deal, she suggested there would be little point going back to the EU to ask for further changes. ""I believe if we were to go back to the European Union and say: Well people didn't like that deal, can we have another one? ... I don't think they're going to come to us and say: We'll give you a better deal."" Mrs May, who has previously warned about the dangers of the UK leaving without a deal or not leaving at all, would not be drawn on whether she would quit if MPs refused to back her deal. Asked what was a more likely outcome in such an event - a no-deal exit or the UK remaining in the EU - she said ""from my point of view, personally, there is no question of 'no Brexit' because the government needs to deliver on what people voted on in the referendum in 2016"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab tells Today the proposed Brexit deal is worse than EU membership Asked by a caller called Michael if the UK would be better off outside the EU under her deal than staying in, she said that as someone who voted to Remain, she had never said the ""sky would fall in"" if Brexit happens. ""I think we will be better off in a situation which we'll have outside the European Union, where we have control of all those things, and are able to trade around the rest of the world,"" she said. DUP may revisit Tory deal says Foster Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott Chancellor Hammond in Brexit visit to NI Reality Check: The important bits of the political declaration She added: ""You say: Are we better off?... actually it's a different sort of environment, and a different approach that we'll be taking to things."" Pressed by Emma Barnett to answer the question, she said ""it is going to be different,"" before adding: ""We can build a better future outside the European Union."" The UK and EU have agreed in principlethe framework for their future relations,externaloutlining how UK-EU trade, security and other issues would work. The document, known as the ""political declaration"", is not legally-binding but will be the starting point for negotiations on co-operation after the UK leaves. It has been heavily criticised by many MPs for lacking detail. This is a separate document to the legally-binding withdrawal agreement - setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, including the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said what was on offer in the political declaration was inferior to EU membership, as it would leave the UK bound by the same rules but without control over them. Pedro Sanchez and the 27 other EU leaders will be asked to sign off the agreement on Sunday Theresa May goes back to Brussels on Saturday for more talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker Negotiators try to get an agreement with Spain over Gibraltar EU leaders meet on Sunday to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration If that is agreed Mrs May starts the process of getting MPs to back the deal - most are currently against it If MPs back the deal it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament The UK leaves the EU on 29 March - and trade talks on the future relationship start Meanwhile, EU officials are meeting to try to put the finishing touches to both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. Irish border Brexit plans 'encouraging' Post-Brexit who will lead Europe? The future of Gibraltar and its 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, remains a sticking point. Spain has long contested Britain's 300 year-rule of the peninsula and there are concerns about how the territory's political status and economic ties with the Spanish mainland will be affected by Brexit. This video can not be played What's in the political declaration? Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law and employment law at Trinity College, Cambridge, told the BBC that Spain's room for manoeuvre was limited as the ""divorce"" document only had to be agreed at EU level by qualified majority voting, meaning 20 of the 27 member states.

What happens if MPs reject deal?,"It feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent. On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May DUP may revisit Tory deal says Foster Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? The default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next. Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. Whatever motion the government brings back to Parliament will now have to be amendable, after MPs backed a change to it tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. MPs are hoping this will allow them to vote to rule-out a no-deal Brexit. The government would find it hard to ignore such a vote - but it would not carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? Sir David Natzler (seated, front left) says MPs could vote again But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. Theresa May could try to return to Brussels to renegotiate the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - the main sticking point for many MPs. The government has long insisted this is not an option, because the EU has said the existing deal is final and there is no alternative. Might Brussels give Mrs May some leeway if she loses the vote by a narrowish margin? Some MPs hope she could get behind another version of Brexit at this point. There is support on the Tory benches for a membership of the European Free Trade Area, which would see the UK staying closely linked to the EU, like Norway. This would not be a straightforward move - and would require extensive renegotiation, even if the EU was prepared to contemplate it, and the extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day. Then there is Labour's proposal for a permanent customs union - Mrs May has always ruled that out, but if enough MPs get behind it, it might be an option, although, again, it would need Article 50 to be extended to allow for more talks. Unlikely, given her track record of doggedly ploughing on against the odds - but if she is defeated by a heavy margin on 11 December she may feel she has no other option. There would then be a Tory leadership contest, which would turn into a fight to the death between the Leave and Remain wings of the party, with profound effects on the future of Brexit and, indeed, the country. Jacob Rees-Mogg's band of Brexiteers famously failed to reach the magic 48 letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest last month. But if she tries to cling on after a significant defeat on 11 December, more MPs could add their names to the list, forcing a no-confidence vote that she might struggle to win. MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by thePolitical Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000,external. TheElectoral Commission's,externalrecommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day. This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks. So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree. This is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem"" of a deadlocked parliament. That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later. Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government - Labour has said they will table such a motion if Mrs May loses on 11 December. This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it. This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in. Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process. Instead, she faces a fraught few days and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons.

Brexit: A really simple guide,"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

Banksy art works seized in BelgiumArt works worth â¬15m (Â£12m) are impounded as they may not have been insured.Europe,"The exhibition included a version of Banksy's famous Girl With Balloon Art works by street artist Banksy have been seized by Belgian authorities after an exhibitor showing them realised they might not be insured. Some 58 pieces worth millions of euros had gone on display in an empty supermarket space in Brussels. The exhibitor told the authorities the works might not be covered in case of damage or theft, their lawyer said. The move comes amid a rights dispute between Banksy's former agent and a German firm over the works. The display, Banksy Unauthorised, is said to have been put together without the artist's involvement and was being shown by Belgian exhibitor Strokar. The works, worth â¬15m (Â£12m), were seized late on Thursday and include paintings, photos and silkscreens in a collection put together by Banksy's former agent, Steve Lazarides. Among the works being shown was a version of the famous image Girl With Balloon. Nature's hilarious moments win prizes Leaning Tower of Pisa 'now leaning less' The Thai farmer who became BFFs with a buffalo A German-based firm, On Entertainment, acting as an intermediary, invited Strokar to exhibit the works in the Belgian capital, Strokar's lawyer Stanislas Eskenazi told the AFP news agency. The firm said it had the rights and permits to show the works, but it was not clear under what conditions those rights were granted or whether the works were insured, he added. This video can not be played The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post After lawyers for Mr Lazarides alleged the works were being displayed illegally, and amid the doubts whether they were insured, Mr Eskenazi said his clients opted to leave it to the courts to rule on the dispute between Mr Lazarides and On Entertainment. ""My client is a small non-profit which only provided an exhibition space. It wanted to protect itself against an enormous risk,"" Mr Eskenazi said. A Belgian court must decide on the matter in the next few months. The works are currently being held by bailiffs.

Brexit deal 'better than staying in EU',"Ahead of the 2016 referendum, Philip Hammond was a committed Remainer Chancellor Philip Hammond has insisted that the prime minister's Brexit deal is better than remaining in the EU. He said the deal respected the result of the 2016 referendum and offered ""the best compromise possible"". European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the deal at a summit on Sunday. It comes after Spain, which threatened to miss the summit, was reassured over objections it had raised about Gibraltar. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has now received enough reassurances from the UK government over the issue. Mrs May flies into Brussels later to hold talks with top EU officials, ahead of the summit. This video can not be played Dominic Raab told Today the proposed Brexit deal is worse than EU membership The UK is scheduled to depart the EU on 29 March 2019. The terms of the UK's withdrawal have been under negotiation since June 2016 following a referendum in which 51.9% voted to leave the EU. Even if the EU approves the deal, it still has to be passed by the UK Parliament, with many MPs having stated their opposition. Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), has already stated the party will not back the Brexit deal - and is expected to reiterate her position at this weekend's annual conference in Belfast. She will say the withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Ireland's long-term economic or strategic interests. Mrs May relies on the DUP, whose 10 MPs help the minority Conservative government to pass legislation. The DUP has threatened to look again at the agreement with the Conservatives if the Brexit deal gets through Parliament. DUP Chief Whip Jeffrey Donaldson denied the party would walk away from its agreement - but told the BBC the party was ""very unhappy"" with the withdrawal agreement. DUP urges PM to 'bin the backstop' Brexit: Simple answers to key questions A guide to where we are with Brexit The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Philip Hammond told Today he was hopeful of a solution with the DUP. The deal on offer was the ""best way of Britain leaving the EU with the minimum negative impact on the economy,"" he said. The chancellor said the deal was better than remaining in the EU because it honoured the referendum result and offered ""the best compromise possible... satisfying both sides"" of the Brexit argument. ""If we want this country to be successful in the future, we have got to bring it back together after this process,"" he said. By Leila Nathoo, BBC political correspondent Ministers' hard sell of the Brexit deal continues - this morning it was Philip Hammond's turn. He's been trying to reassure the DUP over their concerns about the Irish border - but he also had a message for MPs thinking of voting against the deal in the Commons. Don't - or chaos will be unleashed. Warnings about the economic consequences of a Parliamentary rejection will remind some of what was dubbed 'Project Fear' during the referendum campaign. The chancellor's suggestion that there is no alternative can be seen as a dismissal of those critics - the DUP, Tory Brexiteers - who think there is still a chance of renegotiation. Meanwhile, former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers - a Leave campaigner in 2016 - has said she will vote against the withdrawal agreement. ""I do not believe it is in the national interest,"" she told Today. She said ""every effort should continue to be made to try and reach a better agreement"" but failing that, Theresa May ""should walk away"". But Mr Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit would unleash ""economic chaos"". ""If the meaningful vote [in Parliament] is lost we are in uncharted territory,"" he said. On Saturday, Mrs May will meet the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk for talks. Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents: The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship may be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally-binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" - a way to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus. This video can not be played What's in the political declaration? Spain raised last-minute objections to how the issue of Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents - had been handled in the Brexit talks so far. Spain has long-held ambitions to bring the territory back under Spanish rule, and there's growing concern about how their economic ties with the territory will be affected by Brexit. Mr Sanchez is pro-European and it is not in his nature to scupper EU plans, the BBC's Katya Adler said Although one country on its own cannot stop the withdrawal agreement being approved, there is ""no way the EU can rubber-stamp a text when an existing member is so strongly opposed"", said BBC News Europe editor Katya Adler. Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? Gibraltar: What's it got to do with Brexit? France, Denmark and the Netherlands had raised concerns over what the political declaration said about fishing rights in UK waters - but this issue is understood to have been resolved. If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it. A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December. Labour,the SNPtheLiberal Democrats,the DUPand Plaid Cymru have all said they will vote against the government's deal, as well as many Conservatives. What happens if MPs reject Theresa May's deal? On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement. But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"". Meanwhile,the Telegraph said,externalit has seen leaked Cabinet papers which suggest the PM is planning to ""reframe the Brexit debate around migration"" - by planning restrictions on low-skilled migrants coming to the UK - in a bid to attract the support of Brexiteers. This video can not be played Michael: ""What in your honest opinion is better for the UK, your deal or the deal we had if we stayed in the EU?"" Yes. After the 2017 general election, Mrs May's Conservative Party got 318 seats - four short of the number she needed to rule with a majority government. The DUP formed a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories, promising that its 10 MPs would vote with the government, and therefore enable it to win key votes in Parliament. Please upgrade your browser The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the ""backstop"" - the last resort back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens. It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal.

European Union set to agree Brexit deal,"European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal at a summit on Sunday. It comes after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez received assurances from the UK government over Gibraltar, and dropped his threat to boycott the summit. He said he had received the written guarantees he needed over Spain's role in the future of the British territory. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived in Brussels and held talks with top EU officials, ahead of the summit. Meanwhile, former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would become a ""satellite state"" under the deal. 'Junk the backstop' - Boris Johnson Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The terms of the UK's withdrawal have been under negotiation since June 2016 following a referendum in which 51.9% voted to leave the EU. Even if the EU approves the deal, it still has to be passed by the UK Parliament, with many MPs having stated their opposition. Spain had raised last-minute objections ahead of the summit about how the issue of Gibraltar had been handled in the Brexit talks so far. But EU leaders secured a compromise with the Spanish prime minister, who said that Europe and the UK ""had accepted the conditions set down by Spain"" and so would ""vote in favour of Brexit"". Mr Tusk, who represents EU leaders on the world stage, said he recommended ""that we approve on Sunday the outcome of the Brexit negotiations"" in a letter to members of the European Council. He added: ""No-one has reasons to be happy. But at least at this critical time, the EU 27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity."" Mrs May met the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Mr Tusk for talks on Saturday evening. Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents: The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship may be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work. The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" - a way to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus. This video can not be played What's in the political declaration? If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in the UK Parliament to back it. A vote is expected in December.Labour, theLiberal Democrats,the SNPandthe DUPhave all said they will vote against the government's deal, as well as many Conservatives. BBC News political correspondent Ben Wrighthas said Mrs May ""faces an incredibly hard job""getting the deal passed by MPs. Spain threatened to derail the Brexit deal over concerns about its role in future trade arrangements involving Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents. But the UK published a letter it had sent to Spain reassuring it over the withdrawal agreement. After holding emergency talks with Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker, the Spanish prime minister dropped his threat. Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? Gibraltar: What's it got to do with Brexit? Mr Sanchez said: ""Gibraltar is excluded from the general negotiation of the European Union with the United Kingdom. ""This gives the chance to Spain to have direct negotiations with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar."" This video can not be played 'I will always stand by Gibraltar' - May Spain's foreign minister Josep Borrell said the assurance was""the most important"" development since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713,external, which ceded Gibraltar to Britain. But BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said that the UK's letter does not contain anything substantially different from the withdrawal agreement. He said there was a suspicion that Spanish ministers were ""showboating a little for the domestic electorate"" on the eve of elections in Andalusia, in the south of Spain, where Gibraltar is a significant issue. Theresa May said discussions with Spain have been ""constructive and sensible"" but that the UK's position on Gibraltar will not change. She said: ""I'm proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar."" This video can not be played Why Gibraltar is British - in 60 seconds Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo also played down Spain's claims about the UK's guarantees. He said: ""What you have heard from the Spanish prime minister was not a reflection of any new position, however much he tried to present it as such."" The former foreign secretary told Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) conference that the UK was on the verge of ""making a historic mistake"". Mr Johnson said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and there was still time to work for a better deal. This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the DUP conference that agreeing to the Brexit deal would be an historic mistake Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. The DUP has threatened to look again at the agreement with the Conservatives if the Brexit deal gets through Parliament. But Mr Johnson said it was ""absolutely vital that we keep this partnership going"" to avoid Labour coming to power. The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the ""backstop"" - the back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens. It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.

She urged the government to secure a better deal for Northern Ireland, adding: ""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say."" Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted that the prime minister's Brexit deal is better than remaining in the EU. He said the deal respected the result of the 2016 referendum and offered ""the best compromise possible"". He added that he was hopeful of a solution with the DUP. This video can not be played Michael: ""What in your honest opinion is better for the UK, your deal or the deal we had if we stayed in the EU?"" On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.

Sweet shop shut down after drugs raid,"Police took away dozens of jars of sweets fearing they could be laced with amphetamine and sold to children A sweet shop has been shut down and its entire stock of confectionery seized in a drugs raid. Acting on a tip-off, officers and sniffer dogs raided the Convenience Store in South Moor, near Stanley. White powder, thought to be amphetamine, was taken and dozens jars of sweets removed from the shop, which is near a nursery, Durham police said. A 50-year-old woman and a man, 56, have been arrested on suspicion of being involved in drug dealing. A spokesman for the force said: ""Families with children were regular customers at the premises, which is right in the heart of the village and straight opposite a nursery. ""We have confiscated the contents of the shop because we couldn't take the risk that some of those loose sweets might become contaminated with a potentially dangerous substance.

Legal aid lawyers win pay rise after strike,"A 1% increase on all fees will also come into effect alongside the new scheme The government has announced an extra Â£23m spending for barristers' trial fees in serious criminal cases, such as robbery, rape and murder. It comes afterbarristers went on strikein protest at a new system for determining their legal aid payments for defending people in Crown Courts. The Criminal Bar Association, which led the strikes, welcomed the announcement. However, some of its members warned the funding boost is only a temporary ""sticking plaster"". In April, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) introduced a new system for determining fees for legal aid work called theAdvocates' Graduated Fee Scheme (AGFS),external. The system created bands for payments, with murder and manslaughter attracting the highest payments, but some barristers said the fees were too low. The new system, along with existing concerns, prompted a period of industrial action by some criminal barristers. In an attempt to resolve the issue, the government announced plans to increase spending on the AGFS by Â£15m in August. Following a consultation, this amount has been increased by a further Â£8m. Murder case delayed by strikes Why English courts are opening in the EU Barristers take industrial action over legal aid cuts Announcing the move, Lord Chancellor David Gauke also pledged to bring forward a 1% increase on all fees to come into effect alongside the new scheme. Mr Gauke said: ""Criminal defence advocates play a crucial role in upholding the rule of law, and it is vital that their pay adequately reflects the work they do in a fair and sustainable way."" Chris Henley QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), said: ""After years of deep cuts across the criminal justice system, significant investment is urgently required to address an increasing crisis, which is impacting profoundly on the retention and diversity of junior criminal barristers."" The Law Society echoed the CBA, adding that ""advocacy in the Crown Courts is only one small part of the system"". The body's president, Christina Blacklaws, urged the MoJ to revise its approach to the AGFS, as well as fees paid for work undertaken in the magistrates' court and police station to ""ensure solicitors are fairly paid for the work they have to do"". Junior barrister and CBA member Jo Cecil told the BBC the extra funding was welcome but added: ""It's very much a first step. It's a sticking plaster."" There is a ""real danger"" that people will not be properly represented in court, she said. Ms Cecil explained: ""The fee structure means that during a trial, you can basically be working for less than the minimum wage for all intents and purposes, so senior barristers won't take those cases on.""

DUP urges PM to 'bin the backstop',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the DUP conference that agreeing to the Brexit deal would be an historic mistake The UK is on the verge of making a historic mistake if it does not ""junk the backstop"", Boris Johnson has said. He told the DUP conference the EU had made NI an ""indispensable bargaining chip"" in the Brexit negotiations. DUP leader Arlene Foster said a Brexit deal that includes the backstop plan is ""not in the national interest"". There has been political opposition among unionists to the government's plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border. It would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules if it took effect. European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal at a summit on Sunday. The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea. Brexit deal: NI business and farming community reacts to proposals Reality Check: Brexit withdrawal agreement - what it all means Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Mr Johnson is one of two senior Conservative MPs to appear at the conference this weekend, after Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke on Friday night. ""We must agree that neither side will introduce a hard border in Northern Ireland,"" he said. The former foreign secretary said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and that there is still time to work for a better deal. ""In the words of that great Northern Irish singer Van Morrison, it is time we all moved from the dark end of the street to the bright side of the road,"" he added, to applause. He said he hoped the DUP and Conservatives could continue working together, ""backing our union against all those who would seek to divide us"". by Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter What do Star Wars, sardines and the Titanic all have in common? Answer: They all somehow ended up getting a mention in Boris Johnson's speech at the DUP conference (yes, really). It certainly wasn't a normal party conference, but these are unusual times. There was standing room only as the politician, who often brings a rock star flavour to events, took to the stage. That being said, while much of what he said received roars of applause, my colleague Gareth Gordon noticed one woman asleep in the front row. But even getting Mr Johnson to appear at the conference will be seen as a victory for the DUP, in its attempt to resist the government's path for Brexit. Before party leader Arlene Foster was announced to the stage, one DUP councillor described her as ""a lady who's not for turning"". But with Theresa May also holding firm against the DUP's opposition to the backstop so far, soon enough someone's going to have to give. Mr Johnson also suggested the creation of a secretary of state for ""no deal"" on World Trade Organisation terms, ""with real powers across Whitehall to make things happen"". ""I do not believe that we will exit without a deal - that is totally unnecessary - but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations,"" he added. Mrs Foster told her party's conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used. The government has said it is looking at alternative arrangements to ensure the backstop is a last resort. This video can not be played Brexit: Arlene Foster says choice 'not between this deal and no deal' But, Mrs Foster said there were ""many contradictions"" in the draft withdrawal agreement. She said she understood the position of many in the business community, who have urged DUP MPs to back the deal. But she added that the party could not wish away proposals that it believes are not in the best interests of Northern Ireland's economy or interests. ""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say,"" she said. Ahead of the party conference, Mrs Foster warned that if the deal gets passed in parliament, her party may have to revisit its confidence-and-supply pact with the Conservatives. The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament. It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure. On Saturday, she said ""the DUP had never been afraid to say yes when it is right to do so, nor to say no when required"". Earlier, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party would ""stand firm in the face of inevitable onslaught"" in opposing the government's Brexit plan. Mr Dodds told the party's conference: ""Prime minister - bin the backstop."" Nigel Dodds was addressing the Democratic Unionist Party conference Mr Dodds told the conference that the union is ""non-negotiable"". He described Theresa May's draft plan as portraying a ""pitiful and pathetic place for the United Kingdom"". The government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario. Mr Dodds added that the DUP wanted to leave the EU with a deal, but ""not a deal at any price"". Philip Hammond had a series of engagements in Northern Ireland on Friday before attending the DUP conference On Friday, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop. He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down. The government of Gibraltar is also represented at the DUP conference. Gibraltar has become involved in the Brexit debateas Spain sought written assurances from the UK that it would be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory. This video can not be played Brexit agreement: What does the 585-page document say? Donald Tusk recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez received assurances from the UK government over Gibraltar, and dropped his threat to boycott the summit. On Saturday, the government of Gibraltar said the territory ""will not fold"" over Brexit and staunchly supports the union. Housing and equality minister Samantha Sacramento told the DUP conference Gibraltar would ""not be bullied"".

Brexit: Back to basics guide,"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted.

"Police link crime rise with benefits changesA Police Scotland report says there is ""anecdotal evidence"" that universal credit has helped push up the number of robberies.Scotland","Universal credit has proved controversial since it was introduced Police Scotland has claimed UK government benefit changes may be linked to a rise in robberies. A force report,externalsaid welfare reform, including the introduction of universal credit, may have helped push robberies up by 30% over the five-year average. There were 880 robberies throughout Scotland between April and June, an increase of 12% on the previous summer. The Department for Work and Pensions said there was ""no firm evidence"" to link any trends to changes in welfare. All 13 Police Scotland divisions produced ""robbery problem profiles"" as part of its overall crime report for April to September. What is universal credit - and what's the problem? It said robberies were up by 8.4% (68 crimes) on the previous year and up 23.3% (166 crimes) on the five-year average. However, that was an improvement on the April to June period, when robberies were up 12.5% (50 crimes) on the previous year and up 30.5% (105 crimes) on the five-year average. The Scottish Police Authority report says an increase in the price of illegal drugs also contributed to the rise in robbery rates. It states: ""Analysis conducted during August 2018 has not identified a discernible pattern, although anecdotal evidence from intelligence suggests that a combination of increased drug prices due to police enforcement, and changes to welfare systems, may have contributed to an increase in crimes of dishonesty and robbery."" Universal credit, which is being rolled out across the UK, has proved controversial with reports of IT issues, massive overspends and administrative problems.

"VW recalls 75,000 cars to fix seatbeltThe move follows a test that showed a rear seatbelt failing when cars turned sharply.Business","Volkswagen said affected customers would be contacted Volkswagen will recall about 75,000 of its VW Polo and Seat Ibiza and Arona cars after a seatbelt fault was exposed by a Finnish car magazine test drive. A new fix would be offered to affected UK owners from Monday, VW said. The test drive in Finland showed that when three passengers were in the back seats and the car turned sharply, the centre-rear seatbelt failed. VW said the tests were under ""exceptional"" conditions and had not been replicated or reported elsewhere. However, consumer group Which questioned why Volkswagen had sold close to 55,000 additional cars with a ""potentially lethal fault"" since the problem was first identified in May. An earlier cable tie solution and an ""informal recall"" were rejected by regulators. Alex Neill, Which's head of home products and services, said: ""The decision not to suspend sales when the problem was discovered has now put substantially more drivers, as well as their passengers, at risk."" Nobody has been injured because of the fault. The car maker defended its communication of the issue to car dealers and customers as it became aware its fix would not be good enough to satisfy the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency. ""These specific communications - both of the issue and the relevant steps to take - with all of our affected customers were felt to be more effective than a statement on a website,"" a VW spokesperson said. ""Given the limited circumstances in which the seatbelt can (in the test conditions) come unbuckled, and the employment of the interim fix and further still the specific warnings provided to users, there is no materially increased risk. It is on that basis that sales continued."" Volkswagen said affected customers would be contacted and could drop their cars off to VW retailers to arrange the fix, free of charge.

Boy with rare condition 'upset' over toy,"George, 10, with his beloved Kangaroo on the day he lost it A boy who has battled through years of surgery with his trusted companion - a toy kangaroo - has been left devastated after his cuddly friend went missing. George Fawkes, 10, lost Kangaroo while travelling to a hospital appointment in Bristol on 16 November. The youngster, who has a form of dwarfism, requires regular surgery, and always takes the toy with him. George's mother, Gilda, of King's Lynn, Norfolk, said George had been ""so upset"" since Kangaroo went missing. She is offering a reward for the safe return of the cuddly toy. George, who has Floating-Harbor Syndrome, was born in Australia. He was given the toy - which has faded boxing gloves and his name sewn into the back - by a nurse. He was on his way to the Bristol Children's Hospital when he lost his beloved toy, sending his mother ""into a complete panic"". George recovering from surgery with Kangaroo by his side in hospital Mrs Fawkes, 50, who is George's full-time carer, said she nodded off on the train so did not initially notice Kangaroo was missing. ""We got off at Bath Spa to show George the Christmas lights,"" she said. ""He was acting a bit funny but finally admitted Kangaroo had fallen under the seat and because I was napping, he hadn't told me."" Graffiti menace is 'not Les Dennis' Locked-up police-bite puppy released Photographers snap a touch of frost The mother-of-four immediately contacted GWR train company but was told the lost property section at Bristol Temple Meads can receive ""up to 3,000 items a day"". ""Staff have said they will keep a special eye out for Kangaroo but I'm a bit concerned it could be overlooked because at first glance, it looks like a teddy bear,"" she said. ""We do have a spare one but it looks brand new and George doesn't want it."" George has rejected a replacement toy, which is not as worn as his favourite Mrs Fawkes has delayed her son's next round of surgery until after Christmas in the hope Kangaroo will be found. ""I'm worried it could affect his recovery,"" she said. ""Every time George has an operation, we make sure Kangaroo is on the recovery table when he wakes up. ""For parents who lose their child's favourite cuddly toy, it's devastating, but for George it's a level deeper. He's really very upset.""

Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied allegations Russia was behind the Salisbury spy poisoning Russia is now a ""far greater threat"" to the UK's national security than the Islamic State group, the head of the British army has said. In aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalGeneral Mark Carleton-Smith said Britain ""cannot be complacent about the threat Russia poses"". ""The Russians seek to exploit vulnerability and weakness wherever they detect it,"" he said. The UK blames Russia for the Salisbury poisoning and several cyber-attacks. In March, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yuliasurvived being poisonedwith Novichok. Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. Gen Carleton-Smith's comments follow similar remarks made earlier this year by theUK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.,external In October, the UK government alsoaccused Russia's GRU military intelligence serviceof being behind four high-profile cyber-attacks on targets including the US Democratic Party and a small TV network in Britain. Russia denies any involvement in the Skripal poisoning and has described cyber-attack accusations as a ""rich fantasy"". Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious In his first interview since being appointed Chief of the General Staff in June, Gen Carleton-Smith said Russia is ""indisputably"" a bigger threat than Islamic terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and IS. ""Russia has embarked on a systematic effort to explore and exploit Western vulnerabilities, particularly in some of the non-traditional areas of cyber, space, undersea warfare,"" he said. ""We cannot be complacent about the threat Russia poses or leave it uncontested."" The Russian Embassy responded by poking fun at his comments. Allow Twitter content?

""In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18. ""If an individual is assessed to be under 18 but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example, by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case."" Earlier this month, a pupil at Stoke High shared an image on social media with the message: ""How's there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?"" The school, which initially contacted the Home Office, previously said it had ""followed government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any asylum admissions matter"". It added the pupil ""was not attending the school at this time"". Ipswich MP Sandy Martin said: ""I'm under the impression that both the school and the Home Office are not going to speak to anybody about this. ""I also do respect the privacy of the family and I believe that the younger of the two young people left the school because of the threat or danger that they might be seriously bullied. ""The whole thing is very unfortunate all round and the Home Office do have a duty to make sure people are the right age before people are sent to school."" One concerned parent, Victoria Newby, previously told the BBC: ""My girls will not be attending until I know for sure he's been removed."" Locked-up police-bite puppy released Albert Square to Advent star Boy with rare condition ""upset"" over toy But mother-of-three Victoria Thorpe said she would not be taking her 11-year-old son out of the school.

Veteran Tory Eurosceptic given knighthoodLabour suggests the timing of the honour could be an attempt to win support for the PM's Brexit deal.UK Politics,"The Conservative backbench MP John Hayes has been granted a knighthood. Number 10 said the Queen had approved the honour for the South Holland and The Deepings MP, who was a transport minister until a reshuffle in January. Sir John, a long-standing sceptic about the UK's membership of the EU, has been critical of the PM's Brexit deal. Labour shadow minister Chris Matheson said it would be an ""act of desperation"" for the PM ""to be giving away knighthoods"" to win deal backing. The prime minister is due to travel to Brussels on Saturday ahead of the EU summit on Sunday, when the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement is due to be signed off. EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? Sir John - a Eurosceptic - has told the Sun,externalthat the honour has no bearing on how he will vote on the deal. Speaking to his local newspaper,external, Spalding Today, Sir John said he was ""immensely proud"" to receive the knighthood. ""I am very proud to be MP for the area in which I live - I see it as something for everyone in the area, not just for me,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

The awarding of a knighthood to an MP outside of the usual New Year's and Queen's birthday honours lists is not unprecedented. Conservative ex-defence minister Mike Penning and ex-whip Robert Syms lost their roles in the post-election reshuffle in 2017 and were given knighthoods months later. Former cabinet minister Eric Pickles, who was a casualty of David Cameron's reshuffle following the Tories' 2015 general election victory,received his knighthood later that year. Sir John served in a series of ministerial roles from 2010 to January 2018 and was Home Office security minister from May 2015 to June 2016, while Mrs May was home secretary. The Queen has also approved the appointment of Tory deputy chief whip Christopher Pincher and Labour whip Mark Tami to the Privy Council, Downing Street said.

Syrian DJ: 'He knew he wouldn't die quietly in his bed',"Raed Fares' radio station defied threats from jihadist groups and resisted orders to stop playing music A prominent Syrian radio journalist has been shot dead by gunmen in the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib. Raed Fares, a well-known Syrian activist, was killed in the north-western town of Kafranbel. It was not the first time the founder of Radio Fresh, an independent radio station broadcasting from inside opposition-held areas in the country, had been targeted. His activism had earned the ire of both militants and the Syrian government. Four years ago, two gunmen for the Islamic State (IS) militant group shattered several bones and punctured his lung in a failed attempt to silence Fares. More attempts on his life would follow and yet the former estate agent was determined to carry on. A sarcastic response to Syria's militants Why does the battle for Idlib matter? Sense of an ending for Syria's war on Idlib front line ""He was very much aware that he should not expect to die quietly in his bed,"" French journalist Nicolas Henin told the BBC. Henin, who described Fares as ""one of the most impressive leaders of the Syrian revolution"", explained that even with the constant threats, his friend had refused to carry a weapon. ""It was nothing for himself and because his fight was just dedicated to the people, and to the welfare of all groups, all society,"" he said. ""I think he believed that that was his best protection."" It was not just Fares the militants took issue with. The radio station - with its music and female presenters - also angered the groups which overran the town and surrounding area. Four years ago, when IS had a presence in Idlib province, the station's office was raided by militants.  In 2016, Fares was detained by the Nusra Front, the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance (HTS), which currently controls most of Idlib province, had ordered Radio Fresh to stop broadcasting music. Allow Twitter content?

The station's response was to play long sequences of other sounds, such as tweeting birds, clucking chickens and bleating goats. ""They tried to force us to stop playing music on air,"" Farestold the BBC in 2017. ""So we started to play animals in the background as a kind of sarcastic gesture against them."" Later, the station began to introduce further defiant sounds including bongs from London's Big Ben clock, ticking sounds, ringing explosions and chanting football fans. Another group, the now-dissolved Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, once instructed the radio station to take women off the air. Instead of complying, Fares told the BBC's Mike Thomson about his creative solution to get round the issue. ""We simply put their voices through a computer software programme which makes them sound like men,"" he said. But, despite these battles, Fares never forgot the reason he had first gone out on to the streets back in 2011. Up until the end, he remained a vocal critic of President Bashar al-Assad, the man who has clung to power through seven years of civil war. In his final Facebook post, Fares described a protest in Kafranbel on 5 October calling for the end of Mr Assad's reign. ""The people of Kafranbel are in Huriyah [Freedom] Square and voices are chanting: The people want the downfall of the regime. We started this in 2011 and we are continuing on. Our loyalty to the martyrs and detainees has increased our determination."" In the end, he did not live to see the end of the war.  Radio Fresh's Facebook page posted a graphic photo of Fares' body on 23 November, along with an image of the body of Hammoud Juneid, another activist who was shot dead. Dozens of people gathered for their funerals the same day as news of his death began to filter out to the wider world, leading to an outpouring of grief on social media from activists and international journalists.

Grenade man held before French fuel protest,"This video can not be played Thousands march in France over diesel tax A man armed with a grenade demanding protesters be given an audience with French President Emmanuel Macron has been arrested in western France. The man, who was wearing a yellow jacket like the hi-visibility jackets worn by protesters, surrendered after several hours' negotiation in Angers. The incident comes as Paris readies itself for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters taking part in a second weekend of demonstrations. They are protesting at fuel prices. Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Much of the anger is directed towards President Emmanuel Macron, who is accused of being out of touch. Police were first alerted to the incident at about 16:45 local time (15:45 GMT) on Friday, with the man finally surrendering just before 22:30. According to local police, the 45-year-old was holding a grenade in his hands, demanding ""the yellow vests be received at the ÃlysÃ©e"" Palace, the president's official residence in Paris. The man was in a car park in Angers The man had spent the afternoon with a group of protesters who had gathered near the Espace Anjou shopping centre, local official Bernard Gonzalez said, according to news agency AFP. The explosive device, which is currently being inspected by experts, was ""not fake"", Mr Gonzalez added, saying ""there was real risk"" to those around him. The protesters have distanced themselves from the unidentified man. A smaller number of protesters wearing yellow jackets - giving the movement its name, ""gilet jaune"" - have been setting up road blocks around the country since the main demonstrations last weekend. But the number of protesters is expected to rise again on Saturday, with Paris bracing itself for the arrival of people from all over France by train and coach. Reuters news agency says as many as 30,000 are expected in the capital, with other protests expected elsewhere. About 3,000 police officers have been brought in to work in Paris alone - dealing not just with the yellow jacket protest, but also another against sexual violence, as well as football and rugby matches. by Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris This is a protest from the social media age,  which means there are no real leaders, no real demands, and no-one is quite sure how many will turn up or where in Paris. They've been offered rallying-points by the Eiffel Tower and in two big squares in the east of Paris, but there are fears that without any focus,  the protesters could break up into myriad small groups - much harder to manage especially if, as is far from impossible, trouble-makers try to join their ranks. Smaller groups of protesters have gathered throughout the week The protest may be amorphous, but the anger is real enough. Its heartland is what's become known here as the France of the periphery: that is, the thousands of small towns across the country where people depend heavily on cars to get to work and to shop - and feel their values are ignored by the sophisticated rule makers of the capital. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP reports. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. The president has blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise. He also said more tax on fossil fuels was needed to fund renewable energy investments. Some 280,000 people took part in protests at more than 2,000 locations across France on Saturday, with demonstrations spilling over into Sunday. The protests left two dead and more than 600 injured, according to the interior ministry. At least 50 people were also arrested, although most of the protests took place without incident. Several of the injuries came when drivers tried to force their way through protesters. Chantal Mazet, 63, was killed in the south-eastern Savoy region when a driver who was taking her daughter to hospital panicked at being blocked by about 50 demonstrators, who were striking the roof of her vehicle, and drove into them. The protests spilled over into a second day The driver has been charged with manslaughter and released on bail, prosecutors said. About 3,500 people stayed out on Saturday in what Interior Minister Christophe Castaner called a ""restive"" night. In Paris, protesters approaching the ÃlysÃ©e Palace were repelled with tear gas.

Taiwan votes on same-sex marriage,"This video can not be played Wang Tien-ming and Ho Hsiang have been together for 33 years Taiwan has been voting in a referendum on whether to become the first place in Asia to legalise gay marriage. The top court ruled in favour of same-sex marriage, giving parliament two years to amend laws or pass new ones. But surveys last week suggest the island will vote against the change. The issue is one of 10 voters are being asked to consider, including one inflaming tensions with China: how they want to be called at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Taiwan or Chinese Taipei. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Taiwan profile Currently, Taiwan competes as Chinese Taipei, the name agreed with China in the 1980s. This is because Taiwan's status is sensitive. The island has been self-ruling since 1949 but China regards it as a breakaway province it will reunite with one day. The referendums are running alongside local elections. Polls close at 16:00 local time (08:00 GMT), with the first results expected later on Saturday. The issue is actually the subject of two separate referendums on Saturday, which have been put forward by rival groups. Conservative groups have asked whether marriage should be legally defined as between a man and a woman, while LGBT activists have put forward one for equal marriage rights. A rally held in support of same-sex marriage was attended by thousands The two sides have also put other issues to voters, including rival questions on education around LGBT issues in schools. According to a survey carried out by the Taiwan Public Opinions Foundation, 77% of respondents believe marriage should be legally defined as between a man and a woman. The government has said the vote will not affect it bringing inthe changes required by the court rulingmore than 18 months ago. But campaigners fear it will mean the eventual legislation will be weaker. ""We hope that love and equality will win,"" Suki Chung, East Asia campaigner at human rights group Amnesty International told news agency AFP. ""However, if the opposite happens then the government must not use the result as cover to water down same-sex marriage proposals."" Nearly 21,000 candidates are vying for 11,000 elected positions, from mayors to city councillors and township chiefs. President Tsai Ing-wen (centre) voted in New Taipei City Looming over the elections is Taiwan's fraught relationship with China, the BBC's Cindy Sui reports from Taipei. SincePresident Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence DPP came to office in 2016, relations have deteriorated. Beijing has refused to deal with her because she does not recognise an agreement reached between the two sides in 1992 that both sides are part of one China. And that has heightened military tensions, fuelled a loss of Taiwan's diplomatic allies and hurt the economy, our correspondent says.

"Dire warning on US climate change impactsClimate change could cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage health, a major report warns.","This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns. ""Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today,"" the 4th National Climate Assessment says. The report saysclimate change is ""presenting growing challenges,externalto human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth"". The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda. By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week,Donald Trump tweeted, ""whatever happened to global warming?"",external Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss' question in comprehensive detail. Global warming is here in the US, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic. The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida. And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation. With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life. The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was ""largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population"". The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite CO2 cuts ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,"" the report says. ""Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."" The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ""to adapt to the changes that will occur"". Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action. Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not ""some problem in the distant future"". ""It's happening right now in every part of the country,"" she said. This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice. ""While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm,"" she said. Former US Vice-President Al Gore, a prominent climate change campaigner, accused the White House of trying to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday - the unofficial start of America's Christmas shopping season. ""Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the west, hurricanes batter our coasts - and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical US assessment of the climate crisis,"" Mr Gore said. ""The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible."" In October,President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a ""political agenda"", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was ""a hoax"". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: ""I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."" A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops. If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

"Met probed over scooter chase crashesOfficers can use their vehicles to knock moped thieves off their bikes, the Met Police has said.London","This video can not be played The Met said drivers aim to end pursuits before riders or members of the public are injured The Met Police has published footage of officers knocking suspected criminals off scooters, at the same time as the watchdog is investigating some crashes. Videos released by the force show police cars being driven into riders. The Met says it has cut scooter crime by 36% this year. However, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it is investigating three cases involving ""tactical contact"" by Met police cars on scooters. The number of offences involving scooters has fallen since specialists teams were set up to tackle the problem. In January 2018 to October 2018 there were 12,419 offences, 7,036 fewer than the same period in 2017. Police officers can use their vehicles to knock moped thieves off their bikes, the Met Police said The Met says drivers are specially trained and aim to end pursuits before riders or members of the public are injured. A spokesperson said the tactic is not new but is being used more often by its most highly trained drivers working on Operation Venice; the team set up to tackle scooter gangs. According to the IOPC, one of the cases being investigated involved a 17-year-old boy who suffered head injuries a year ago in Bexley. However, none of the three cases involved officers involved with Operation Venice. Can Chicago cure London's violence?

'He knew he wouldn't die quietly in his bed',"Raed Fares' radio station defied threats from jihadist groups and resisted orders to stop playing music A prominent Syrian radio journalist has been shot dead by gunmen in the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib. Raed Fares, a well-known Syrian activist, was killed in the north-western town of Kafranbel. It was not the first time the founder of Radio Fresh, an independent radio station broadcasting from inside opposition-held areas in the country, had been targeted. His activism had earned the ire of both militants and the Syrian government. Four years ago, two gunmen for the Islamic State (IS) militant group shattered several bones and punctured his lung in a failed attempt to silence Fares. More attempts on his life would follow and yet the former estate agent was determined to carry on. A sarcastic response to Syria's militants Why does the battle for Idlib matter? Sense of an ending for Syria's war on Idlib front line ""He was very much aware that he should not expect to die quietly in his bed,"" French journalist Nicolas Henin told the BBC. Henin, who described Fares as ""one of the most impressive leaders of the Syrian revolution"", explained that even with the constant threats, his friend had refused to carry a weapon. ""It was nothing for himself and because his fight was just dedicated to the people, and to the welfare of all groups, all society,"" he said. ""I think he believed that that was his best protection."" It was not just Fares the militants took issue with. The radio station - with its music and female presenters - also angered the groups which overran the town and surrounding area. Four years ago, when IS had a presence in Idlib province, the station's office was raided by militants.  In 2016, Fares was detained by the Nusra Front, the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance (HTS), which currently controls most of Idlib province, had ordered Radio Fresh to stop broadcasting music. Allow Twitter content?

The station's response was to play long sequences of other sounds, such as tweeting birds, clucking chickens and bleating goats. ""They tried to force us to stop playing music on air,"" Farestold the BBC in 2017. ""So we started to play animals in the background as a kind of sarcastic gesture against them."" Later, the station began to introduce further defiant sounds including bongs from London's Big Ben clock, ticking sounds, ringing explosions and chanting football fans. Another group, the now-dissolved Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, once instructed the radio station to take women off the air. Instead of complying, Fares told the BBC's Mike Thomson about his creative solution to get round the issue. ""We simply put their voices through a computer software programme which makes them sound like men,"" he said. But, despite these battles, Fares never forgot the reason he had first gone out on to the streets back in 2011. Up until the end, he remained a vocal critic of President Bashar al-Assad, the man who has clung to power through seven years of civil war. In his final Facebook post, Fares described a protest in Kafranbel on 5 October calling for the end of Mr Assad's reign. ""The people of Kafranbel are in Huriyah [Freedom] Square and voices are chanting: The people want the downfall of the regime. We started this in 2011 and we are continuing on. Our loyalty to the martyrs and detainees has increased our determination."" In the end, he did not live to see the end of the war.  Radio Fresh's Facebook page posted a graphic photo of Fares' body on 23 November, along with an image of the body of Hammoud Juneid, another activist who was shot dead. Dozens of people gathered for their funerals the same day as news of his death began to filter out to the wider world, leading to an outpouring of grief on social media from activists and international journalists.

Among the tributes was one from Fadel Abdul Ghany, founder and chairman of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, who revealed he had asked Fares to leave. Fares, however, was not to be moved.

EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May,"This video can not be played Michael: ""What in your honest opinion is better for the UK, your deal or the deal we had if we stayed in the EU?"" Theresa May has said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement. She told a BBC phone-in that there would be just ""more division and uncertainty"" if Parliament voted against the agreement next month. But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"". A summit of EU leaders to sign off the deal will go ahead on Sunday despite ""unresolved"" issues over Gibraltar. Spain is seeking written assurances from the UK that it will be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory. Its prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said he won't decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until these are provided. DUP may revisit Tory deal, says Foster What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? The withdrawal agreement - what it all means He has said his backing for the overall deal cannot be taken for granted although no one country can block the withdrawal agreement on its own at this stage. Meanwhile, the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster,has said she will ""look again"" at her party's dealwith the Conservatives if Mrs May's Brexit bill passes through parliament. ""But we are not there yet,"" Mrs Foster added. This video can not be played Watch in full: Prime Minister Theresa May takes calls on the BBC News Channel and BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Emma Barnett: The PM didn't give clear answers on Brexit Mrs May told the Emma Barnett Show that her job was to persuade MPs to back her but also to ""explain"" the merits of the deal to the public. Asked what her plan B was, if MPs rejected the deal, she suggested there would be little point going back to the EU to ask for further changes. ""I believe if we were to go back to the European Union and say: Well people didn't like that deal, can we have another one? ... I don't think they're going to come to us and say: We'll give you a better deal."" Mrs May, who has previously warned about the dangers of the UK leaving without a deal or not leaving at all, would not be drawn on whether she would quit if MPs refused to back her deal. Asked what was a more likely outcome in such an event - a no-deal exit or the UK remaining in the EU - she said ""from my point of view, personally, there is no question of 'no Brexit' because the government needs to deliver on what people voted on in the referendum in 2016"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab tells Today the proposed Brexit deal is worse than EU membership Asked by a caller called Michael if the UK would be better off outside the EU under her deal than staying in, she said that as someone who voted to Remain, she had never said the ""sky would fall in"" if Brexit happens. ""I think we will be better off in a situation which we'll have outside the European Union, where we have control of all those things, and are able to trade around the rest of the world,"" she said. DUP may revisit Tory deal says Foster Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott Chancellor Hammond in Brexit visit to NI Reality Check: The important bits of the political declaration She added: ""You say: Are we better off?... actually it's a different sort of environment, and a different approach that we'll be taking to things."" Pressed by Emma Barnett to answer the question, she said ""it is going to be different,"" before adding: ""We can build a better future outside the European Union."" The UK and EU have agreed in principlethe framework for their future relations,externaloutlining how UK-EU trade, security and other issues would work. The document, known as the ""political declaration"", is not legally-binding but will be the starting point for negotiations on co-operation after the UK leaves. It has been heavily criticised by many MPs for lacking detail. This is a separate document to the legally-binding withdrawal agreement - setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, including the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said what was on offer in the political declaration was inferior to EU membership, as it would leave the UK bound by the same rules but without control over them. Pedro Sanchez and the 27 other EU leaders will be asked to sign off the agreement on Sunday Theresa May goes back to Brussels on Saturday for more talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker Negotiators try to get an agreement with Spain over Gibraltar EU leaders meet on Sunday to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration If that is agreed Mrs May starts the process of getting MPs to back the deal - most are currently against it If MPs back the deal it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament The UK leaves the EU on 29 March - and trade talks on the future relationship start Meanwhile, EU officials are meeting to try to put the finishing touches to both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. Irish border Brexit plans 'encouraging' Post-Brexit who will lead Europe? The future of Gibraltar and its 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, remains a sticking point. Spain has long contested Britain's 300 year-rule of the peninsula and there are concerns about how the territory's political status and economic ties with the Spanish mainland will be affected by Brexit. This video can not be played What's in the political declaration? Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law and employment law at Trinity College, Cambridge, told the BBC that Spain's room for manoeuvre was limited as the ""divorce"" document only had to be agreed at EU level by qualified majority voting, meaning 20 of the 27 member states. Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, said the territory was perfectly happy to have ""direct engagement"" with Madrid over future trade relations but would not be ""dragged"" into doing so Reality Check: The declaration Brexit deal 'within our grasp' Video, 00:02:18Brexit deal 'within our grasp' The document - in 45 seconds.

May heads to Brussels ahead of EU summit,"Ahead of the 2016 referendum, Philip Hammond was a committed Remainer Chancellor Philip Hammond has insisted that the prime minister's Brexit deal is better than remaining in the EU. He said the deal respected the result of the 2016 referendum and offered ""the best compromise possible"". European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the deal at a summit on Sunday. It comes after Spain, which threatened to miss the summit, was reassured over objections it had raised about Gibraltar. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has now received enough reassurances from the UK government over the issue. Mrs May flies into Brussels later to hold talks with top EU officials, ahead of the summit. This video can not be played Dominic Raab told Today the proposed Brexit deal is worse than EU membership The UK is scheduled to depart the EU on 29 March 2019. The terms of the UK's withdrawal have been under negotiation since June 2016 following a referendum in which 51.9% voted to leave the EU. Even if the EU approves the deal, it still has to be passed by the UK Parliament, with many MPs having stated their opposition. Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), has already stated the party will not back the Brexit deal - and is expected to reiterate her position at this weekend's annual conference in Belfast. She will say the withdrawal agreement contains arrangements that are not in Northern Ireland's long-term economic or strategic interests. Mrs May relies on the DUP, whose 10 MPs help the minority Conservative government to pass legislation. The DUP has threatened to look again at the agreement with the Conservatives if the Brexit deal gets through Parliament. DUP Chief Whip Jeffrey Donaldson denied the party would walk away from its agreement - but told the BBC the party was ""very unhappy"" with the withdrawal agreement. DUP urges PM to 'bin the backstop' Brexit: Simple answers to key questions A guide to where we are with Brexit The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Philip Hammond told Today he was hopeful of a solution with the DUP. The deal on offer was the ""best way of Britain leaving the EU with the minimum negative impact on the economy,"" he said. The chancellor said the deal was better than remaining in the EU because it honoured the referendum result and offered ""the best compromise possible... satisfying both sides"" of the Brexit argument. ""If we want this country to be successful in the future, we have got to bring it back together after this process,"" he said. By Leila Nathoo, BBC political correspondent Ministers' hard sell of the Brexit deal continues - this morning it was Philip Hammond's turn. He's been trying to reassure the DUP over their concerns about the Irish border - but he also had a message for MPs thinking of voting against the deal in the Commons. Don't - or chaos will be unleashed. Warnings about the economic consequences of a Parliamentary rejection will remind some of what was dubbed 'Project Fear' during the referendum campaign. The chancellor's suggestion that there is no alternative can be seen as a dismissal of those critics - the DUP, Tory Brexiteers - who think there is still a chance of renegotiation. Meanwhile, former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers - a Leave campaigner in 2016 - has said she will vote against the withdrawal agreement. ""I do not believe it is in the national interest,"" she told Today. She said ""every effort should continue to be made to try and reach a better agreement"" but failing that, Theresa May ""should walk away"". But Mr Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit would unleash ""economic chaos"". ""If the meaningful vote [in Parliament] is lost we are in uncharted territory,"" he said. On Saturday, Mrs May will meet the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk for talks. Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents: The political declaration, which sets out what the UK and EU's relationship may be like after Brexit - outlining how things like UK-EU trade and security will work The EU withdrawal agreement: a 585-page, legally-binding document setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. It covers the UK's Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" - a way to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus. This video can not be played What's in the political declaration? Spain raised last-minute objections to how the issue of Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents - had been handled in the Brexit talks so far. Spain has long-held ambitions to bring the territory back under Spanish rule, and there's growing concern about how their economic ties with the territory will be affected by Brexit. Mr Sanchez is pro-European and it is not in his nature to scupper EU plans, the BBC's Katya Adler said Although one country on its own cannot stop the withdrawal agreement being approved, there is ""no way the EU can rubber-stamp a text when an existing member is so strongly opposed"", said BBC News Europe editor Katya Adler. Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? Gibraltar: What's it got to do with Brexit? France, Denmark and the Netherlands had raised concerns over what the political declaration said about fishing rights in UK waters - but this issue is understood to have been resolved. If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it. A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December. Labour,the SNPtheLiberal Democrats,the DUPand Plaid Cymru have all said they will vote against the government's deal, as well as many Conservatives. What happens if MPs reject Theresa May's deal? On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement. But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"". Meanwhile,the Telegraph said,externalit has seen leaked Cabinet papers which suggest the PM is planning to ""reframe the Brexit debate around migration"" - by planning restrictions on low-skilled migrants coming to the UK - in a bid to attract the support of Brexiteers. This video can not be played Michael: ""What in your honest opinion is better for the UK, your deal or the deal we had if we stayed in the EU?"" Yes. After the 2017 general election, Mrs May's Conservative Party got 318 seats - four short of the number she needed to rule with a majority government. The DUP formed a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories, promising that its 10 MPs would vote with the government, and therefore enable it to win key votes in Parliament. Please upgrade your browser The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the ""backstop"" - the last resort back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens. It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.

"Dire warning on US climate change impactsClimate change could cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage health, a major report warns.US & Canada","This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns. ""Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today,"" the 4th National Climate Assessment says. The report saysclimate change is ""presenting growing challenges,externalto human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth"". The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda. By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week,Donald Trump tweeted, ""whatever happened to global warming?"",external Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss' question in comprehensive detail. Global warming is here in the US, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic. The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida. And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation. With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life. The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was ""largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population"". The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite CO2 cuts ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,"" the report says. ""Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."" The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ""to adapt to the changes that will occur"". Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action. Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not ""some problem in the distant future"". ""It's happening right now in every part of the country,"" she said. This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice. ""While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm,"" she said. Former US Vice-President Al Gore, a prominent climate change campaigner, accused the White House of trying to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday - the unofficial start of America's Christmas shopping season. ""Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the west, hurricanes batter our coasts - and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical US assessment of the climate crisis,"" Mr Gore said. ""The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible."" In October,President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a ""political agenda"", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was ""a hoax"". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: ""I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."" A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops. If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

"Boy with rare condition ""upset"" over toyThe mother of a boy who has a form of dwarfism appeals for help to find his cuddly kangaroo.Norfolk","George, 10, with his beloved Kangaroo on the day he lost it A boy who has battled through years of surgery with his trusted companion - a toy kangaroo - has been left devastated after his cuddly friend went missing. George Fawkes, 10, lost Kangaroo while travelling to a hospital appointment in Bristol on 16 November. The youngster, who has a form of dwarfism, requires regular surgery, and always takes the toy with him. George's mother, Gilda, of King's Lynn, Norfolk, said George had been ""so upset"" since Kangaroo went missing. She is offering a reward for the safe return of the cuddly toy. George, who has Floating-Harbor Syndrome, was born in Australia. He was given the toy - which has faded boxing gloves and his name sewn into the back - by a nurse. He was on his way to the Bristol Children's Hospital when he lost his beloved toy, sending his mother ""into a complete panic"". George recovering from surgery with Kangaroo by his side in hospital Mrs Fawkes, 50, who is George's full-time carer, said she nodded off on the train so did not initially notice Kangaroo was missing. ""We got off at Bath Spa to show George the Christmas lights,"" she said. ""He was acting a bit funny but finally admitted Kangaroo had fallen under the seat and because I was napping, he hadn't told me."" Graffiti menace is 'not Les Dennis' Locked-up police-bite puppy released Photographers snap a touch of frost The mother-of-four immediately contacted GWR train company but was told the lost property section at Bristol Temple Meads can receive ""up to 3,000 items a day"". ""Staff have said they will keep a special eye out for Kangaroo but I'm a bit concerned it could be overlooked because at first glance, it looks like a teddy bear,"" she said. ""We do have a spare one but it looks brand new and George doesn't want it."" George has rejected a replacement toy, which is not as worn as his favourite Mrs Fawkes has delayed her son's next round of surgery until after Christmas in the hope Kangaroo will be found. ""I'm worried it could affect his recovery,"" she said. ""Every time George has an operation, we make sure Kangaroo is on the recovery table when he wakes up. ""For parents who lose their child's favourite cuddly toy, it's devastating, but for George it's a level deeper. He's really very upset.""

Brazil 'replaces' leaving Cuban doctors,"The first group of Cuban doctors arrived back in Havana on Friday Brazil's health ministry says it has filled almost all of the vacancies left by thousands of Cuban doctors who returned to their home country. Cuba pulled the doctors out of Brazil after what it called ""contemptuous"" remarks by president-elect Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right leader had questioned the doctors' qualifications. He accused Cuba's communist government of keeping 75% of their pay, and of not allowing their families to join them. Cuban doctor Rosa Elena Soto (centre) returned after working for two years in a small town in Brazil The first group of Cuban doctors to leave was greeted in Havana by the country's deputy health minister on Friday. The health ministry said in a statement that it had managed to fill 92% of the resulting vacancies with Brazilian doctors. The statement said more than 17,500 doctors had already been signed up, while almost 8,000 had been allocated to specific areas. But a large proportion of the Cuban doctors worked in poor, rural parts of Brazil, where it was harder to recruit Brazilian doctors, and it is not clear how many of the new recruits will be prepared to go to those areas. Healthcare is Cuba's most lucrative export. The ""More Doctors"" aid programme operates in 67 countries, and makes the island $11bn a year. Around 8,000 Cuban doctors have been working in Brazil's remotest areas under the scheme. Cuba has said they will all be summoned home by the end of December. However, a Brazilian diplomatic source told AFP that 2,000 will likely stay put due to personal ties. What are Jair Bolsonaro's policies? Why an American went to Cuba for cancer care What does Cuba's future hold? Brazilian mayors have warned that up to 30 million people are facing a care crisis - many in areas where local doctors refuse to go.

'Why most men should pay on first dates'VideoVideoOlympic dreams at 90'I missed a period and hoped I was pregnant'VideoVideo'I became a fashion model in my 60s'VideoVideoBringing Simone Cousteau's adventures to the surface,"Anne argues societal innate inequalities mean that splitting the bill isn't fair Anne Rucchetto, 27, is a writer living in Toronto, Canada. As part of the BBC's 100 Women series, she writes about why it matters who picks up the bill. When I first began dating, my mother warned me that there was ""no such thing as a free drink"". She would elaborate gravely: ""Men will think you owe them something."" I know my mother didn't mean to fill me with dread, but her statement left me troubled each time I met someone new. It took me time to relinquish the sense of obligation I felt to men who covered the cost of my $5 beer - but since then, I've never looked back. As someone who's been dating since the age of 14, I've spent a lot of time thinking and talking about ways to find a great partner, as well as what behaviours to look for when meeting someone for the first time. These days finding a date is easier than ever, with apps and online communities for people of every conceivable orientation, identity, and background. But who should pay for the first date always sparks a spirited conversation. US 'dine-and-dash' dater sentenced Aiming high key to online dating success 'I transitioned and lost my male privilege' I used to embrace the logic that for women to be treated as equal to men, we should pay for our own share, and split the bill with our date. To make sure that's never a problem, I've always suggested affordable dating venues - cheap and cheerful restaurants, dive bars, gigs, parks. About five years ago my friends and teachers introduced me to ideas that made me question that approach. I became aware of feminist writers like Gloria Jean Watkins (known by her pen name bell hooks) who made me think about who benefits most from the current structure of society. She and others got me thinking about the way power functions at the every level, including small individual exchanges. People benefit differently based on the current structure of society, so depending on who we're spending time with, it shouldn't be expected for both parties to pay equal amounts. Women, on average, earn less than men.Canadian women, on average, earn C$0.69 for every dollar a man makes,externalat work. This doesn't mean that our cost of living is cheaper - in many cases, it can be more expensive. The woman who draws Tinder dates Your worst dating app experiences Expectations around women's appearances and behaviour have material and personal costs. Women's physical appearances are held to impossibly high standards and a routine subject of ridicule everywhere from the entertainment industry to The White House. We are expected to be calmer, more attentive, understanding, flexible, and accommodating than men in every area of our lives - in family, work, relationships, and friendships. Meeting these norms is costly - materially and emotionally. Furthermore, who pays cannot be reduced to an issue of men versus women. We all have different experiences based on our gender, social and economic status, race, citizenship, and more. Ultimately, equality is not the same as equity. Equality is everyone getting the exact same pair of shoes. Equity is everyone getting a pair of shoes that fits them. In good relationships, people will strive for equity. When I went on a first date with a man who spent most of the time boasting about his sports car and travels, it confused me when he wanted to split the bill. Curiously, it is often these privileged men that have declared to my friends and I: ""I'm a feminist, so we'll split it"" Whether or not men believe women's labour is underpaid, it is. Further, whether or not men agree with women being underpaid, they directly benefit from it. This isn't to say that men don't work hard or should always pay - when I've been in situations where it is obvious that I have more income than the man I'm dating, I am happy to split or cover the bill. If I sense that a man correlates his paying for a first date with me ""owing"" him in some way, I will insist on paying for both of us and shut down any chance of further communication. This kind of primitive thinking shows a lack of perspective, respect, and consent. I have dated both men and women, and funnily enough, anytime I've dated a woman, or gender-diverse person we've ended up competing to pay the bill. I've been with my partner, Zac, for over a year now. I had a good feeling about him when he told me he loved animals, described his appreciation for his friends, and shared his views about labour rights. He paid for our first date and I paid for our second. Now, we share expenses based on what we can afford when we go out together or visit each other's homes. This might change in the future, but we've found a balance that works for both of us. Our most important goal is to make sure that both of us feel respected and that neither of us feel underappreciated or taken advantage of. First dates are one small opportunity to recognise that people in society have different access to resources. If we want to be good company and good partners, challenging power imbalances is an important part of every relationship. Who pays on a first date doesn't define the terms of the relationship. As bonds develop, the people involved can work to find terms that suit them. Regardless of the expectations we might have about who should (or shouldn't) pay on a first date, it's always good to be considerate.

'I missed a period and hoped I was pregnant'VideoVideo'I became a fashion model in my 60s'VideoVideoBringing Simone Cousteau's adventures to the surface,"Nicole, now in her mid-40s, reflects on experiencing early menopause Nicole Evans was diagnosed with premature menopause at the age of 30. She writes for BBC 100 Women about the shock of infertility and how she has come to terms with the diagnosis. My periods had been getting lighter for a couple of years, but when I mentioned it to health workers here in my native New Zealand they brushed it off as a natural effect of the pill. When one month I missed a period altogether, I went to the doctor excited that I might be pregnant. I had been married for a year and we had just started talking about having a baby. But the pregnancy test came back negative. My doctor got blood tests done, and brought me back to explain my hormone levels weren't normal. She referred me to a hormone specialist and I was diagnosed with premature menopause. I didn't know ovaries could stop working at this age - it came as an incredible shock. Today's feminism tells us we can have it all and we should want it all, on our terms and in our timeframe. But this lie costs us greatly when circumstances interfere with the path we had planned. Nicole on her wedding day with her partner I believe celebrity culture has a lot to answer for when it comes to fertility awareness. When a woman's fertility is, directly or indirectly, erroneously portrayed as something that easily continues into her 50s, signs of problems are easy to overlook. I had no idea that, generally speaking,female fertility starts to decline in your mid 30s,external. We decided to go through a donor egg IVF cycle with a wonderful friend and felt very hopeful and expected it to be the answer to all our problems. But we ended up with only one viable embryo to transfer and that didn't lead to a pregnancy. It was extremely upsetting for everyone involved. 'I went through the menopause at 11' High carb diet may hasten menopause Staff urged to say 'menopause' more often A year later another friend offered to help us, but this time I was very hesitant. It would be the last government-funded cycle, and psychologically I felt safer in between treatment. In the midst of fertility treatment it can take a great deal of courage simply to walk out the door each morning. But we gave the second cycle a go because I was now aged 32. Time was marching on. Menopause is the biological stage in a woman's life that occurs when she stops having periods Periods can become less frequent over months or years before the stop Other symptoms include hot flushes, poor concentration, headaches, anxiety, reduced sex drive and difficulty sleeping Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 - the UK average is 51 About one in every 100 women under the age of 40 go through premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian insufficiency Source:NHS UK,external Sadly the two separate embryo transfers we did from this cycle didn't become pregnancies either, and we didn't have the financial or emotional resources to invest in a third cycle. I couldn't face adoption. Having just finished being poked and prodded physically, I would then have to start on a journey of more prodding - into our relationship, jobs, home life, finances - as part of a gruelling vetting process. Of course I understood why it was necessary, but I just couldn't face it on top of the trauma I'd already experienced. I hit rock bottom. The emotional heartache for the loss of our potential children was there no matter how hard we tried to rationalise it away. And this heartache remained for me until one particular evening. I'd spent it with a girlfriend and her newborn, and after she left I noticed that the longing to have a baby of my own was gone. Simply erased. I couldn't explain it other than I believe God took away the longing deep in my heart. And looking back now I know it's because he had something better planned for me - a closer relationship with him. A great number of doctors seem to be unaware of premature menopause. I've spoken to many women in the support group I run who, when they tell their doctor their periods have become irregular, are only referred to specialists after a delay, if at all. I have been on HRT ever since I was diagnosed. I'm very grateful for this treatment because even in your early 40s, as I now am, it's very hard to discuss menopausal hot flushes, moodiness and brain fog with anyone. You feel too embarrassed to say anything because you feel you have to explain yourself to any age group. It's a nice bonus to be rid of the expense and the hassle of sanitary products each month. But it's taken me a while to recognise silver linings like this. I believe the ageing-averse, hardship-averse culture of the West hinders us from dealing well with natural life processes. We have become so good at distracting ourselves from hard realities, feeding ourselves comforting lies, that we have a very narrow idea of what makes a truly satisfying life. Premature menopause may have given me much heartache, but it also uncovered the deception that true satisfaction is found in health and youth and perfection. Our infertility journey was a life crisis and our world had to be rebuilt from the ground up, but it has certainly made us stronger both individually and as a couple. It taught us many lessons: that our true identity transcends our circumstances; to count our blessings; to have more compassion for others; and to approach life with an open mind, to name a few. We may not have it all, but we have everything we need. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories.

"Brazil 'replaces' leaving Cuban doctorsMost vacancies left by departing Cuban doctors have now been filled, Brazil's health ministry says.Latin America & Caribbean","The first group of Cuban doctors arrived back in Havana on Friday Brazil's health ministry says it has filled almost all of the vacancies left by thousands of Cuban doctors who returned to their home country. Cuba pulled the doctors out of Brazil after what it called ""contemptuous"" remarks by president-elect Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right leader had questioned the doctors' qualifications. He accused Cuba's communist government of keeping 75% of their pay, and of not allowing their families to join them. Cuban doctor Rosa Elena Soto (centre) returned after working for two years in a small town in Brazil The first group of Cuban doctors to leave was greeted in Havana by the country's deputy health minister on Friday. The health ministry said in a statement that it had managed to fill 92% of the resulting vacancies with Brazilian doctors. The statement said more than 17,500 doctors had already been signed up, while almost 8,000 had been allocated to specific areas. But a large proportion of the Cuban doctors worked in poor, rural parts of Brazil, where it was harder to recruit Brazilian doctors, and it is not clear how many of the new recruits will be prepared to go to those areas. Healthcare is Cuba's most lucrative export. The ""More Doctors"" aid programme operates in 67 countries, and makes the island $11bn a year. Around 8,000 Cuban doctors have been working in Brazil's remotest areas under the scheme. Cuba has said they will all be summoned home by the end of December. However, a Brazilian diplomatic source told AFP that 2,000 will likely stay put due to personal ties. What are Jair Bolsonaro's policies?

Review: Is The Girl in the Spider's Web worth an evening out? âââââ,"The omens weren't good. It was the evening after the heavily advertised nationwide release of The Girl in the Spider's Web: A New Dragon Tattoo Story, and the city centre cinema where I went to see the film was as empty as a trickster's promise. Such a pitiful showing would have been a dispiriting sight for the Sony Pictures execs who'd backed the movie to kick-start the stalled Millennium Series franchise. For those who didn't show up, rest easy - you made the right choice. The fifth film to have been adapted from Stieg Larsson's best-selling Scandi-noir saga is easily the worst of the bunch. And that's not because it is an adaptation of the fourth book in the series written after Larsson's death by David Lagercrantz (who also ghosted the best sports autobiography in living memory, I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic). The problem with the film, nominally a psychological thriller, is that it is neither disturbing nor thrilling. The Girl in the Spider's Web is an action-packed film, but lacks dramatic tension It is a perfectly serviceable but very predictable action movie full of car-chase clichÃ©s and video game shoot-outs, powered by a plot that has about as much dramatic tension as a game of garden bowls. The movie opens with the two young Salander sisters playing chess in their father's draughty and over-the-top eerie cliff-top concrete castle. When they finish the game their sexually abusive dad decides it's his turn to play with them. Not nice. Lisbeth hurls herself from a broken balcony into the deep snow below and legs it. Camilla stays. Sylvia Hoeks plays Camilla, who is Lisbeth's sister Cut to a couple of decades later and Lisbeth (Claire Foy) has moved into an industrial space in town that makes her dad's old place look cosy. Still, it matches her goth-punk aesthetic and cold-as-ice persona, which, in turn, fits with her life as a monosyllabic vigilante intent on dishing out the old electric cattle-prod treatment to an assortment of baddies. From The Queen to punk computer hacker, Claire Foy takes on the role of Lisbeth Salander She takes on a detective job for a nerdy computer programmer (Stephen Merchant) who has created a nuclear version of Frankenstein's Monster. ""What am I looking for?"" she asks. ""The sum of all my sins,"" replies the bearded Merchant. It's not a great line in any circumstance, but is beyond limp coming from the mouth of a man who looks like his idea of being naughty is un-tucking his pyjama top. Anyway, off Lisbeth goes, riding her black Ducati motorbike with elbows out like wings, into a murky world of deadly Russians, decent Americans, and inscrutable Swedes. She is not entirely alone; as ever she can rely on a little help from a few geeky friends and her old chum and admirer Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason), an investigative journalist. Investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) is Lisbeth's ally And that's it really. The story unfolds as you would imagine, with plot twists as surprising as getting a woolly jumper for Christmas. Claire Foy does a reasonable job in a limited role, which offers precious little opportunity to flesh out her character beyond being a cartoonishly two-dimensional action hero blessed with the tech skills to put her in the running for Employee of the Month at PC World. Who knows why the film's talented director Fede Ãlvarez (Don't Breathe) has chosen to swap mind games for endless punch-ups and shots of laptop screens. Director Fede Alvarez fails to capture the psychological depth of Larsson's work It misses the point of Larsson's creation. What makes the books so compelling, and the original film in which Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth, is the inner psychological drama that determines and informs each protagonist's actions and relationships. Noomi Rapace won acclaim in the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but said she was ""done"" with the part They are complicated, dark stories, populated by damaged and complex characters. They need time to evolve and unfold in their otherworldliness. The Girl in the Spider's Web doesn't allow for any of that. Instead we have yet another car chase to crack on with and an electric cattle prod to wield. Why have dark and complicated when you can have simple and light? The Girl in the Spider's Web still has her dragon tattoo but she's lost her soul.

One of those tickets won her and her husband a $1.8m (Â£1.4m) jackpot. The winning ticket was found about two weeks before it was set to expire. It was from the 6 June draw and had to be claimed within six months. ""We kept checking the numbers again and again,"" Harold Ehrenberg told the Louisiana Lottery Corporation.

"Black Friday shoppers 'spending less'Data from Barclaycard shows more transactions on the day of discounts, but less being spent.Business","UK shoppers on Black Friday have been buying more items but spending less, credit card data suggests. Barclaycard, which processes half of all UK card payments, said that by 15:00 GMT it had seen 10% more transactions from a year earlier. However, the value of spending was down 12% on last year. Separate data suggested a continuing trend for Black Friday bargain hunting to be done online rather than on the High Street. Barclaycard said it had processed 1,087 transactions per second between 13:00 and 14:00 GMT, a record high. Konrad Kelling, managing director of Barclaycard Payment Solutions, said: ""Our data shows that people have been making a higher number of less expensive purchases than at this time last year. ""This suggests that, while Black Friday is clearly encouraging shoppers to buy, consumers are more likely to be purchasing smaller 'treat' products, rather than splashing out on high-end items."" Useful tips for the best Black Friday deals Warning on 'misleading' Black Friday deals Separate data from retail analysts Springboard indicated that shoppers were continuing to favour buying online rather than heading out to the shops. Springboard said that by 13:00 GMT, footfall at shops was down 7% from a year ago. High Streets saw a 6.4% decline while shopping centres saw visitor numbers drop 9.1%. In comparison, the volume of online transactions was up 47%, according to analysis by Loqate/GBG. Black Friday, a period of heavy discounting which originated as a post-Thanksgiving sale in the US, has divided retailers in the UK. Some see it as risking already-thin profit margins as consumers expect both pre-and post-Christmas deals. However, this year has seen a return of some retailers who snubbed the promotion 12 months ago. Previous years have seen huge crowds stampeding for in-store bargains Retail aggregator LovetheSales.com, which tracks prices and discounts, said there were 26% more deals on offer this year compared with 2017, and noted that chains such as Homebase, Whistles and FatFace had begun offering Black Friday deals again. Department store chain John Lewis said the most searched-for products so far on Friday were Apple Airpods and the Applewatch Series 3. Earlier on Friday, the National Cyber Security Centre issued advice to shoppers of therisk of ""malicious"" online threatsand potential for fraud as shoppers are distracted by bargains.
