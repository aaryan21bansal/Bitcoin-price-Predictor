Why show was scrapped,"The precise circumstances of Steve Dymond's death are not known. But what is clear, from multiple sources, is that he was troubled and vulnerable before he participated in the show - even though he did so willingly - and that failing the lie detector test was a devastating blow. That much was clear on Tuesday morning, when ITV said that they were minded to launch an inquiry and wait for the coroner's verdict. Yet this morning the show was taken off the air permanently. What happened that should cause the sudden change of mind? The Jeremy Kyle show has been part of ITV's daytime schedule since it started in 2005 Two things at least. First, growing evidence of links between that failed lie detector test and Mr Dymond's death. ITV learned significant new information in the past 24 hours. And second, another morning of damaging front page headlines, especially in the tabloids that are still influential and widely read among ITV's heartland audience. That is explicitly not to say that the decision to take the show off air permanently was primarily a commercial one. The driver may have been moral repugnance, at ITV board level, at what has happened. Certainly, if as part of their internal process board members saw footage of Mr Dymond's response to failing the lie detector test on the episode that was never aired, it must have prompted a visceral reaction. But even if you accept that Carolyn McCall and the ITV board made this decision because of revulsion at what one of their shows did, that doesn't discount the commercial and editorial context in which the decision was made. As an advertiser-funded broadcaster, albeit with multiple linear channels and a digital offering, ITV is under pressure. Kevin Lygo, its creative chief, has tried to reinvent the schedule, and with some success. But the feeling at the top of ITV is that Jeremy Kyle's show was a distinct anomaly within the new offering - and therefore not necessarily a good fit as part of its future. It is hard to imagine that the show would have been permanently scrapped if Lygo and other bosses were deeply admiring of it. In reaching millions of people every weekday, many of them of the view that the mainstream media doesn't generally reflect their lives very well, ITV had a solid, regular offer to a big and loyal audience. In today's exceptionally competitive media environment, when the claims on our attention are multiplying by the minute, that isn't something you give up lightly. Especially when you know that whatever replaces Kyle will struggle to achieve its ratings, at least at first. There is, as I mentioned on last night's bulletins, a massive disconnect here: between those who wanted the show off air, who generally don't watch it; and those who do watch it, and feel they can relate to it. These fans, like ITV bosses, might proffer a liberal argument: people who go on the show are consenting, fully informed, capacitous adults who know what they're doing. In the show's 14-year history, thousands of contributors have been on-stage. And this is not a show that has traditionally led to Ofcom being inundated with complaints. Several people have said to me that, given two people who appeared on Love Island have taken their own lives, it is inconsistent to leave that show on air, and ITV's decision on Wednesday is partly about protecting that highly lucrative show. ITV resist the latter point strongly, and it is important not to generalise from the specific circumstances of any death - particularly suicide. Moreover, Love Island and The Jeremy Kyle Show occupied very different parts of the schedule, and don't belong in the same category of programme. Steve Dymond, who was 63, was found dead a week after he was filmed on the Jeremy Kyle show taking a lie detector test to prove if he'd been faithful to his fiancee I wonder, however, if rising concerns about the mental health of participants in all TV programmes may prompt greater investment in after-care, or an expansion of Ofcom's remit to go much further on the duty of care programme makers have toward their contributors. Celebrity culture is as old as culture itself; but the advent of, first, mass media, and now social media, has rapidly expanded the circle of those who can be famous. But displaying, or even parading, private anguish and trauma in a public way can obviously have a disastrous impact on mental health. Whether it be Strictly Come Dancing, Come Dine With Me, or The Jeremy Kyle Show and Love Island, contributors and contestants give up something of themselves, some degree of autonomy, when they become characters in productions whose goal is commercially motivated entertainment. The journey they go on, and which viewers are encouraged to go on with them, can be life-affirming, cultural gold-dust. That is television at its best. But the spectacle can also lead contributors to a dark place. Even if that is not television at its worst, it is television that - for now - ITV believes should not be aired. No matter the ratings.

National Grid attacks Labour's energy plan,"The Labour Party is unveiling plans to take the National Grid into public ownership. It wants to create a National Energy Agency to own and maintain transmission infrastructure. Labour said its nationalisation pledge would ""usher in a Green Industrial Revolution"" and tackle climate change. But National Grid - the largest transmitter of electricity and gas in Britain - said the proposal was the ""last thing"" that was needed. The firm, which does not operate in Northern Ireland, said the Labour plan would hinder the shift to green energy. Labour also set out plans to put solar panels on nearly two million homes. Its proposals are contained in a document entitledBringing Energy Home,external, due to be presented on Thursday by leader Jeremy Corbyn and Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow energy secretary. Installing solar panels on social homes and those with low-incomes is part of Labour's plan to ""usher in a Green Industrial Revolution in housing, transport and industry - creating over 400,000 jobs and tackling climate change"". Labour said the solar panels would reduce fuel bills, and that it would also offer interest-free loans, grants and make changes to regulations to help an additional 750,000 properties install solar panels. Unused electricity would be used by the National Grid, which would be nationalised. ""Energy networks that are owned by the public and responsive to the public interest will be able to prioritise tackling climate change, fuel poverty and security of supply over profit extraction, while working with energy unions to support energy workers through the transition,"" Labour said. But National Grid said the plan would ""delay the huge amount of progress and investment that is already helping to make this country a leader in the move to green energy"". ""At a time when there is increased urgency to meet the challenges of climate change, the last thing that is needed is the enormous distraction, cost and complexity contained in these plans,"" it added. Reality Check: What has happened to energy since privatisation? Gas heating ban for new homes from 2025 UK has first coal-free week for a century National Grid chief executive John Pettigrew told the BBC's Today programme: ""We do not believe the Labour proposals are in the interests of customers."" He defended National Grid's record, saying it was ""in the middle of a huge transformation"" and ""investing hugely in the network"". He said Labour had to consider what problem it was looking to solve. Labour is committed to generating at least 60% of the UK's electricity and heat from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030. It would take the four licensed and regulated electricity and gas transmission companies, including National Grid Electricity and National Grid Gas, back into public ownership and ""replace existing private monopolies with publicly owned and locally run institutions"". Mr Corbyn said: ""Our Green Industrial Revolution will benefit working-class people with cheaper energy bills, more rewarding well-paid jobs, and new industries to revive the parts of our country that have been held back for far too long."" However, Dan Neidle, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance, told the BBC that Labour's nationalisation plans could contravene international law, because of suggestions that it would not necessarily pay stock market value to buy back the assets. He said that in every UK privatisation so far, the state paid market value, so it was not up to Labour to decide what was a fair price. ""That's not what the UK precedent is and that's not what international law says,"" he says. ""The courts have never said that's acceptable,"" he added. With the rare exception of Venezuela, ""you have to look quite hard for governments that have done that"". If the UK did this, it might struggle to raise money in the bond market, he suggested. The Conservative's vice-chairman for policy, Chris Philp, said Labour's ""ideological plan for the state to seize these companies would cost an eye-watering Â£100bn and saddle taxpayers with their debts"". ""It would leave politicians in Westminster in charge of keeping the lights on and leave customers with nowhere else to turn,"" he added. ""With no credible plan for how Labour would pay for this, more borrowing and tax hikes would be inevitable."" What has happened to energy since privatisation?

Biscuit heiress apologies for Nazi commentsVerena Bahlsen faced a backlash after defending her firm's use of forced labour during Nazi rule.Europe,"Verena Bahlsen is an heir to the Bahlsen biscuit empire The heiress of a German biscuit company has apologised for saying the firm ""did nothing wrong"" in its use of forced labour during Nazi rule. Verena Bahlsen, 25, had been accused of being ""oblivious to history"" and the company had distanced itself from her comments. But after the backlash she admitted her remarks were inappropriate. ""It was a mistake to amplify this debate with thoughtless responses,"" Ms Bahlsen said in a statement Bahlsen, which makes Choco Leibniz biscuits, employed about 200 forced labourers between 1943 and 1945 - most of whom were women from Nazi-occupied Ukraine. The controversy started last week, when Ms Bahlsen told delegates at a marketing conference: ""I'm a capitalist. I own a quarter of Bahlsen, that's great. I want to buy a sailing yacht and stuff like that."" Although German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that the audience clapped and laughed along with her, some social media users accused the heiress of being insensitive to the company's past exploitation of forced labourers by making light-hearted remarks about her wealth. Berlin buries prisoners' tissue kept by Nazi-era doctor Holocaust survivors recreate photo Reimann family firm reveals Nazi slave past Asked about the criticism in an interview with Bild newspaper, Ms Bahlsen replied: ""That was before my time, and we paid the forced labourers exactly as much as German workers and we treated them well."" She added that the company had nothing to feel guilty about. These comments only deepened the controversy. The Nazi Forced Labour Documentation Centre in Berlintweeted that there was ""a great knowledge gap for family members of the Bahlsen family"",external. ""The issue of Nazi forced labour is often still a blind spot in the collective memory,"" they added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Co-accused acquitted of Annalise murder,"Annalise Johnstone's body was discovered in woodland in May 2018 A woman has been acquitted of murdering her friend's sister in Perthshire. Angela Newlands was accused of killing Annalise Johnstone, 22, along with co-accused Jordan Johnstone, at the Maggie's Wall Memorial near Dunning. Miss Newlands was acquitted of the murder charge at the conclusion of the prosecution's case against the couple. The 19-year-old still faces a charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice, and the murder charge against Mr Johnstone remains. Ms Newlands broke down in tears as judge Lady Scott told the jury there was insufficient evidence to convict her of murder. The judge said: ""I have heard legal submissions made in respect of the second accused in terms of the charge of murder. ""I have made a ruling that there is insufficient evidence which would entitle you to consider the evidence and convict on that charge. ""Accordingly I have acquitted the second accused on charge four. She remains on charge five on the indictment, that's the attempt to defeat the ends of justice."" She added: ""I know this is a bit frustrating for jurors because you haven't heard the legal arguments and the decision's been made in your absence."" Both accused deny falsely reporting Annalise Johnstone missing last May, cleaning their car, disposing of a knife and burning items of clothing. During the final day of prosecution evidence, the jury heard Ms Newlands told police her relationship with Jordan Johnstone was not sexual, although they shared a bed when they stayed at her home in Auchterarder and at her parents' house in Inchture, also in Perthshire. Mark Stewart QC, defending Ms Newlands, put it to witness Det Con Rachel Webster: ""Angela Newlands makes it clear they haven't had a sexual relationship. Beyond that statement (she) gave you some explanation why that might be so - because she believes him to be gay?"" The officer replied: ""Yes."" Mr Stewart also asked about clothing Mr Johnstone had been wearing. He put it to Det Con Webster that Ms Newlands had stated that Jordan Johnstone had taken Annalise away, and later returned wearing entirely different clothes. Mr Stewart added: ""The clothing wasn't his clothing, it was Angela Newland's father's clothing. She wasn't very happy about it. ""It was Jordan Johnstone alone who took Annalise away from Inchture late on the 9 May into the early hours of the 10th?"" Ms Webster answered: ""Yes."" Mr Stewart then asked: ""Throughout this entire interview she's crystal clear Jordan Johnstone left Inchture with Annalise Johnstone in the Ford Galaxy and they left together and alone?"" The officer agreed. Following the cross examination, Lady Scott warned the jury that any allegations made by one accused against another were not evidence. Earlier in the trial, the jury heard agreed evidence that the cause of Miss Johnstone's death was a deep puncture wound to her neck which severed vital veins and arteries and caused death within a few minutes. The prosecution and defence also confirmed that Mr Johnstone's car was near the Maggie's Wall Memorial at the time Miss Johnstone was attacked. The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.

PM deal 'dead' if Brexit bill fails - Barclay,"This video can not be played Theresa May: MPs ""have a duty"" to deliver Brexit Theresa May says MPs have a ""duty"" to ""ensure we deliver"" Brexit by voting for the withdrawal bill in the Commons. The government says the bill - required to implement the PM's deal - will be considered by MPs in the week beginning 3 June. Earlier, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the deal would be ""dead"" if MPs did not pass it. But Jeremy Corbyn's spokesman has said Labour would not support the bill if no cross-party agreement is reached. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Theresa May's Brexit deal, the withdrawal agreement that was negotiated with the EU, was rejected three times by MPs. Asked twice during a trip to Paris whether she would resign if her Brexit plan is rejected again by MPs, Mrs May said the withdrawal bill would ""ensure that we deliver Brexit for the public"". She added: ""When MPs come to look at this bill, come to vote on this legislation, I'm sure they will be thinking of the duty we have to ensure we deliver on the vote of the British public."" Government sources have told the BBC there would not be a further attempt if the plan is rejected. PM all but out of time to pass Brexit deal Remain parties 'shouldn't squabble' The vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) - which will take place when MPs return from half-term recess - would bring the withdrawal agreement into UK law. This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay: PM's deal is ""dead"" if bill fails BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not the same thumbs up or thumbs down that another meaningful vote would be - a straightforward yes or no to the divorce deal that the prime minister negotiated with the EU. Instead, she said, MPs would be voting on the Withdrawal Bill, which is a whole tome of new laws that will be needed to take us out of the European Union. Speaking to a House of Lords committee earlier, Stephen Barclay said the withdrawal bill will be published ""as soon as possible"". He said: ""I think if the House of Commons does not approve the WAB, then the Barnier deal is dead in that form and I think the House will have to then address a much more fundamental question between whether it will pursue... a no-deal option or whether it will revoke."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said MPs will have to decide ""if they want to vote for Brexit or not"". Bringing the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill forward would allow the prime minister to push ahead with her ambition of delivering Brexit before the summer - despite the lack of agreement so far in the cross-party talks, said BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Mr Corbyn's spokesman said that unless there was an agreement based on ""real compromise and movement by the government"" then the bill would be ""based on the same botched Brexit deal that has been rejected three times already by Parliament"". As things stand pulling off a victory in the Brexit bill would seem to be like pulling off a miracle. Not impossible, but very unlikely. Which is why we come back to that question. If the bill falls, does Theresa May fall too? Plenty of her critics are out there publicly claiming that must be the end. One of her oldest and staunchest supporters suggested quietly today, ""I think she knows that's it"". Another loyal lieutenant who's been fighting off attempts to oust her for months says ""losing the bill would have to be it - we are in the end now."" This has already for Theresa May been a very long goodbye, and we can't know yet when she will actually bid a final farewell. But by committing to bringing the Brexit bill back to Parliament, the prime minister has set herself another huge test, that if she loses, it could turn out to be her last in the job. Read more from Laura Brexiteer and Conservative MP Steve Baker said bringing the bill forward ""over the heads"" of DUP MPs - on whom the government relies for a majority - would ""eradicate the government's majority"". ""What is the government thinking?"" he asked. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn discussed the ongoing cross-party talks on Tuesday DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: ""If the prime minister brings the withdrawal bill to the Commons for a vote, the question will be, 'What has changed?' ""Unless she can demonstrate something new that addresses the problem of the backstop, then it is highly likely her deal will go down to defeat once again."" Thebackstopis the controversial part of the withdrawal deal that aims to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. This is a requirement under the terms of previous Brexit legislation passed last year. The legislation would make the citizens' rights part of the agreement directly enforceable in UK courts, and set their relationship with the EU's Court of Justice. It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal, and give effect to the so-called backstop plan for the Irish border. MPs will be able to vote on amendments to the bill, and this could allow ministers to make good on any compromise they reach with Labour in the cross-party talks. If the bill is introduced in the first week of June it will come seven days after the European Parliament elections -  which Education Secretary Damian Hinds has acknowledged could be ""difficult"" for the Conservatives. A state visit by US President Donald Trump and a by-election in Peterborough will also take place that same week.

'Wrong Parkrun' man praised for 5AM trekIan Guest turned up to help despite mistakenly signing up for an event in a different county.Nottingham,"Ian Guest was hailed as a hero for turning up to the event in Clifton, Nottingham A Parkrun steward who booked himself on to an event in the wrong county has been hailed a ""hero"" for turning up. Ian Guest had intended to help at a run in Clifton Park, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Saturday morning. But on Friday evening he realised he had signed up for the run in Clifton, Nottingham, 37 miles (60km) away. Despite his error - and thoughts of backing out - he made it to the race after an early morning bike ride to his local train station. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Parkruns are 5km runs for all abilities held in parks across the UK. Regular runner Mr Guest had recently started to volunteer at events due to injury. When he found the run closest to his Sheffield home was fully staffed, he searched a little wider, booking on to what he thought was the Rotherham event.

Biscuit heiress sparks Nazi controversy,"Verena Bahlsen is an heir to the Bahlsen biscuit empire The heiress of a German biscuit company has apologised for saying the firm ""did nothing wrong"" in its use of forced labour during Nazi rule. Verena Bahlsen, 25, had been accused of being ""oblivious to history"" and the company had distanced itself from her comments. But after the backlash she admitted her remarks were inappropriate. ""It was a mistake to amplify this debate with thoughtless responses,"" Ms Bahlsen said in a statement Bahlsen, which makes Choco Leibniz biscuits, employed about 200 forced labourers between 1943 and 1945 - most of whom were women from Nazi-occupied Ukraine. The controversy started last week, when Ms Bahlsen told delegates at a marketing conference: ""I'm a capitalist. I own a quarter of Bahlsen, that's great. I want to buy a sailing yacht and stuff like that."" Although German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that the audience clapped and laughed along with her, some social media users accused the heiress of being insensitive to the company's past exploitation of forced labourers by making light-hearted remarks about her wealth.

She added that the company had nothing to feel guilty about. These comments only deepened the controversy. The Nazi Forced Labour Documentation Centre in Berlintweeted that there was ""a great knowledge gap for family members of the Bahlsen family"",external.

Change UK candidate quits to back Lib Dems,"David Macdonald said he would not now be standing as a candidate for Change UK Change UK's lead candidate for the EU elections in Scotland has quit the race and is now endorsing the Lib Dems. David Macdonald is top of the Change UK list in Scotland, but said the party ""don't stand much of a chance"" of winning a seat in the 23 May poll. He urged pro-Remain voters to back the Lib Dems to avoid ""splitting the vote"" and benefiting pro-Brexit parties. Change UK MP Chuka Umunna said it was ""disappointing"" that Mr Macdonald had ""let down his fellow candidates"". Mr Macdonald is the second lead candidate to quit the Change UK list in Scotland, after David Russowithdrew one day into the race. Because the deadline for registrations has passed he will still appear on the ballot paper for the party, but has written to MP Anna Soubry to announce his resignation and underline his backing for the Lib Dems. Should Change UK win a seat in the Scotland constituency, it would now pass to the next candidate on the list, Peter Griffiths. Who are the MEP candidates in Scotland? Speaking alongside Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie outside Holyrood, Mr Macdonald - an independent councillor in East Renfrewshire - said it had been ""an honour"" to be Change UK's lead candidate in Scotland. He said the new party was ""genuinely a force for good"", but that ""if things continue as they are, the Remain vote will split in Scotland and put at risk the representation that supporters of remaining in the EU collectively desire"". He added that ""the numbers don't look good"" for Change UK in Scotland, and that voters should instead back the ""fundamentally similar"" pro-EU and pro-UK platform of the Lib Dems. Mr Macdonald said: ""They share many of the values of Change UK and are now the most likely party in favour of both remaining in the EU and of Scotland remaining in the UK to have a chance of being elected."" In response, Mr Umunna said Mr Macdonald had ""let down his fellow candidates and activists"". He said: ""We are focusing all our efforts on adding to the Remain vote in the UK and challenging the pro-Brexit Tory, Brexit and Labour parties. ""Winning voters over from the main parties and growing the Remain vote across the UK will continue to be our focus.""

Ferrari worth millions stolen on test driveA 1985 Ferrari 288 GTO that once belonged to Eddie Irvine is driven off by a prospective buyer.,"The car - seen here in a police-supplied photo - is likely worth more than â¬2m (Â£1.7m) An opportunistic car ""collector"" used a test drive to make off with a Ferrari worth â¬2m (Â£1.7m; $2.2m). The suspect had expressed interest in buying a 1985 Ferrari 288 GTO, police in the German city of DÃ¼sseldorf say. He turned up by taxi to the dealership and two hours later, on a test drive, it was time to swap drivers. But when the seller stepped out of the car, the would-be buyer quickly hit the accelerator and vanished. The car was later found in a garage. Police say the ""historic vehicle"" with 43,000km (27,000 miles) on the clock should be valued at more than â¬2m. A listing for the car on the dealer's website says it once belonged to former Northern Ireland Formula 1 driver Eddie Irvine â who raced for Ferrari between 1996 and 1999. Similar vehicles are frequently listed with prices around Â£1.5â2m, or above $3m in the US. They are often sold through specialist auctions at the likes of Sotheby's. Luckily for investigators, the distinctive car - in bright Italian ""Rosso Corsa"" red - attracted so much attention that it was quickly found on Tuesday evening after police appealed for witnesses. It was discovered hidden in a garage in the town of Grevenbroich, not far from DÃ¼sseldorf city centre. Rare Ferrari sells for 32m euros My obsession with 'resurrecting' classic cars Classic car fraudster cost victims Â£82k The suspect, however, remains at large. Police have released a photograph of the man inspecting the Ferrari before the theft. Police are seeking this man in connection with the speedy theft The managing director of the dealership told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper the man had exchanged calls and emails over the course of a number of weeks. Bernhard Kerklo told the newspaper the car could never be sold on the market as it was ""too flashy"". Insiders - the only real buyers for such a rare collector's item - would instantly know it was the stolen vehicle, he said, as all the models of this type ever sold are well-known.

Pregnancy sickness: 'I thought I was dying',"This video can not be played Essex mum 'bedbound for six months of pregnancy' For Hannah Dalton, pregnancy meant not being able to drink fluids for eight months without throwing up, going into hospital 27 times for intravenous drips and living off ice lollies and anti-sickness medication. Hannah, 30, from Thundersley, Essex, hadhyperemesis gravidarum (HG),external, the severe pregnancy sickness the Duchess of Cambridge experienced during her three pregnancies. She was bedridden for six months, ended up in a wheelchair and, at her worst, her body started to shut down. ""I seriously questioned was this still worth doing,"" Hannah says. ""We wanted a bigger family but was there a chance that we would lose me. I thought I was dying."" With support from her family, Hannah continued with her pregnancy and, in April, gave birth to a girl. The moment she went into labour, the sickness stopped. More than 5,000 women from across the UK have shared their experience of HG with BBC News: Most had considered terminating their pregnancy One in three had thought of killing themselves About three-quarters were left with long-term physical and mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression More than one in three said their experience with their GP had been ""poor"" Last year, UK hospitals saw more than 36,000 admissions for pregnant women needing urgent care because of extreme sickness and dehydration. The causes of HG are unknown. There is some evidence it runs in families. And if a woman had HG in a previous pregnancy, she is more likely to have it in the next. Now, scientists at King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital are launching a four-year study - the world's largest - in the hope of finding some answers. Blood samples and medical histories will be taken from at least 1,000 women admitted to hospital with the most severe HG symptoms and others recruited via the charityPregnancy Sickness Support,external. The study will be looking for genetic links and hormonal changes, in particular a protein, GDF15, produced by the placenta, which affects the part of the brain controlling vomiting and nausea. Consultant obstetrician Prof Catherine Williamson says: ""The problem we have is that the treatments aren't good enough. ""Our ambition is to identify genetic causes of this condition so we can tell why women have it and identify those at risk. ""We can then develop new treatments that are much more effective so hopefully there won't be any more women with severe hyperemesis, because we can control it."" What is hyperemesis gravidarum? HG is very different from morning sickness, which affects about 80% of pregnant women While morning sickness is unpleasant, women can usually continue with their daily lives and eat and drink normally But those with HG can vomit more than 50 times a day and feel constantly and severely nauseous, significantly interfering with their daily lives Complications can include serious vitamin deficiency from the excessive vomiting, significant weight loss, dehydration and malnutrition putting the health of both mother and baby at risk It can often leave a woman bedridden for months, affecting her longer term mental and physical health One in 100 of all pregnant women is admitted to hospital because of severe sickness in pregnancy The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) estimates 10% of women with HG terminate their pregnancy Before IV fluids were introduced, HG was the leading cause of death in early pregnancy There isevidence to suggest Charlotte Bronte died of HG, in 1855 - her death certificate said tuberculosis,externalbut she was four months pregnant and had experienced severe nausea and vomiting Ever since the thalidomide scandal 50 years ago, there has been concern about taking anti-sickness drugs during pregnancy. The sedative, which was found to ease nausea and vomiting in expectant mothers, left thousands of babies with severe birth defects. But most women with HG do end up taking some sort of medication to control the vomiting. Only one, Xonvea, is permitted in Britain for use in pregnancy - but alternatives, such as cyclizine, prochlorperazine and ondansetron, are also regularly prescribed and considered safe by doctors who treat the condition. Women may also be given vitamin B6 and B12 or steroids. If these don't work, women may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment including intravenous fluids. Here are the words of one woman who terminated three pregnancies because of HG. She now has a young child. ""It's your own personal hell that you can't escape from. It's devastating. It completely takes over your life, your family's life, so it would be easier either to just miscarry or die. ""The vomiting and retching was so violent and so intense, I couldn't breathe. ""I couldn't take a breath while I was retching, so I passed out and woke up on the bathroom floor and I thought, 'Oh my God, I can't do this.' ""I did have some dark moments. ""I wanted this baby so badly but I felt like it was killing me and ultimately, out of pure desperation, led me to have three terminations. ""I developed PTSD. I had insomnia and nightmares when I could sleep. ""The senior consultant came round and said, 'Have you tried ginger biscuits and salty crackers?' and I was like, 'Oh my God.' ""It's like saying to somebody with a broken leg, 'Have you tried rubbing lavender oil on it?'... because if the senior consultant didn't understand, what hope did I have?"" Caitlin Dean, from Pregnancy Sickness Support, says not treating HG has serious risks. ""Increasingly evidence suggests that, while the actual nausea and vomiting is unlikely to harm the offspring, the complications of HG, such as malnutrition, dehydration and mental ill health, can cause lifelong consequences for both mother and baby,"" she says. ""There are many wonderful, compassionate doctors out there providing excellent evidence-based care for people with HG but unfortunately there are also doctors who do not recognise the condition, are reluctant to prescribe appropriate treatment or are unaware of the evidence base. ""This leads to a vast amount of unnecessary suffering, costly hospital admissions and, all too often, terminations of otherwise wanted pregnancies. ""In 2019, there is very little excuse not to provide this basic level of care for pregnant women."" Felicity Collins, from Northamptonshire, was desperate for doctors to prescribe her stronger drugs to help her cope with HG. She was already in hospital, and 24 hours away from terminating her twin pregnancy, when she was finally given steroids to ease the constant vomiting. ""It was such a dark time,"" she says. ""It was a decision we made because I knew without those drugs, I couldn't carry on. ""I couldn't eat or drink. Everything made me sick. It was so bad. That's how close it came."" For the next six months, she injected herself daily with steroids, finally giving birth to twin boys, Arthur and Harry, who are now three years old.

""I dream about eating again and drinking again,"" she says. ""This illness makes you a shadow of who you wereâ¦ it's nine months of living hell."" Laura faces about 20 more weeks of HG before she gives birth. She says: ""I fully intend on getting to the end of this pregnancy with a baby, no matter what it does to my health. ""And when this baby girl is born and the HG has gone, I will spend the rest of my life trying to raise awareness about this awful illness.

Instagram chiefs asked about suicide poll,"Police are investigating the apparent suicide of a teenage Instagram user in Malaysia Instagram executives have said they are ""heartbroken"" over the reported suicide of a teenager in Malaysia who had posted a poll to its app. The 16-year-old is thought to have killed herself hours after asking other users whether she should die. But the technology company's leaders said it was too soon to say if they would take any action against account holders who took part in the vote. The Instagram chiefs were questioned about the matter in Westminster. They were appearing as part of an inquiry by the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee into immersive and addictive technologies. Reports indicate the unnamed teenager killed herself on Monday, in the eastern state of Sarawak. The local police have said that she had run a poll on the photo-centric platform asking: ""Really important, help me choose D/L."" The letters D and L are said to have represented ""die"" and ""live"" respectively. This took advantage of a feature introduced in 2017 that allows users to pose a question via a ""sticker"" placed over one of their photos, with viewers asked to tap on one of two possible responses. The app then tallies the votes. At one point, more than two-thirds of respondents had been in favour of the 16-year-old dying, said district police chief Aidil Bolhassan. What to do if you see an Instagram post about suicide Selena Gomez says social media is 'terrible' for young people Instagram to remove graphic self-harm images ""The news is certainly very shocking and deeply saddening,"" Vishal Shah, head of product at Instagram, told MPs. ""There are cases... where our responsibility around keeping our community safe and supportive is tested and we are constantly looking at our policies. ""We are deeply looking at whether the products, on balance, are matching the expectations that we created them with. ""And if, in cases like the polling sticker, we are finding more evidence where it is not matching the expectations... we are looking to see whether we need to make some of those policy changes."" The two Instagram executives are normally based in Instagram's California offices His colleague Karina Newton, Instagram's head of public policy, told the MPs the poll would have violated the company's guidelines. The platform has measures in place to detect ""self-harm thoughts"" and seeks to remove certain posts while offering support where appropriate. For example, if a user searches for the word ""suicide"", a pop-up appears offering to put them in touch with organisations that can help. But Mr Shah said that the way people expressed mental-health issues was constantly evolving, posing a challenge. Damian Green, who chairs the committee, asked the two if the Facebook-owned service could adapt some of the tools it had developed to target advertising to proactively identify people at risk of self-harm and reach out to them. Instagram already features a pop-up that appears if a user searches for ""suicide"" ""Would it not be possible, where there are cases of people known to have been engaged in harmful content and [who] may have been at risk, that analysis could be done to see what other users share similar characteristics?"" the MP asked. Ms Newton replied that there were privacy issues to consider but that the company was seeking to do more to address the problem. Mr Green also asked if Instagram might consider suspending or cancelling the accounts of those who had encouraged the girl to take her life. But the executives declined to speculate on what steps would be taken. ""I hope you can understand that it is just so soon. Our team is looking into what the content violations are,"" said Ms Newton. Under Malaysian law, anyone found guilty of encouraging or assisting the suicide of a minor can be sentenced to death or up to 20 years in jail. It follows the earlier case of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old British girl who killed herself, in 2017, after viewing distressing material about depression and suicide that had been posted to Instagram. The social network vowed to remove all graphic images of self-harm from its platform after her father accused the app of having ""helped kill"" his child.

Choco Leibniz heir sparks Nazi controversy,"Verena Bahlsen is an heir to the Bahlsen biscuit empire The heiress of a German biscuit company has apologised for saying the firm ""did nothing wrong"" in its use of forced labour during Nazi rule. Verena Bahlsen, 25, had been accused of being ""oblivious to history"" and the company had distanced itself from her comments. But after the backlash she admitted her remarks were inappropriate. ""It was a mistake to amplify this debate with thoughtless responses,"" Ms Bahlsen said in a statement Bahlsen, which makes Choco Leibniz biscuits, employed about 200 forced labourers between 1943 and 1945 - most of whom were women from Nazi-occupied Ukraine. The controversy started last week, when Ms Bahlsen told delegates at a marketing conference: ""I'm a capitalist. I own a quarter of Bahlsen, that's great. I want to buy a sailing yacht and stuff like that."" Although German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that the audience clapped and laughed along with her, some social media users accused the heiress of being insensitive to the company's past exploitation of forced labourers by making light-hearted remarks about her wealth.

She added that the company had nothing to feel guilty about. These comments only deepened the controversy. The Nazi Forced Labour Documentation Centre in Berlintweeted that there was ""a great knowledge gap for family members of the Bahlsen family"",external.

The Jeremy Kyle Show axed by ITV,"About one million people watched The Jeremy Kyle Show every day ITV has axed The Jeremy Kyle Show after 14 years following the death of a guest who took part in the programme. Steve Dymond was found dead on 9 May a week after filming the show, during which he took a lie detector test. ITV's chief executive Carolyn McCall said the decision was a result of the ""gravity of recent events"". Following the announcement, a committee of MPs launched an inquiry into whether enough support is offered to guests on TV shows during and after filming. ""Given the gravity of recent events we have decided to end production of The Jeremy Kyle Show. ""The Jeremy Kyle Show has had a loyal audience and has been made by a dedicated production team for 14 years, but now is the right time for the show to end. ""Everyone at ITV's thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of Steve Dymond. The previously announced review of the episode of the show is under way and will continue. ""ITV will continue to work with Jeremy Kyle on other projects."" Damian Collins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said the broadcaster had made the right decision. ""However, that should not be the end of the matter,"" he said. ""There needs to be an independent review of the duty of care TV companies have to participants in reality TV shows."" Programmes like The Jeremy Kyle Show risked ""putting people who might be vulnerable on to a public stage at a point in their lives when they are unable to foresee the consequences"", he said. 'I was traumatised': Jeremy Kyle guests relive their appearances The committee will question broadcasting executives and regulators. Love Island, another ITV show, has also come under scrutiny after the deaths of two former contestants. The Jeremy Kyle Show was the most popular programme in ITV's daytime schedule, with an average of one million viewers and a 22% audience share. More than 3,000 episodes have been broadcast since its debut in 2005. Following Mr Dymond's death, ITV initially took the show off air and suspended filming. This video can not be played Jeremy Kyle Show: Audience member recalls Steven Dymond episode The pre-recorded episode Mr Dymond took part in was based on the subject of infidelity. A member of the audience who was at the recording told BBC News that Mr Dymond ""collapsed to the ground"" and was ""sobbing"" when he failed the lie detector test. Lie detectors were a regular fixture on the programme, which often featured disputes between partners and family members. Broadcasting regulator Ofcom has told ITV to report back its initial findings on Mr Dymond's participation in the programme by Monday. ""While ITV has decided to cancel the programme, its investigation into what happened is continuing and we will review the findings carefully,"" an Ofcom spokesperson said. The watchdog is now examining whether to update its code of conduct to protect people taking part in reality and factual shows. ""We're examining whether more can be done to safeguard the welfare of those people, similar to the duty of care we have in the broadcasting code to protect under-18s,"" the spokesperson said. A lot has changed in 24 hours. Yesterday morning, ITV were minded to wait for the coroner's verdict before deciding what to do with the show. In the past 24 hours, the evidence has grown that his appearance on the show had a devastating impact on Steve Dymond. That evidence, and the fact that ITV is plastered across front pages once again, will have weighed heavily on the board's mind. The company's director of television Kevin Lygo has tried to reinvent the broadcaster, and this programme was an anomaly within his offering: different in tone and editorial approach. Nevertheless, it was a ratings hit, and much of its loyal audience will be despondent about it being pulled. For all that, it's vital to remember that this is ultimately an exceptionally sad story of a troubled individual who was found dead in his flat. Read more from Amol Owen Jones, author of Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class, was among those whowelcomed the decision to pull the show,external, which he said ""consisted of putting vulnerable people from disadvantaged backgrounds in stocks to have eggs thrown at them"". Piers Morgan, who hosts Good Morning Britain - a show Jeremy Kyle has previously guest presented -defended the host on Twitter,external, saying there was ""so much snobbery an hypocrisy being spewed by his critics"". Former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook, who has appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show, praised the care she was given. Appearing on Channel 5's Jeremy Vine Show, she said: ""If it wasn't for Jeremy Kyle I probably wouldn't be alive myself."" She added: ""They really have looked after me and you know, since I've been in rehab I've spoken to Jeremy all the time and [psychotherapist] Graham [Stanier] and the team, and went I went back on the show, reassessed and [I was] really looked after."" TV critic Emma Bullimore told BBC Radio 5 Live she was surprised by the speed of ITV's decision to cancel the show. ""Usually these things take a review, and it's ages, but with this one the public opinion and the pressure they were under was so strong that they didn't really have another option,"" she said. ITV has said it will still work with the host, who also fronts The Kyle Files. ""I don't think this is the end of this kind of television,"" Bullimore added. ""There's no getting away from the fact that whether you like it or you find it reprehensible, there is a loyal audience for this show."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, former ITV chief executive Stuart Prebble said the cancellation was ""a good decision"", but that producers ""do take seriously their duty of care"". He said: ""The producers of these programmes walk a very thin line and and they know they do. If you are always tip-toeing close to the edge as I think this show did, perhaps it is not surprising that something like this will eventually happen. ""They [ITV] have done the right thing - a speedy and effective review, and the faster these things are dealt with the better."" All previous episodes of The Jeremy Kyle Show have been taken down from the channel's catch-up service, ITV Hub. Episodes will not air on ITV2 either, and the show's YouTube channel has been deleted. A spokeswoman for Portsmouth coroner's office said an inquest into Mr Dymond's death would be likely to be opened within the next few days, following the result of the post-mortem investigation. The lie detectors used on The Jeremy Kyle show are supplied by a company called UK Lie Tests, which declined to comment to the BBC. A lie detector test, or polygraph test, involves an examiner using various instruments to measure the subject's reaction to a series of questions - and determine whether or not they are giving truthful answers. According to the British Polygraph Association,external(BPA), two convoluted rubber pneumograph tubes are placed around the subject's chest and abdomen to record breathing and movement. Sensors attached to the subject's fingers or hand monitor changes to skin resistance during the test, while a cardiosphygmograph traces changes to the subject's blood pressure and pulse. Various charts are then generated, which the examiner reviews to establish the test results. The BPA says the tests are ""the most reliable technique to test if someone is being deceptive to a specific issue"". However the results of lie detector tests are considered too unreliable for use in UK criminal trials.

Why The Jeremy Kyle Show was scrapped,"The precise circumstances of Steve Dymond's death are not known. But what is clear, from multiple sources, is that he was troubled and vulnerable before he participated in the show - even though he did so willingly - and that failing the lie detector test was a devastating blow. That much was clear on Tuesday morning, when ITV said that they were minded to launch an inquiry and wait for the coroner's verdict. Yet this morning the show was taken off the air permanently. What happened that should cause the sudden change of mind? The Jeremy Kyle show has been part of ITV's daytime schedule since it started in 2005 Two things at least. First, growing evidence of links between that failed lie detector test and Mr Dymond's death. ITV learned significant new information in the past 24 hours. And second, another morning of damaging front page headlines, especially in the tabloids that are still influential and widely read among ITV's heartland audience. That is explicitly not to say that the decision to take the show off air permanently was primarily a commercial one. The driver may have been moral repugnance, at ITV board level, at what has happened. Certainly, if as part of their internal process board members saw footage of Mr Dymond's response to failing the lie detector test on the episode that was never aired, it must have prompted a visceral reaction. But even if you accept that Carolyn McCall and the ITV board made this decision because of revulsion at what one of their shows did, that doesn't discount the commercial and editorial context in which the decision was made. As an advertiser-funded broadcaster, albeit with multiple linear channels and a digital offering, ITV is under pressure. Kevin Lygo, its creative chief, has tried to reinvent the schedule, and with some success. But the feeling at the top of ITV is that Jeremy Kyle's show was a distinct anomaly within the new offering - and therefore not necessarily a good fit as part of its future. It is hard to imagine that the show would have been permanently scrapped if Lygo and other bosses were deeply admiring of it. In reaching millions of people every weekday, many of them of the view that the mainstream media doesn't generally reflect their lives very well, ITV had a solid, regular offer to a big and loyal audience. In today's exceptionally competitive media environment, when the claims on our attention are multiplying by the minute, that isn't something you give up lightly. Especially when you know that whatever replaces Kyle will struggle to achieve its ratings, at least at first. There is, as I mentioned on last night's bulletins, a massive disconnect here: between those who wanted the show off air, who generally don't watch it; and those who do watch it, and feel they can relate to it. These fans, like ITV bosses, might proffer a liberal argument: people who go on the show are consenting, fully informed, capacitous adults who know what they're doing. In the show's 14-year history, thousands of contributors have been on-stage. And this is not a show that has traditionally led to Ofcom being inundated with complaints. Several people have said to me that, given two people who appeared on Love Island have taken their own lives, it is inconsistent to leave that show on air, and ITV's decision on Wednesday is partly about protecting that highly lucrative show. ITV resist the latter point strongly, and it is important not to generalise from the specific circumstances of any death - particularly suicide. Moreover, Love Island and The Jeremy Kyle Show occupied very different parts of the schedule, and don't belong in the same category of programme. Steve Dymond, who was 63, was found dead a week after he was filmed on the Jeremy Kyle show taking a lie detector test to prove if he'd been faithful to his fiancee I wonder, however, if rising concerns about the mental health of participants in all TV programmes may prompt greater investment in after-care, or an expansion of Ofcom's remit to go much further on the duty of care programme makers have toward their contributors. Celebrity culture is as old as culture itself; but the advent of, first, mass media, and now social media, has rapidly expanded the circle of those who can be famous. But displaying, or even parading, private anguish and trauma in a public way can obviously have a disastrous impact on mental health. Whether it be Strictly Come Dancing, Come Dine With Me, or The Jeremy Kyle Show and Love Island, contributors and contestants give up something of themselves, some degree of autonomy, when they become characters in productions whose goal is commercially motivated entertainment. The journey they go on, and which viewers are encouraged to go on with them, can be life-affirming, cultural gold-dust. That is television at its best. But the spectacle can also lead contributors to a dark place. Even if that is not television at its worst, it is television that - for now - ITV believes should not be aired. No matter the ratings.

British Steel: Three options for government,"British Steel - the Scunthorpe steelworks with a brand name revived by private investors Greybull - says it needs Â£75m of government support to avoid collapse. Business Secretary Greg Clark faces three choices in weighing up whether to intervene: hand over Â£75m of taxpayer's money to a private company with a chequered track record that bought the Scunthorpe works for a Â£1 nationalise it allow British Steel to go bust with the loss of 4,000 direct jobs and 20,000 more at risk in the supply chain What are the implications of each of these options? The government has already lent this company Â£120m so why not round it up to Â£200m to keep the company going? Well, the first Â£120m was in the form of a bridging loan - a bridge to a world in which a Brexit deal has been agreed and the company can then receive the back-dated carbon credits that have been withheld pending Brexit uncertainty and settle its Â£120m carbon emissions bill with the EU. That would allow British Steel to give the government its Â£120m back. If the withdrawal agreement had already been passed, the UK would now be in transition/implementation phase, life would be as it was before, and British Steel wouldn't have needed the Â£120m in the first place. The extra Â£75m is different. This is a straight lifeline to a company that is struggling in the market place and needs extra operating cash to pay wages and keep the furnaces warm. This is the sort of thing the government refused to do foroutsourcing companies Carillionand Interserve as it offends Tory principles to prop up failing businesses. As former Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, Lord (Nick) McPherson replied to me on Twitter: It would be ""Further evidence that industrial policy has lurched back to the failed interventionism of the 1970s. If British Steel can't compete at this exchange rate, you have to ask whether it ever will. #badbusiness."" Given steel market conditions, some have said it would amount to shovelling taxpayer money straight into a furnace. On the very day Labour announced its plans to nationalise the energy sector - to howls of protest by the energy companies and the condemnation of right-leaning free marketeers - this ultimate form of state intervention would be a difficult political manoeuvre. It would look like handing the Labour Party the moral and political high ground by saying that only the state could save the jobs of workers from the clutches of private speculators who bought this business for Â£1. This would perhaps be the traditional Tory party tough love response. The state is not in the business of propping up failing businesses. The market decides which companies prosper and which do not - simples. Letting 4,000 jobs go, with another 20,000 in the supply chain, with elections next week? That could see Tory orthodoxy exact a heavy price at the European elections next week in which most expect them to get a drubbing anyway. There are other options such as temporary nationalisation to support a management buyout or add sweeteners to a prospective trade buyer. Where is the saviour of the UK steel industry Sanjeev Gupta when you need him? Mr Gupta has bought a string of ailing UK steel plants and nursed some back to health.  But he is thought to have been having problems of his own lately with many steel suppliers reporting that payment problems have caused them to ask for money up front for raw materials.

"NI abuse survivors used as 'blackmail tool'Historical abuse survivors are being used as leverage in the Stormont talks process, campaigners say.Northern Ireland","Jon McCourt (centre) said some victims feel they are being used as a leverage tool in talks to restore devolution Historical abuse survivors feel like they are being used as ""a blackmail tool"" in NI's political talks process, a campaigner has said. NI Secretary Karen Bradley haspushed back the prospect of taking legislation through Westminster to give compensation to abuse victims. Payments wererecommended by the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry in 2017. ButStormont's collapsestalled the process. Jon McCourt, of the Survivors North West group, said some victims feel they are being used as a leverage tool in talks to restore devolution. ""Victims and survivors are seeing this as being used for leverage to drag a coalition of the unwilling around the table,"" Mr McCourt said He added: ""In other words we are a blackmail tool for the secretary of state to use to force a government around a table at Stormont and we are not going to be used for it."" Mr McCourt said he was ""ashamed that Karen Bradley has the brass neck to call herself secretary of state."" Mrs Bradley sent a letter to victims' groups on Tuesday David Sterling, the head of the NI Civil Service, had asked Mrs Bradley to take control of the issue. BBC News NI has seen a letter from the secretary of state, which was sent to victims' groups on Tuesday. In the letter, Mrs Bradley suggested putting HIA payments as an item in the Stormont talks process was the ""quickest possible way to bring this issue to a resolution"". ""Unfortunately we cannot simply take forward legislation without addressing the consultation feedback,"" Mrs Bradley said in her letter. ""Urgent consideration needs to be given to the views expressed during the consultation."" Mr McCourt's views were shared by others representing survivors. ""It is utterly appalling that, yet again, the survivors are being used as leverage to pressure the political parties into an agreement,"" Claire McKeegan, a solicitor who represents some of the victims,told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""The reality here is that this is yet another political decision where the government will cherry pick issues which it will deal with... and yet when it comes to the survivors of institutional abuse ... the government just will not take steps."" It comes a day after the Executive Office published responses to a public consultation on HIA redress. The consultation received 562 responses. However, the Executive Office said it has completed its analysis of them. Mrs Bradley added that she has also written to Mr Sterling to ask him to include HIA matters in thecurrent round of Stormont talks. He is chairing the working group looking at the programme for government. Last week, the Head of the Civil Service David Sterling said the historical institutional abuse issue ""transcends politics"" ""The current talks are the best opportunity for these complex issues - such as the total redress payment - to be discussed by local politicians,"" she added. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said the secretary of state believes ""the quickest and best route to deliver for victims and survivors is to include this issue as a priority in the talks process"". ""This has a timeframe to make progress by the end of May,"" it added. The HIA inquiry was set up by Stormont leadersto investigate allegations of abuse in children's residential homes run by religious, charitable and state organisations. It was chaired by Sir Anthony Hart and its remit covered a 73-year period from the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1922 through to 1995. The inquiry made a number of recommendations including compensation, a memorial and a public apology to abuse survivors. Since the inquiry ended two years ago,30 survivors of historical institutional abuse have died. Mike Nesbitt, a former victims' commissioner and Ulster Unionist Party leader, said Mrs Bradley was pushing him to ""breaking point"". ""There is not on penny in this year's budget for redress of historical institutional abuse victims,"" he toldBBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""[UUP leader] Robin Swann will contact the secretary of state and 'say get on with it in Westminster', and he will contact the other four main party leaders and say, 'contact the secretary of state'. ""I have dealt in one way or another with the last 13 secretaries of state and she is the worst by a country mile."" Mrs Bradley said she will also meet the chair of the HIA inquiry, Sir Anthony Hart, in the coming days, as well as a number of victims' and survivors' groups next week. Amnesty International has described the latest development as a ""shameful betrayal of abuse victims, who have been let down time after time"". Last week, Stormont's political parties echoed calls from David Sterling and victims' groups for the secretary of state to take immediate action on HIA compensation. Church leaders urge 'courageous leadership' SoS 'powerless to run NI departments' 'Dozens of deaths' since abuse inquiry end No 'further painful delay for victims' Abuse redress scheme 'could cost Â£114m' Abuse compensation laws drafted Deadlock delays child abuse victims' cash Call for no compensation from HIA 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Why Kyle's show was scrapped,"The precise circumstances of Steve Dymond's death are not known. But what is clear, from multiple sources, is that he was troubled and vulnerable before he participated in the show - even though he did so willingly - and that failing the lie detector test was a devastating blow. That much was clear on Tuesday morning, when ITV said that they were minded to launch an inquiry and wait for the coroner's verdict. Yet this morning the show was taken off the air permanently. What happened that should cause the sudden change of mind? The Jeremy Kyle show has been part of ITV's daytime schedule since it started in 2005 Two things at least. First, growing evidence of links between that failed lie detector test and Mr Dymond's death. ITV learned significant new information in the past 24 hours. And second, another morning of damaging front page headlines, especially in the tabloids that are still influential and widely read among ITV's heartland audience. That is explicitly not to say that the decision to take the show off air permanently was primarily a commercial one. The driver may have been moral repugnance, at ITV board level, at what has happened. Certainly, if as part of their internal process board members saw footage of Mr Dymond's response to failing the lie detector test on the episode that was never aired, it must have prompted a visceral reaction. But even if you accept that Carolyn McCall and the ITV board made this decision because of revulsion at what one of their shows did, that doesn't discount the commercial and editorial context in which the decision was made. As an advertiser-funded broadcaster, albeit with multiple linear channels and a digital offering, ITV is under pressure. Kevin Lygo, its creative chief, has tried to reinvent the schedule, and with some success. But the feeling at the top of ITV is that Jeremy Kyle's show was a distinct anomaly within the new offering - and therefore not necessarily a good fit as part of its future. It is hard to imagine that the show would have been permanently scrapped if Lygo and other bosses were deeply admiring of it. In reaching millions of people every weekday, many of them of the view that the mainstream media doesn't generally reflect their lives very well, ITV had a solid, regular offer to a big and loyal audience. In today's exceptionally competitive media environment, when the claims on our attention are multiplying by the minute, that isn't something you give up lightly. Especially when you know that whatever replaces Kyle will struggle to achieve its ratings, at least at first. There is, as I mentioned on last night's bulletins, a massive disconnect here: between those who wanted the show off air, who generally don't watch it; and those who do watch it, and feel they can relate to it. These fans, like ITV bosses, might proffer a liberal argument: people who go on the show are consenting, fully informed, capacitous adults who know what they're doing. In the show's 14-year history, thousands of contributors have been on-stage. And this is not a show that has traditionally led to Ofcom being inundated with complaints. Several people have said to me that, given two people who appeared on Love Island have taken their own lives, it is inconsistent to leave that show on air, and ITV's decision on Wednesday is partly about protecting that highly lucrative show. ITV resist the latter point strongly, and it is important not to generalise from the specific circumstances of any death - particularly suicide. Moreover, Love Island and The Jeremy Kyle Show occupied very different parts of the schedule, and don't belong in the same category of programme. Steve Dymond, who was 63, was found dead a week after he was filmed on the Jeremy Kyle show taking a lie detector test to prove if he'd been faithful to his fiancee I wonder, however, if rising concerns about the mental health of participants in all TV programmes may prompt greater investment in after-care, or an expansion of Ofcom's remit to go much further on the duty of care programme makers have toward their contributors. Celebrity culture is as old as culture itself; but the advent of, first, mass media, and now social media, has rapidly expanded the circle of those who can be famous. But displaying, or even parading, private anguish and trauma in a public way can obviously have a disastrous impact on mental health. Whether it be Strictly Come Dancing, Come Dine With Me, or The Jeremy Kyle Show and Love Island, contributors and contestants give up something of themselves, some degree of autonomy, when they become characters in productions whose goal is commercially motivated entertainment. The journey they go on, and which viewers are encouraged to go on with them, can be life-affirming, cultural gold-dust. That is television at its best. But the spectacle can also lead contributors to a dark place. Even if that is not television at its worst, it is television that - for now - ITV believes should not be aired. No matter the ratings.

MPs to vote on Brexit bill in early June,"This video can not be played Barclay: There needs to be an ""end point"" to Brexit talks Theresa May is giving MPs another chance to vote on Brexit in early June - whether or not the government and Labour have reached a deal by then. A vote on the bill that would pave the way for Brexit was ""imperative"" if the UK was to leave the EU before MPs' summer recess, Downing Street said. Labour sources say they will not back the bill without a cross-party deal. If Mrs May's plan is defeated, Number 10 saidthe UK is set for no deal or for Article 50 to be revoked,external. That is because the EU will not grant a further extension beyond 31 October, says BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay also said the deal the PM negotiated with the EU would be ""dead"" if the bill did not pass. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise began after Mrs May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs. But government sources have told the BBC that there would not be a further attempt if the plan is rejected. PM all but out of time to pass Brexit deal Remain parties 'shouldn't squabble' The vote - which will take place when MPs return from half-term recess - would bring the withdrawal agreement into UK law via the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. The prime minister has negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs have effectively rejected three times in Commons votes. No 10 described Tuesday evening's discussions between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn on Brexit as ""both useful and constructive"". Mrs May had made clear the government's ""determination to bring the talks to a conclusion and deliver on the referendum result to leave the EU"", a spokesman said. A Labour party spokesman said Mr Corbyn had ""raised doubts over the credibility of government commitments, following statements by Conservative MPs and cabinet ministers seeking to replace the prime minister"". He said the Labour leader had called for ""further movement"" from the government and the prime minister's team would bring back ""further proposals tomorrow"". Talks continued on Tuesday evening Bringing the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill forward would allow the prime minister to push ahead with her ambition of delivering Brexit before the summer - despite the lack of agreement so far in the cross-party talks, said BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""It is now time for Parliament to make a decision, reflecting the manifestos of both the Conservative and Labour parties at the last general election and to deliver Brexit in the way that the public were promised."" In the 2017 general election, the two main parties promised in their manifestos to respect the result of the Brexit referendum. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said that if MPs do not vote for the government's Brexit plan next month, then it will ""take us to either the potential of revocation of Article 50 or leaving without a deal"". He said MPs will have to decide ""if they want to vote for Brexit or not"". Brexiteer and Conservative MP Steve Baker said bringing the bill forward ""over the heads"" of DUP MPs - on whom the government relies for a majority - would ""eradicate the government's majority"". ""What is the government thinking?"" he asked. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: ""If the prime minister brings the withdrawal bill to the Commons for a vote, the question will be, 'What has changed?'. ""Unless she can demonstrate something new that addresses the problem of the backstop, then it is highly likely her deal will go down to defeat once again."" Thebackstopis the controversial part of the withdrawal deal that aims to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. It's not exactly the same thumbs up or thumbs down that another meaningful vote would be. That is a straightforward yes or no to the divorce deal that the prime minister negotiated with the EU. This time, it will be the Withdrawal Bill which is a whole tome of new laws that will be needed to take us out of the European Union. The draft of that bill is still being kept under wraps. Very, very few people have seen it. It's much more detailed than just a vote on the agreement would be. Of course, that gives people more things to object to. Although Theresa May might have pleaded in cabinet that people on all sides have to move away from absolutism, and move to a mood of compromise, there's not much sign of it. As and when that bill actually emerges, that may well - in the words of one cabinet minister - make things worse before they can get better. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. This is a requirement under the terms of previous Brexit legislation passed last year. The legislation would make the citizens' rights part of the agreement directly enforceable in UK courts, and set their relationship with the EU's Court of Justice. It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal, and give effect to the so-called backstop plan for the Irish border. MPs will be able to vote on amendments to the bill, and this could allow ministers to make good on any compromise they reach with Labour in the cross-party talks. If the bill is introduced in the first week of June it will come seven days after the European Parliament elections -  which Education Secretary Damian Hinds has acknowledged could be ""difficult"" for the Conservatives. A state visit by US President Donald Trump and a by-election in Peterborough will also take place that same week.

Ferrari worth millions stolen on test driveA 1985 Ferrari 288 GTO that once belonged to Eddie Irvine is driven off by a prospective buyer.Europe,"The car - seen here in a police-supplied photo - is likely worth more than â¬2m (Â£1.7m) An opportunistic car ""collector"" used a test drive to make off with a Ferrari worth â¬2m (Â£1.7m; $2.2m). The suspect had expressed interest in buying a 1985 Ferrari 288 GTO, police in the German city of DÃ¼sseldorf say. He turned up by taxi to the dealership and two hours later, on a test drive, it was time to swap drivers. But when the seller stepped out of the car, the would-be buyer quickly hit the accelerator and vanished. The car was later found in a garage. Police say the ""historic vehicle"" with 43,000km (27,000 miles) on the clock should be valued at more than â¬2m. A listing for the car on the dealer's website says it once belonged to former Northern Ireland Formula 1 driver Eddie Irvine â who raced for Ferrari between 1996 and 1999. Similar vehicles are frequently listed with prices around Â£1.5â2m, or above $3m in the US. They are often sold through specialist auctions at the likes of Sotheby's. Luckily for investigators, the distinctive car - in bright Italian ""Rosso Corsa"" red - attracted so much attention that it was quickly found on Tuesday evening after police appealed for witnesses. It was discovered hidden in a garage in the town of Grevenbroich, not far from DÃ¼sseldorf city centre. Rare Ferrari sells for 32m euros My obsession with 'resurrecting' classic cars Classic car fraudster cost victims Â£82k The suspect, however, remains at large. Police have released a photograph of the man inspecting the Ferrari before the theft. Police are seeking this man in connection with the speedy theft The managing director of the dealership told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper the man had exchanged calls and emails over the course of a number of weeks. Bernhard Kerklo told the newspaper the car could never be sold on the market as it was ""too flashy"". Insiders - the only real buyers for such a rare collector's item - would instantly know it was the stolen vehicle, he said, as all the models of this type ever sold are well-known. Only 272 of the Ferrari 288 GTO were ever built.

'I questioned if pregnancy was worth it',"This video can not be played Essex mum 'bedbound for six months of pregnancy' For Hannah Dalton, pregnancy meant not being able to drink fluids for eight months without throwing up, going into hospital 27 times for intravenous drips and living off ice lollies and anti-sickness medication. Hannah, 30, from Thundersley, Essex, hadhyperemesis gravidarum (HG),external, the severe pregnancy sickness the Duchess of Cambridge experienced during her three pregnancies. She was bedridden for six months, ended up in a wheelchair and, at her worst, her body started to shut down. ""I seriously questioned was this still worth doing,"" Hannah says. ""We wanted a bigger family but was there a chance that we would lose me. I thought I was dying."" With support from her family, Hannah continued with her pregnancy and, in April, gave birth to a girl. The moment she went into labour, the sickness stopped. More than 5,000 women from across the UK have shared their experience of HG with BBC News: Most had considered terminating their pregnancy One in three had thought of killing themselves About three-quarters were left with long-term physical and mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression More than one in three said their experience with their GP had been ""poor"" Last year, UK hospitals saw more than 36,000 admissions for pregnant women needing urgent care because of extreme sickness and dehydration. The causes of HG are unknown. There is some evidence it runs in families. And if a woman had HG in a previous pregnancy, she is more likely to have it in the next. Now, scientists at King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital are launching a four-year study - the world's largest - in the hope of finding some answers. Blood samples and medical histories will be taken from at least 1,000 women admitted to hospital with the most severe HG symptoms and others recruited via the charityPregnancy Sickness Support,external. The study will be looking for genetic links and hormonal changes, in particular a protein, GDF15, produced by the placenta, which affects the part of the brain controlling vomiting and nausea. Consultant obstetrician Prof Catherine Williamson says: ""The problem we have is that the treatments aren't good enough. ""Our ambition is to identify genetic causes of this condition so we can tell why women have it and identify those at risk. ""We can then develop new treatments that are much more effective so hopefully there won't be any more women with severe hyperemesis, because we can control it."" What is hyperemesis gravidarum? HG is very different from morning sickness, which affects about 80% of pregnant women While morning sickness is unpleasant, women can usually continue with their daily lives and eat and drink normally But those with HG can vomit more than 50 times a day and feel constantly and severely nauseous, significantly interfering with their daily lives Complications can include serious vitamin deficiency from the excessive vomiting, significant weight loss, dehydration and malnutrition putting the health of both mother and baby at risk It can often leave a woman bedridden for months, affecting her longer term mental and physical health One in 100 of all pregnant women is admitted to hospital because of severe sickness in pregnancy The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) estimates 10% of women with HG terminate their pregnancy Before IV fluids were introduced, HG was the leading cause of death in early pregnancy There isevidence to suggest Charlotte Bronte died of HG, in 1855 - her death certificate said tuberculosis,externalbut she was four months pregnant and had experienced severe nausea and vomiting Ever since the thalidomide scandal 50 years ago, there has been concern about taking anti-sickness drugs during pregnancy. The sedative, which was found to ease nausea and vomiting in expectant mothers, left thousands of babies with severe birth defects. But most women with HG do end up taking some sort of medication to control the vomiting. Only one, Xonvea, is permitted in Britain for use in pregnancy - but alternatives, such as cyclizine, prochlorperazine and ondansetron, are also regularly prescribed and considered safe by doctors who treat the condition. Women may also be given vitamin B6 and B12 or steroids. If these don't work, women may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment including intravenous fluids. Here are the words of one woman who terminated three pregnancies because of HG. She now has a young child. ""It's your own personal hell that you can't escape from. It's devastating. It completely takes over your life, your family's life, so it would be easier either to just miscarry or die. ""The vomiting and retching was so violent and so intense, I couldn't breathe. ""I couldn't take a breath while I was retching, so I passed out and woke up on the bathroom floor and I thought, 'Oh my God, I can't do this.' ""I did have some dark moments. ""I wanted this baby so badly but I felt like it was killing me and ultimately, out of pure desperation, led me to have three terminations. ""I developed PTSD. I had insomnia and nightmares when I could sleep. ""The senior consultant came round and said, 'Have you tried ginger biscuits and salty crackers?' and I was like, 'Oh my God.' ""It's like saying to somebody with a broken leg, 'Have you tried rubbing lavender oil on it?'... because if the senior consultant didn't understand, what hope did I have?"" Caitlin Dean, from Pregnancy Sickness Support, says not treating HG has serious risks. ""Increasingly evidence suggests that, while the actual nausea and vomiting is unlikely to harm the offspring, the complications of HG, such as malnutrition, dehydration and mental ill health, can cause lifelong consequences for both mother and baby,"" she says. ""There are many wonderful, compassionate doctors out there providing excellent evidence-based care for people with HG but unfortunately there are also doctors who do not recognise the condition, are reluctant to prescribe appropriate treatment or are unaware of the evidence base. ""This leads to a vast amount of unnecessary suffering, costly hospital admissions and, all too often, terminations of otherwise wanted pregnancies. ""In 2019, there is very little excuse not to provide this basic level of care for pregnant women."" Felicity Collins, from Northamptonshire, was desperate for doctors to prescribe her stronger drugs to help her cope with HG. She was already in hospital, and 24 hours away from terminating her twin pregnancy, when she was finally given steroids to ease the constant vomiting. ""It was such a dark time,"" she says. ""It was a decision we made because I knew without those drugs, I couldn't carry on. ""I couldn't eat or drink. Everything made me sick. It was so bad. That's how close it came."" For the next six months, she injected herself daily with steroids, finally giving birth to twin boys, Arthur and Harry, who are now three years old.

""I dream about eating again and drinking again,"" she says. ""This illness makes you a shadow of who you wereâ¦ it's nine months of living hell."" Laura faces about 20 more weeks of HG before she gives birth. She says: ""I fully intend on getting to the end of this pregnancy with a baby, no matter what it does to my health. ""And when this baby girl is born and the HG has gone, I will spend the rest of my life trying to raise awareness about this awful illness.

London Bridge PC waited 'forever' for back-upPC Mia Kerr says she drew her baton to guard people as they tried to save a man who had been stabbed.,"No paramedics were sent to help Sebastien Belanger where he lay dying Medics were not told that three victims of the London Bridge attack needed urgent attention, an inquest has heard. Andrew Beasley co-ordinated the medical response to the attack on 3 June 2017. He told the inquest he did not know Sebastien Belanger, James McMullan and Alexandre Pigeard lay mortally wounded in a courtyard near Borough Market. Earlier, a police officer explained how she had repeatedly asked for paramedics to be sent to help one victim -  Mr Belanger - but none came. The inquest has heard that the scene of the attack was deemed a ""hot zone"" under London Ambulance Service (LAS) protocol, which prevents paramedics from entering for their own safety. Mr Beasley said he had parked a short distance away as the safety of his crew on the scene was ""paramount"". After hearing gunfire in Borough Market, he said he wondered 'am I going to be shot next?'. ""For our own safety we couldn't go forward,"" he told the Old Bailey, which is hearing the inquests into the deaths of the eight people killed in the attack at London Bridge and Borough Market. Mr Belanger, Mr McMullan and Mr Pigeard were eventually brought to ambulances at a safe meeting point, but were already dead. Mr Belanger, a 36-year-old chef, originally from Angers, western France, had been drinking at the Boro Bistro when he was stabbed in the stomach. He was one of eight people killed in the attack. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden PC Mia Kerr said she had been a police officer for about a year at the time of the attacks. She said she came across members of the public giving first aid to Mr Belanger at 22:12 BST. He had collapsed in Green Dragon Court, below where the attackers' van had crashed into railings on London Bridge. After deciding that the group ""looked like they knew what they were doing"", PC Kerr drew her baton in case the attackers returned to the area. ""I was the only officer down there for a little while which felt like forever,"" she said. ""I'd only had about a year of service so it was a lot of pressure."" PC Kerr was recognised for her bravery during the London Bridge attack Another police officer and a police medic arrived over the next few minutes, the court heard. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Victim came 'nose to nose' with attacker The court heard that no members of the LAS came to the scene to help Mr Belanger, despite PC Kerr calling the Metropolitan Police control room to request paramedics. Two members of the public and the officers spent more than half an hour performing CPR on Mr Belanger before he was eventually moved up steps to a waiting ambulance at about 22:45 BST, the inquest heard. BBC correspondent Richard Lister, at the inquest PC Kerr was composed as she told the inquest about how she, another officer and two members of the public fought to revive Sebastien Belanger. She talked of initially being the only police officer there. ""Time just stood still. I just wanted some help,"" she said. The Belanger family listened intently to their interpreter as PC Kerr described standing guard while Lisa Deacon and Craig Smith did what they could for Mr Belanger. None of them knew whether the attackers would come back and PC Kerr, who only had a baton for protection said: ""I was very aware that where I was standing, I was trying to cover three potential entrances and exits."" Ambulance service incident response officer Nicholas Lesslar told the court he was unaware there were seriously injured casualties in the courtyard. Questioning PC Kerr on behalf of the victim's family, Gareth Patterson QC said: ""If you had been told there were LAS [London Ambulance Service] resources available before then, up on the High Street, presumably you would have discussed getting Sebastien up to those ambulances as quickly as possible?"" PC Kerr said: ""We would have discussed it, yes."" Mr Belanger's mother told the inquest on its opening day thatshe was ""so proud"" of him. The Old Bailey also heard from a reveller who described how he jumped over a flowerbed and almost trampled on 32-year-old entrepreneur James McMullan. Andrius Vorobjovas had been celebrating a friend's birthday at the Boro Bistro on the night of the attack. When a man emerged wielding a bloody knife, people ran for their lives. ""You could hear the tables moving, glasses smashing, people running,"" he told the inquest. Mr Vorobjovas headed towards some flowerbeds, where he nearly stepped on Mr McMullan, who had been stabbed after coming to the aid of au pair Sara Zelenak. Mr Vorobjovas said: ""I nearly stepped on a person on his belly. I was very shocked and amazed to see someone there because I could not figure out how they got there."" He added that he hid in the dark passage for some seconds before he ventured out and ""decided to make a run for it"". Mr Vorobjovas said he later directed armed officers back to the courtyard of the Boro Bistro. The other five people killed in the attack were: Xavier Thomas, 45; Chrissy Archibald, 30; Ignacio Echeverria, 39: Sara Zelenak, 21; and Kirsty Boden, 28. The inquests into their deaths continues.

Phone users to get end-of-contract alerts,"Mobile phone subscribers will get a reminder ahead of their contract lock-ins coming to an end Broadband, pay-TV, mobile phone and landline customers must be told when their contracts are about to end and be informed of their providers' best alternative deals, under new rules. The UK's communications watchdogOfcom aims to help users avoid overpaying.,external It said more than 20 million people have stuck with subscriptions beyond their lock-in, often without realising. And those that opt not to move to another package need to be reminded they can still do so on a yearly basis. The watchdog first announced its plan tohelp people secure end-of-contract deals in July 2018,external. Relevant companies have nine months to update their systems and must start sending out the notifications from 15 February 2020. Service providers will need to text, email or send a letter to their consumers between 10 to 40 days before their contracts come to an end saying: the date their contract can be terminated without a penalty the price they have been paying any changes to the price or service that automatically come into effect after the date how much notice they need to give to cancel the deal the best alternative subscriptions on offer, including the prices charged to new customers Users will be able to choose how they should be contacted ""This will put power in the hands of millions of people who're paying more than necessary when they're no longer tied to a contract,"" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director. About 14% of customers do not know whether or not they are still tied to their current contracts, according to research commissioned by the regulator. It added that customers can typically cut the cost of a bundle of the services involved by about 20% if they sign up to a new deal rather than remain on a contract beyond its minimum period, However, some consumer rights organisations still have concerns the measures do not go far enough. During the consultation,Citizens Advice had told Ofcom,externalthat it believed providers should be made to send out more than one notification to each customer and that the companies should also be made to disclose how many of their subscribers are out-of-contract and how much extra on average they are paying compared to in-contract users. ""Almost nine in 10 people think that charging loyal customers more is unfair, and we agree,"" commented Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice's chief executive. ""We look forward to hearing about the concrete actions Ofcom will take to end this systematic scam."" A trade group has also raised concern that small internet providers that specialise in serving business customers might struggle with thecost and complexity of adapting their systems to meet the rules,external. ""[The Internet Services Providers' Association] is concerned at the lack of clarity around small business customers... as it does not seem to take into account the scale and nature of this market,"" said a spokesman for the organisation.

any deal that could be struck between the Conservatives and Labour. âIt is such a fragile administration [that] there is a real
question,â she says. âIs it worth Labour agreeing anything when there is a

ousted â such as changing the rules of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers to
get rid of her in light of an expected wipe-out at the upcoming European elections, or forcing her
from office if the Withdrawal Agreement Bill fails. But, Laura says, ânever say neverâ. She adds: âTheresa Mayâs sticking power has been absolutely
astonishing and the organisation of those who have wanted her out has failed on

After that, Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom will outline what's coming up in Parliament in the forthcoming weeks. There are two debates on subjects proposed by individual MPs and given the nod by the Backbench Business Committee. One is on the definition of Islamophobia, and the other on the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia. House of CommonsParliament And that concludes the day in the House of Commons. MPs will return tomorrow at 09:30 BST for questions to the Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay. House of CommonsParliament The general debate on serious violence has come to an end, and MPs have moved to their closing debate tonight, on Alexandra Hospital in
Redditch. The debate is being led by the local Conservative MP, Rachel Maclean. House of CommonsParliament Home Secretary Sajid Javid and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott are the first speakers in a general debate on serious violence in the House of Commons. The debate is expected to run until 19:00 BST. House of CommonsParliament MPs have moved on to urgent questions in the Commons after PMQs. The first question, from deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, is on theWhatsapp data breach. The second is on the Learning Disabilities Mortality Review.  Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the question on
the lips of everyone in Westminster is how long Theresa Mayâs premiership can
go on for. Speaking on BBC Twoâs Politics Live, she says people involved
in cross-party talks are âvery awareâ that it is âone of the big dynamicsâ of
any deal that could be struck between the Conservatives and Labour. âIt is such a fragile administration [that] there is a real
question,â she says. âIs it worth Labour agreeing anything when there is a
target on the prime ministerâs back?â Tory MPs are talking through all the ways Mrs May could be
ousted â such as changing the rules of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers to
get rid of her in light of an expected wipe-out at the upcoming European elections, or forcing her
from office if the Withdrawal Agreement Bill fails. But, Laura says, ânever say neverâ. She adds: âTheresa Mayâs sticking power has been absolutely
astonishing and the organisation of those who have wanted her out has failed on
several occasions. âBut it really does feel like the endgame now.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Louise Haigh, the shadow policing and crime minister, says research by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show has revealed that four children have been killed by a parent in the last five years after a family court granted access. More than 120 MPs have written to the governmentasking for an inquiry into how family courts in England and Wales treat victims of domestic violence. ""Does the prime minister agree that there is something wrong with the
system,"" she says. A childâs welfare should be ""paramount"" in decisions, Mrs May
responds. She says there are new family court guidelines and no evidence yet to suggest a public inquiry is needed. But the justice minister will meet with Ms Haigh to discuss the issue, Mrs May adds. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach is interrupted by a tannoy announcement.

"Phone users to get end-of-contract alertsInternet, pay-TV, and phone subscribers in the UK must be told when their lock-ins are about to end.","Mobile phone subscribers will get a reminder ahead of their contract lock-ins coming to an end Broadband, pay-TV, mobile phone and landline customers must be told when their contracts are about to end and be informed of their providers' best alternative deals, under new rules. The UK's communications watchdogOfcom aims to help users avoid overpaying.,external It said more than 20 million people have stuck with subscriptions beyond their lock-in, often without realising. And those that opt not to move to another package need to be reminded they can still do so on a yearly basis. The watchdog first announced its plan tohelp people secure end-of-contract deals in July 2018,external. Relevant companies have nine months to update their systems and must start sending out the notifications from 15 February 2020. Service providers will need to text, email or send a letter to their consumers between 10 to 40 days before their contracts come to an end saying: the date their contract can be terminated without a penalty the price they have been paying any changes to the price or service that automatically come into effect after the date how much notice they need to give to cancel the deal the best alternative subscriptions on offer, including the prices charged to new customers Users will be able to choose how they should be contacted ""This will put power in the hands of millions of people who're paying more than necessary when they're no longer tied to a contract,"" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director. About 14% of customers do not know whether or not they are still tied to their current contracts, according to research commissioned by the regulator. It added that customers can typically cut the cost of a bundle of the services involved by about 20% if they sign up to a new deal rather than remain on a contract beyond its minimum period, However, some consumer rights organisations still have concerns the measures do not go far enough. During the consultation,Citizens Advice had told Ofcom,externalthat it believed providers should be made to send out more than one notification to each customer and that the companies should also be made to disclose how many of their subscribers are out-of-contract and how much extra on average they are paying compared to in-contract users. ""Almost nine in 10 people think that charging loyal customers more is unfair, and we agree,"" commented Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice's chief executive. ""We look forward to hearing about the concrete actions Ofcom will take to end this systematic scam."" A trade group has also raised concern that small internet providers that specialise in serving business customers might struggle with thecost and complexity of adapting their systems to meet the rules,external. ""[The Internet Services Providers' Association] is concerned at the lack of clarity around small business customers... as it does not seem to take into account the scale and nature of this market,"" said a spokesman for the organisation.

Facebook Live curbed after NZ attack,"Live-streamed on the internet, the Christchurch mosque attacks killed 51 people Facebook has announced curbs on its streaming feature ahead of an online extremism summit in Paris, called after the Christchurch mosque attacks. The tech giant said there would be a ""one-strike policy"" banning those who violate new Facebook Live rules. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called the measures a ""good first step"". In March the gunman live-streamed the attacks in New Zealand, where 51 people died. Ms Ardern is chairing the summit with French President Emmanuel Macron. It aims to co-ordinate international efforts to stop social media being used to organise and promote terrorism. Political leaders from Europe, Canada and the Middle East will meet senior representatives from companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, who will issue a joint ""call to action"" to cooperate on ""transparent, specific measures"" to eliminate terrorist material. ""The dissemination of such content online has adverse impacts on the human rights of the victims, on our collective security and on people all over the world,"" reads the pledge. NZ and France seek to curb online extremism Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? UK plans social media and internet watchdog UK Prime Minister Theresa May will call for governments and technology companies to work together to prevent terrorist material being shared online. Mrs May said the fact Facebook had to remove 1.5 million copies of the video was ""a stark reminder that we need to do more"". Speaking ahead of the summit, the prime minister said the tactic of live-streaming attacks ""exposed gaps in our response and the need to keep pace with rapidly changing technological developments"". She said: ""My message to governments and internet companies in Paris will be that we must work together and harness our combined technical abilities to stop any sharing of hateful content of this kind."" In a statement,Facebook said that anyone sharing ""violating content"" like a statement from a terrorist group without context would be blocked,externalfrom using Facebook Live for a set period, such as 30 days. The company will also extend these new restrictions to other areas of the platform in the coming weeks, including to advertisers. Facebook has also pledged $7.5m (Â£5.8m) towards new research partnerships to automatically detect banned content, after some users bypassed existing detection systems by uploading edited versions of the Christchurch attacks. ""Our goal is to minimize risk of abuse on Live while enabling people to use Live in a positive way every day,"" the statement said. In the wake of the attack Facebook faced heavy criticism for its lack of response to officials. At the time,New Zealand's privacy commissioner wrote emails to company executives saying their silence was ""an insult to our grief"",external, the New Zealand Herald reported. In her speech, Mrs May is expected to raise concerns about the threat of far-right political groups online and call for an international approach to regulation. She is due to say that technology companies responded effectively to her call to fight propaganda from the Islamic State group, after the 2017 attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge. Last year Islamic State propaganda was at its lowest levels online since 2015, Theresa May is expected to say Last year IS propaganda was at its lowest levels online since 2015 as a result of that co-ordinated global response, she is expected to say. Mrs May will say: ""That shows us what is possible. Our work here must continue in order to keep pace with the threat. But we also need to confront the rise of the far right online.""

Asda could be listed on the stock market,"Asda could be listed on the stock market after its merger with supermarket rival Sainsbury's was blocked by the competition authorities. Judith McKenna, chief executive of Asda's owner Walmart, has told staff such a listing is being considered. But, she told managers at an event in Leeds - where Asda is based - any listing could ""take years"". It comes after the Competition and Markets Authority blocked its merger with rival Sainsbury's. TheCMA was concernedthe tie-up would raise prices for consumers, raise prices at the supermarkets' petrol stations and lead to longer checkout queues. It has left the giant US retailer Walmart looking at options for the supermarket chain it bought 20 years ago. ""While we are not rushing into anything, I want you to know that we are seriously considering a path to an IPO - a public listing - to strengthen your long-term success,"" Ms McKenna said. Asda overtakes Sainsbury's to become second largest supermarket Asda sales growth slows amid 'challenging' trade Walmart would have kept a 42% stake in the enlarged Sainbury's-Asda business if the Â£15bn tie-up had gone ahead. The remarks by Ms McKenna are the first time that Walmart has spoken about the future of its UK operations since the CMA blocked the deal. Managers at the meeting were also told to prepare staff for the need for ""ongoing change"" amid proposals to make changes to contracts that increase the basic pay of staff and require more flexible working. There have been warnings that this could leave staff worse off. Asda is traditionally a value supermarket but had come under pressure from discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have rapidly expanded their market share in recent years. T Walmart, often described as the world's largest retailer, has already listed its Mexico operations and has been buying smaller companies, such as online shopping Jet.com, as well as brands such as Bonobos and Bare Necessities, to expand into new areas. The GMB union said it had called for an urgent meeting with Walmart bosses to discuss the flotation plans. GMB national officer Gary Carter said there was ""uproar among the workforce"" over plans to change Asda employees' contracts. He called on the supermarket to address that ""debacle"" before any stock market listing took place. Ms McKenna told the 1,200 managers at the meeting: ""Walmart does not have a one-size-fits-all approach to operating its international markets, but a consistent focus on strong local businesses powered by Walmart."" Even before the CMA formally blocked the deal, there had been reports that private equity house KKR could consider an offer for Asda and install former Asda chief executive Tony De Nunzio to run the operation. The current Asda chief executive, Roger Burnley, also spoke to the managers at the meeting, which took place on Tuesday, and told them that there would be no change in strategy. Asda, which calls its staff ""colleagues"", intends to make Â£80m of price cuts during the rest of this year and trial new technology. A ""scan and go"" initiative was launched in 25 stores last week and more ""click and collect"" towers will be installed in stores.

Abuse survivors used as 'blackmail tool',"Jon McCourt (centre) said some victims feel they are being used as a leverage tool in talks to restore devolution Historical abuse survivors feel like they are being used as ""a blackmail tool"" in NI's political talks process, a campaigner has said. NI Secretary Karen Bradley haspushed back the prospect of taking legislation through Westminster to give compensation to abuse victims. Payments wererecommended by the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry in 2017. ButStormont's collapsestalled the process. Jon McCourt, of the Survivors North West group, said some victims feel they are being used as a leverage tool in talks to restore devolution. ""Victims and survivors are seeing this as being used for leverage to drag a coalition of the unwilling around the table,"" Mr McCourt said He added: ""In other words we are a blackmail tool for the secretary of state to use to force a government around a table at Stormont and we are not going to be used for it."" Mr McCourt said he was ""ashamed that Karen Bradley has the brass neck to call herself secretary of state."" Mrs Bradley sent a letter to victims' groups on Tuesday David Sterling, the head of the NI Civil Service, had asked Mrs Bradley to take control of the issue. BBC News NI has seen a letter from the secretary of state, which was sent to victims' groups on Tuesday. In the letter, Mrs Bradley suggested putting HIA payments as an item in the Stormont talks process was the ""quickest possible way to bring this issue to a resolution"". ""Unfortunately we cannot simply take forward legislation without addressing the consultation feedback,"" Mrs Bradley said in her letter. ""Urgent consideration needs to be given to the views expressed during the consultation."" Mr McCourt's views were shared by others representing survivors. ""It is utterly appalling that, yet again, the survivors are being used as leverage to pressure the political parties into an agreement,"" Claire McKeegan, a solicitor who represents some of the victims,told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""The reality here is that this is yet another political decision where the government will cherry pick issues which it will deal with... and yet when it comes to the survivors of institutional abuse ... the government just will not take steps."" It comes a day after the Executive Office published responses to a public consultation on HIA redress. The consultation received 562 responses. However, the Executive Office said it has completed its analysis of them. Mrs Bradley added that she has also written to Mr Sterling to ask him to include HIA matters in thecurrent round of Stormont talks. He is chairing the working group looking at the programme for government. Last week, the Head of the Civil Service David Sterling said the historical institutional abuse issue ""transcends politics"" ""The current talks are the best opportunity for these complex issues - such as the total redress payment - to be discussed by local politicians,"" she added. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said the secretary of state believes ""the quickest and best route to deliver for victims and survivors is to include this issue as a priority in the talks process"". ""This has a timeframe to make progress by the end of May,"" it added. The HIA inquiry was set up by Stormont leadersto investigate allegations of abuse in children's residential homes run by religious, charitable and state organisations. It was chaired by Sir Anthony Hart and its remit covered a 73-year period from the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1922 through to 1995. The inquiry made a number of recommendations including compensation, a memorial and a public apology to abuse survivors. Since the inquiry ended two years ago,30 survivors of historical institutional abuse have died. Mike Nesbitt, a former victims' commissioner and Ulster Unionist Party leader, said Mrs Bradley was pushing him to ""breaking point"". ""There is not on penny in this year's budget for redress of historical institutional abuse victims,"" he toldBBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""[UUP leader] Robin Swann will contact the secretary of state and 'say get on with it in Westminster', and he will contact the other four main party leaders and say, 'contact the secretary of state'. ""I have dealt in one way or another with the last 13 secretaries of state and she is the worst by a country mile."" Mrs Bradley said she will also meet the chair of the HIA inquiry, Sir Anthony Hart, in the coming days, as well as a number of victims' and survivors' groups next week. Amnesty International has described the latest development as a ""shameful betrayal of abuse victims, who have been let down time after time"". Last week, Stormont's political parties echoed calls from David Sterling and victims' groups for the secretary of state to take immediate action on HIA compensation. Church leaders urge 'courageous leadership' SoS 'powerless to run NI departments' 'Dozens of deaths' since abuse inquiry end No 'further painful delay for victims' Abuse redress scheme 'could cost Â£114m' Abuse compensation laws drafted Deadlock delays child abuse victims' cash Call for no compensation from HIA 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Call for more climate change stories on TV,"Words like ""vegan"" were used more often than words like ""green energy"" Television shows should have more plot lines and references to climate change to help tackle the issue, according to Bafta. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts says TV can help change people's attitudes towards the planet. It cites successes from previous initiatives based around health and social issues. The call to action comes afterBafta,externalanalysed a year's worth of subtitles from 40 TV channels. It found that references to climate change lagged far behind such terms as ""beer"" or ""sex"". Attenborough climate change TV show a 'call to arms' Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Talk to our climate change bot In its""Subtitles to Save the World"" report,external, the academy analysed 128,719 non-news programmes from across the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky between September 2017 and September 2018. In total, 25 words related to the environment were tracked including ""food waste"", ""electric car"" and ""green energy"". The document found that ""climate change"" had 3,125 mentions - far behind such terms as ""beer"" (21,648), ""dog"" (105,245), ""tea"" (60,060) and ""sex"" (56,307). ""Climate change"" references came up more or less as often as ""zombie"", ""urine"" or ""rhubarb"". The report also found that the possible solutions to reducing individuals' carbon footprints which were mentioned the most in programmes were not the ones that have the biggest impact. Words like ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"" were used more often than words like ""green energy"" and ""hybrid cars"". However, food is responsible for 12% of a person's carbon footprint, and experts say we will need to eat less meat if we want to meet climate targets. The report was prepared by Bafta and was also supported by analysis from Deloitte. Blue Planet II helped communicate the scale of plastic pollution to new audiences Reacting to the document's findings, Bafta's chairwoman Dame Pippa Harris said: ""The TV industry's call to address climate change is clear. ""It's time to write a different script,"" she said, urging the industry to ""use powerful human stories to connect audiences with the world around them"". Meanwhile, the academy's head of industry sustainability, Aaron Matthews, told the BBC that TV programmes did talk about the environment ""in some way, but at quite a low level at the moment"". ""So, obviously, no zombie apocalypse on the horizon, but a climate change one,"" he said. In 2016, EastEnders featured a story about Stacey Branning's postpartum psychosis Television is still seen as a very powerful medium which can change the public's opinion of health and social issues. Blue Planet II opened people's eyes to the problem of plastic pollution. And when soap operas such as EastEnders tackle health and social issues,charities often receive surges in calls for help. Research by the charityMind,externalfound that one in four people who saw a mental health storyline in a soap, contacted a friend, colleague or loved one. In addition, 16% sought professional help themselves. Can TV soaps like Eastenders and Coronation Street really change lives? Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? But when it comes to issues such as sustainability and climate change, some will question whether this can be done without putting off viewers. Charlie Brooker, seen here with Black Mirror co-writer Annabel Jones, has explored climate change as part of the show Satirist and writer Charlie Brooker has explored climate change in his show Black Mirror, but admits including the subject in plotlines ""is a very, very tough nut to crack"". He says: ""It is a difficult thing to see a simple story. ""You tend to get things like Game of Thrones where the dead at the wall and 'winter is coming' was kinda playing out like a metaphor for climate change with everybody warring and getting caught up with their own political squabbles while facing annihilation. ""I never know quite how much drama can change people's opinions and behaviour."" But screenwriter Lisa Holdsworth says little references - like showing people recycling and talking about environmental issues - can make a difference. ""We're beginning to see the real-life effects of climate change on people who've no choice but to bear the brunt of it and, I think, if television and drama are not reflecting that, we're not doing our job properly."" In a statement, the BBC said it was ""helping to arm audiences with the facts on climate change and sustainability"". It added: ""We will be commissioning more programmes which challenge and inform audiences, while building up our collection of online resources and archive about our planet and the environment in which we live."" Sky said it supports the new research and says its ""channels regularly show content that illustrates the breadth of the challenge we face in order to help protect our planet."" ""Broadcasters have an incredible opportunity to highlight environmental issues and inspire public change."" Chief of Staff at Channel Four, Lynette Huntley, said ""this fascinating piece of research will help us identify what more we can do to challenge perception and inspire change around sustainability.""

Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

BBC sees rise in female contributors,"BBC Breakfast is hitting the target In April last year, the BBC launched its 50:50 challenge, aiming for an equal number of male and female expert contributors on-air and online. A year on, the results of last month's data have been revealed and show a big boost in female representation. Nearly three-quarters of BBC news and current affairs/topical programmes had an equal number of male and female expert contributors. Only 27% of 74 English language outlets involved had hit the target initially. Since then, the number of teams signed up to the project across the BBC has topped 500 and 57% of those groups, including recent joiners, have reached the 50:50 mark. BBC director general Tony Hall said: ""It's amazing to see such a remarkable change in just a year - you can see and hear it right across our programming. ""I want the BBC to lead the way on equality and fairness, and this project demonstrates what can be achieved."" The One Show reached its 50:50 target last month More than 20 external media companies have also signed up to replicate the challenge, including the Financial Times and ABC News. Some of the BBC programmes that hit the 50:50 target last month included the Andrew Marr Show, BBC Breakfast, The One Show, Politics Live and Radio 4's Saturday Live. There has also been progress from teams such as Sportsday, shown on the BBC News Channel. It started with 20% female voices and in April reached 43%, more than doubling its female representation. Contributors refers to all BBC reporters, commentators, spokespeople, analysts, academics and case studies featured across BBC content. The BBC's 50:50 Project contributes towards the BBC's commitment to reach 50% women on-screen, on-air and in lead roles across all departments by 2020.

Wales only nation to see child poverty rise,"Ministers had previously aimed to end child poverty in Wales by 2020 Wales was the only UK nation to see a rise in child poverty last year, according to research by charities. It suggested 29.3% of children were in poverty in 2017-18, a rise of 1%. Sean O'Neill, of Children in Wales, said parents had to make ""impossible choices"" between feeding themselves or their children. The Welsh Government blamed policies set by the UK government, which said it was helping families improve their lives through work. The research by Loughborough University was commissioned for the End Child Poverty Network, a coalition of organisations which includes Children in Wales, Oxfam Cymru, Barnardo's Cymru and Save The Children. It suggested more than 206,000 Welsh children were living in poverty in 2017-18. Almost half of children living in Penrhiwceiber are said to be in poverty A child is considered to be growing up in poverty if they are living in a household where the income is below 60% of the median income. It found the Cardiff South and Penarth, Cynon Valley and Rhondda constituencies had the highest proportion in Wales - all at 35% - after housing costs are taken into account. Around a third of children living in valleys council areas like Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf were also in poverty. But the figures also break down child poverty into much smaller areas of deprivation, ward-by-ward across Wales. Penrhiwceiber near Mountain Ash in the Cynon Valley has nearly half of its children in poverty, according to the research. Three wards in Wrexham are proportionately the next worst, followed by two inner city areas of Cardiff - Butetown and Grangetown. A snapshot of child poverty during the year suggests seven out of the 10 wards in Wales with the highest numbers of children in child poverty are in Cardiff. It estimates there are 2,342 living in Grangetown, followed by 2,183 in Ely. Ysgol Glan Morfa is a Welsh-medium primary school in Splott, Cardiff, an area with an estimated 35% of children living in poverty. Ysgol Glan Morfa in Cardiff recycles uniforms to help parents cut costs Head teacher Meilir Tomos said: ""We realise that there are children in our school whose families are struggling in different ways. ""We believe it's vitally important for children to have the best start in life possible and there are many ways in which our school supports families."" As well as a breakfast club, there is a scheme to donate school uniforms which pupils have outgrown so other parents can buy them for a nominal amount. Under fives 'may never catch up' Austerity 'perfect storm' for children in care Flying Start 'failing to reach poorest' School trips and uniform costs ' hit poorest pupils' Mr O'Neill said: ""In far too many parts of Wales, growing up in poverty is no longer the exception, with more children expected to get swept up in poverty in the coming years. ""What this means on a day-to-day basis is that parents are having to make really impossible choices. ""They have to make a choice about whether they feed their children, go without food themselves, and things that many people take for granted - like heating and leisure facilities. ""Parents are really struggling just to get by."" As well as calling for a new strategy to tackle poverty, the group of charities want Wales' political parties to commit themselves to ""ambitious"" child poverty reduction pledges in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections. It also wants a ""credible"" child poverty reduction strategy from the UK government, including restoring the link between benefits and inflation and investing in children's services. Rachel Cable from Oxfam Cymru agreed UK welfare policy had had a large impact, but said the Welsh Government needed to take responsibility as well. ""We had a minister with specific responsibility for tackling poverty. That role has now been scrapped and the tackling poverty role is across all cabinet portfolios. ""While I welcome that breadth of responsibility there needs to be some coordination from the centreâ¦ there needs to be some leadership and we need a strategy and ambitious targets."" The UK government's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it recognised some families needed more support and it continued to spend Â£95bn a year on working-age benefits. It said the study was based on estimates rather than actual measurements. ""Children growing up in working households are five times less likely to be in relative poverty, which is why we are supporting families to improve their lives through work,"" said a UK government spokeswoman. ""Statistics show employment is at a joint record high, wages are outstripping inflation and income inequality and absolute poverty are lower than in 2010. The Welsh Government said the report was not surprising and believed initiatives to help people pay council tax and free school meals would help tackle the problem. ""Analysis by a range of respected organisations has predicted a significant rise in levels of poverty, including child poverty, in the coming years as a direct result of the UK government's tax and welfare reforms,"" said a spokeswoman. She added that the first minister had appointed Lesley Griffiths as lead minister ""to ensure that Welsh Government's budget planning process has maximum effect in tackling poverty"".

Glasgow aims to be first 'net-zero' city,"Glasgow wants to reach the target ""well before"" 2045 Glasgow and Edinburgh are going head-to-head to try to become the UK's first ""net zero"" city. Both cities have now unveiled ambitious plans to cut greenhouse emissions to a neutral level. Glasgow wants to reach the target ""well before"" 2045, while Edinburgh has set its target to 2030. Scottish Power is helping Glasgow with its aims and says a ""race to zero"" is exactly what is needed to effect a significant change. The company believes if inner cities can achieve the goal, then any location can. Both bids exceed the Scotland-wide 2045 ambition announced by the Scottish government earlier this month. Glasgow's plans include mass charging points for electric vehicles. Glasgow City Council and Scottish Power say they will work on a range of programmes to help the city reach the target, including the power giant investing in electric buses. Edinburgh aims to be net-zero by 2030 Edinburgh's initiative will concentrate on local supply chains being redeveloped for ""construction and refurbishment in low carbon design"". A ""circular economy"" could be created - focusing on local production, low waste and increased recycling. More renewable energy will be generated locally. Net-zero is the point where the same volume of greenhouse gases is being emitted as is being absorbed through offsetting techniques like forestry. What is a climate emergency? Scotland to set 'faster' climate change target Sturgeon declares 'climate emergency' Scottish Power chief executive Keith Anderson says Scotland was right to put itself at the front of the race to become net-zero. Speaking onBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: ""If this declaration kick starts a race to zero with other ambitious cities, like Edinburgh, because then we will all be winners. ""The prize is the future of our country and our planet. ""For Scotland to get to net carbon zero by 2045 the cities have to get there first. Edinburgh has announced plans to be more ambitious and we are working very closely with Glasgow council, so let's have some competition. ""A 'race to zero' is a good thing. It is a healthy thing and will create a better environment, cleaner air, so let's go on and start the race."" The move came after Nicola Sturgeon declared a ""climate emergency"" at the SNP party conference last month. A week later the Scottish government said it would legislate to reduce greenhouse emissions to net-zero by 2045. Advice fromthe Committee on Climate Change,externalurged Scotland to set the target five yearsahead of the UK as a wholebecause of its potential for planting trees. Scottish Power said renewable energy capacity had to quadruple and electricity generation needed to double before Scotland could meet the target. The terms carbon neutral and net-zero are often used interchangeably but there are differences. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas but there are others which the Scottish government counts and they are not all carbon-based. Therefore, some climate change campaigners prefer the term net-zero as it includes not just CO2 and methane but also nitrous oxide, which is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities as well as from fossil fuels. Simply being carbon neutral would not stop global warming because these other gases are also harmful to the atmosphere. Perhaps an even better term would be ""climate neutral"". Electric cars and public transport is at the heart of Glasgow's plan Glasgow was the location of Scotland's first low emission zone (LEZ), which intends to phase out the dirtiest buses from the city centre over five years. The UK's largest onshore wind farm, Whitelee, which is owned by Scottish Power, is on the outskirts of the city. The focus is now expected to turn to other parts of the city's economy that can be decarbonised, such as transport and heating. Among the issues they are expected to tackle is that of electric vehicle charging. More than 70% of the city's residents living in flats are unable to charge electric cars as they have no off-street parking. Scottish Power says it is planning a charging system where people can rapidly charge their vehicles away from home - at work or at public charging locations. Sites for these locations are being assessed and the scheme could become a template for other UK cities facing similar problems. Whitelee is the UK's largest onshore wind farm Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said: ""We simply have to act now and the Glasgow city government will develop those partnerships necessary to get to where we simply have to be. We need to be a net-zero city. And we need to be the UK's first net-zero city."" A low emission zone will make it more difficult to bring cars into the city centre Council heads in the capital have set one of the most ambitious targets globally - 15 years earlier than the Scottish government's ambition. The council says it faces ""tough choices"" including replacing conventional gas boilers in properties with carbon neutral alternatives. It will also become more difficult to access the city centre by car with priority given to cyclists, pedestrians and those using public transport. Freight hubs could also be set up outside the city - allowing for low carbon alternatives to bring goods into the Capital. There will be an increase in council and city generation of renewable energy including the ""use of council land and property for micro-generation, support local groups to develop renewables projects and encourage innovation in adopting new technologies"". Waste services are also set for an overhaul. The council hopes to develop a new ""energy recovery facility"" to manage non-recyclable waste. Council leader Adam McVey said: ""We are quite clear the 2030 target should be the target for this organisation and this city - but with a hard limit of 2037. ""I think it's important that this organisation responds to the challenges we all recognise they are incredibly serious. I think it's important that we as a city take our responsibility seriously.""

Frail elderly 'failed by care deserts',"The system for looking after frail older people in England is falling apart, with what are being dubbed ""care deserts"" emerging, a charity says. An analysis carried out for Age UK indicates about 30% of areas now have no residential care beds. The situation is even worse for nursing homes - needed for the most frail - with more than 60% having no places. Recruiting staff and keeping services running were proving a real challenge some areas, the charity said. Age UK believes the situation is now so bad that about 1.4 million older people are not getting the care they need - nearly one in seven of the over-65 population. Ruthe Isden, from Age UK, said: ""The system is failing people - and that is having catastrophic consequences."" The government has promised plans to reform the care system will be put forward soon. What's happened to social care plan? Call for new tax to fund the NHS NHS care funding a 'postcode lottery'  1.4molder people not getting the care they need 7,500postcode districts in England analysed 30%have no residential care beds 62%have no nursing home beds Age UK asked analysts at Incisive Health to look at the state of the care market for older people needing help with daily tasks such as washing and dressing. This covers round-the-clock support in care homes and nursing homes and daily help in individuals' homes. The research said services were being cut, with some areas having no or very little care available, calling these ""care deserts"". To given an idea of the scale of this, the research looked at how many local areas did not have any residential care or nursing home beds. It found out of the 7,500 postcode districts in England, about 2,200 had no residential care beds and 4,600 had no nursing ones with the north-east, south-west and east of England particularly badly hit. Postcode districts - certainly in urban areas - are pretty small, essentially covering neighbourhoods. So, it may be the case that residents in a district with no care home do not have to travel far to find a care home if a neighbouring district has one. What is more, some districts will be largely rural areas, such as a national park, where you would not necessarily need a home. Nonetheless, Age UK believes it is a good proxy for illustrating the problem. Access to help at home was harder to quantify - but Age UK said it was undoubtedly a problem, with the number of hours of care being provided falling. Age UK said the system was severely underfunded - spending by councils had fallen by 9% per person in real terms since 2010. One result of this had been an increasing reliance on self-funders - those who paid the entire cost of care themselves. But even that had not been enough, with reports of services struggling to stay open and recruit enough staff. In Hull, for example, a third of nursing home beds had closed in the past three years. Overall, about 8% of posts in the care sector were vacant, Age UK said. And nursing jobs were the worst hit, with more than 12% of posts unfilled. The government has set aside extra money for the social care system in recent years to help relieve some of the pressures. In the long term, it has promised a Green Paper to reform the entire system. This has been promised since the 2017 election but has been repeatedly delayed. The Department of Health and Social Care said it would be published soon. Kieran Lucia, from Incisive Health, who carried out the research for Age UK, said it could not come ""soon enough"". ""The system is broken,"" he added.

May to call for curbs on internet terror,"Live-streamed on the internet, the Christchurch mosque attacks killed 51 people Facebook has announced curbs on its streaming feature ahead of an online extremism summit in Paris, called after the Christchurch mosque attacks. The tech giant said there would be a ""one-strike policy"" banning those who violate new Facebook Live rules. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called the measures a ""good first step"". In March the gunman live-streamed the attacks in New Zealand, where 51 people died. Ms Ardern is chairing the summit with French President Emmanuel Macron. It aims to co-ordinate international efforts to stop social media being used to organise and promote terrorism. Political leaders from Europe, Canada and the Middle East will meet senior representatives from companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, who will issue a joint ""call to action"" to cooperate on ""transparent, specific measures"" to eliminate terrorist material. ""The dissemination of such content online has adverse impacts on the human rights of the victims, on our collective security and on people all over the world,"" reads the pledge. NZ and France seek to curb online extremism Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? UK plans social media and internet watchdog UK Prime Minister Theresa May will call for governments and technology companies to work together to prevent terrorist material being shared online. Mrs May said the fact Facebook had to remove 1.5 million copies of the video was ""a stark reminder that we need to do more"". Speaking ahead of the summit, the prime minister said the tactic of live-streaming attacks ""exposed gaps in our response and the need to keep pace with rapidly changing technological developments"". She said: ""My message to governments and internet companies in Paris will be that we must work together and harness our combined technical abilities to stop any sharing of hateful content of this kind."" In a statement,Facebook said that anyone sharing ""violating content"" like a statement from a terrorist group without context would be blocked,externalfrom using Facebook Live for a set period, such as 30 days. The company will also extend these new restrictions to other areas of the platform in the coming weeks, including to advertisers. Facebook has also pledged $7.5m (Â£5.8m) towards new research partnerships to automatically detect banned content, after some users bypassed existing detection systems by uploading edited versions of the Christchurch attacks. ""Our goal is to minimize risk of abuse on Live while enabling people to use Live in a positive way every day,"" the statement said. In the wake of the attack Facebook faced heavy criticism for its lack of response to officials. At the time,New Zealand's privacy commissioner wrote emails to company executives saying their silence was ""an insult to our grief"",external, the New Zealand Herald reported. In her speech, Mrs May is expected to raise concerns about the threat of far-right political groups online and call for an international approach to regulation. She is due to say that technology companies responded effectively to her call to fight propaganda from the Islamic State group, after the 2017 attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge. Last year Islamic State propaganda was at its lowest levels online since 2015, Theresa May is expected to say Last year IS propaganda was at its lowest levels online since 2015 as a result of that co-ordinated global response, she is expected to say. Mrs May will say: ""That shows us what is possible. Our work here must continue in order to keep pace with the threat. But we also need to confront the rise of the far right online."" The UK has recently published its own plans to introduce a legal duty of care for internet companies, which would be enforced by a new independent regulator.

"Phone users to get end-of-contract alertsInternet, pay-TV, and phone subscribers in the UK must be told when their lock-ins are about to end.Technology","Mobile phone subscribers will get a reminder ahead of their contract lock-ins coming to an end Broadband, pay-TV, mobile phone and landline customers must be told when their contracts are about to end and be informed of their providers' best alternative deals, under new rules. The UK's communications watchdogOfcom aims to help users avoid overpaying.,external It said more than 20 million people have stuck with subscriptions beyond their lock-in, often without realising. And those that opt not to move to another package need to be reminded they can still do so on a yearly basis. The watchdog first announced its plan tohelp people secure end-of-contract deals in July 2018,external. Relevant companies have nine months to update their systems and must start sending out the notifications from 15 February 2020. Service providers will need to text, email or send a letter to their consumers between 10 to 40 days before their contracts come to an end saying: the date their contract can be terminated without a penalty the price they have been paying any changes to the price or service that automatically come into effect after the date how much notice they need to give to cancel the deal the best alternative subscriptions on offer, including the prices charged to new customers Users will be able to choose how they should be contacted ""This will put power in the hands of millions of people who're paying more than necessary when they're no longer tied to a contract,"" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director. About 14% of customers do not know whether or not they are still tied to their current contracts, according to research commissioned by the regulator. It added that customers can typically cut the cost of a bundle of the services involved by about 20% if they sign up to a new deal rather than remain on a contract beyond its minimum period, However, some consumer rights organisations still have concerns the measures do not go far enough. During the consultation,Citizens Advice had told Ofcom,externalthat it believed providers should be made to send out more than one notification to each customer and that the companies should also be made to disclose how many of their subscribers are out-of-contract and how much extra on average they are paying compared to in-contract users. ""Almost nine in 10 people think that charging loyal customers more is unfair, and we agree,"" commented Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice's chief executive. ""We look forward to hearing about the concrete actions Ofcom will take to end this systematic scam."" A trade group has also raised concern that small internet providers that specialise in serving business customers might struggle with thecost and complexity of adapting their systems to meet the rules,external. ""[The Internet Services Providers' Association] is concerned at the lack of clarity around small business customers... as it does not seem to take into account the scale and nature of this market,"" said a spokesman for the organisation.

Huawei willing to sign 'no-spy' agreements,"Huawei is ""willing to sign no-spy agreements with governments"" including the UK, its chairman Liang Hua said. It follows concerns from some countries that China could use products made by the telecoms firm for surveillance. The Chinese company has denied that its work poses any risks of espionage or sabotage. Huawei has also said it is independent from the Chinese government, but some countries have blocked it from their 5G networks on national security grounds. A recent report suggested theUK could allow Huawei's telecoms equipment to be part of the country's 5G networks, with some limitations. ""We are willing to sign no-spy agreements with governments, including the UK government, to commit ourselves to making our equipment meet the no-spy, no-backdoors standard,"" Liang Hua said via an interpreter at a business conference in London on Tuesday. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss Huawei: The world's most controversial company? The next US-China battleground Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment. It faces a growing backlash from Western countries on concerns over the security of its products used in next-generation 5G mobile networks.

The US has restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products andhas put pressure on allies to shun them. On Wednesday, Reuters reported the US was likely to tighten restrictions on Huawei with President Donald Trump expected to sign an executive order this week barring US companies from using telecoms equipment made by firms that pose a national security risk.

Payday loan complaints 'up 130% in a year',"Complaints against payday lenders have soared to a five-year high, the industry watchdog has said. There were nearly 40,000 new complaints brought last year, up a ""startling"" 130% on the 17,000 the previous year, the Financial Ombudsman Service said. In too many cases people have been left to struggle with debt, it said. Short-term lender industry body the Consumer Finance Association (CFA) said most of the complaints dated back a number of years. Most of the complaints were made about affordability. Some customers took out 20 to 30 loans in a short space of time, either to pay off other outstanding loans or for household bills. Many of the complaints came through claims management companies, the CFA said. A CFA spokeswoman said: ""These figures show a deeply disappointing increase, driven by a flood from claims management companies and we continue to see many a complaint that has no foundation. ""Now nearly nine in 10 of complaints to firms are generated by these companies. The complaints are often of poor quality."" She added that the lender has to pay the case fee regardless of who submits the complaint, and said some members had questioned the ombudsman's complaint figures. Last calendar year the highest volume of complaints were made against QuikQuid owner Casheuronet. John from Stockton on Tees says he has had payday loans with ""virtually every company out there"", including ones that have gone into administration. ""I am in contact with the administrators by email who tell me I am owed thousands but if I receive anything it will be next year and a small percentage of what I am owed,"" he says. ""I have also come to an agreement with one lender who has agreed to refund me Â£350 without involving the financial ombudsman. ""The problem with all this though is that I was paying back these debts with all the inflated interest and charges for months. ""Now these loans no longer exist will I get these payments back?"" Overall, complaints about financial services shot up to a five-year high, with more than 388,000 new complaints made in the last financial year, a 14% increase on the previous year. Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman and chief executive of the Financial Ombudsman Service, said: ""Too often we see that the interests of consumers are not hard-wired into financial services. ""This marks a five-year high in the number of complaints that consumers have brought to us, and the behaviour we've seen from some businesses is simply not good enough."" The Financial Ombudsman Service added that complaints about fraud and scams increased by more than 40% in 2018-2019, with more than 12,000 received. Gareth Shaw of consumer group Which? said: ""Bank transfer fraud is spiralling out of control, with people losing life-changing sums every day and then facing a gruelling battle to get their money back from the very banks that should be preventing them from falling victim in the first place."" Payday lenders say that they have faced a flood of spurious compensation claims, driven by commission-hungry claims management companies. The lenders are furious that if the borrower appeals to the Financial Ombudsman Service they have to pay Â£550 per case whatever the outcome. And since the collapse of Wonga, which fell into administration in August last year, the rush to complain has become even more urgent because of the fear that more firms will fail and the compensation will dry up. But while the ombudsman agrees that the numbers of complaints are ""startling"", it has little sympathy for payday lenders which it says have left too many people struggling with debt.
