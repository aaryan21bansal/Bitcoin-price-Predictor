Queen tops Christmas Day TV viewing,"This video can not be played The Queen's Christmas message The Queen's Christmas Broadcast was the most watched TV programme on Christmas Day, according to overnight figures. But Call the Midwife ended up the most watched programme overall once on-demand figures were calculated. Overnight figures revealed a combined audience of 6.4 million watched The Queen'sannual messageon BBC One, ITV, Sky One and Sky News. That figure rose to 7.1 million once figures were consolidated - less than Call the Midwife's 8.7 million total. The Barb figures show a continuing decline in Christmas TV viewing - 7.6 million watched the Queen last year. Michael McIntyre's Big Christmas Show on BBC One initially seemed the highest-rated programme on a single channel, with overnight figures putting its audience at 6.1 million viewers. Yet even when its figures were consolidated, its 7.6 million viewers only saw it claim second place on the festive viewing rundown. The overnight figures mentioned include people who watched a programme live or on catch-up on TV before 02:00 GMT on 26 December. But they do not include those watching on-demand services on smartphones and computers, figures that are added later to obtain a total, ""consolidated"" figure. Former JLS star Aston Merrygold won Strictly Come Dancing's Christmas special The Queen used her Christmas broadcast to say that the Christian message of ""peace on Earth and goodwill to all"" was ""needed as much as ever"". Zog, the BBC's animated version of  Julia Donaldson's book, ended up fifth on the viewing chart with a consolidated seven-day audience of 6.9 million. By Lizo Mzimba, entertainment correspondent The BBC may have, as usual, dominated this year's ratings - but traditional TV viewing on Christmas Day is falling significantly. Ten years ago, Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death was watched by an overnight audience of 14.3 million people. That's more than double the number who watched this year's highest rated programme, The Queen's Christmas Broadcast. Even solid performers like Mrs Brown's Boys lost large numbers of viewers compared with 2017. The comedy is down by more than 2 million year on year. The growing impact of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon is undoubtedly partly to blame. It's likely that a lack of ""event programmes"" that can deliver really big in the way that shows like Only Fools & Horses did, has also contributed. But the most significant factor is probably a very straightforward one - people's viewing habits are changing, and TV viewing on Christmas Day is becoming less important to us. While the traditional image of families settling down to enjoy a variety of festive TV together is still an accurate one for many, for more and more people TV is no longer the automatic choice on Christmas Day. Audiences for Christmas Day have been falling in recent years and no programme has attracted more than 20 million viewers since 2001. The single biggest Christmas Day TV audience was recorded in 1989 when 21.8 million watched the UK premiere of the film Crocodile Dundee. The official figures do not include repeats - ruling out the late-night episode of EastEnders broadcast on Christmas Day 1986 featuring ""Dirty"" Den Watts handing divorce papers to his wife Angie. The programme had an audience of 30 million if a repeat on 28 December is included, but only 18.9 million watched it on 25 December. 1. Call the Midwife (BBC One) - 8.7m 2.

US stock markets rally after slump,"Stock markets in the US have seen significant rises, with the Dow Jones up by nearly 5% and the technology-focused Nasdaq rising by nearly 6%. In Asia, markets were following suit on Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up more than 3% in early trade. It contrasts strongly with the run-up to Christmas when stocks suffered their worst weekly falls in a decade. Analysts say data from MasterCard showed US holiday retail sales up 5.1%, the strongest growth in six years. Confidence was also boosted by White House assurances that Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's job was safe. Investors have been concerned by reports that President Donald Trump had discussed firing Mr Powell. US shutdown could stretch into new year Fed raises rates despite Trump opposition The partial US government shutdown and continuing US-China trade tensions also contributed to the recent downturn. ""The market is extremely oversold where we left it [on Monday],"" said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services, based in Florida. ""You cannot make the assumption that this correction is over, but today's action is definitely a very positive signal."" On Monday, President Trump lashed out at the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, as the stock market plunged. The president said the Fed was ""the only problem"" of the US economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett later tried to calm Wall Street jitters, telling ABC News that Mr Powell's job was ""100%"" safe.

Death crash driver found dead in cell,"Casper Platt-May (left) and his brother Corey were on a family trip when they were killed A driver who killed two brothers in a hit-and-run crash while high on drugs has been found dead in prison. Robert Brown, 53, wasjailed for 10 and a half yearsfor killing Casper Platt-May, two, and Corey, six, as they crossed a road in February. He had previously been jailed for possessing a machete and was let out on licence six days before the crash. Serco, which runs HMP Dovegate, confirmed a prisoner had been found dead on Christmas Day. Brown was jailed in April after admitting causing the boys' deaths by dangerous driving, and had his sentence increased in July from nine years to 10 and a half. Casper and Corey were with their mother Louise on the way to a park when they were hit by Brown's Ford Focus as they crossed MacDonald Road in Coventry. Robert Brown was found dead in his cell on Christmas Day Brown, who had 30 previous driving convictions, had never had a driving licence and was banned from driving at the time of the crash. West Midlands Police's Collision Investigation Unit calculated that Brown, who had taken cocaine, diazepam and zopiclone, was driving at more than 60mph. Both boys were taken to hospitalbut neither could be saved. Their mother was unhurt. At a plea hearing, the court was told Brown, of Attwood Crescent, Wyken, and his passenger Gwendoline Harrison had tried to flee the scene on foot but members of the public attempted to stop them. Harrison, 42, of Triumph Close, Wyken, hit someone who intervened. She admitted a charge of assault intending to resist arrest and was jailed for six months. In May, the boys' father Reece Platt-May wasfound dead in a hotel in Greece. A spokesman for Serco, which manages the prison where Brown had been serving his sentence, said: ""We can confirm a prisoner died [on Christmas Day] at HMP Dovegate and, as is normal, the death will be subject to a coroner's investigation.""

US man finishes solo race across Antarctica,"Colin O'Brady's Instagram page features a daily selfie of his chores, such as securing his tent each night A 33-year-old American man has become the first person to cross Antarctica alone and unassisted. Explorer Colin O'Brady finished in 53 days, ahead of British Army Captain Louis Rudd, 49, after an epic race across the ice. Both men set out on 3 November to complete the journey, which killed a British ex-Army officer two years ago. The 921-mile (1,482km) trek took them across the coldest continent on Earth in some of the most extreme conditions. O'Brady, a pro-athlete who posts his milestones on social media, spoke to the BBC on one his harshest days. ""I'm tired, man. I'm exhausted, but I'm making steady progress every day,"" he said from his satellite phone on 20 December - Day 47 - as he camped amid a storm and massive ridges of ice and snow known as sastrugi. After a day which was like being ""in the inside of a ping-pong ball"" O'Brady said he was grateful to have negotiated the wavelike ridges of hard snow and ice in low visibility without having broken a leg. ""I've been dragging an almost 375lb (170kg) sled for 12-13 hours per day through the coldest harshest place in the world,"" he said, adding that he had lost so much weight that his wristwatch had been slipping off and he is ""scared"" to look at his unclothed body.

The two men set off from the Ronne Ice Shelf after poor weather delayed their start for several days. Only days earlier they had met for the first time at a hotel bar in Chile and agreed to turn their separate attempts to cross solo and unaided into a formal competition. Both men come from very different backgrounds. In 2008 O'Brady suffered severe burns to 25% of his body during a holiday in Thailand, leading doctors to tell him that he may never walk normally again. He recovered and went on to race in triathlons before climbing each of the Seven Summits - the highest peaks on every continent. He has also skied to both the north and south pole and hiked to the highest point in every US state. O'Brady wore tape on his face to stave off frostbite Sastrugi are hard wave-like ridges in the ice that can be extremely difficult to navigate Throughout it all, he has posted words of inspiration on Instagram, and used his satellite phone to take a question each night from one of the thousands of students who have followed his solo expedition. Rudd, a father of three, was given leave from the military where he has spent his career, in order to train  and attempt to make the crossing. He was inspired to attempt the adventure after the death of his friend and colleague, Henry Worsley, along the same route. Worsley died of an illness after he was rescued only 30 miles from the finish line - the Ross Ice Shelf. Capt Louis Rudd has served in the Army for 33 years In his daily dispatch from the ice on Christmas Eve, Rudd described carrying Worsley's flag to the places that his friend had come so close to reaching. ""I'm carrying Henry's flag... that he carried on all his journeys, and it's really important to me that, this time, the flag goes all the way, and completes the journey right to the end,"" he said, before completing his posts as he always does. ""Onwards..."" Explorer dies in Antarctic crossing Polar mission Army explorer appointed MBE Antarctica is well-known as the coldest continent on Earth, but it is also the highest and driest. The cold freezes all moisture, technically making the landscape a desert. Mile-thick sheets of ice covering the continent also make it the highest average-elevation landmass with a peak that the men reach of 9,613ft. Allow Instagram content?

Sunlight, which shines 24 hours a day in the summer, O'Brady says, ""is weird and disorienting but I actually kinda like it,"" since it allows him to charge his solar panels. The men must carry all the calories they will consume throughout the journey, a nearly impossible task considering their level of energy exertion, and boil ice and snow for all their drinking water. Capt Rudd sent voice despatches from the ice along his journey Apart from occasionally spotting each other as specks on the horizon, they have seen very few forms of life. At the South Pole, O'Brady says he saw some signs of life from the polar researchers stationed there, but was forbidden from accepting any help which would have prevented him from achieving his goal unaided. O'Brady eats his morning oatmeal in near white-out conditions Before bed, they each pack all their wet clothes into their sleeping bag, so they could use their body heat to dry the gear throughout the night. But soon they will be back in their beds, looking back on their accomplishment and dreaming of the next previously-impossible goal.

Three Channel migrants brought ashore,"French authorities said the group were in a semi-rigid vessel Three migrants spotted in a small boat in the Channel have been brought ashore by the Border Force. The men were about 10 miles (16.5km) off France when French authorities spotted them after midnight. the Prefecture Maritime de la Manche said. Border Force officials brought the group ashore at Dover. Forty migrants, including two children, were rescuedon Christmas Day. The Home Office has blamed organised crime, but Dover's MP has demanded action. Coastguards said they were not involved in the latest incident on Boxing Day. Forty migrants in Christmas Day rescues Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? A Home Office spokesman said: ""Evidence shows there is organised criminal gang activity behind illegal migration attempts by small boats across the Channel. ""We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk."" The Home Office said the three rescued by French teams overnight were transferred to UK authorities and brought to Dover. The group, who presented themselves as Iranian, were medically assessed and passed to immigration officials, the spokesman said. Those rescued on Christmas Day presented themselves as Iraqi, Iranian and Afghan. Dover's Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has said the Home Office and National Crime Agency ""do not appear to be on top of this situation"". He said: ""With well over 100 migrants having broken into Britain in recent weeks they need urgently to explain what they are doing to put a stop to these crossings. ""This is an incredibly dangerous crossing to make in the middle of winter. ""Our volunteer lifeboat crews are being called out nearly every day - even during Christmas. ""The British and French authorities must get a grip and find and stop the traffickers behind these crossings before there is a tragedy in the English Channel."" A statement from the French authorities also warned migrants planning to cross the the Dover-Calais strait - the world's busiest shipping lane - they were endangering lives. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Tributes to man killed in police car crash,"Tony Carroll's family said he was ""always the life and soul of the party"" A pedestrian who died after being hit by a police car on Christmas Day had enjoyed the ""best day ever"" before the crash, his family said.

Couple die within hours of each other,"More than Â£17,000 has been raised for the families of Jason Francis and Alice Robinson Thousands of pounds has been raised to help the families of a British couple who died within hours of each other in Australia. Former Market Drayton Town footballer Jason Francis, 29, was hit by a car near the home he shared with partner Alice Robinson in Scarborough, Perth. Ms Robinson, who was said to have been ""heartbroken"", was later found dead. More than 32,000 Australian dollars (Â£17,938) has been donated since Christmas Eve. A Go Fund Me Page said this would help their relatives with any costs that might be incurred in sending the couple's bodies home. Mr Francis had been on a day out with friends from Cottesloe Rugby Club, before getting a taxi home on Saturday evening. Western Australia Police said a white VW Jetta, driven by an 18-year-old man, hit a male pedestrian on Stanley Street in Scarborough. The force confirmed it was also investigating the death of a woman, and was preparing a report for the coroner. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sam Diamond, president of the rugby club, which Mr Francis joined at the beginning of the year after moving to the area, said of the couple: ""They were two of the finest people you could meet. ""They well and truly ingrained themselves in our club."" He said he understood Ms Robinson had gone outside the couple's home to investigate when she saw the flashing emergency lights. ""She was told by first responders that it was Jason they were working on,"" he said. ""We don't know what happened to her after this. I know the police have launched an inquiry into it. ""She has gone missing after notifying some of our friends of what's happened (to Mr Francis) and hasn't been found until the next morning."" He described Ms Robinson, who worked for a digital marketing company but was also a talented artist, as having ""an infectious laugh"" and being ""very bubbly"". Mr Diamond added: ""Jason was the sort of person that's always got the time of day for everyone. Loved talking, loved working out, loved staying fit and healthy. ""They were just genuine, down-to-earth, fantastic people."" He said the mothers of both Mr Francis, who was in the process of becoming a firefighter, and Ms Robinson had expressed their appreciation for the funds raised. A number of Shropshire sports clubs paid tribute to Mr Francis, including the captain of Market Drayton Town FC. Paul McMullen said: ""You young man were such a fine piece of our puzzle at MDTFC during our success and it was a pleasure to be part of it playing alongside of you."" Allow Facebook content?

Worker broke back in Tesco 'hit and run',"This video can not be played Two people were injured outside the Tesco store A supermarket worker broke her back when a car drove into her and others outside the store, her colleague said. A blue Citroen C3 hit pedestrians before driving away from the Tesco car park in Rickmansworth on Sunday. Police said a woman was taken to Watford General Hospital with serious injuries while a man was treated for slight injuries. A fundraising page set up to support the victim has already raised nearly four times its target. A video on social media shows the blue car being rammed by shoppers with trolleys and crashing into other vehicles nearby before it manages to drive away from the store car park. Police are still trying to find the vehicle and its occupants and confirmed no-one had been arrested. Julia Matthews, a colleague and friend of the injured woman, set up the fundraising page. She said: ""She shouldn't have had this happen to her ever, but especially not just before Christmas. ""She should be at home with her family, with her partner and her child enjoying the holiday."" The car had its rear windscreen smashed as it tried to leave a Tesco car park Ms Matthews added she hoped the money would help her colleague to enjoy Christmas when she was allowed to go back home. ""I've created this for all those who have asked for a way to help, to help bring some positivity and love into her life when it has been shattered by selfish criminals,"" she added. More than Â£800 had been pledged by 14:00 on Boxing Day. Officers said the driver and a passenger had been involved in an ""incident"" inside the store in Harefield Road moments before. A person was challenged by security staff after allegedly attempting to steal alcohol.

Japan to restart commercial whale hunts,"Japan will be free to hunt whales like the minke for commercial purposes from July onwards Japan says it is to restart commercial whaling in July in a move that is likely to draw international criticism. It said it would withdraw from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the body tasked with whale conservation. Commercial whaling was banned by the IWC in 1986 after some species were driven almost to extinction. Officials in Japan, an IWC member since 1951, say eating whales is part of the country's culture. For many years Japan has hunted whales for what it calls ""scientific research"" and to sell the meat, a programme widely criticised by conservationists. Wednesday's announcement had been expected, but conservation groups warn the move will have serious consequences. It means Japan will be able to freely hunt species currently protected by the IWC, like minke whales. Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said commercial whaling would be restricted to Japanese territorial waters and economic zones. As a result, Japan will stop hunting in Antarctic waters and the southern hemisphere, a prospect conservation groups had welcomed before it was formally confirmed. Could the ban on killing whales end? Japan and the whale A statement by Japan's government said the IWC was not committed enough to one of its goals, of supporting sustainable commercial whaling. It accused the IWC of being focused only on the aim of conserving numbers. Sushi made of whale meat and blubber sold in Miyagi prefecture A number of coastal communities in Japan have hunted whales for centuries, butconsumption in the country surged only after World War Two when whales were the main source of meat. It has plummeted in recent decades. According to Japan's Asahi newspaper, whale meat makes up only 0.1% of all meat sold in Japan. In a joint statement, Australia'sForeign Minister Marise Payne and Environment Minister Melissa Price said they were ""extremely disappointed"" with Japan's decision,external. ""Australia remains resolutely opposed to all forms of commercial and so-called 'scientific' whaling,"" the statement added. Before the formal announcement was made, Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns at Humane Society International in Australia, said Japan would be ""operating completely outside the bounds of international law"". She added: ""This is the path of a pirate whaling nation, with a troubling disregard for international rule."" Greenpeace Japan urged the government to reconsider, and warned it would risk criticism as the host of the G20 summit in June. Sam Annesley, Greenpeace Japan's executive director, said: ""It's clear that the government is trying to sneak in this announcement at the end of year, away from the spotlight of international media, but the world sees this for what it is. ""The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures."" In 1986, IWC members agreed to a moratorium on hunting to allow stocks to recover. Pro-whaling nations expected the moratorium to be temporary, until consensus could be reached on sustainable catch quotas. Currently, Japan kills whales under a so-called scientific research programme Instead, it became a quasi-permanent ban. Whaling nations, such as Japan, Norway and Iceland, however argue the practice is part of their culture and should continue in a sustainable way. Today, whale stocks are carefully monitored, and while many species are still endangered, others - like the minke whale that Japan primarily hunts - are not. Japanese whaling: why the hunts go on In September, Tokyo tried to get the IWC to allow commercial catch quotas but the proposal was rejected. It will still be bound by certain international laws, despite leaving the IWC. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea binds countries to co-operate on the conservation of whales ""through the appropriate international organisations for their conservation, management and study"". The text does not say which international organisation that is. Japan could either try to set up another international body if it manages to get enough other countries to sign up - or join an existing one like the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (Nammco) instead. Like a smaller version of the IWC, Nammco is a grouping of pro-whaling nations - Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands - born out of frustration with the IWC. Yes, Japan has been hunting whales for the past 30 years but under a scientific programme, granted as an exception under the IWC ban. Critics say the practice is a cover for what actually amounts to commercial whaling. Japan takes hundreds of whales each year It means that whales can be taken for scientific studies and the meat can later be sold for consumption. Japan has caught between about 200 and 1,200 whales each year,external, saying it is investigating stock levels to see whether the whales are endangered or not. Japan has repeatedly tried to overturn the moratorium and secure agreement on sustainable catch quotas. The last attempt to do so came in September at an IWC summit in Brazil. Japan offered a package of measures, including setting up a Sustainable Whaling Committee and sustainable catch limits ""for abundant whale stocks/species"". The proposal was voted down. Since then there has been talk of the country simply leaving the body so it will no longer be bound by its rules.

Trump's foreign policy worries allies,"Is this, at last, the true face of the Trump administration's foreign policy? US ground troops withdrawn from Syria at short notice; the long-heralded departure of James Mattis - a much respected defence secretary - who can clearly no longer tolerate the president's mercurial approach to security and defence. Now there are reports (as yet unconfirmed) about a partial US pull-out from Afghanistan, where American forces provide the backbone of the train-and-assist effort that is helping the Afghan security forces in their faltering efforts to contain the Taliban insurgency. In one sense, none of this should be a surprise. US President Donald Trump has long railed against the wars bequeathed to America by his predecessors. Trump rewrites US Syria policy White House revolving door: Who's gone? Many analysts question the value of the US troop presence in Syria, just as they point to the inherent problems in seeking to bolster an Afghan government riven by corruption, factional infighting and so on. But to cite the deficiencies of these deployments and to question where they are going or what value they bring is one thing. Simply to up sticks and depart is quite another. Withdrawal, just as much as intervention, requires a game plan, a strategy or framework into which Washington's own actions are placed. And the simple fact is that President Donald Trump does not seem to do strategy. How, for example, does the US withdrawal from Syria fit into any coherent plan either to stabilise the country or to contain the sizeable elements of the Islamic State (IS) group that still remain? How does it help the US to counteract Russia and Iran's rising influence in the region? And what signal does it send to America's allies about its commitment to their security? James Mattis (right) resigned a day after President Trump said he was withdrawing troops from Syria The departure of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis raises many similar questions. Yes, he resigned, but he had clearly fallen out of favour with Mr Trump weeks ago. He had fought a hard and pragmatic campaign against the president's disdain for Washington's Nato allies. Indeed, despite the rhetoric coming from the White House, US deployments of troops and equipment to Europe have increased significantly on Mr Trump's watch. Mr Trump's Syria withdrawal, of course, leaves Washington's Kurdish allies in a predicament - potentially caught between three fires: that of the Turks who are threatening a further encroachment into northern Syria; the remnants of IS; and the Bashar al-Assad government which also has scores to settle. Many US experts see in Mr Trump's actions a betrayal which will long resonate in the region and beyond. But it is the strategy question that is fundamental. The world is certainly changing. China, a major new power, is rising. Russia, a resurgent player, seeks to return to the world stage and has chosen the Middle East as the first region in which it seeks to flex its muscles. From their rise, other less powerful countries are taking an example, arguing that a market economy can co-exist with an authoritarian form of government. In many cases, this is bolstered by a rising tide of populism. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? And this extends into the West, afflicting once settled Scandinavia, countries on the main European landmass, and across the Atlantic to the US itself. The linkage of market economics and liberal democracy that seemed to triumph at the end of the Cold War is now on the back foot, having to defend itself from a variety of challenges. America's allies are looking to Washington more than ever for a far-sighted strategy that can help all of them to resist these new challenges. But no coherent strategy is offered. The president tweets, ignores the expert voices in his own administration - and policy changes. But what is to be left behind in Syria, Afghanistan or anywhere else where President Trump's fleeting gaze lands? Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever Who are the Taliban? Let's be clear. The arguments for a continued US presence in Syria or indeed even ultimately in Afghanistan are complex, difficult and by no means always convincing. President Trump's predecessors made many errors along the way. These were situations that went badly wrong. But a precipitous withdrawal may only make matters worse. To the dismay of its friends and allies, the US seems to have no grand strategy for the Middle East. The current balance of power means that it has fewer levers to pull and certainly cannot enforce any settlement in Syria on its own. But Mr Trump appears to be washing his hands and handing the whole job over to Russia, Turkey and Iran. This absence of a strategic approach is reflected in so many other areas too. On climate change and arms control, Mr Trump is at variance with Washington's closest friends. He is ambivalent towards Russia, and his efforts to engage the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un amount to little more than mutual flattery and studied obfuscation of the real issues. After Mr Trump's first year in office, I went to Washington to make a programme looking at what had changed in defence and wider security policy over the past 12 months. Surprisingly, the answer then was very little. Block out the ""noise"" - the tweets and pronouncements from the White House press room - and it was the Pentagon that seemed to be steering a familiar course. Now though, things have undoubtedly changed. That helmsman - Jim Mattis - is departing. President Trump seems to be charting his own erratic course through an ocean of reefs, rocks and monsters without any strategic map to guide him.

Japan and the whale,"This video can not be played Is Japan losing the taste for whale meat? Hunting whales is irrelevant to feeding Japan's population, draws global condemnation and is certainly not economic.  So why does Japan still do it? The answer from the Japanese government is that whaling is an ancient part of Japanese culture, that fishermen have caught whales for centuries, and that Japan will never allow foreigners to tell its people what they can and cannot eat. One Japanese official once said to me: ""Japanese people never eat rabbits, but we don't tell British people that they shouldn't"".  I pointed out that rabbits are not exactly an endangered species. Wada is one of five ports allowed to whale under Japan's coastal whaling program There is a long history to anti-whaling protests Still, there is some merit to the government's argument. A number of coastal communities in Japan have indeed hunted whales for centuries, and continue to do so. Taiji in Wakayama prefecture is well known, many would say infamous, for its annual dolphin hunts. There are other places, in Chiba Prefecture and in Ishinomaki in northern Japan, that also do coastal whaling. Food festivals have been organised to get the public to eat more whale - even in curry So, yes, coastal whaling is part of Japanese culture,like Norway and Icelandand the Inuit of northern Canada. But only Japan continues to sail a fleet of ships half way across the globe to hunt whales in the Antarctic and maintains a large factory ship that can process hundreds of whales at sea. Nothing about these Antarctic whaling expeditions is historic. Japan's first whaling voyage to the Antarctic took place in the mid-1930s but the really huge hunts didn't get going until after World War Two. Japan lay in ruins, its population starving. With the encouragement of General Douglas MacArthur, Japan converted two huge US Navy tankers into factory ships and set sail for the Southern Ocean. Japan still runs an approved coastal whaling programme From the late 1940s to the mid-1960s whale meat was the single biggest source of meat in Japan. At its peak in 1964 Japan killed more than 24,000 whales in one year, most of them enormous fin whales and sperm whales. Today Japan can afford to import meat from Australia and America. There is no deep-sea commercial whaling in Japan. The fleet that is now hunting in Antarctic waters is paid for by Japanese taxpayers to carry out what the Japanese government describes as ""scientific research"". Japan's other justification is that it needs to kill hundreds of whales each year to study them. But the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has systematically dismantled that argument. In 2014 it ruled that there was no scientific case for Japan's  programme of ""lethal research"" in the Southern Ocean, and ordered Tokyo to stop. For a year Japan stopped. But last year it sent its fleet to sea again insisting, to widespread disbelief, that its new, smaller, Antarctic whaling programme satisfies the ICJ's requirements. Coastal whaling involves much smaller ships, and catches Junko Sakuma used to work for Greenpeace in Japan. For the last 10  years she has been researching Japan's whaling industry. ""There is no benefit to Japan from whaling...but nobody knows how to quit,"" she tells me at Tokyo's famously chaotic Tsukiji fish market, the biggest in the world renowned for its pre-dawn tuna auctions. Of the thousands of fish wholesalers in Tsukiji only two still deal in whale meat. At one stand we find a few large hunks of minke whale meat, deep red and oozing blood. At the next there are two long slabs of lighter-coloured fin whale meat, an endangered species, its trading banned by CITES. Business is bad, complains the stall owner. Last year Japan caught no whales in the Antarctic, so there is less minke whale meat available, he says. If there is a whale meat shortage, the price should be soaring. But according to Junko it is not. ""The fact is, most Japanese people do not eat whale meat,"" she says. ""Consumption has been falling for years,"" and adds that ""even as the amount of whale meat decreases, the price doesn't go up"". According to Junko's research, the average consumption of whale meat by Japanese people in 2015 was just 30g (one ounce) per person. Once a staple, now a novelty Iceland also whales, but sends some of the meat to Japan If eating whale is such an integral part of Japanese culture, why are so few eating it? I turn to my old friend Etsuo Kato. Over the 20 years we have known each other he has, on occasion, tried to persuade me to eat whale meat with him. Kato-San grew up in Kita-Kyushu in western Japan, close to the big whaling port at Shimonoseki. We are sitting in a cosy restaurant in Tokyo's notorious red light district, Kabukicho. Above us hangs a very large, and rather ancient, mummified whale penis. On the wall are picture of whales. The first plate to arrive is whale sashimi - it is raw. The owner points to the different delicacies; steak, heart, tongue and even raw whale skin. My stomach turns, but I steel myself. Gingerly, I put a bit of raw whale steak into my mouth. It has a strong gamey flavour, chewy and fibrous. Next, I try the tongue. It is salty and fishy. Kato-San points to the heart. I politely decline. ""When I was a child I ate this every day,"" he says. ""Meat meant whale meat. I didn't know what beef was, or pork. Steak was whale steak, bacon meant whale bacon."" But if Japan stopped whale hunting you would be sad? He looks at me smiling and gently shaking his head. ""I don't need whale hunting"" he says. ""Once you have eaten beef there is no need to eat whale meat."" The other customers in the restaurant are all middle-aged salary men. Eating a bit of whale meat is nostalgic, remembering school meals 50 years ago. Japan's only whaling factory ship is ageing and some analysts suggest the country may be reluctant to fund a replacement Confrontations on the high seas are used by both sides to drum up support So I come back again to my original question: why does Japan still do it? Recently I was at a private briefing with a high-ranking member of the Japanese government. Japan had just announced it was going to resuming whaling. I outlined to him why I thought it made no sense, and asked him to respond. His answer was astonishingly frank. ""I agree with you,"" he said. ""Antarctic whaling is not part of Japanese culture. It is terrible for our international image and there is no commercial demand for the meat. I think in another 10 years there will be no deep sea whaling in Japan."" ""So why not stop now?"" asked another journalist. ""There are some important political reasons why it is difficult to stop now."" he said. He would say no more. But Junko Sakuma thinks the answer lies in the fact that Japan's whaling is government-run, a large bureaucracy with research budgets, annual plans, promotions and pensions. ""If the number of staff in a bureaucrat's office decreases while they are in charge, they feel tremendous shame,"" she says. ""Which means most of the bureaucrats will fight to keep the whaling section in their ministry at all costs. And that is true with the politicians as well. If the issue is closely related to their constituency, they will promise to bring back commercial whaling. It is a way of keeping their seats."" It may seem incredibly banal. But Japan's determination to continue whaling may come down to a handful of MPs from whaling constituencies and a few hundred bureaucrats who don't want to see their budgets cut.

Could the ban on killing whales end?,"Whales are known to be intelligent and sociable animals Few conservation issues generate as emotional a response as whaling. Are we now about to see countries killing whales for profit again? Commercial whaling has been effectively banned for more than 30 years, after some whales were driven almost to extinction. But the International Whaling Committee (IWC) is currently meeting in Brazil and next week will give its verdict on a proposal from Japan to end the ban. Yes, they do - but it's complicated. IWC members agreed to a moratorium on hunting in 1986, to allow whale stocks to recover. Pro-whaling nations expected the moratorium to be temporary, until consensus could be reached on sustainable catch quotas. Japan used a clause allowing scientific whaling to continue its hunt Instead, it became a quasi-permanent ban, to the delight of conservationists but the dismay of whaling nations like Japan, Norway and Iceland who argue that whaling is part of their culture and should continue in a sustainable way. Japan and the whale Why Japan keeps on whaling But by usingan exception in the ban that allows for whaling for scientific purposes,external, Japan has caughtbetween about 200 and 1,200 whales every year.,externalsince,including young and pregnant animals. Among other things, it says it's investigating stock levels and to see whether the whales are endangered or not. Critics say this is just a cover so they can kill whales for food. And in fact, the meat from the whales killed for research usually does end up for sale. Hideki Moronuki, Japan's senior fisheries negotiator and commissioner for the IWC, told the BBC that Japan wants the IWC to get back to its original purpose - both conserving whales but also ""the sustainable use of whales"". Whaling in the 19th and early 20th Century brought the giant mammals to the brink of extinction. By the 1960s improved catch methods and giant factory ships made it obvious that whale hunting could not go unchecked. Hence the moratorium. Japan kills 300 to 400 whales each year Today, whale stocks are carefully monitored, and while most species are still endangered, others - like the minke whale which Japan primarily hunts - are not. So Japan, the current chair of the IWC, is suggesting a package of measures, including setting up a Sustainable Whaling Committee and setting sustainable catch limits ""for abundant whale stocks/species"". As an incentive to anti-whaling nations, the proposals would also make it easier to establish new whale sanctuaries. Not everyone thinks so. Anti whaling activists are of course up in arms about the proposal. Many whales are endangered, minke whales however are not ""These graceful giants face so many threats in our degraded oceans such as entanglement, plastic and noise pollution, and climate change, the last thing they need is to be put back in the whalers' crosshairs,"" says Kitty Block, president of Humane Society International. Rare blue whale washed ashore in Japan Rare hybrid blue whale killed in Iceland Killer whale carries dead baby for 16 days There's also the argument that whales are very intelligent animals with highly developed social structures. Killing them causes them fear, panic and pain. The old way of whaling with a plain harpoon meant a slow and agonising death. Modern hunters though aim to kill the animal instantly, usually with an exploding harpoon, but conservations argue it can still take very long for a whale to die. Traditional whaling often resulted in a drawn-out death for the animal Two years agothe Australian government released graphic footage from 2008 showing a Japanese research ship harpooning a whalewhich activist group Sea Shepherd said took more than 20 minutes to die. ""And that's not to mention that they are killing them with their family members, with their pods having to witness their family members screaming out in pain,"" says Jeff Hansen, managing director of Sea Shepherd in Australia. Those in favour of whaling say such cases are exceptions - accidents that also happen in any abattoir. Yet their main point is that they argue that opposition to sustainable whaling of non-endangered stocks is deeply hypocritical. Sustainable whaling is no less moral that commercial farming, say pro-whaling groups Industrial meat production keeps pigs, cows and chicken in grim captivity from birth to slaughterhouse, but this seldom stops shoppers from reaching for a nice cut of pork or beef. There is also the hunter's defence that killing a wild animal is more ethical than raising an animal in captivity with the sole purpose of eating it. Lars Walloe, former head of Norway's delegation to the IWC, told the BBC whaling is the same as killing ""other large mammals in the forest, like deer, elk, moose"". ""We kill them for meat and we don't see the difference between killing a minke whale and a moose as long as it's done humanely."" Leading anti-whaling nations like Australia have already said they would band together to reject any attempts to undermine the current ban. Australia has long been Japan's major opponent when it comes to whaling and wants to strengthen the IWC's protection of whales. It would face fierce opposition at home if it changed its mind. Canberra took the issue to the International Court of Justice, which in 2014 ruled against Japan, saying it was not necessary to kill whales in order to study them. Scientific whaling is widely seen as a poor disguise But that was in reference to one specific scientific programme - so Japan simply changed said programme and resumed whaling. Japanese officials, however, have told the BBC they hope the new proposal will be considered and adopted. ""This issue should be resolved based on science and international law, but not with emotion,"" urges Hideki Moronuki. Donald R Rothwell, professor of international law at Australia National University, told the BBC an end to the moratorium might not ultimately have much impact. ""If Japan would offer to end its scientific programme, a future commercial whaling quota would likely see very little change in the actual number of whales killed,"" he said. The people of the whale Were Romans the first whale hunters? Under the scientific programme, Japan takes around 300 to 400 animals each year and a commercial quota could limit them to a similar number. Currently, some of the whales are hunted in a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic. Japan argues the sanctuary is to protect against commercial whaling but that scientific whaling does not break any rules. Whales caught by Japan for research do often end up on the plate If in future, Japan was to whale under an IWC quota for commercial purpose, it would be bound by the sanctuary rules. And if Japan were simply to leave the IWC, it would still be bound by international laws that bind countries to ""co-operate on whale conservation"". But ultimately, there's a good chance the contentious issue will gradually die down by itself. Japanese demand for whale meat has long been on the decline. The industry already survives on state subsidies so eventually, changing tastes might mean commercial whaling is undone by plain commercial arithmetic.

'Meghan's bump' caught by amateur snapper,"The pregnant Duchess of Sussex puts a hand on her bump while greeting crowds at Sandringham on Christmas Day An amateur photographer who caught smiling Royals leaving church on Christmas Day 2017 has struck again - with a snap of the Duchess of Sussex. Karen Anvil, 40, took the picture of Meghan stroking her bump at Sandringham where last year she captured Princes Harry and William with Kate and Meghan greeting wellwishers. Ms Anvil also got in a quick chat, too. She said she planned to avoid Sandringham next year after being photographed herself. Ms Anvil said she was hoping her latest images of the expectant Duchess would please the thousands of Meghan fans who follow her on social media. Karen Anvil, who spoke to the duchess, took this photo and said it was ""clear she loves being pregnant"" She said it was ""especially lovely"" to have a chat with the duchess ""as one mother to another"". The Duchess of Sussex reached for her bump and said, ""We're nearly there"", when asked by Ms Anvil if she was excited about her baby, which is due in spring. Ms Anvil said: ""She loves that child. Her bump holding was pure instinct, natural and not staged at all."" Ms Anvil's shot of the Royals leaving church on Christmas Day 2017 led to her taking on an agent after the photo was sold to the media in almost 50 countries around the world.

Woman's attacker revealed as child killer,"Lorraine Holt was murdered in 1979 and her father Jim Holt (right) has only one colour photograph of her A man who nearly decapitated a dementia sufferer in a row over garden tools is a child killer who was released from prison in 2017, the BBC can reveal. Stephen Chafer was 17 when he sexually assaulted and stabbed to death three-year-old Lorraine Holt in Derby. He was released in 2002, returned to prison in 2013 for arson - but then released again on licence in 2017. Now known as Stephen Leonard, the 57-year-old was convicted this month of trying to kill a woman in Peterborough. The fact Stephen Leonard and Stephen Chafer are the same man has not previously been reported. But Lorraine's father Jim Holt, who was friends with Chafer, said the decision to release him had ""destroyed a family"". ""Because all of this has happened it's brought all of [Lorraine's death] back, not just to me, but to the whole of my family,"" he told BBC News. ""Somebody said to me the other day 'he's an animal'. And I said 'don't disrespect animals'."" Stephen Leonard will be sentenced for attempted murder on 4 January Jim Holt has kept newspaper cuttings of his daughter's case down the years Lorraine was out playing in the snow in the back garden of her family home in Sinfin Lane, Derby, on 20 January 1979 - but wandered off. Chafer, who was related to her through marriage, had been out drinking during the afternoon and came across her sitting in the snow crying while he was walking to their house. The then teenager gave Lorraine some sweets and carried her to the grounds of the local vicarage, where he put his hand over her mouth and sexually assaulted her before stabbing her 39 times. He later pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed, before being released 23 years later in 2002. Jim Holt has a copy of Derbyshire Police's appeal for witnesses at the time of his daughter's murder More than 10 years later Chafer - by now known as Leonard - removed the fire alarms at his flat, part of a block of nine in Peterborough, and set it alight. He admitted arson with being reckless whether life would be endangered and was sentenced to 26 months in prison, but was released on licence on 9 August 2017. Then on 23 June 2018 he went to the home of Faye Mills, a 60-year-old woman with dementia whom he had known for about 15 years, in Peterborough. It was there that an argument over a garden rake ""caused a flick of the switch in his head"", prosecutor Charles Falk told Cambridge Crown Court. He hit her over the head with the tool before grabbing a knife and stabbing her in a ""frenzied"" attack. Mr Falk said: ""He inflicted multiple stab wounds all over her body and almost decapitated her and then tried to stab her neighbour who intervened, after hearing her screams."" The mystery of the milk carton kids Builder found Â£76m lottery ticket in van Railings crash leave police speechless The extent of her injuries, which included a ""slash"" across the neck, made it ""almost inexplicable"" she lived and when police officers arrived they thought she was dead, Cambridge Crown Court heard. The attack, Mr Falk said, left Ms Mills with ""life-changing injuries from which she will never fully recover"". A jury found him guilty of attempted murder and he will be sentenced on 4 January for that offence. Speaking to the BBC after learning of the new conviction, his first victim's father Mr Holt said he hoped authorities would ""lock him up and keep him locked up because if he comes out again he'll destroy another family"". ""He won't go away because he gets a buzz off it, that's my personal opinion,"" he said. Lorraine Holt's grandmother wrote to the Parole Board to plead with them to keep Chafer in jail Back in 2000, Mr Holt submitted a petition to then Home Secretary Jack Straw to extend Chafer's time in jail. He spent an extra two years incarcerated. Mr Holt, who now lives in Nottingham, said: ""I knew he was out and knew at the back of my mind he would re-offend. ""Then I hear from the police and he's back inside for arson and I'm like 'so you've had him twice and you've let him go?'. ""And now this has happened to the Mills family."" Asked what he would say to the Parole Board who agreed his release, Mr Holt said: ""I'd ask them why did you let him out - on what excuse, when you'd been warned?"" A Parole Board spokesman said it was rare for released offenders to go on to commit serious further offences. ""Whilst this represents an extremely small proportion of cases considered, we do take each case extremely seriously and work with others in the criminal justice system to ensure that lessons are learned to help to prevent further tragedies,"" he added.

Afghan election delayed by three months,"Final results from October's parliamentary elections have not yet been declared Next year's presidential election in Afghanistan has been postponed by three months, election authority sources say. It was initially due in April. A new date in mid-July or early August is to be announced on Thursday. Many potential candidates had been unable to meet registration requirements and extreme weather meant their teams could not organise for a spring date, the sources told the BBC. It comes days after reports thatthe US was to withdraw thousands of troops. About 7,000 troops - roughly half the remaining US military presence in the country - could go home within months, the US media reports said. On Monday43 people died in a suicide and gun attack on the Afghan ministry of public worksin Kabul, officials said. Meanwhile Iran has held talks with the Afghan Taliban, a senior Iranian security official said. Trump's withdrawal 'ignores dangerous threat' Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever The decision to postpone the presidential vote also comes after a series of problems affected parliamentary elections in October, which was disrupted by the Taliban and Islamic State group. Violence affected campaigning and the polls themselves, with 10 candidates killed and deadly blasts at polling stations, nearly a third of which were closed because of security concerns. There were widespread problems with biometric identification devices used in October The vote in Ghazni province has not yet taken place because of insecurity and will now happen at the same time as the presidential election. Voting in Kandahar province was delayed for a week after its police chief there was assassinated. There were also problems with a biometric verification system as well as delays at many polling stations because staff arrived late. Final results from other major provinces such as Kabul, Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif have not yet been declared. The new parliament is due to begin sitting in March. Taliban threaten 70% of Afghanistan, BBC finds Who are the Taliban? Past elections in the country have also been marred by corruption, fraud, and voter intimidation. The previous presidential election - which saw Ashraf Ghani take power - was only resolved after a power-sharing agreement was negotiated by the US with Mr Ghani's main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, who was given the position of chief executive.

TV art historian Wendy Beckett dies,"TV art historian and nun Sister Wendy Beckett has died at the age of 88, it has been announced. In the 1990s she became one of the most unlikely television stars. Emerging from her hermit-like existence in a caravan at a Carmelite monastery in Norfolk, she hosted unscripted BBC shows from galleries across the world. Born in South Africa, Sister Wendy moved as a child to Edinburgh, where her father studied medicine, joining a convent when she was 16. This video can not be played Sister Wendy speaking about the true meaning of Christmas and iconography (video originally published in 2010) She died at 14:30 GMT at the Carmelite monastery in Quidenham. BBC director of arts Jonty Claypole paid tribute, saying Sister Wendy had ""a unique presentation style, a deep knowledge of and passion for the arts"". He added: ""She was a hugely popular BBC presenter and will be fondly remembered by us all."" In 1950 Sister Wendy's order sent her to Oxford University, where she lodged in a convent, and was awarded a Congratulatory First Class degree in English literature. She returned to South Africa in 1954 to teach, but in 1970, with her health deteriorating, the Vatican gave permission for her to pursue a life of solitude and prayer. After obtaining permission to study art in the 1980s - largely through books and postcard reproductions of the great works obtained from galleries - Sister Wendy decided to write a book to earn money for her convent. Contemporary Women Artists, published in 1988, was followed by more books and articles. In 1991 the BBC commissioned her to present a television documentary on the National Gallery in London. Dressed in black nun's habit, Sister Wendy stood in front of paintings, and without script or autocue discussed them to the camera. Her programmes included Odyssey, Sister Wendy's Grand Tour and Sister Wendy's Story of Painting. The Grand Tour took Sister Wendy to cities including Paris, Madrid and Florence in 1996 Sister Wendy's Odyssey showed the unlikely TV star at her caravan in Norfolk in 1992 Sister Wendy on her Christmas icons.

'I won't ignore race of grooming gangs' - Javid,"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has defended highlighting the ethnicity of some grooming gangs. The home secretary faced criticism for a tweet earlier this year referring to ""sick Asian paedophiles"". But speaking on BBC Radio 4 Today, Mr Javid - who has Pakistani heritage - said that ignoring the ethnicity of abusers gives ""oxygen"" to extremists. He said he wanted officials researching the causes of gang-based exploitation to leave ""no stone unturned"". Asked by the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie, who was guest-editing the Today programme, whether he was concerned that his comments may have fuelled hate crimes, he said he was ""very much aware of the need for politicians to be careful with their language"". But he said: ""When it comes to gang-based child exploitation it is self-evident to anyone who cares to look that if you look at all the recent high-profile cases there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage.""

Boxing Day sales 'attracting fewer shoppers',"The number of people heading to the Boxing Day sales has fallen for the third year running despite some heavy discounting, retail analysts have said. Springboard, which examines information from UK High Street and shopping centre cameras, said average footfall for the day was 3.1% lower than in 2017. It suggested 26 December was becoming less important as a trading day. But there were still queues for some shops from as early as midnight and the data does not include online sales. 'Super Saturday' fails to boost retailers Bad weather hits Christmas retailing Has it been the worst November for retailers? And retailers in London's West End declared a ""Boxing Day bounce"" saying there had been a 15% increase in footfall from last year. Shoppers on London's Oxford Street told BBC News they braved the crowds to pick up a bargain and browse products in person rather than just buying them online. Some stores were offering discounts of as much as 70% after slow sales up to Christmas. Springboard said in recent years Boxing Day had consistently seen fewer shoppers than theBlack Fridaysales at the end of November. The number of shoppers in the morning was said to be more than 9% lower than Black Friday. However, footfall does not include online sales, which made up 21% of retail sales in November, according to the Office for National Statistics. Bargain-hunters raced into Selfridges in London as the doors were opened By Joe Miller, BBC business correspondent Black Friday has been taking the wind out of Boxing Day sales for a few years now, and retailers have been forced to slash prices even further during the festive period. While this is good news for shoppers, analysts are concerned that struggling chains, with warehouses full of stock to shift, are now engaged in a race to the bottom, just when they need to be increasing profits. What's worse is that there is no sign of a spending splurge on the horizon. Even online giants such as Asos have had a hard time of it lately, as household debt is growing, and people have less disposable income altogether. One place that seems to be bucking the trend - at least today - is the West End in London. That's driven, at least in part, by lots of visitors from overseas, hoping to take advantage of the weak pound. But across the country as a whole there are only a few days left to make up for a miserable year. Some shops opened at 06:00 GMT, with queues of the keenest bargain-hunters having formed at 02:00. Retailers in London's West End expect to see 500,000 shoppers over the day and Â£50m in sales. Shoppers queued up in Princes Street, Edinburgh Jace Tyrrell, chief executive at New West End Company, representing businesses in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street, said: ""International tourists are out in force driven by the weaker pound, as well as domestic shoppers who are looking for a day out after family celebrations yesterday,"" he said. Myf Ryan, chief marketing officer for Europe at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which owns the Westfield shopping centres, said: ""Boxing Day is always one of our peak trading days and has got off to a very busy start."" Early morning queues in Cardiff stretched down Queen Street Customers hunted for the best bargains in Next, Edinburgh The so-called ""Super Saturday"" before Christmas had failed to deliver the boost that retailers hoped for, with just a 1% increase in footfall. Retail analysts had been predicting bigger than usual Boxing Day discounts as shops tried to entice consumers back to the High Street. Management consultancy Deloitte said it expected average discounts of 52% from retailers seeking to offload unwanted stock. Many stores had already begun discounting before Christmas, with the rise of Black Friday stretching the sales into November. Online retailer Asos blamed ""unprecedented"" discounting for damaging November trading, which it said would lead to weak profit for the full year. Stuart McClure, of price and discount tracking website LovetheSales.com, said that online, some retailers had kept discounts running from Black Friday right up until Christmas and increasing numbers were starting their Boxing Day sales early. ""The reductions have also been deeper. Right now the average discount online stands at 43% - this is the highest it's ever been on Boxing Day,"" he said. Some bargain-hunters queued overnight outside Selfridges in central London Brands including Primark, Ted Baker and John Lewis also warned of a slump in sales, while Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct and House of Fraser, said it was the ""worst November in living memory"". Increased shopping online is thought to be one culprit: November in-store sales fell 2.6% compared with last year, while online sales rose by 18.2%, according to research by accountants and business advisers BDO. But last-minute Christmas sales showed some signs of improvement. Ipsos Retail Performance said visits to non-food stores were up by 27.4% on Christmas Eve compared with 2017. Stuart Rose, the former M&S boss who now chairs online supermarket Ocado, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the ""pace of change"" in UK retailing in the last year had been extraordinary. He said local authorities, governments, landlords and retailers had to work together to make British high streets a ""more exciting and interesting place"".

Hunt orders persecuted Christians review,"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (centre, front row) are joined by some survivors of Christian persecution Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review into the plight of persecuted Christians around the world and how much help they get from the UK. The review, led by the Bishop of Truro, will look at government efforts to help some of the 215 million Christians who faced discrimination and violence last year, according to the Foreign Office. Officials say violence against Christians is rising dramatically, with an average of 250 killed every month. Mr Hunt said the UK ""must do more"". ""Britain has long championed international religious freedom,"" he said. ""So often, the persecution of Christians is a telling early warning sign of the persecution of every minority."" The Foreign Office said the review would ""consider some tough questions and offer ambitious policy recommendations"". The Bishop of Truro - the Rt Reverend Philip Mounstephen - is expected to report back by Easter. The review will have three aims: To map the persecution of Christians in ""key countries"" in the Middle East, Africa and Asia To provide an analysis of current UK government support To offer recommendations for a ""cohesive and comprehensive policy response"" Asia Bibi's husband pleaded for asylum from the UK, US or Canada The intervention comes after an outcry over the treatment of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who faced death threats after being acquitted of blasphemy in Pakistan. Ms Bibi spent eight years on death row until her conviction was reversed by Pakistan's Supreme Court earlier this year. Large crowds took to the streets to protest against the court's decision, as her husband pleaded for asylum from the UK, US or Canada, saying the family were in danger. UK Prime Minister Theresa May defended herself in Parliament after being asked whether she had intervened to stop the UK government offering asylum. Mrs May told Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith he ""shouldn't necessarily believe everything he reads in the papers"", adding ""the absolute prime concern"" was the ""safety and security"" of Asia Bibi and her family. Christians have also been targeted in other parts of the world.In China there has been a recent surge of police actionagainst churches, raising concern that the government is getting tougher on unsanctioned Christian activity. AndCoptic Christians in Egypt have faced a series of attacksby extremists including the Islamic State (IS) group. May questioned over Asia Bibi asylum case Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted?

'Virtual tumour' new way to see cancerScientists in Cambridge have built a 3D model of cancer to help in the search for new treatments.Health,"An avatar of a scientist exploring a 3D tumour in a virtual reality laboratory Scientists in Cambridge have built a virtual reality (VR) 3D model of cancer, providing a new way to look at the disease. The tumour sample, taken from a patient, can be studied in detail and from all angles, with each individual cell mapped. Researchers say it will increase our understanding of cancer and help in the search for new treatments. The project is part of an international research scheme. Researchers start with a 1mm cubed piece of breast cancer tissue biopsy, containing around 100,000 cells Wafer thin slices are cut, scanned and then stained with markers to show their molecular make-up and DNA characteristics The tumour is rebuilt using virtual reality The 3D tumour can be analysed within a virtual reality laboratory The VR system allows multiple users from anywhere in the world to examine the tumour. Prof Greg Hannon, director ofCancer Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK),,externaltold the BBC:  ""No-one has examined the geography of a tumour in this level of detail before; it is a new way of looking at cancer."" The 'virtual tumour' project is part of CRUK'sGrand Challenge Awards,external. Within a 'virtual' laboratory, Prof Hannon and I became avatars, whilst the cancer was represented by a multi-coloured mass of bubbles. Although the human tissue sample was about the size of a pinhead, within the virtual laboratory it could be magnified to appear several metres across. To explore the tumour in more detail, the VR system allowed us to 'fly through' the cells. The virtual tumour we were looking at through our headsets was taken from the lining of the breast milk ducts. A group of cells, circled, have broken away from the main tumour mass As Prof Hannon rotated the model, he pointed to a group of cells that were flying off from the main group: ""Here you can see some tumour cells which have escaped from the duct. ""This may be the point at which the cancer spread to surrounding tissue - and became really dangerous - examining the tumour in 3D allows us to capture this moment."" Prof Karen Vousden, CRUK's chief scientist, runs a lab at the Francis Crick Institute in London which examines how specific genes help protect us from cancer, and what happens when they go wrong.

'Meghan's bump' caught by amateur snapperA mum whose photo of the Royals went viral last Christmas does it again with a snap of Meghan.Norfolk,"The pregnant Duchess of Sussex puts a hand on her bump while greeting crowds at Sandringham on Christmas Day An amateur photographer who caught smiling Royals leaving church on Christmas Day 2017 has struck again - with a snap of the Duchess of Sussex. Karen Anvil, 40, took the picture of Meghan stroking her bump at Sandringham where last year she captured Princes Harry and William with Kate and Meghan greeting wellwishers. Ms Anvil also got in a quick chat, too. She said she planned to avoid Sandringham next year after being photographed herself. Ms Anvil said she was hoping her latest images of the expectant Duchess would please the thousands of Meghan fans who follow her on social media. Karen Anvil, who spoke to the duchess, took this photo and said it was ""clear she loves being pregnant"" She said it was ""especially lovely"" to have a chat with the duchess ""as one mother to another"". The Duchess of Sussex reached for her bump and said, ""We're nearly there"", when asked by Ms Anvil if she was excited about her baby, which is due in spring. Ms Anvil said: ""She loves that child. Her bump holding was pure instinct, natural and not staged at all."" Ms Anvil's shot of the Royals leaving church on Christmas Day 2017 led to her taking on an agent after the photo was sold to the media in almost 50 countries around the world. This snap of the Royals in 2017 picture provided Karen Anvil with a regular monthly income, ranging from Â£600 to Â£6,000 This year she only managed to snap the back of the four Royals alongside Prince Charles, but said she must have an eye for taking pictures as the same shot has been put up on the Kensington Palace website. Ms Anvil is keeping the paparazzi on their toes with her photos of the Royals at Sandringham The photographer, from Watlington, Norfolk, said despite the 2017 pictureearning her almost Â£40,000 so far,she would be avoiding Sandringham next Christmas after the paparazzi turned the cameras on her.

'Trash Girl' defies bullies to go global,"Nadia Sparkes said the ""Trash Girl"" nickname made her feel ""like a superhero"" A 13-year-old who was nicknamed ""Trash Girl"" by bullies for clearing litter from the streets has gained a global following for her work. Nadia Sparkes, from Norfolk, refused to let the taunts deter her from litter-picking on her way to and from school. After her story went viral she became an ambassador for the wildlife charity WWF, and now has more than 4,000 followers on social media. Nadia said she was ""really pleased"" to see her efforts make a difference. Since starting her crusade, the teenager has collected more than 1,100 litres of rubbish - enough to fill about 40 kitchen bins. She leaves an hour early to go to school each day so she can ""clear her route"" using her bicycle basket, doing one side of the road on the way in and the opposite side on the way back. Schoolgirl Nadia Sparkes is depicted as a superhero in a cartoon by Creative Nation Earlier this year, Nadia - who said being called ""Trash Girl"" made her feel like a superhero - was immortalised in cartoon form. The teenager, who loves to draw, is also being given the chance to publish her own on-message cartoon in the Eastern Daily Press newspaper. She even has her own range of merchandise and hopes to use the money to buy refillable water bottles for every pupil at her school. Nadia said she was ""really pleased"" to be able to make a difference with her litter-picking Paula Sparkes said her daughter wanted to ""give people a wake-up call about litter"" but despite her achievements, the name-calling at school had not stopped. ""It's very hard to change the attitude of teenagers,"" she said. ""Nadia always felt alone in her litter-picking and was made to feel different, but then she realised all litter-pickers felt like that. ""She wanted to create a group to bring them all together and she's done that - she has been contacted by people from all over the world. ""We're incredibly proud of her.""

Donald Trump and his wife Melania were taking calls from American children as the couple sat under two gargantuan Christmas trees. All the children who called in had done so in the hope of getting through to Norad,the government agency that tracks Santa's movements around the world at Christmas,external(that still operated despite a partial government shutdown). Some of those calls were patched through to Mr Trump and his wife. And this is how the conversation between Collman and the president unfolded: Trump: What you gonna do for Christmas? Collman: I think we'll probably put out some cookies, and then we're hanging out with our friends. That's pretty much all. Trump: You just have a good time. Collman: Yes, sir. Trump: Are you still a believer in Santa? Collman: Yes, sir. Trump: Cause at seven, it's marginal, right? Collman: Yes, sir. Trump: You just enjoy yourself. President Trump is seen smiling at the end of the conversation. Collman's parents later said they had no issue with the way Mr Trump spoke to their daughter, and said the president's remark was unfairly politicised. ""I think it's crazy it became a big deal.It's Christmas time,"" Collman's father Donald J Lloyd told Buzzfeed.,external ""I'd love to keep politics out of Christmas. It didn't bother me - I like to talk to my kids like adults."" Trump to child: Do you believe in Santa?

Three Channel 'migrants' brought ashore,"French authorities said the group were in a semi-rigid vessel Three migrants spotted in a small boat in the Channel have been brought ashore by the Border Force. The men were about 10 miles (16.5km) off France when French authorities spotted them after midnight. the Prefecture Maritime de la Manche said. Border Force officials brought the group ashore at Dover. Forty migrants, including two children, were rescuedon Christmas Day. The Home Office has blamed organised crime, but Dover's MP has demanded action. Coastguards said they were not involved in the latest incident on Boxing Day. Forty migrants in Christmas Day rescues Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? A Home Office spokesman said: ""Evidence shows there is organised criminal gang activity behind illegal migration attempts by small boats across the Channel. ""We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk."" The Home Office said the three rescued by French teams overnight were transferred to UK authorities and brought to Dover. The group, who presented themselves as Iranian, were medically assessed and passed to immigration officials, the spokesman said. Those rescued on Christmas Day presented themselves as Iraqi, Iranian and Afghan. Dover's Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has said the Home Office and National Crime Agency ""do not appear to be on top of this situation"". He said: ""With well over 100 migrants having broken into Britain in recent weeks they need urgently to explain what they are doing to put a stop to these crossings. ""This is an incredibly dangerous crossing to make in the middle of winter. ""Our volunteer lifeboat crews are being called out nearly every day - even during Christmas. ""The British and French authorities must get a grip and find and stop the traffickers behind these crossings before there is a tragedy in the English Channel."" A statement from the French authorities also warned migrants planning to cross the the Dover-Calais strait - the world's busiest shipping lane - they were endangering lives. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Labour pledges tougher anti-hunting laws,"Labour is promising to toughen up the ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales, saying it will consult on jailing those caught breaking the law. Ahead of the Boxing Day hunts, shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said jail terms would put penalties on a par with those for other wildlife crimes. An unlimited fine is currently the most severe punishment available. The pro-hunting Countryside Alliance says Labour's ""obsessive pursuit of hunting... looks increasingly bizarre"". Some 250 packs are expected to meet for traditional Boxing Day hunts, with up to 250,000 people taking part or watching. Did fox hunting disappear? Alpacas 'viciously attacked' by hunt dogs Call for fox hunt law change after ruling Since fox hunting was outlawed in 2004, pursuit of live animals has been replaced by trail hunting, which sees hounds and riders follow a pre-laid scent such as fox urine. Activists have claimed these events can effectively allow banned practices to continue, if trails are laid near where foxes are likely to be. Ms Hayman said: ""Labour's 2004 Hunting Act was a key milestone in banning this cruel blood sport, but since then new practices have developed to exploit loopholes in the legislation."" In order for a prosecution to succeed, a person must be shown to be intentionally hunting an animal. Labour is considering a ""recklessness"" clause to stop trail hunts being used to disguise illegal hunting. Hunting continues legally, with hounds encouraged to follow a scent Separately, in Scotland, which outlawed hunting animals in 2002, Green MSP Alison Johnstone announced plans for a consultation on strengthening the nation's ban on fox hunting. ""The so-called ban has failed and urgent action is needed to close the loopholes that allow foxes to be chased and even killed by hunts,"" she said. Up until 2017, more than 460 individuals had been found guilty of breaking the law in England and Wales. However, earlier this month,Cheshire's police commissioner urged the government to change the law. David Keane said a review had found ""current legislation in the way it is drafted presents challenges to investigators and prosecutors"". He had ordered the inquiry after MPs raised concerns. In January, Chester MPChris Matheson (Labour) told the Commons ""at least four foxes""had been ""killed by trail hunts"" in the four weeks after Boxing Day last year. A hunt organiser had described the kills as ""accidental"". Hunt supporters have consistently argued that the ban has done nothing to protect foxes, which they say are now shot by farmers to control the population. The Countryside Alliance has called on supporters to lobby politicians to support hunts in the face of ""misinformation"" from animal rights groups. Chief executive Tim Bonner said: ""The Labour Party continues to focus on a narrow animal rights agenda, rather than issues that really matter to rural people. ""Labour's obsessive pursuit of hunting... looks increasingly bizarre to people in the countryside, as well as to those in towns and cities."" Prime Minister Theresa May has in the past declared her support for fox hunting. However,in January, she dropped a manifesto pledgeto hold a vote on repealing the ban, telling the BBC there had been a ""clear message"" against it from the public. Labour's promise came as apoll commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports,externalfound only one in six of 1,072 rural residents questioned believed hunting with dogs reflected countryside values. In the polling, by Survation, only 4% said they ever participated in hunting, compared with 63% who observed wildlife at least once a month and 59% who took part in walking or hiking at least once a month. A government spokesman said the 2004 Hunting Act set out tightly-drawn exemptions under which dogs may be used to hunt wild mammals, ""subject to very strict conditions"". Those found guilty were subject to ""harsh"" penalties, including the possibility of an unlimited fine. ""We are also increasing maximum sentences for those who commit the most heinous acts of animal cruelty tenfold, to five years in jail.""

Syria says Israel strikes hit weapons depot,"Smoke was seen rising over a mountain near Damascus on Tuesday night Russia has branded as ""provocative"" an alleged Israeli air strike on Syria late on Tuesday. Reports from Syria said an arms depot in Qatifah, about 40km (25 miles) north-east of Damascus, was hit, injuring three soldiers. Israel has not commented, but after the reported strikes it said it had fired at a Syrian anti-aircraft missile. It did not report any damage or injuries. Israel has carried out dozens of strikes on Syria in recent years. It says it is acting to thwart advanced weapons transfers from Iran to the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement and the strengthening of Iran's military presence in Syria. Israel considers Iran and Hezbollah to pose a particularly dangerous threat. The foreign ministry of Russia, a key Syrian ally, said it was ""very concerned"" by the alleged Israeli air strikes. ""The provocative actions of the Israeli air force... directly threatened two airliners,"" it said. The statement said the unidentified airliners ""not from Russia, were preparing to land at the airports of Beirut and Damascus"". The Syrian military said the attacks were carried out from within Lebanese air space. Syrian state news agency, Sana, said most of the missiles were intercepted. Video footage posted on social media shows an object moving over Damascus. Then the sound of a loud explosion is heard, followed by a burst of artillery shelling. Newsweek magazine quoted an unnamed US defence department source as sayingseveral Hezbollah leaders had just boarded a flight to Iran and were injured in the strikes,external. Why is there a war in Syria? The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later tweeted that its air defence systems had been ""activated in response to an anti-aircraft missile launched from Syria"".

'Thanks for your loved one's organ',"This video can not be played Liver transplant beneficiary: 'I have a baby boy thanks to you' Ellie Lacey was just hours from death, desperately needing an urgent liver transplant. Two years on, the 32-year-old from Cardiff is a new mum and has written to her organ donor's family to express her joy at life while acknowledging their terrible loss. It was seven long months after finding out I was pregnant, that I finally mustered the courage to sit down and write. I had been putting it off, not because I didn't want to write, but because I didn't know how. I was so happy about my news, I knew how blessed and fortunate I'd been, but as I began to scratch out the words, an enormous wave of emotion and sadness hit me. Baby Otto was born on 21 December weighing in at weighing 7lb 8oz Regardless, I beganâ¦ To my dear donor's familyâ¦ It has been nearly two years since my liver transplant and I have something to tell youâ¦ But then I stopped, my pen down, my head in my hands. Transplant patient develops cancer from donated kidney Boy, 10, meets his 'superman' life-saver Opt-out organ donation for England by 2020 For as much as I wanted to let them know that their loved one's liver had not only allowed me to live, but had allowed me to bring new life into the world, I also knew hearing from me must be so bittersweet. The brutal truth of the situation was that I was only alive because their loved one had died. Yet how could I not keep thanking them, and letting them know how much they are in my hearts? Ellie Lacey was hours from death in desperate need of a transplant It wasn't the first letter I had written to them. Just after my operation, when I was on a massive high at having cheated death, I wrote, gushing with excitement. I had hoped my joy might be a silver lining to their sadness. I never got a reply and I'm not surprised. I was so insensitive and blind to their loss. I wrote again last Christmas, a very short letter to say I never stopped thinking about them - and now this. Of course, like every young person, I never expected to be in the position where I would need a donor organ in my body. I had been very fit and healthy, newly married and looking forward to life. Living life for me and my organ donor Opt-out donation plan will not increase donors Organ donation: why you may wait longer if you are black I worked in marketing and spent weekends competing around the UK in wild, windy fell races. Then, out of nowhere and for no discernible reason, in January 2017, my liver failed and I needed a transplant. I began to get very ill, turning yellow and ending up in intensive care. Over a matter of days, my body had collapsed. Ellie in hospital, 10 days before her transplant Eventually, I was in and out of consciousness, connected to machines and wires with a team of doctors rushing around me. My family members weren't compatible donors, so I was put at the very top of the worldwide donor list for my blood type O. Doctors told my family that a liver would likely be found for me that night. In the end, it took three days, coming in at the point I had just hours to live. During that time, I had said goodbye to the world. Yes, I wanted to live - to have more time with my loved ones and one day start a family, but I was also at peace. I knew I had loved and been loved, and I knew - after setting up a marathon in Uganda - that I had also made a difference in the world. Ellie organises the Running The Rift marathon in Uganda to raise money for charity Then, amazingly, an organ was found. It came in late at night to a hospital in the Midlands. It was transported down, then I was operated on the following day. When I woke up, although I was incredibly weak, to the point I couldn't walk, I was also euphoric. How many other terminally ill people get a chance to live again? Of course, the euphoria was eventually replaced by a huge low as I came to terms with everything. But as I struggled to get back to normal, there was barely a moment I didn't think about my donor. I was told she was a woman in her sixties who had died from a stroke. And I was told I was allowed to write to her family, via the hospital, if I didn't reveal my full name. Ellie keeping fit during her pregnancy I can't explain how much I wanted to write to thank them. It was down to them that I was able to live. I also wanted to tell them about the pregnancy and how much it meant to me. You see, trying for a baby had not been an easy decision to make. Because of my transplant, I was high risk. Ellie competing in the British Transplant Games in 2017 There was a 10% chance my body might reject the liver. There was also a bigger risk ofpre-eclampsia,external- a condition caused by high blood pressure - and having a premature baby. First and foremost, I did not want to be a burden on the NHS again - or to need a new organ. But I had also vowed to myself, after coming so close to death, that I would livelife to the full, not just for me but for my donor too - so that's what I and my husband Paul, who's 33, decided to do. Following her transplant, Ellie wanted to live life to the full and experience motherhood Thankfully, all went smoothly. And my beautiful boy, Otto Lacey, was born on 21 December 2018, weighing 7lb 8oz (3,5kg) and becoming our best Christmas present ever. He really is perfect in every way. Eventually, I did finish and send my letter to the family, explaining that while nothing will bring their loved one back to them, she has left a lifelong legacy within our family and that she's our hero. Whether they reply or not, I will have to wait and see. Baby Otto James Lacey weighed 7lb 8oz Either way, my boy will now grow up knowing about this lady who saved my life. He will know there are good people in the world who think of others. And he will know what it means to be kind and selfless.

Tories accused over Boxing Day rail,"Labour has accused the Tories of overseeing a ""rail standstill"" on Boxing Day - and pointed out they complained about a lack of trains on the bank holiday while in opposition. Five out of 28 operators are running vastly reduced services on 26 December. Shadow transport minister Andy McDonald said: ""The Tory hypocrisy on this issue is astounding."" The Department for Transport said engineers are working to deliver ""vital investment"" in Britain's railways. Network Rail says it uses the Christmas and new year period to carry out engineering and other improvement work because fewer people use trains. It said its workers will undertake more than 330 projects as part of a Â£148m programme to improve services and facilities. According to the National Rail Enquiries website,external, only Chiltern, ScotRail, Southeastern, Southern and the Stansted Express will be running limited services on 26 December. Mr McDonald said: ""Tory ministers' handling of the Boxing Day rail standstill is making it much harder for families and friends to visit one another this Christmas break. ""In opposition the Tories attacked the Boxing Day rail shutdown, but they've now had more than eight years to do something about it and haven't lifted a finger."" A DfT spokesman said most of the network is open for business in the festive period but some routes will be heavily affected.
