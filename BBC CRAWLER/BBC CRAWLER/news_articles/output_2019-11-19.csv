Tories criticised over 'fact check',"This video can not be played The Tory press office was rebranded as ""factcheckUK"" for Tuesday's live TV debate Social networking site Twitter has said the Conservative Party misled the public when it rebranded one of its Twitter accounts. The @CCHQPress account - the Tory press office - was renamed ""factcheckUK"" for Tuesday's live TV debate involving Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. After the debate, the account reverted to its original branding. Twitter said it would take ""decisive corrective action"" if a similar stunt was attempted again. But the firm does not appear to have taken any action over this particular incident. ""Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action."" The Tories were earlier criticised by genuine fact-checking agency Full Fact, which said in a statement: ""It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate. ""Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service such as FullFact, FactCheck or FactCheckNI."" Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly defended the rebranding. He told BBC Newsnight: ""The Twitter handle of the CCHQ press office remained CCHQPress, so it's clear the nature of the site."" Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit Kuenssberg: First TV debate not a game-changer Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked Who should I vote for? Election policy guide Mr Cleverly added the decision to rebrand the account would have been made by the party's digital team, which he said operated within his remit. He said he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with the party ""calling out when the Labour Party put what they know to be complete fabrications in the public domain"". Reacting to the decision, the Labour Party tweeted: ""The Conservatives' laughable attempt to dupe those watching the #ITVDebate by renaming their twitter account shows you can't trust a word they say."" The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, said the ploy was ""straight out of Donald Trump or Putin's playbook"", adding the Tories were ""deliberately misleading the public"". Twitter is a minority interest. Journalists are over-represented on this platform compared to other social media, creating a profound danger that they misinterpret what happens on Twitter as representative of the wider world. Nevertheless, an important threshold has now been repeatedly breached by Britain's party of government, and Twitter is the site where it happened. It is perhaps arguable that, like thedoctored video of Sir Keir Starmera fortnight ago, the re-branding of CCHQ as a fact-checking service falls into the broad category known as satire. But that is a stretch. The effect will have been to dupe many unknowing members of the public, who genuinely thought it was a fact-checking service when it gave opinions on Jeremy Corbyn. This is not to patronise voters, who are wise; rather, it is to recognise that in a world of information overload, what cuts through are stunts. Which is why, ironically, in CCHQ this morning there will be younger staff who chalk this up as a victory. Journalists thus face a dilemma: call out disinformation, and you play to the worst of social media, distracting from questions of policy; but ignore it, and the truth recedes ever further from view. Twitter has policies regarding deceptive behaviour on the platform. The company said it can remove an accountâs âverifiedâ status if the account owner is said to be âintentionally misleading people on Twitter by changing one's display name or bioâ. Other users on the platform subsequently changed their display names to mock the move. Among them, writer Charlie Brooker, who tweeted: âWe have always been at war with Eastasiaâ, a reference to George Orwellâs dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. This latest controversial move on social media comes less than a month after the Conservative Party was criticised for posting a ""doctored"" video involving Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, in which the shadow Brexit secretary was made to look as if he met a question, posed by ITV's Piers Morgan, with silence. Conservative Party chairmanJames Cleverly said the video, since taken down, was meant to be ""light-hearted"". The party later posted an extended version of the interview.

Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed on issues ranging from Brexit to the NHS during the first leaders' debate. The BBC Reality Check team has analysed some of their claims. Reality Check:That's not right - Mr Johnson's deal was supported by 285 Conservative MPs, 19 Labour MPs and 25 independents. All 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) voted against the deal. You can find out how any MP voted using this tool. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive  Those MPs described as ""Did not vote"" may not have done so for a number of reasons. It could be they wished to abstain, or that they had constituency or ministerial business.  The Speaker and his deputies cannot vote and Sinn Fein members traditionally do not vote. Reality Check:Since 2010, police officer numbers have decreased by 20,500 in England and Wales, so the 20,000 new ones would not quite replace them. On hospitals, the government has already announced 20 hospitals it plans to upgrade, but is it building 40 new ones? The government has pledged Â£2.7bn for building work on six hospitals. A further 34 will only share an initial Â£0.1bn to develop future plans - rather than start building immediately. You can read more about the 40 new hospitals inthis Reality Check. Reality Check:The Labour leader made this claim while talking about the state of the health service under the Conservatives. It's a bit of an understatement - there are currently 39,500 nursing vacancies in the NHS in England, according tofigures from NHS Improvement,external. Reality Check:It all depends how you define ""a trade border down the Irish Sea"" but, under his agreement, there would be checks on goods going from Great Britain (GB) to Northern Ireland (NI). Under the deal, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. This will mean checks on, for example, products of animal origin, but the precise details haven't been worked out. Goods entering NI and deemed at risk of being moved to the Republic of Ireland would also be subject to EU customs tariffs (one trade expert has suggestedmore than 60% could be affected). The deal would allow firms to claim the tariff back if the goods didn't end up crossing the border. The Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has also said firms exporting goods from NI to GB will need to fill out ""exit declarations"" but Boris Johnson has denied there would be any checks. What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? Tariffs on 60% of goods entering NI from GB Brexit: No checks on goods, says PM Reality Check:This has been one of Labour's attack lines during the election campaign. The party has claimed that under a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the US, under Boris Johnson, the NHS would be ""up for sale"". US trade negotiators have set out their objectivesfor any such trade deal with the UK, including ""full market access"" for US pharmaceuticals. The prime minister responded by saying: ""There are no circumstancesâ¦ in which this government or any Conservative will put the NHS on the table in any free trade negotiation."" Reality Check:He was referring to his decision to postpone a planned cut in UK corporation tax - on companies' profits - from 19% to 17%. But Ireland, for example, has a rate of 12.5%, according to statistics from theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),external. Reality Check:Jeremy Corbyn replied that over the course of the next Parliament a Labour government would increase corporation tax to ""around the levels it was in 2010"". Back then, it was 28%. So, would this be the highest in Europe? At the moment, several European countries have higher corporation tax rates than this: France 32% and Belgium 29%. Both countries are planning reductions though: France to 28% and Belgium to 25%.

Stowaways found in cold container bound for UKTwenty-five people are found in a cooling container on a UK-bound ferry coming from the Netherlands.Europe,"Two of the people found on the ferry were taken to hospital for treatment Police in the Netherlands have arrested a Romanian lorry driver after 25 stowaways were found in a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for the UK. They were found at around 19:00 (18:00 GMT), forcing the ship to return to the port of Vlaardingen near Rotterdam. The Danish-registered ferry had been en route to Felixstowe. The incident comes just weeks after the bodies of 39 people were found in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex in eastern England. The stowaways found on Tuesday received medical attention at the port of Vlaardingen, where police were waiting for the ship's arrival. Two were taken to hospital to receive extra medical care, while the other 23 people were transferred to a police facility after a medical check-up, authorities said. Essex lorry deaths: Who are the victims? Essex lorry deaths: What we know The stowaways, whose nationalities have not yet been confirmed, were found in a refrigerated container on a lorry on board the ferry, authorities said. The driver of the lorry was detained and was being questioned over possible involvement, police told the Dutch broadcaster NOS. Police told the broadcast that crew members found the stowaways and alerted authorities after hearing ""sounds coming from the cooling container"". A search of the ferry involving police dogs was carried out but no-one else was found. Seafarers' charity Stella Maris said it was important to recognise the ""hugely stressful"" nature of these types of incidents for crew. The bodies found in the Essex container last month were those of Vietnamese nationals who had arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Two lorry drivers have since been charged with manslaughter, and several other men have been arrested in connection with the case.

Oxford Union president resigns over blind student,"This video can not be played Footage of security appearing to grapple with Mr Azamati was filmed in the chamber The president of Oxford Union has resigned over a row involving a blind student who was ""violently"" removed from a society debate. Ebenezer Azamati was ""accosted"" by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat he had earlier reserved before the discussion on 17 October. On Saturday,he was cleared of any wrongdoing. President of the society Brendan McGrath apologised for his ""mistakes"" and resigned. Postgraduate student Mr Azamati, from Ghana, said his treatment made him feel ""unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country"". After the charges against Mr Azamati were successfully appealed,Mr McGrath apologised to the Africa Society,external""for the distress and any reputational damage"" to the student. Helen Mountfield QC, representing Mr Azamati, had said there were ongoing talks with the union over what steps it could take to address the ""failings"" exposed by the case. The Oxford Union intentionally resembles the House of Commons In a letter to the standing committee,posted on Oxford Union's Facebook page,external, Mr McGrath said: ""For all my shortcomings, and all of my mistakes, I apologise profusely and unqualifiedly."" He said managing the response to Mr Azamati's eviction from the debate had been ""the most difficult thing I've ever been charged with"". The Oxford Union, which is independent from the university, has a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823. It is one of the most prestigious societies in the world and its debating chamber intentionally resembles the House of Commons. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan once said the union is ""the last bastion of free speech in the Western world"". The union invites world leaders, politicians, celebrities and controversial speakers to give speeches to its members, who are mostly current or former Oxford students. Past presidents include Benazir Bhutto, Boris Johnson, Gyles Brandreth and former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. Mr McGrath said he had been asked by those present to bring the disciplinary complaint against him on behalf of a staff member but added he ""should have recognised a wider obligation"". ""The right response would not have begun with prosecution and apportioning blame; it would have addressed immediately the extreme distress of all involved,"" he continued. Before signing his resignation, he added he had proposed ""a full, public and independent review"" of the union's policies in relation to disability, how it trains its staff and whether the current security system ""is fit for the purpose of a student society"". Oxford University previously tweeted its support for Mr Azamati, and said it shared ""the widespread outrage regarding the unacceptable treatment"" of the student. Allow Twitter content?

Oxford Union president resigns over blind student row,"This video can not be played Footage of security appearing to grapple with Mr Azamati was filmed in the chamber The president of Oxford Union has resigned over a row involving a blind student who was ""violently"" removed from a society debate. Ebenezer Azamati was ""accosted"" by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat he had earlier reserved before the discussion on 17 October. On Saturday,he was cleared of any wrongdoing. President of the society Brendan McGrath apologised for his ""mistakes"" and resigned. Postgraduate student Mr Azamati, from Ghana, said his treatment made him feel ""unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country"". After the charges against Mr Azamati were successfully appealed,Mr McGrath apologised to the Africa Society,external""for the distress and any reputational damage"" to the student. Helen Mountfield QC, representing Mr Azamati, had said there were ongoing talks with the union over what steps it could take to address the ""failings"" exposed by the case. The Oxford Union intentionally resembles the House of Commons In a letter to the standing committee,posted on Oxford Union's Facebook page,external, Mr McGrath said: ""For all my shortcomings, and all of my mistakes, I apologise profusely and unqualifiedly."" He said managing the response to Mr Azamati's eviction from the debate had been ""the most difficult thing I've ever been charged with"". The Oxford Union, which is independent from the university, has a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823. It is one of the most prestigious societies in the world and its debating chamber intentionally resembles the House of Commons. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan once said the union is ""the last bastion of free speech in the Western world"". The union invites world leaders, politicians, celebrities and controversial speakers to give speeches to its members, who are mostly current or former Oxford students. Past presidents include Benazir Bhutto, Boris Johnson, Gyles Brandreth and former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. Mr McGrath said he had been asked by those present to bring the disciplinary complaint against him on behalf of a staff member but added he ""should have recognised a wider obligation"". ""The right response would not have begun with prosecution and apportioning blame; it would have addressed immediately the extreme distress of all involved,"" he continued. Before signing his resignation, he added he had proposed ""a full, public and independent review"" of the union's policies in relation to disability, how it trains its staff and whether the current security system ""is fit for the purpose of a student society"". Oxford University previously tweeted its support for Mr Azamati, and said it shared ""the widespread outrage regarding the unacceptable treatment"" of the student. Allow Twitter content?

Old age: Why 70 may be the new 65Experts say health and life expectancy gains mean it is time to rethink how we measure and define being elderly.Health,"It may be time to rethink how we measure and define old age in the UK because more people are surviving into their late 80s and beyond, say experts. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalteam says although 65 has traditionally been seen as the start of old age, 70 could be seen as the ""new 65"". That's because many people who reach this milestone birthday can still expect to live another 15 years. Remaining life expectancy may be a better marker of old age, they say. Traditionally, 65 has been taken as the entry point into old age. For decades it has been the official retirement age for men when they can start drawing their state pension. But working patterns are shifting and the pension age is rising for both men and women - it will reach 66 in 2020 and 67 by 2028. The ONS team says people are living longer, healthier lives. That means we should consider the years people have ahead of them, not just chronological age when deciding what ""old"" looks like. The ONS Centre for Ageing and Demography team looked back at population data on health and life expectancy to compare trends over time. If you take the measure of 15 years of life remaining, the average age that a person will hit this point has changed over the last century. In 1951 men and women around the age of 60 could expect to live another 15 years. By the 1990s it had shifted to 65 and currently it's 70-year-olds who can expect another 15 years of life. In 2057, experts predict this average age will rise again to 75. The population's life expectancy has increased over the centuries thanks to improvements in healthcare and living conditions. But are these extra years enjoyed in good health? Is it fair to shift the milestone of old age from 65 to 70? Health by chronological (birthday) age has improved over time. But changes in health by prospective age (how much time you have left to live) have declined in some cases and improved in others. By the researchers' calculations, levels of poor general health for women aged 70 in 2017 were around the same as for those aged 60 in 1981, while levels of longstanding illness were similar for women aged around 64. For men, levels of poor general health at age 70 in 2017 were around the same as for those aged 65 in 1997, while levels of limiting longstanding illness were similar for those around age 57. So, at a population level, it would seem fair to label 70 as the new 65 (or perhaps even younger), even taking health into account. Libby Webb, senior research manager at Age UK, said: ""People at age 70 now have the same life expectancy and similar health to people aged 65 in the past so, on average, we are definitely seeing people doing better than they did in the past."" But she said most people still experienced a period of poor health at the end of their lives. ""What we are not seeing is that period getting shorter."" She said improved life expectancy meant there were now more ""very old"" people with quite complex care needs and that health inequalities between the richest and poorest remain. But she said an ageing society should not be viewed as negative. ""We know that older people make really important contributions to our society both through their paid work and through their caring responsibilities and volunteering. ""Age is just a number and for different people it means different things.""

Trump Ukraine phone call 'improper' - US officialA US official tells the impeachment inquiry that Donald Trump made inappropriate political demands.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Why did this impeachment witness earn applause? The White House attacked its own top Ukraine official as he testified to an impeachment hearing that a phone call made by the president was ""improper"" and had left him in ""shock"". Lt Col Alexander Vindman told Congress that President Donald Trump made ""inappropriate"" political demands of the Ukrainian president. ""I couldn't believe what I was hearing,"" Col Vindman said. The hearings are investigating whether Mr Trump abused his presidential power. A decorated Iraq war veteran who serves in a senior role on the US National Security Council (NSC), Col Vindman testified before the House on Tuesday in his Army dress uniform. As he described his reaction to hearing a call between President Trump and his Ukranian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, Col Vindman came under attack by the official White House Twitter account, which posted a critical quote from his former boss on the NSC questioning his judgement. Republican congressmen pressed Col Vindman on the remark and questioned his loyalty to the US - asking about instances in which Ukrainian officials approached him about becoming the country's defence minister. ""Every single time I dismissed it,"" Col Vindman said. ""I'm an American."" Key takeaways from impeachment hearing Fact-checking Republican impeachment claims A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story The impeachment story explained The impeachment hearings are an effort by Democrats to establish whether Mr Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new leader, Mr Zelensky, into announcing a corruption inquiry into Joe Biden, Mr Trump's leading Democratic rival for the US presidency. If the president were to be impeached by a majority vote in the House of Representatives, he would face a trial in the Senate which could remove him from office, although the Republican controlled chamber would be unlikely to vote against him. Col Vindman told the US House intelligence committee that he had been concerned by the president's demands to investigate Mr Biden. ""It was probably an element of shock that maybe, in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukrainian policy could play out was playing out,"" he said. ""It was improper for the president to request - to demand - an investigation into a political opponent, especially [from] a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge,"" he told the committee. He had reported the ""inappropriate"" discussion to NSC lawyers ""out of a sense of duty"". This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? The official Twitter account of the White House was used throughout the hearing to attack Col Vindman and the inquiry in real time, retweeting hashtags including #ShamImpeachment and #ParodyImpeachment. The Trump administration's use of a taxpayer-funded account to attack opponents has drawn criticism in the past. What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Why Ukraine is so important to the US Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? Col Vindman was among the US officials who listened in on the 25 July call between the two leaders. He is a decorated Iraq war veteran who was born in Ukraine; his family moved from the Soviet Union to the US 40 years ago. Mr Trump similarly used his own personal Twitter account to attack the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, during her testimony to the impeachment inquiry last week. If what Vindman said was important, how he said it in the public hearings also mattered. Behind closed doors, veteran ambassadors Bill Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch were reportedly smooth while Vindman was halting and nervous. Those observations have been confirmed by their public testimony - when Vindman delivered his opening statement, his hands trembled slightly. He occasionally stumbled over his words. Republicans could paint that as weakness or uncertainty, but it might also be seen by Americans as giving his testimony a touch of humanity - particularly when paired with the emotional closing words to Vindman's opening statement. Vindman offered reassurance to his father, who brought his children to the US from the Soviet Union, that he was sitting in the US Capitol and would be ""fine for telling the truth"". Toward the end of Vindman's appearance, he was asked by a Democratic congressman to read that line again - and then added why he's not afraid of testifying today. ""Because this is America,"" he said. ""This is the country I have served and defended... and here, right matters."" Vindman's testimony will only add to the contentious debate among Democrats and Republicans over who is right and exactly what the truth is. The other witness in the morning session was Jennifer Williams, a foreign service adviser to Vice-President Mike Pence. She said Mr Trump's reference to Mr Biden in the 25 July call with Mr Zelensky had been ""unusual"" because it delved into domestic US politics. ""The reference to Biden sounded political to me,"" she said. The inquiry's afternoon session heard from former NSC official Tim Morrison and Kurt Volker, the former US special representative to Ukraine. Mr Volker told the hearing that President Trump ""had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past"" and despite ""positive news and recommendations"" being conveyed about Ukraine's new president ""he was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view"". He added that the allegations against Mr Biden were ""self-serving and not credible"". Mr Morrison - who resigned from his position some weeks ago - says he felt no pressure to quit and feared no retaliation. In his opening statement he said he did not know the identity of a whistleblower whose report helped start the inquiry. Mr Trump is facing a process that could eventually see him removed from office. The inquiry is trying to establish whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020. Things are still at an early stage. The first public hearings started last week in the lower house of Congress, the House of Representatives, controlled by the Democrats. President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing. Tuesday is the third day of televised impeachment hearings. Depending on what happens in the next few weeks, Mr Trump could end up facing impeachment.

Hacking the Ripper - BBC News The book reconstructs the lives of the five women - Mary Ann ""Polly"" Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly - killed by the unidentified serial killer in the Whitechapel area of the city, often using little more than the DNA of a single hair. ""There's so much in their stories that we can take away that tells us about how we live today: everything from homelessness to addiction to domestic violence,"" she went on. ""And people become victims because society doesn't care about them."" Image taken from the cover of The Five by Hallie Rubenhold Stig Abell, chair of the judges for the award, said the ""beautifully written and impressively researched"" book ""spoke with an urgency and passion to our own times"". Earlier in the year, around its publication,the Guardian,externalnoted how ""a landmark study calls time on the misogyny that fed the Jack the Ripper myth"". The paper's critic, Frances Wilson, however, begged the question: ""Why has it taken 130 years for a book telling the stories of the women to appear?"" Rebecca Armstrong fromiNews,externalwrote that Rubenhold was ""giving Jack the Ripper's victims back their voices"". ""Throughout the book, Rubenhold uses the particulars of her subjects' lives as a springboard to depict social circumstances that shaped millions of lives,"" added Wendy Smith inThe Washington Post.,external Jad Adams from theLiterary Review,externalacknowledged how the book did not include any gory accounts of how each victim met her death. ""This is because she wants to look not at how they died but at how they lived,"" he wrote. Other titles shortlisted for the award included Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud and the Last Trial of Harper Lee by Casey Cep, and On Chapel Sands: My Mother and Other Missing Persons by Laura Cumming. William Feaver's The Lives of Lucian Freud: Youth, Maoism: A Global History by Julia Lovell, and Guest House for Young Widows by Azadeh Moaveni were also recognised.

Tories criticised over 'factcheckUK' rebrand,"This video can not be played The Tory press office was rebranded as ""factcheckUK"" for Tuesday's live TV debate Social networking site Twitter has said the Conservative Party misled the public when it rebranded one of its Twitter accounts. The @CCHQPress account - the Tory press office - was renamed ""factcheckUK"" for Tuesday's live TV debate involving Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. After the debate, the account reverted to its original branding. Twitter said it would take ""decisive corrective action"" if a similar stunt was attempted again. But the firm does not appear to have taken any action over this particular incident. ""Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action."" The Tories were earlier criticised by genuine fact-checking agency Full Fact, which said in a statement: ""It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate. ""Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service such as FullFact, FactCheck or FactCheckNI."" Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly defended the rebranding. He told BBC Newsnight: ""The Twitter handle of the CCHQ press office remained CCHQPress, so it's clear the nature of the site."" Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit Kuenssberg: First TV debate not a game-changer Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked Who should I vote for? Election policy guide Mr Cleverly added the decision to rebrand the account would have been made by the party's digital team, which he said operated within his remit. He said he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with the party ""calling out when the Labour Party put what they know to be complete fabrications in the public domain"". Reacting to the decision, the Labour Party tweeted: ""The Conservatives' laughable attempt to dupe those watching the #ITVDebate by renaming their twitter account shows you can't trust a word they say."" The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, said the ploy was ""straight out of Donald Trump or Putin's playbook"", adding the Tories were ""deliberately misleading the public"". Twitter is a minority interest. Journalists are over-represented on this platform compared to other social media, creating a profound danger that they misinterpret what happens on Twitter as representative of the wider world. Nevertheless, an important threshold has now been repeatedly breached by Britain's party of government, and Twitter is the site where it happened. It is perhaps arguable that, like thedoctored video of Sir Keir Starmera fortnight ago, the re-branding of CCHQ as a fact-checking service falls into the broad category known as satire. But that is a stretch. The effect will have been to dupe many unknowing members of the public, who genuinely thought it was a fact-checking service when it gave opinions on Jeremy Corbyn. This is not to patronise voters, who are wise; rather, it is to recognise that in a world of information overload, what cuts through are stunts. Which is why, ironically, in CCHQ this morning there will be younger staff who chalk this up as a victory. Journalists thus face a dilemma: call out disinformation, and you play to the worst of social media, distracting from questions of policy; but ignore it, and the truth recedes ever further from view. Twitter has policies regarding deceptive behaviour on the platform. The company said it can remove an accountâs âverifiedâ status if the account owner is said to be âintentionally misleading people on Twitter by changing one's display name or bioâ. Other users on the platform subsequently changed their display names to mock the move. Among them, writer Charlie Brooker, who tweeted: âWe have always been at war with Eastasiaâ, a reference to George Orwellâs dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. This latest controversial move on social media comes less than a month after the Conservative Party was criticised for posting a ""doctored"" video involving Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, in which the shadow Brexit secretary was made to look as if he met a question, posed by ITV's Piers Morgan, with silence. Conservative Party chairmanJames Cleverly said the video, since taken down, was meant to be ""light-hearted"". The party later posted an extended version of the interview. Full Fact, which is a charity supported by donations from the likes of Google, described the incident as ""irresponsible"". Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit Who should I vote for?

Kuenssberg: Not a game-changer,"A lot of huffing and puffing. A lot of over eager attempts to land and repeat their stock lines. But the first head-to-head clash between the two men who could be the next prime minister did not transform the landscape of this election. There were clashes, predictably, on Brexit and the NHS. And Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson both stepped carefully through the minefield of commenting on the monarchy and Prince Andrew's recent jaw-dropping interview. But neither man seem to have made a meaningful mistake. Nor did either of them appear to have a breakthrough moment. Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit It is still early in this election campaign and likely that swathes of the public have quite understandably only started to think vaguely about the choice in front of them. But at this stage, with Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. That seemed a taste of how many people may well feel in this election, that they are being asked to choose a national leader from a less than tempting pair.

Babies and mums died 'amid toxic hospital culture',"Rhiannon Davies campaigned for an independent inquiry after her baby, Kate, died in 2009 Babies and mothers died amid a ""toxic"" culture at a hospital trust stretching back 40 years, a report has said. The catalogue of maternity care failings at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust are contained in a reportleaked to The Independent,external. It reveals that some children were left disabled, staff got the names of some dead babies wrong and, in one case, referred to a child as ""it"". The trust apologised and said ""a lot"" had been done to address concerns. What do we know about the review? In 2017,then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced an investigationinto avoidable baby deaths at the trust, which runs Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal. It is being led by maternity expert Donna Ockenden, who authored the report for NHS Improvement. The trust runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital in Telford Its initial scope was to examine 23 cases but this has now grown tomore than 270, covering the period from 1979 to the present day. The cases include 22 stillbirths, three deaths during pregnancy, 17 deaths of babies after birth, three deaths of mothers, 47 cases of substandard care and 51 cases of cerebral palsy or brain damage. The interim report said the number of cases it is now being asked to review ""seems to represent a longstanding culture at this trust that is toxic to improvement effort"". The report details the issues experienced by affected families, including: Babies left brain-damaged because staff failed to realise labour was going wrong, or from group B strep or meningitis that can often be treated by antibiotics Heartbeats not monitored adequately during labour One father gaining his only feedback on his daughter's death after bumping into a hospital employee at a supermarket Family members being told they would have to leave if they did not ""keep the noise down"" when they were upset following their baby's death A baby girl's shawl, which her mother had planned to bury her in, was lost by staff Multiple families ""where deceased babies are given the wrong names by the trust - frequently in writing"" and ""on occasions referred to a deceased baby as 'it'"" It also points to an inadequate review carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in 2017 and the ""misplaced"" optimism of the regulator in charge in 2007. Donna Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019 Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton,whose baby Kate died in 2009, were among the families who first pushed for the independent inquiry. Ms Davies said she was already aware of many of the issues raised by the report but said she was ""shocked"" by the length of time covered by the report. ""The devastating reality of Kate's avoidable death, that I have to live with, is that she was condemned to her painful death by the culture at SaTH that wilfully refused to learn from earlier cases dating back decades,"" she said. ""That is why I have fought every body and every institution in Kate's name because no other baby will suffer the same harm while I have breath in my body. ""The only way I believe it will stop is if the police or Crown Prosecution Service bring corporate manslaughter charges against the trust."" Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This report will unfortunately only confirm what dozens of families have been telling me since we first highlighted the problems at the trust in 2017. A staggering attitude towards any number of families - dismissing their questions, telling young women who'd just lost a healthy baby not to worry as they'll be pregnant again within the year - showed a wilful disregard to improving healthcare and learning from mistakes. But it would be wrong to simply blame SaTH, culpable as it is. NHS regulators as far back as 2007 drew attention to problems in the maternity unit and then failed to follow-up with any meaningful improvements. The trust has recently appointed a new chief executive - developing a new culture will take an awful lot longer. Det Supt Carl Moore, of West Mercia Police, said the force was liaising with the independent inquiry and awaiting its findings before any criminal proceedings would be considered - in line with protocol in health care settings. Mr Stanton said: ""My feelings are one of huge sorrow, huge sorrow for all the families who have had their lives ripped apart by this trust, by the avoidable death of their child, an avoidable death of a mother or the harm to their child. ""A death at the hands of a trust that has a toxic culture of lying and cover up."" Baby death investigation 'not watered down' Hundreds more cases in baby deaths review Sharon Morris, whose daughter Olivia suffered a brain injury 14 years ago, said she was ""not shocked"" by the findings. In a statement released by Lanyon Bowdler solicitors, she said: ""Every day for the last 14 years we are constantly reminded of the failure by SaTH to help me give birth to healthy twins. ""No amount of money can change things and all we can now hope for is that changes are made to ensure other families don't suffer like we do."" Olivia Morris (centre), pictured with her identical twin Beth and their mother Sharon, suffered a brain injury 14 years ago Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (SaTH) said it had ""not been made aware of any interim report"" and awaited the findings of the full report. Paula Clark, interim chief executive, apologised ""unreservedly"" to the families affected. She added: ""A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases."" However, the report warned lessons were not being learned and staff at the trust were uncommunicative with families. Latest news from the West Midlands Ms Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019. ""This was produced at the request of NHS Improvement and was not meant for publication,"" she said. She said the independent review team was working to meet the family's request for ""one, single, comprehensive"" report covering all cases of serious concern within maternity services at the trust.

Trump Ukraine phone call 'improper' - US official,"This video can not be played Why did this impeachment witness earn applause? The White House attacked its own top Ukraine official as he testified to an impeachment hearing that a phone call made by the president was ""improper"" and had left him in ""shock"". Lt Col Alexander Vindman told Congress that President Donald Trump made ""inappropriate"" political demands of the Ukrainian president. ""I couldn't believe what I was hearing,"" Col Vindman said. The hearings are investigating whether Mr Trump abused his presidential power. A decorated Iraq war veteran who serves in a senior role on the US National Security Council (NSC), Col Vindman testified before the House on Tuesday in his Army dress uniform. As he described his reaction to hearing a call between President Trump and his Ukranian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, Col Vindman came under attack by the official White House Twitter account, which posted a critical quote from his former boss on the NSC questioning his judgement. Republican congressmen pressed Col Vindman on the remark and questioned his loyalty to the US - asking about instances in which Ukrainian officials approached him about becoming the country's defence minister. ""Every single time I dismissed it,"" Col Vindman said. ""I'm an American."" Key takeaways from impeachment hearing Fact-checking Republican impeachment claims A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story The impeachment story explained The impeachment hearings are an effort by Democrats to establish whether Mr Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new leader, Mr Zelensky, into announcing a corruption inquiry into Joe Biden, Mr Trump's leading Democratic rival for the US presidency. If the president were to be impeached by a majority vote in the House of Representatives, he would face a trial in the Senate which could remove him from office, although the Republican controlled chamber would be unlikely to vote against him. Col Vindman told the US House intelligence committee that he had been concerned by the president's demands to investigate Mr Biden. ""It was probably an element of shock that maybe, in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukrainian policy could play out was playing out,"" he said. ""It was improper for the president to request - to demand - an investigation into a political opponent, especially [from] a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge,"" he told the committee. He had reported the ""inappropriate"" discussion to NSC lawyers ""out of a sense of duty"". This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? The official Twitter account of the White House was used throughout the hearing to attack Col Vindman and the inquiry in real time, retweeting hashtags including #ShamImpeachment and #ParodyImpeachment. The Trump administration's use of a taxpayer-funded account to attack opponents has drawn criticism in the past. What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Why Ukraine is so important to the US Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? Col Vindman was among the US officials who listened in on the 25 July call between the two leaders. He is a decorated Iraq war veteran who was born in Ukraine; his family moved from the Soviet Union to the US 40 years ago. Mr Trump similarly used his own personal Twitter account to attack the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, during her testimony to the impeachment inquiry last week. If what Vindman said was important, how he said it in the public hearings also mattered. Behind closed doors, veteran ambassadors Bill Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch were reportedly smooth while Vindman was halting and nervous. Those observations have been confirmed by their public testimony - when Vindman delivered his opening statement, his hands trembled slightly. He occasionally stumbled over his words. Republicans could paint that as weakness or uncertainty, but it might also be seen by Americans as giving his testimony a touch of humanity - particularly when paired with the emotional closing words to Vindman's opening statement. Vindman offered reassurance to his father, who brought his children to the US from the Soviet Union, that he was sitting in the US Capitol and would be ""fine for telling the truth"". Toward the end of Vindman's appearance, he was asked by a Democratic congressman to read that line again - and then added why he's not afraid of testifying today. ""Because this is America,"" he said. ""This is the country I have served and defended... and here, right matters."" Vindman's testimony will only add to the contentious debate among Democrats and Republicans over who is right and exactly what the truth is. The other witness in the morning session was Jennifer Williams, a foreign service adviser to Vice-President Mike Pence. She said Mr Trump's reference to Mr Biden in the 25 July call with Mr Zelensky had been ""unusual"" because it delved into domestic US politics. ""The reference to Biden sounded political to me,"" she said. The inquiry's afternoon session heard from former NSC official Tim Morrison and Kurt Volker, the former US special representative to Ukraine. Mr Volker told the hearing that President Trump ""had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past"" and despite ""positive news and recommendations"" being conveyed about Ukraine's new president ""he was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view"". He added that the allegations against Mr Biden were ""self-serving and not credible"". Mr Morrison - who resigned from his position some weeks ago - says he felt no pressure to quit and feared no retaliation. In his opening statement he said he did not know the identity of a whistleblower whose report helped start the inquiry. Mr Trump is facing a process that could eventually see him removed from office. The inquiry is trying to establish whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020. Things are still at an early stage. The first public hearings started last week in the lower house of Congress, the House of Representatives, controlled by the Democrats. President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing. Tuesday is the third day of televised impeachment hearings. Depending on what happens in the next few weeks, Mr Trump could end up facing impeachment.

Epstein guards charged with falsifying records,"Tova Noel (L) and Michael Thomas (R) - separated by a lawyer - have pleaded not guilty Two prison guards who were on duty on the night of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's death have been charged with falsifying records. They are accused of failing to check in on him every 30 minutes and fabricating log entries to show they had. Both appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The case of Jeffrey Epstein - in 300 words The 66-year-old was previously jailed in Florida in 2008 for procuring a minor for prostitution. The charges against the two guards are the first to arise from a criminal inquiry into his death. They were supposed to check on Epstein every 30 minutes on the night of his death. He had been taken off suicide watch after a previous suspected attempt to take his own life and was alone in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. But attorney Geoffrey Berman said the two guards had""repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction"",external. The guards were named in a statement by the Southern District of New York Attorney's Office on Tuesday as correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, aged 31 and 41 respectively. For ""substantial portions"" of their shifts, they ""sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the common area"", the statement said. They then signed ""false certifications"" showing that they had conducted counts of inmates. Both guards have been charged with ""making false records and conspiring to make false records and to defraud the United States"". ""We allege these officers falsified records to create the appearance they were following... protocols. The security risks created by this type of behaviour are immense,"" FBI assistant director William Sweeney said in the statement. Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sexually abusing dozens of girls Surveillance footage showed that no other people had entered the area where Epstein was held that evening, the statement added. Both guards appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. Bail was set at $100,000 (Â£77,000) each, US media reports. Both guards were previously reported to have beenworking overtime shifts on the night of Epstein's death. US Attorney General William Barr ordered their suspension in August after the FBI opened an investigation. Federal prosecutors later offered the guards a plea bargain but they turned it down, according to the Associated Press news agency. New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections.

Hitler's old home to become police station,"This video can not be played Bethany Bell visits the house where Adolf Hitler was born The building where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was born in Austria will be turned into a police station, officials have announced. Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn said it would be an ""unmistakable signal"" that the property did not commemorate Nazism. Hitler spent the first few weeks of his life in a flat in the 17th-Century building in the town of Braunau am Inn. The fate of the property has been the subject of a lengthy dispute. For decades, the government rented it from its former owner in an attempt to stop far-right tourism.

There has been widespread debate and disagreement in Austria over the fate of the building. Some have called for it to be torn down, while others argued it should be used for charity work or as a house of reconciliation.

Law firm suspends asylum seeker interpretersThree interpreters are suspended amid a police investigation into reports of fraud in the asylum system.Scotland,"Hazhar Jabbary worked as an interpreter on asylum cases One of Scotland's biggest immigration law firms has suspended three interpreters amid a police investigation into reports of fraud in the asylum system in Glasgow. The BBC has learned that Latta & Co has taken action against freelance interpreters working on Kurdish asylum seeker claims. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of the law firm. It is understood police are investigating one interpreter. They received allegations that Hazhar Jabbary had been telling asylum seekers he could guarantee their claim to stay in the UK would be successful in return for payment. Last month, the BBC received information the interpreter was asking for money, and the amount charged ranged from about Â£4,000 to Â£25,000. It is understood Mr Jabbary, who is a freelance interpreter, has worked in the past for a number of public authorities, including the police. More recently he has worked as a self-employed interpreter for Latta & Co in Glasgow. A spokesman for Latta & Co described the three interpreters as ""rivals"" and said it had suspended them when they became aware of the allegation. He said: ""They will never work for the firm again. We carried out a thorough investigation and took detailed legal advice but there was an obvious lack of clear evidence to back up claims of wrongdoing. As part of the process, we encouraged anyone with concerns to report the matter to the police. ""The work of interpreters is vital in this field of law and we are now working with a number of alternative interpreters to ensure our clients get the legal help they need."" Interpreters are employed to provide support to asylum seekers involved in making applications. They receive an hourly rate for their services. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Police in Glasgow are currently investigating reports of fraud relating to immigration and asylum applications in the city. Inquiries are at an early stage.""

Old age: Why 70 may be the new 65Experts say health and life expectancy gains mean it is time to rethink how we measure and define being elderly.,"It may be time to rethink how we measure and define old age in the UK because more people are surviving into their late 80s and beyond, say experts. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalteam says although 65 has traditionally been seen as the start of old age, 70 could be seen as the ""new 65"". That's because many people who reach this milestone birthday can still expect to live another 15 years. Remaining life expectancy may be a better marker of old age, they say. Traditionally, 65 has been taken as the entry point into old age. For decades it has been the official retirement age for men when they can start drawing their state pension. But working patterns are shifting and the pension age is rising for both men and women - it will reach 66 in 2020 and 67 by 2028. The ONS team says people are living longer, healthier lives. That means we should consider the years people have ahead of them, not just chronological age when deciding what ""old"" looks like. The ONS Centre for Ageing and Demography team looked back at population data on health and life expectancy to compare trends over time. If you take the measure of 15 years of life remaining, the average age that a person will hit this point has changed over the last century. In 1951 men and women around the age of 60 could expect to live another 15 years. By the 1990s it had shifted to 65 and currently it's 70-year-olds who can expect another 15 years of life. In 2057, experts predict this average age will rise again to 75. The population's life expectancy has increased over the centuries thanks to improvements in healthcare and living conditions. But are these extra years enjoyed in good health? Is it fair to shift the milestone of old age from 65 to 70? Health by chronological (birthday) age has improved over time. But changes in health by prospective age (how much time you have left to live) have declined in some cases and improved in others. By the researchers' calculations, levels of poor general health for women aged 70 in 2017 were around the same as for those aged 60 in 1981, while levels of longstanding illness were similar for women aged around 64. For men, levels of poor general health at age 70 in 2017 were around the same as for those aged 65 in 1997, while levels of limiting longstanding illness were similar for those around age 57. So, at a population level, it would seem fair to label 70 as the new 65 (or perhaps even younger), even taking health into account. Libby Webb, senior research manager at Age UK, said: ""People at age 70 now have the same life expectancy and similar health to people aged 65 in the past so, on average, we are definitely seeing people doing better than they did in the past."" But she said most people still experienced a period of poor health at the end of their lives. ""What we are not seeing is that period getting shorter."" She said improved life expectancy meant there were now more ""very old"" people with quite complex care needs and that health inequalities between the richest and poorest remain. But she said an ageing society should not be viewed as negative. ""We know that older people make really important contributions to our society both through their paid work and through their caring responsibilities and volunteering. ""Age is just a number and for different people it means different things.""

Sweden drops Assange rape investigation,"This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Prosecutors in Sweden have dropped an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010. Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. The 48-year-old Australian was evicted in April and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline of saga The Swedish investigation had been shelved in 2017 but wasre-opened earlier this year following his eviction from the embassy. Separately, the US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010. Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson took the decision to ""discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange"", the Swedish Prosecution Authority said. ""The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,"" it added. Eva-Marie Persson said the decision had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses Ms Persson said: ""I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. ""Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation."" This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Prosecutors told reporters the decision to drop the inquiry had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses in the case. Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent With the end of Julian Assange's legal troubles in Sweden, one long chapter in the saga is over. But another one, in the United States, has barely begun. The Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police. Now Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail. From behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US. Assange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual. He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out. There was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation. Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: ""Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment."" Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,external. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a lengthy prison term. How likely is an Assange conviction in US? In June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US. Assange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London Assange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term. Buta judge ruled that Assange should remain in jailuntil his extradition hearing because of his ""history of absconding"". Last month,a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London in February.

Welch, West Virginia, is in a county where US President Donald Trump received more than 70% of the vote in the 2016 election. The BBC spoke to locals about the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump. This video can not be played What coal country makes of Trump impeachment Rudy Giuliani is a key player in the Ukraine matter, and particularly in Volker's ongoing testimony This video can not be played Trump-Ukraine: What was president's lawyer Giuliani up to? The text messages shared by Volker were some of the first evidence we saw from the impeachment inquiry. They documented the Trump administration's efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate a Ukrainian company with ties to Joe Biden's son and conspiracy theories around Russian hacking during the 2016 US presidential election. Democrats in the US House of Representatives - which is conducting an impeachment investigation of Donald Trump - made public a selection of these messages. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher examined just how damaging those texts were to Trump. Volker says during his one in-person meeting with Giuliani on 19 July, he rejected the ""conspiracy theory"" raised by Giuliani that Biden ""had been influenced in his duties as vice-president by money paid to his son"". Volker calls Biden an honourable man and says he holds him in the highest regard. ""I did
not know that President Trump or others had raised Vice-President Biden with the
Ukrainians, or had conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption, with an investigation of the former vice-president. ""In retrospect, for the Ukrainians, it clearly
would have been confusing."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter On day three of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry, the witnesses were top aides who listened in on President Trump's call with Ukraine's leader. What did we learn? One was a decorated Iraq War veteran who was born in Ukraine and came to the US as a child, Lt Col Alexander Vindman. The other was US Vice-President Mike Pence's top adviser on Russia, Jennifer Williams. With the TV cameras rolling on Capitol Hill, they repeated concerns they had aired behind closed doors about the July phone call between the two leaders. But much of Tuesday's hearing was spent talking about a person who was probably not even in the room - the whistleblower. Read Anthony's full analysis here. Volker testifies that Giuliani told him that he ""stressed the importance"" of Ukraine conducting investigations into what happened in the past - ""both the accusations about Vice-President Biden, and about interference in the 2016 election"". Volker says he told Giuliani that it did not seem ""at all credible"" that Biden had been influenced by personal motives while serving as Vice-President. BBC Americas Bureaux Editor Paul Danahar, who is in the hearing room, writes that Volker joins a long list of witnesses who have been hostile to what Giuliani was doing. Allow Twitter content?

It's only the fourth time in US history that an American president has faced the peril of being forced from the White House. Trump is accused of withholding nearly $400m (Â£327m) in military aid in order to pressurise Ukraine's new president into launching an inquiry into his 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son. But the US president denies doing anything wrong. This is a complicated story.We've got you covered with this simple guide to the sequence of events. Volker says he and other officials urged Trump to invite Zelensky to the White House, as Zelensky was ""the best chance for getting Ukraine out of the mire of corruption"". ""The president was very sceptical,"" Volker says. ""Given Ukraineâs history of corruption, that is understandable.
He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible people. He said they 'tried to take
me down.' In the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor
Giuliani. ""It was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being
conveyed by this official delegation about the new president, President Trump had a deeply
rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was clearly receiving other information
from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this
negative view."" Volker says as the most senior official working on Ukraine portfolio, he knew it was his role to provide leadership. ""That was my perspective when I learned in May 2019 that we had a significant problem that
was impeding our ability to strengthen our support for Ukraineâs new president in his effort to
ramp up Ukraineâs fight against corruption and implementation of needed reforms."" That problem involved Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer. ""Despite the unanimous, positive assessment and recommendations of
those of us who were part of the US Presidential Delegation that attended the inauguration of
President Zelensky, President Trump was receiving a different, negative narrative about
Ukraine and President Zelensky....fuelled by accusations from
Ukraineâs then-Prosecutor General and conveyed to the President by former Mayor Rudy
Giuliani."" Kurt Volker says he was never ""aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate
former Vice President Biden"". He says he was not present on the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky and did not know of any reference made to the Bidens by the president in that call until the transcript was released in September. Morrison makes it clear he won't speculate on who the whistleblower is. He says he respects the others who testified, even if their ""recollections may differ"". Morrison - who resigned from his position some weeks ago - says he felt no pressure to quit and feared no retaliation. The two big names you need to know - Democratic Chairman Adam Schiff and Republican Devin Nunes. It's a complicated story. Here are your handy primers for all things impeachment.  SIMPLE GUIDE :If you want a basic take on what's going on, this one's for you  GO DEEPER:Here's a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story  WHAT'S IMPEACHMENT?It's a political process to remove a president - video guide  VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Hear from residents in Pennsylvania  FACT-CHECK:Is the whistleblower linked to Democrats?  CONTEXT:Why Ukraine matters to the US Lawmakers are back from voting and the hearings continue. We'll hear from Ambassador Kurt Volker and former National Security Council adviser Tim Morrison. As we wait for the afternoon session to start, let's take a look at a central figure in this saga. On the now infamous 25 July call, Trump asked Ukraineâs leader to co-ordinate with his personal lawyer  Giuliani on any inquiry into the Bidens. The former New York City mayor has already admitted to pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate  unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Joe Biden. He was to travel to Ukraine in May, but eventually decided against it. Earlier this year, two of his associates who helped connect Giuliani with Ukrainian officials were arrested on unrelated campaign finance charges. Giuliani has also been accused of trying to discredit former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who gave compelling testimony on Friday, while running his shadow foreign policy in Ukraine. He has been subpoenaed for documents by impeachment investigators, though heâs previously said he wonât co-operate with Democrats.   This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? As the first of today's hearings concluded Trump's re-election campaign sent out a fundraising email with the title ""our latest product"". ""The American People arenât buying this baseless
impeachment BS any more. In fact, we donât think
anyone ever really was,"" the email reads, while advertising bumper stickers in the shape of a traffic sign.""Itâs always been one big COUP to try and get President Trump OFF the 2020
Ballot. Itâs pathetic really."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

It all got a bit festive in the spin room during a row about Brexit... This video can not be played Election debate: The 'pantomime dame' and 'stand-up comic' MPs The final question of the programme is on I'm a Celebrity and her ideal jungle partner. Sian Berry says ""obviously"" she'd pick her Green co-leader Jonathan Bartley to go in with her ""because weâd make a strong team and weâd win it easily"". Q: Is it ever OK for climate change protesters to stop people going to work? A: I think Extinction Rebellion do a fantastic job and they [try] to be disruptive, but I do not agree with all of their tactics. Q: Would you encourage young women into a career in politics given the abuse they may face? A: I am asked a lot by young women... and it is really difficult to say it's all fine, go ahead, as it is a toxic atmosphere. It is getting worse too and it worries me. But anyone who wants to stand up and get involved should. Q: Aside from climate change and another Brexit referendum, what is your priority? A: To eliminate poverty Back to the ITV debate, and Sian Berry is asked what she would do get more people buying and using electric cars. She says that while it is important, it ""isn't the main focus of sustainable transport"". ""The best thing is to reduce the need to travel by having local services nearby, not on the ring road. ""And we need to be replacing rural bus services."" Questioned on the big bill for her climate change proposals - Â£100bn a year - she says the investment will make a ""real difference in a couple of years"". She adds: ""People are willing to listen to us now as they have listened to other parties and seen no results."" Newsnight Over on Newsnight, Tory Party chairman James Cleverly is asked whythe Conservative press office pretended to be a fact-checking organisationduring the main leaders' debate. He says it was still ""clear"" it was a Tory Twitter feed, but insists: ""We were calling out the inaccuracies that were coming out during the debate."" Mr Cleverly is unrepentant and accuses Jeremy Corbyn of ""spending the entire debate spouting things he knew were not true"", for example, on the NHS. Allow Twitter content?

The Greens' Sian Berry criticises ITV for ""relegating"" the question on climate change to Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to the quickfire round. She says: ""The young people on the streets, begging to be heard, must be feeling so let down."" Onto the party's target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030, she says they do not take the challenge lightly, but efforts must be made ""on every level"". ""We must fill in all the gaps with community action and huge investment in research."" Last up is Sian Berry - the co-leader of the Green Party.They launched their manifesto earlier today. She says the Green Party has offered ""grown-up politics"", especially around climate change, and has been ""leading the way"" on the issue. She adds: ""I think the other parties are starting to take notice of the incredible climate movement. ""We are so proud of the young people and ashamed we haven't taken action sooner."" But she says other parties need to ""catch up"" and is unhappy more time wasn't given to the issue in the main Johnson-Corbyn debate. Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson faced off on ITV in the first head-to-head debate of the election campaign As Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson faced off on ITV, their supporters clashed online. BBC Trending looks more closely. Final question, as with the other leaders is, which other leader would Nigel Farage take into the jungle with him if he had to take part in I'm a Celebrity? ""I'd have to say Boris because he likes a drink and I could sit down with him with
a bottle of something and find out what he really believes in,"" he replies. Q: What do you do personally to help the environment? A: I drive all over the country, I catch a lot of aeroplane flights, I am not a leading example. But I think the UK should start a global initiative on planting trees on a massive scale. Q: Is the political debate now toxic? Yes it is, and there very simple reason why. All through our history, if you lose an election you accept the result. For the first time in our history, senior figures have refused to accept the result, insulting and abusing those who dare to vote for Brexit, and this is what led to this. Q: Will we leave the EU this year? A: We are leaving the EU, and I think we will leave in 2020, but it must not just be Brexit in name only. We look at the big moments from the party leaders' first TV debate in the run-up to the general election.Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Babies and mums died 'amid toxic hospital culture'Staff got dead babies' names wrong and, in one case, referred to a child as ""it"", a leaked report says.Shropshire","Rhiannon Davies campaigned for an independent inquiry after her baby, Kate, died in 2009 Babies and mothers died amid a ""toxic"" culture at a hospital trust stretching back 40 years, a report has said. The catalogue of maternity care failings at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust are contained in a reportleaked to The Independent,external. It reveals that some children were left disabled, staff got the names of some dead babies wrong and, in one case, referred to a child as ""it"". The trust apologised and said ""a lot"" had been done to address concerns. What do we know about the review? In 2017,then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced an investigationinto avoidable baby deaths at the trust, which runs Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal. It is being led by maternity expert Donna Ockenden, who authored the report for NHS Improvement. The trust runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital in Telford Its initial scope was to examine 23 cases but this has now grown tomore than 270, covering the period from 1979 to the present day. The cases include 22 stillbirths, three deaths during pregnancy, 17 deaths of babies after birth, three deaths of mothers, 47 cases of substandard care and 51 cases of cerebral palsy or brain damage. The interim report said the number of cases it is now being asked to review ""seems to represent a longstanding culture at this trust that is toxic to improvement effort"". The report details the issues experienced by affected families, including: Babies left brain-damaged because staff failed to realise labour was going wrong, or from group B strep or meningitis that can often be treated by antibiotics Heartbeats not monitored adequately during labour One father gaining his only feedback on his daughter's death after bumping into a hospital employee at a supermarket Family members being told they would have to leave if they did not ""keep the noise down"" when they were upset following their baby's death A baby girl's shawl, which her mother had planned to bury her in, was lost by staff Multiple families ""where deceased babies are given the wrong names by the trust - frequently in writing"" and ""on occasions referred to a deceased baby as 'it'"" It also points to an inadequate review carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in 2017 and the ""misplaced"" optimism of the regulator in charge in 2007. Donna Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019 Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton,whose baby Kate died in 2009, were among the families who first pushed for the independent inquiry. Ms Davies said she was already aware of many of the issues raised by the report but said she was ""shocked"" by the length of time covered by the report. ""The devastating reality of Kate's avoidable death, that I have to live with, is that she was condemned to her painful death by the culture at SaTH that wilfully refused to learn from earlier cases dating back decades,"" she said. ""That is why I have fought every body and every institution in Kate's name because no other baby will suffer the same harm while I have breath in my body. ""The only way I believe it will stop is if the police or Crown Prosecution Service bring corporate manslaughter charges against the trust."" Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This report will unfortunately only confirm what dozens of families have been telling me since we first highlighted the problems at the trust in 2017. A staggering attitude towards any number of families - dismissing their questions, telling young women who'd just lost a healthy baby not to worry as they'll be pregnant again within the year - showed a wilful disregard to improving healthcare and learning from mistakes. But it would be wrong to simply blame SaTH, culpable as it is. NHS regulators as far back as 2007 drew attention to problems in the maternity unit and then failed to follow-up with any meaningful improvements. The trust has recently appointed a new chief executive - developing a new culture will take an awful lot longer. Det Supt Carl Moore, of West Mercia Police, said the force was liaising with the independent inquiry and awaiting its findings before any criminal proceedings would be considered - in line with protocol in health care settings. Mr Stanton said: ""My feelings are one of huge sorrow, huge sorrow for all the families who have had their lives ripped apart by this trust, by the avoidable death of their child, an avoidable death of a mother or the harm to their child. ""A death at the hands of a trust that has a toxic culture of lying and cover up."" Baby death investigation 'not watered down' Hundreds more cases in baby deaths review Sharon Morris, whose daughter Olivia suffered a brain injury 14 years ago, said she was ""not shocked"" by the findings. In a statement released by Lanyon Bowdler solicitors, she said: ""Every day for the last 14 years we are constantly reminded of the failure by SaTH to help me give birth to healthy twins. ""No amount of money can change things and all we can now hope for is that changes are made to ensure other families don't suffer like we do."" Olivia Morris (centre), pictured with her identical twin Beth and their mother Sharon, suffered a brain injury 14 years ago Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (SaTH) said it had ""not been made aware of any interim report"" and awaited the findings of the full report. Paula Clark, interim chief executive, apologised ""unreservedly"" to the families affected. She added: ""A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases."" However, the report warned lessons were not being learned and staff at the trust were uncommunicative with families. Latest news from the West Midlands Ms Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019. ""This was produced at the request of NHS Improvement and was not meant for publication,"" she said. She said the independent review team was working to meet the family's request for ""one, single, comprehensive"" report covering all cases of serious concern within maternity services at the trust.

Workers under Labour 'will take back control',"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said workers and consumers would ""take back control"" under a new business model if Labour wins the election. In a speech in Westminster, he said company boards would include workers and elected members, giving them greater influence over pay structure. And public sector chief executives would not be allowed to earn more than 20 times someone on the living wage. That would mean a maximum salary of about Â£350,000. The plans were part of an overall vision to create a business model that was not based on the ""unfettered pursuit of profit maximisation"". But, responding to Mr McDonnell's speech, the British Chambers of Commerce said it would be ""misguided to impose a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach"". Labour's economic plan in 10 points Live: Latest from the election campaign trail The shadow chancellor said the relentless pursuit of shareholder value and ""corporate greed"" had been to the detriment of the workers who create that wealth. ""Labour's reforms to how our large businesses and public utilities are governed, owned and regulated and how both workers and consumers are represented will genuinely enable them to take back control,"" he said. Mr McDonnell also announced: Workers would become shareholders in their companies Large companies that don't take adequate steps to tackle climate change would be delisted from the FTSE 100 There would be no windfall tax on oil companies. This is essentially a one-off tax imposed on a company or industry by a government, usually imposed when an industry is perceived to have made excessive or undeserved profits Plans to introduce an Excessive Pay Levy on companies over disparities in pay between senior executives and other employees A requirement for companies to set out their policy for tackling the gender and ethnicity pay gap An overhaul of the UK's system of regulation, including establishing its only regulatory bodies Mr McDonnell said Labour would ""rewrite the rules"" of the business model and ""treat people fairly and with respect"". In the past, he said, workers had ""often been treated as virtual chattels"". He also outlined plans to overhaul the business audit sector to make it more independent because, he said, it was too dominated by the ""big four"" audit companies. ""Under Labour, the big four will not be allowed to operate like a cartel,"" he said. ""At the heart, we believe that every business should be a partnership - between employees, customers, managers and shareholders - for the long-term success of the enterprise. ""Many European countries have more robust systems to secure long-term decision-making than the UK. He adds that, if Labour gains power, it will rewrite the Companies Act ""so that directors have a duty to promote the long-term interests of employees, customers, the environment and the wider public"". Earlier, Mr McDonnell confirmed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Labour was retaining its policy to scrap student tuition fees as a start to overhauling the system of financing tertiary education, including student loans. The government ""must realise that the system is falling apart"", he said, adding: ""Large amounts of that debt is not being paid off and the government is having to write it off."" He added that there ""is an approach that has to be taken that looks at existing debt"". When pressed on whether Labour will cancel student debt, Mr McDonnell added: ""What I'm saying is, it has to be addressed in some form by whoever is in government, because the system - exactly as we predicted - is not working."" Responding, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""We can't trust Jeremy Corbyn with our economy and his plan for two more referendums (on Brexit and Scottish independence) would cause havoc next year. ""Only the Conservatives will get Brexit done and keep our economy strong."" The British Chambers of Commerce said in a statement: ""It's one thing to support employee ownership, stronger corporate governance and a transition to a greener economy, which have had positive impacts on many firms. But it would be misguided to impose a rigid, one-size-fits all approach. ""Getting our economy moving requires serious investment in skills, infrastructure and a reduction in business costs. But extensive government interference in ownership and governance could deter investors and damage confidence."" It said the next government must work more closely with businesses, with success depending on ""partnership, not diktat"". Labour's plans to ""rewrite the rules"" for corporate Britain and refocus big employers on climate change and gender parity on their boards certainly reflect its belief in a more muscular state. But the plans are also quite a departure for British corporations used to dealing with social issues voluntarily, and on the basis of consensus. Threatening to delist companies from the stock exchange on the basis of an insufficient plan to address climate change is a stark new direction. But Labour has also rowed back on one of the most radical policiesannounced by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnelllast year. The Inclusive Ownership Fund still involves taking 1%  year of the share value of listed UK companies and putting that into a pot to distribute to workers, up to 10% after a decade. But a number of refinements have now been made to the plan. Firstly, the shares and the profits distributed to UK workers would now only be based on UK profits alone, not on worldwide profits. Secondly, the amount of money distributed to the Exchequer over and above what goes to workers will be limited to 25%. That partially deals with some of the most acute concerns expressed by the private sector about the ""Â£300bn expropriation"" of shares. Dan Neidle, the City lawyer who calculated that figure, now says that limiting it to UK profits, roughly halves that number. In addition, the share of the funds that could go to the Exchequer is now limited to 25%, rather than 90% calculated for the original policy. All the Exchequer funding would go to apprenticeships in skills to help alleviate climate change. The net result is that Labour now calculate the policy as raising Â£2bn a year for workers and Â£700m a year for apprenticeships by 2024. While these are significant sums, in context they are equivalent to raising corporation tax by 0.5%. The CBI said Labour's shift showed it had ""started to listen"" but the effect ""remained severe"" for those companies affected. Labour itself denied it had reined in the policy but acknowledged it had ""listened to concerns"".

Sturgeon brands Johnson 'scaredy-cat' over debates,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Boris Johnson 'terrified' to debate me Nicola Sturgeon has branded Prime Minister Boris Johnson a ""scaredy-cat"" after he said he would never face her on a televised debate. Ms Sturgeon, the SNP leader, has been excluded from Tuesday evening's ITV debate between Mr Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Johnson said ahead of the debate that he would only debate with ""serious candidates"" to become prime minister. But Ms Sturgeon said she was willing to face the PM ""any time, any place"". A joint legal challenge by the SNP and Liberal Democrats to be included in the ITV debate was rejected by the High Court on Monday. Speaking tonewspaper reporters after the decision,external, Mr Johnson accepted that the SNP could be ""very influential"" in British politics. But he said he would only agree to debate Ms Sturgeon if she ""takes leadership of her party in Parliament and is a serious contender to be prime minister of the UK"". Johnson and Corbyn to face off in election debate Live coverage of the TV debate Lib Dems and SNP lose ITV debate legal challenge Mr Johnson added: ""The candidate to be prime minister who Nicola Sturgeon would support is Jeremy Corbyn and that is why he is the appropriate person (to debate)"". Ms Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister and is not standing to become an MP, argued that a debate between the Labour and Tory leaders does not reflect the choice Scottish voters facer at the general election on 12 December. She said: ""The SNP is the biggest party in Scotland, the third-biggest party at Westminster, we could hold the balance of power after this election. ""Our views should be heard, and indeed scrutinised, in this debate and it's deeply regrettable that won't happen."" The prime minister visited a boxing gym ahead of the ITV debate Asked about Mr Johnson's comments that he would not debate her, Ms Sturgeon said: ""He seems to be a big scaredy-cat. ""I remember when he came to Bute House in the summer and was getting into a debate about independence with me - privately I suggested to him then that we should take it to the public sphere and have a debate in public about that. ""He seemed to be up for that at the time, so I can't really throw any light on what has changed his mind."" Ms Sturgeon said it ""spoke volumes"" that Mr Johnson was only willing to go head-to-head with Mr Corbyn, adding: ""I'll put down a challenge to him right now: I'll debate him any time, any place. ""So come on Boris, stop being so scared."" Ms Sturgeon was speaking during a campaign visit to a trampoline activity centre in Stirling, where she repeated her call for Scotland to be given more powers over immigration policy in order to help grow its economy. Mr Corbyn was greeted by supporters as he arrived for the TV debate in Salford As he arrived ahead of the debate, Mr Corbyn said he hoped it would be ""respectful and informative"", and that he would use it to outline how Labour's policies could ""transform this country"". But the Liberal Democrats have said it is ""outrageous that the Remain voice is missing"" from the debate. The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

Chip shop owner cleared of murdering wife,"Geoffrey Bran left court with his daughter Rhiannon A chip shop owner accused of killing his wife by throwing boiling oil over her has been cleared of her murder. Geoffrey Bran, 71, who ran The Chipoteria in Hermon, Carmarthenshire, had told police his wife Mavis slipped and pulled a deep fat fryer over herself. Mrs Bran, 69, died in hospital six days after receiving burns to 46% of her body on 23 October 2018. He was cleared after five hours of jury deliberations at Swansea Crown Court. Mrs Bran had told friends in the weeks before her death that shefeared her husband would kill her, the jury had heard. This video can not be played Geoffrey Bran's family ask to be left to 'grieve properly' A statement read by Mr Bran's granddaughter outside court thanked people for their support, adding: ""Family, friends, and our legal team who have shown great compassion, professionalism and positivity over this trying time. ""The loss of Mavis has left the family devastated and we ask that we are left now to get on with our lives and grieve properly without further intrusion."" Mrs Bran's family said: ""We as a family would like to say a big thank you to everyone for all the support we have received after the loss of our beautiful, loving sister Mavis, who lost her life in such a tragic way doing the job she loved. ""She was the matriarch of the family and is missed every day. ""Now that the court case is over and we finally have closure, we can rebuild our lives as a family, remembering Mavis as the fun-loving person that she was."" Mavis Bran died six days after hot oil went over her at her chip shop The trial was told the couple, who had been married for more than 30 years, had a volatile relationship with arguments and swearing and it deteriorated over the last few months of Mrs Bran's life. The prosecution argued Mr Bran had thrown the oil at his wife after an argument over some burnt fish, but he told the jury sheaccidentally pulled it over herselfafter she slipped and fell. The week-long trial heard Mrs Bran was a heavy drinker and was over the legal drink-drive limit for alcohol on the day of the incident. After Mrs Bran was injured, the court was told she went into their house, which is next to the chip shop cabin, but Mr Bran did not assist her or call an ambulance and continued to serve customers. The couple ran The Chipoteria in Carmarthenshire, one of a number of businesses they owned Mrs Bran called a friend, Caroline Morgan, telling her: ""Geoff has thrown boiling oil over me, help me, help me, get here now.

Families 'devastated' by rail workers' deaths,"This video can not be played Gareth Delbridge's son-in-law calls for changes to rail line working conditions Families of two rail workers who died after being hit by a train have said every day is ""a living nightmare"". They want changes in rail line working conditions after Gareth Delbridge, 64, and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis, 58,were killed by a passenger train on 3 Julynear Margam in Port Talbot. Mr Delbridge's son-in-law Adrian Grant said the families were awaiting the conclusions of three inquiries. An initial report saidthere was ""no safe system in place"". Early investigations found Mr Delbridge, from Kenfig Hill, Bridgend, and Mr Lewis, from nearby North Cornelly,had been using a tool with a petrol engine and wearing ear defenders, meaning they did not hear the train, which was travelling from Swansea to London Paddington. A third worker was treated for shock but was not injured. Gareth Delbridge (L) and Michael Lewis (R) were hit by a train in July Network Rail and Great Western Railway's initial report said six staff were working on the line and separated of their own accord into groups of three and this meant there was no official lookout. Mr Grant, 54, from Porthcawl, said the bereaved families believed the men would have never jeopardised their safety and called on Network Rail to change working conditions for staff on the railway lines. Rail death families 'overwhelmed' by support Rail worker killed by train 'loved by everyone' Rail worker deaths prompt Â£70m safety task force Network Rail safety director Martin Frobisher said it was continuing its investigations and ""nothing will lessen the pain, but understanding what went wrong and learning from that will"". Mr Grant said the deaths had ""devastated both families"". ""Every day is a living nightmare at the moment and a challenge,"" he added. Michael Lewis and wife Dawn had been married for 35 years Mr Grant said: ""I understand that something went tragically wrong that day and I'm in a firm frame of mind that when you send people off to work, especially two people with all that experience of the rail, you expect them to come home. ""Both of these guys had worked on the rail for over 40 years with fantastic exemplary records of safety and - for them not to come home - something has gone tragically wrong. ""We will campaign hard to make sure this doesn't go away until things are changed."" Three official investigations have been launched by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and British Transport Police. Mr Delbridge had been married to wife Carol for 44 years and they had three children, seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren The Network Rail and Great Western Railway report said the men had been instructed to work on freeing, oiling and retightening bolts by the unofficial person in charge, who was also to act as a lookout. There was a problem with a bolt, meaning the lookout became involved in the rail work and suggested putting further oil on the bolt, despite being instructed to remain in a position of safety. It also said groups should be about 20 yards (18m) apart during work, but the workers split and were 150 yards (137m) apart. Mr Grant said: ""This was work they would always do. It was tools they would always use. ""The only thing we know [is] the work had changed and moved around quite a bit that day and, obviously, that's what the independent investigations at this time are looking into whether that had an impact on what happened or not."" Mr Grant said: ""Network Rail say they are carrying out aÂ£70m campaignto stop accidents happening like this. ""But they've tried this before but I'm hoping this time - from the findings of these three investigations - changes will happen... and we will see results from this investment rather than just words on paper."" Mr Frobisher said: ""The whole railway family shares the loss of Gareth Delbridge and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis. ""We have shared our initial investigation into what happened and are continuing our investigation into the root causes before we make recommendations for our organisation and all of our people for the future."" The company said the majority of its work was carried out on ""closed track"", where no trains run. ""Whether the train lines are open or closed, clear plans, roles and responsibilities are essential and no work should be done on the railway without a safe system of work plan, which is briefed to everyone in the team before they go on to the track to work,"" it said. 'No safe system in place' when rail workers killed Rail death families 'overwhelmed' by support Rail worker deaths prompt Â£70m safety task force Specialists drafted to investigate two rail deaths Rail worker killed by train 'loved by everyone' British Transport Police Great Western Railway Network Rail Office of Rail and Road Rail Accident Investigation Branch LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Baby death review: What do we know?,"Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust was placed in special measures in November 2018 Two troubled hospitals are at the centre of a baby deaths scandal dating back more than 40 years. Hundreds of cases are being looked at, amid a review into claims children, and mothers, died or were permanently harmed by care failures at Telford's Princess Royal and the Royal Shrewsbury hospitals. Although not all the cases relate to deaths or serious harm, many are alleging significant errors, according to the BBC's Michael Buchanan. Tasha Turner and partner Jacob's baby Esmai died in 2013 at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital In April 2017, then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced an investigation into a ""cluster"" of avoidable baby deaths at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, which runs both hospitals. The review was initially focused on 23 cases in which maternity failings were alleged. In August 2018, its scope was expanded to look at 40 cases between 1998 and 2017, then later to 100. The figure has now grown tomore than 1,000, covering the period from 1979 to the present day. The trust said it was co-operating fully with the review, which is being led by midwife Donna Ockenden. Its findings are expected to be published by the end of 2020. Dr Bill Kirkup, who led theinquiry into the Morecambe Bay scandal, says the details revealed so far in Shrewsbury and Telford suggests the failures might be more widespread in the NHS. This video can not be played Jack Burn died hours after being born at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford In some cases, which have previously been reported, failures to properly monitor foetal heart rates and delays in deliveries were found to have contributed. Out of seven avoidable deaths between September 2014 and May 2016, failure to properly monitor heart rateswas found to be a contributory factor in five, the BBC discovered. One such case involved Kelly Jones, whose twin girls were stillborn at the Royal Shrewsbury in 2014. She said she had beenignored by staff despite repeatedly telling them she felt pain during pregnancy. The trust admitted her daughters' deaths from oxygen starvation to the brain had been contributed to by ""delay in recognising deterioration in the foetal heart traces and the missed opportunities for earlier delivery"". A further report found the 2009 death of Kate Stanton-Davies at six hours old could also have been avoided afterwarnings of potential complications were missed. The trust said it had ""failed to meet the high standards we set for all of our patients"". It has sincepaid out millions of pounds in compensationto families of babies born with brain injuries. One firm handling claims said it was ""repeatedly seeing the same errors - failures in relation to heart trace monitoring and realising the baby is in distress, delays in taking women for an emergency caesarean and issues with the wrong use of forceps"". Aleaked interim reporthas also described some of the experiences of families, including babies left brain-damaged because staff failed to realise labour was going wrong, staff getting the names of some dead babies wrong and, in one case, referring to a child as ""it"". The inquiry's initial scope was to examine 23 cases but this has now grown to more than 1,000, covering the period from 1979 to the present day As well as the midwife-led, independent review into alleged maternity errors, the trust in charge of both hospitals has also been placed in special measures, in part due to its maternity units. It has faced criticism from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), whose inspectors assess the standard of services provided by a hospital. However, a CQC visit in November 2019 found maternity staffing had increased and morale and governance had improved. Back in October 2018, inspectors were so alarmed by what they saw on the trust's maternity and emergency wards in Shropshirethey ordered bosses to submit weekly status reports. A few weeks later, the trust received its third CQC warning in four months - highlighting staffing concerns in certain critical care and emergency areas. Two days after that, the trust was placed in special measures - meaning it was no longer trusted to run itself alone. Unusually, the decision was taken by health service bosses before the CQC had made a recommendation to do so. NHS Improvement said it had identified a number of ""challenges"" which could threaten patient safety, including governance, staffing, urgent and maternity care and whistle-blowing issues. The CQC said it would have been likely to recommend special measures, as it believed the trust would be unable to improve ""without external support"". In May 2019,""further urgent action"" was taken by the CQC, amid safety concerns over emergency and maternity services. Donna Ockenden's findings are expected to be published by the end of 2020 The trust will receive ""enhanced support"", including additional funding, while in special measures, NHS Improvement said. The trust is usually re-inspected by the CQC within 12 months of going into special measures, but this can be sooner if there are ""significant concerns about quality"", or if there is ""enough evidence of good progress"", the watchdog said. If inspectors feel a trust has made enough progress, they will recommend it is taken out of special measures. Where there has been insufficient progress, the CQC will consult with NHS Improvement to decide whether further action is needed. At the release of the leaked report, Ms Ockenden said families had told her they wanted one, single, comprehensive independent report covering all known cases of potentially serious concern within maternity services at the trust, with she and her review team working hard to achieve this. There is another factor. In June 2020, West Mercia Police confirmed it was exploring whether to bring a criminal case against either the trust or staff in connection with maternity care. As it investigated whether there was evidence to begin proceedings, the force encouraged anyone with information to make contact.

Johnson and Corbyn arrive for election debate,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn locked horns over the NHS, Brexit and the Royal Family Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over Brexit in the first TV election debate of the campaign. Mr Johnson promised to ""end this national misery"" and said Labour offered ""only division and deadlock"". Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""get Brexit sorted by giving you, the people, the final say"". An average audience of 6.7m people watched the leaders lock horns over the NHS, trust and leadership, the future of Scotland - and the Royal Family. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear if either men had won or lost the debate but it was striking how the audience had been ready to laugh at their statements. A snap YouGov poll suggested the public were evenly split on who had won the debate, ""with most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won"". Tories criticised over 'factcheckUK' rebranding Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked How did the election debate play out online? Five things from the debate Reaction after Johnson and Corbyn go head-to-head Meanwhile, the Conservativesreceived criticismfor rebranding one of their Twitter accounts as ""factcheckUK"" during the debate. Will Moy, the chief executive of fact-checking website Full Fact, accused the party of trying to ""mislead"" voters and said Twitter ""could have acted sooner,"" including by forcibly renaming the account. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the move, saying it offered an ""instant rebuttal mechanism"" against ""nonsense thrown at the Conservatives"". The Electoral Commission said voters were entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners. It said it has no role in regulating campaign content but urged parties to ""undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""not impressed at all"" by the debate and said neither man was ""fit"" to be prime minister. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson dismissed the performances of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn as ""bluster and diversion from both of them"". Green Party co-leader Sian Berry expressed dismay at the ""climate chaos"" issue being ""relegated to the quickfire round in that debate"". And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Corbyn was the ""better debater"" but criticised him for not saying if he would Leave or Remain in a future referendum. The Lib Dems and SNP lost a court challengeto ITV's decision not to include their party leaders in the debate. The first half of the debate was dominated by questions on Brexit. Mr Johnson wants to win a majority in 12 December's general election so he can get the Brexit deal he struck with the EU into law and take the UK out of the bloc 31 January and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. Mr Corbyn says he would tear up Mr Johnson's agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU, with a customs union and a closer relationship with the single market, which he would then put to a public vote. A row broke out over the Labour leader's claim that US health firms will be given access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal. This video can not be played Moment Corbyn produces 'NHS dossier' Mr Corbyn told the PM: ""You are going to sell our National Health Service out to the United States and Big Pharma."" He held up redacted accounts of ""a series of secret meetings"" with the US, in which the government proposed ""full market access for US products to our NHS."" In response, Mr Johnson said the claims were ""an absolute invention"" and that there were ""no circumstances whatever in which this government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."" With Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. Read Laura's full blog The two leaders then clashed over whether Brexit put the future of the union between England and Scotland at risk. Mr Johnson claimed Labour would agree to another referendum on Scotland to get the support of the SNP and that isn't a price he would be willing to pay. But Mr Corbyn called the PM's comments ""nonsense"" and insisted his party would not form a coalition between with the SNP. Asked about the issue of trust, Mr Johnson said a toxic atmosphere in politics had been caused by MPs ""repeatedly refusing to honour the referendum"". The Labour leader said ""trust is something that has to be earned and as a public representative you have to listen"". He said his style of leadership was to ""listen to people and try to bring consensus"". Asked by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham if they would ""make a gesture"" to change the tone of the debate, the pair shook hands. Some audience members laughed at Mr Johnson's statement on trust, while others laughed at Mr Corbyn's statements on a Labour's proposal for a reduced working week and his party's Brexit stance. This video can not be played The two leaders had differing views on the monarchy On health, both men praised the NHS, with Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson describing it as ""one of the most civilised things about this country"" and ""one of the single most beautiful and brilliant things about Britain"" respectively. However they quickly differed over NHS management. Mr Corbyn called for an ""end to privatisation"" of services.  Mr Johnson insisted his party was not privatising the NHS. Asked if the monarchy was ""fit for purpose"", Mr Corbyn replied: ""Needs a bit of improvement."" Mr Johnson said: ""The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."" Asked if the Duke of York Prince Andrew was ""fit for the purpose"" following criticism over his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Mr Corbyn said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered"" adding ""nobody should be above the law"". Mr Johnson said ""The law must certainly take its course."" The final question pushed the leaders to say what Christmas present they would give each other. Mr Corbyn said he would get the PM a copy of Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ""and then he can understand how nasty Scrooge was"". Mr Johnson initially said he would buy the Labour leader ""a copy of my brilliant Brexit deal"" but when pushed to give a ""non-political answer"" he said he would get ""some damson jam"". Following the head-to-head between the Labour and Conservative leaders, the leaders of the Brexit Party, Greens, Lib Dems and SNP were interviewed separately on ITV. During her interview, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson emphasised her party's opposition to Brexit and said she could offer the country a ""better future"" than ""those two tired old parties"". She also said her party had plans for a frequent flyer tax to help combat climate change. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland's future"" and promised voters that her party would ensure people ""escape the chaos of Brexit"". She also insisted ""no deal has been done"" to form a coalition with the Labour Party in the event of a hung Parliament. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the current political system ""broken, rotten and corrupt"" and said he would change the voting system and scrap the House of Lords. Last up was Green Party co-leader Sian Berry, who accused Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson of failing properly to address climate change, which she said would leave young people feeling ""let down"". The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

"Babies and mums died 'amid toxic hospital culture'Staff got dead babies' names wrong and, in one case, referred to a child as ""it"", a leaked report says.","Rhiannon Davies campaigned for an independent inquiry after her baby, Kate, died in 2009 Babies and mothers died amid a ""toxic"" culture at a hospital trust stretching back 40 years, a report has said. The catalogue of maternity care failings at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust are contained in a reportleaked to The Independent,external. It reveals that some children were left disabled, staff got the names of some dead babies wrong and, in one case, referred to a child as ""it"". The trust apologised and said ""a lot"" had been done to address concerns. What do we know about the review? In 2017,then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced an investigationinto avoidable baby deaths at the trust, which runs Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal. It is being led by maternity expert Donna Ockenden, who authored the report for NHS Improvement. The trust runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital in Telford Its initial scope was to examine 23 cases but this has now grown tomore than 270, covering the period from 1979 to the present day. The cases include 22 stillbirths, three deaths during pregnancy, 17 deaths of babies after birth, three deaths of mothers, 47 cases of substandard care and 51 cases of cerebral palsy or brain damage. The interim report said the number of cases it is now being asked to review ""seems to represent a longstanding culture at this trust that is toxic to improvement effort"". The report details the issues experienced by affected families, including: Babies left brain-damaged because staff failed to realise labour was going wrong, or from group B strep or meningitis that can often be treated by antibiotics Heartbeats not monitored adequately during labour One father gaining his only feedback on his daughter's death after bumping into a hospital employee at a supermarket Family members being told they would have to leave if they did not ""keep the noise down"" when they were upset following their baby's death A baby girl's shawl, which her mother had planned to bury her in, was lost by staff Multiple families ""where deceased babies are given the wrong names by the trust - frequently in writing"" and ""on occasions referred to a deceased baby as 'it'"" It also points to an inadequate review carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in 2017 and the ""misplaced"" optimism of the regulator in charge in 2007. Donna Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019 Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton,whose baby Kate died in 2009, were among the families who first pushed for the independent inquiry. Ms Davies said she was already aware of many of the issues raised by the report but said she was ""shocked"" by the length of time covered by the report. ""The devastating reality of Kate's avoidable death, that I have to live with, is that she was condemned to her painful death by the culture at SaTH that wilfully refused to learn from earlier cases dating back decades,"" she said. ""That is why I have fought every body and every institution in Kate's name because no other baby will suffer the same harm while I have breath in my body. ""The only way I believe it will stop is if the police or Crown Prosecution Service bring corporate manslaughter charges against the trust."" Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This report will unfortunately only confirm what dozens of families have been telling me since we first highlighted the problems at the trust in 2017. A staggering attitude towards any number of families - dismissing their questions, telling young women who'd just lost a healthy baby not to worry as they'll be pregnant again within the year - showed a wilful disregard to improving healthcare and learning from mistakes. But it would be wrong to simply blame SaTH, culpable as it is. NHS regulators as far back as 2007 drew attention to problems in the maternity unit and then failed to follow-up with any meaningful improvements. The trust has recently appointed a new chief executive - developing a new culture will take an awful lot longer. Det Supt Carl Moore, of West Mercia Police, said the force was liaising with the independent inquiry and awaiting its findings before any criminal proceedings would be considered - in line with protocol in health care settings. Mr Stanton said: ""My feelings are one of huge sorrow, huge sorrow for all the families who have had their lives ripped apart by this trust, by the avoidable death of their child, an avoidable death of a mother or the harm to their child. ""A death at the hands of a trust that has a toxic culture of lying and cover up."" Baby death investigation 'not watered down' Hundreds more cases in baby deaths review Sharon Morris, whose daughter Olivia suffered a brain injury 14 years ago, said she was ""not shocked"" by the findings. In a statement released by Lanyon Bowdler solicitors, she said: ""Every day for the last 14 years we are constantly reminded of the failure by SaTH to help me give birth to healthy twins. ""No amount of money can change things and all we can now hope for is that changes are made to ensure other families don't suffer like we do."" Olivia Morris (centre), pictured with her identical twin Beth and their mother Sharon, suffered a brain injury 14 years ago Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (SaTH) said it had ""not been made aware of any interim report"" and awaited the findings of the full report. Paula Clark, interim chief executive, apologised ""unreservedly"" to the families affected. She added: ""A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases."" However, the report warned lessons were not being learned and staff at the trust were uncommunicative with families. Latest news from the West Midlands Ms Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019. ""This was produced at the request of NHS Improvement and was not meant for publication,"" she said. She said the independent review team was working to meet the family's request for ""one, single, comprehensive"" report covering all cases of serious concern within maternity services at the trust.

Stowaways found in cold container bound for UKAt least 26 stowaways are found in a refrigerated container on a ferry bound to the UK from the Netherlands.Europe,"Two of the people found on the ferry were taken to hospital for treatment Police in the Netherlands have arrested a Romanian lorry driver after 25 stowaways were found in a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for the UK. They were found at around 19:00 (18:00 GMT), forcing the ship to return to the port of Vlaardingen near Rotterdam. The Danish-registered ferry had been en route to Felixstowe. The incident comes just weeks after the bodies of 39 people were found in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex in eastern England. The stowaways found on Tuesday received medical attention at the port of Vlaardingen, where police were waiting for the ship's arrival. Two were taken to hospital to receive extra medical care, while the other 23 people were transferred to a police facility after a medical check-up, authorities said. Essex lorry deaths: Who are the victims? Essex lorry deaths: What we know The stowaways, whose nationalities have not yet been confirmed, were found in a refrigerated container on a lorry on board the ferry, authorities said. The driver of the lorry was detained and was being questioned over possible involvement, police told the Dutch broadcaster NOS. Police told the broadcast that crew members found the stowaways and alerted authorities after hearing ""sounds coming from the cooling container"". A search of the ferry involving police dogs was carried out but no-one else was found. Seafarers' charity Stella Maris said it was important to recognise the ""hugely stressful"" nature of these types of incidents for crew. The bodies found in the Essex container last month were those of Vietnamese nationals who had arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Two lorry drivers have since been charged with manslaughter, and several other men have been arrested in connection with the case.

Old age: Why 70 may be the new 65,"It may be time to rethink how we measure and define old age in the UK because more people are surviving into their late 80s and beyond, say experts. TheOffice for National Statistics,externalteam says although 65 has traditionally been seen as the start of old age, 70 could be seen as the ""new 65"". That's because many people who reach this milestone birthday can still expect to live another 15 years. Remaining life expectancy may be a better marker of old age, they say. Traditionally, 65 has been taken as the entry point into old age. For decades it has been the official retirement age for men when they can start drawing their state pension. But working patterns are shifting and the pension age is rising for both men and women - it will reach 66 in 2020 and 67 by 2028. The ONS team says people are living longer, healthier lives. That means we should consider the years people have ahead of them, not just chronological age when deciding what ""old"" looks like. The ONS Centre for Ageing and Demography team looked back at population data on health and life expectancy to compare trends over time. If you take the measure of 15 years of life remaining, the average age that a person will hit this point has changed over the last century. In 1951 men and women around the age of 60 could expect to live another 15 years. By the 1990s it had shifted to 65 and currently it's 70-year-olds who can expect another 15 years of life. In 2057, experts predict this average age will rise again to 75. The population's life expectancy has increased over the centuries thanks to improvements in healthcare and living conditions. But are these extra years enjoyed in good health? Is it fair to shift the milestone of old age from 65 to 70? Health by chronological (birthday) age has improved over time. But changes in health by prospective age (how much time you have left to live) have declined in some cases and improved in others. By the researchers' calculations, levels of poor general health for women aged 70 in 2017 were around the same as for those aged 60 in 1981, while levels of longstanding illness were similar for women aged around 64. For men, levels of poor general health at age 70 in 2017 were around the same as for those aged 65 in 1997, while levels of limiting longstanding illness were similar for those around age 57. So, at a population level, it would seem fair to label 70 as the new 65 (or perhaps even younger), even taking health into account. Libby Webb, senior research manager at Age UK, said: ""People at age 70 now have the same life expectancy and similar health to people aged 65 in the past so, on average, we are definitely seeing people doing better than they did in the past."" But she said most people still experienced a period of poor health at the end of their lives. ""What we are not seeing is that period getting shorter."" She said improved life expectancy meant there were now more ""very old"" people with quite complex care needs and that health inequalities between the richest and poorest remain. But she said an ageing society should not be viewed as negative. ""We know that older people make really important contributions to our society both through their paid work and through their caring responsibilities and volunteering. ""Age is just a number and for different people it means different things.""

"Sweden drops Assange rape investigationProsecutors drop a rape inquiry into Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is in custody in the UK.Europe","This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Prosecutors in Sweden have dropped an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010. Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. The 48-year-old Australian was evicted in April and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline of saga The Swedish investigation had been shelved in 2017 but wasre-opened earlier this year following his eviction from the embassy. Separately, the US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010. Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson took the decision to ""discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange"", the Swedish Prosecution Authority said. ""The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,"" it added. Eva-Marie Persson said the decision had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses Ms Persson said: ""I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. ""Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation."" This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Prosecutors told reporters the decision to drop the inquiry had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses in the case. Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent With the end of Julian Assange's legal troubles in Sweden, one long chapter in the saga is over. But another one, in the United States, has barely begun. The Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police. Now Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail. From behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US. Assange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual. He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out. There was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation. Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: ""Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment."" Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,external. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a lengthy prison term. How likely is an Assange conviction in US? In June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US. Assange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London Assange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term. Buta judge ruled that Assange should remain in jailuntil his extradition hearing because of his ""history of absconding"". Last month,a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London in February.

Johnson pledges to extend stop and search powers,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the move will deter people from getting back to ""the life of crime"" The police will be given ""greater freedoms"" to use stop and search on those known to have carried knives in the past, Boris Johnson has pledged. Stop and search powers have proved controversial  - and there is evidence that black people are disproportionately targeted. But the government has previously said they work and ""empower"" the police. Mr Johnson plans to speed up charging and prosecuting knife offenders as well, if the Tories win the election. Responding to the Tory leader's announcement, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Tinkering with police powers cannot disguise Tory failure for almost a decade. ""Johnson supported Tory cuts to the police and has no plans to restore the frontline officers that successive Tory governments have axed - just as he never did make good on his promise to recruit 'thousands of extra police' as London Mayor."" She said the Conservatives did not ""intend to do anything about the youth services they cut, or the funding for drug prevention or the increase in school exclusions that have all contributed to rising crime"". LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail What is knife crime like in your area? The key facts about rising knife crime Does stop and search solve crime? Knife crime remains at historically high levels across England and Wales and crime, more broadly, is a key concern among voters so the Conservatives' plans come as little surprise. Speeding up court proceedings in knife possession cases is a largely uncontroversial idea but will take a huge effort across all parts of the criminal justice system to make it happen. More contentious is the proposal to further increase stop and search powers at a time when police stops are on the rise after years of decline. Although police chiefs are convinced stop and search is effective, the research is inconclusive and the disproportionate use of the tactic against young black men has been blamed for fuelling tensions. The Tories' proposal to allow officers to search anyone previously cautioned or convicted for carrying a knife, without the need to have grounds to do so, is likely to be hotly contested. Speaking at a boxing ring in Manchester, Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""come down hard"" on the ""scourge"" of knife crime. Talking about his plans to extend stop and search to those with a previous conviction for carrying a knife, he said: ""We think that that will deter young people who have been convicted of carrying from getting back involved in that kind of life again."" This video can not be played Stop and search is a tactic used by police to crack down on crime Currently police officers are allowed to stop and search individuals if they have reason to suspect serious violence may take place. Speaking in August, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Stop and search works - we hear again and again from police that [they] need to be empowered."" But Ms Abbott said the powers did not reduce violent crime. Mr Johnson also said his government would be ""speeding up prosecutions to make sure the threat of being caught is always an effective deterrent"". Under his proposals, someone caught unlawfully with a knife would be arrested and charged within 24 hours - and appear in court within a week. The Conservatives say this would be three times faster than the current average. BBC home affairs journalist Gaetan Portal says although the current average time from offence to charge is 40 days, the median time - arguably a more representative measure - is just one day. The current median time between someone being charged with an offence and appearing in court is 17 days. Our Reality Check team says decreasing this time will require investment in the criminal justice system. Mr Johnson also said the solution lay in ""wrapping your arms around the kids and putting them on the right tracks in their lives"". He reiterated a previous pledge to boost funding for violence reduction units by Â£35m in 2020. These units tackle knife crime by involving multiple public service providers on early intervention projects. Thismethod of reducing knife crime was first tried in Scotlandin 2005.

Workers under Labour 'will take back control'John McDonnell also says there would be a cap on chief executives' pay in the public sector.,"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said workers and consumers would ""take back control"" under a new business model if Labour wins the election. In a speech in Westminster, he said company boards would include workers and elected members, giving them greater influence over pay structure. And public sector chief executives would not be allowed to earn more than 20 times someone on the living wage. That would mean a maximum salary of about Â£350,000. The plans were part of an overall vision to create a business model that was not based on the ""unfettered pursuit of profit maximisation"". But, responding to Mr McDonnell's speech, the British Chambers of Commerce said it would be ""misguided to impose a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach"". Labour's economic plan in 10 points Live: Latest from the election campaign trail The shadow chancellor said the relentless pursuit of shareholder value and ""corporate greed"" had been to the detriment of the workers who create that wealth. ""Labour's reforms to how our large businesses and public utilities are governed, owned and regulated and how both workers and consumers are represented will genuinely enable them to take back control,"" he said. Mr McDonnell also announced: Workers would become shareholders in their companies Large companies that don't take adequate steps to tackle climate change would be delisted from the FTSE 100 There would be no windfall tax on oil companies. This is essentially a one-off tax imposed on a company or industry by a government, usually imposed when an industry is perceived to have made excessive or undeserved profits Plans to introduce an Excessive Pay Levy on companies over disparities in pay between senior executives and other employees A requirement for companies to set out their policy for tackling the gender and ethnicity pay gap An overhaul of the UK's system of regulation, including establishing its only regulatory bodies Mr McDonnell said Labour would ""rewrite the rules"" of the business model and ""treat people fairly and with respect"". In the past, he said, workers had ""often been treated as virtual chattels"". He also outlined plans to overhaul the business audit sector to make it more independent because, he said, it was too dominated by the ""big four"" audit companies. ""Under Labour, the big four will not be allowed to operate like a cartel,"" he said. ""At the heart, we believe that every business should be a partnership - between employees, customers, managers and shareholders - for the long-term success of the enterprise. ""Many European countries have more robust systems to secure long-term decision-making than the UK. He adds that, if Labour gains power, it will rewrite the Companies Act ""so that directors have a duty to promote the long-term interests of employees, customers, the environment and the wider public"". Earlier, Mr McDonnell confirmed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Labour was retaining its policy to scrap student tuition fees as a start to overhauling the system of financing tertiary education, including student loans. The government ""must realise that the system is falling apart"", he said, adding: ""Large amounts of that debt is not being paid off and the government is having to write it off."" He added that there ""is an approach that has to be taken that looks at existing debt"". When pressed on whether Labour will cancel student debt, Mr McDonnell added: ""What I'm saying is, it has to be addressed in some form by whoever is in government, because the system - exactly as we predicted - is not working."" Responding, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""We can't trust Jeremy Corbyn with our economy and his plan for two more referendums (on Brexit and Scottish independence) would cause havoc next year. ""Only the Conservatives will get Brexit done and keep our economy strong."" The British Chambers of Commerce said in a statement: ""It's one thing to support employee ownership, stronger corporate governance and a transition to a greener economy, which have had positive impacts on many firms. But it would be misguided to impose a rigid, one-size-fits all approach. ""Getting our economy moving requires serious investment in skills, infrastructure and a reduction in business costs. But extensive government interference in ownership and governance could deter investors and damage confidence."" It said the next government must work more closely with businesses, with success depending on ""partnership, not diktat"". Labour's plans to ""rewrite the rules"" for corporate Britain and refocus big employers on climate change and gender parity on their boards certainly reflect its belief in a more muscular state. But the plans are also quite a departure for British corporations used to dealing with social issues voluntarily, and on the basis of consensus. Threatening to delist companies from the stock exchange on the basis of an insufficient plan to address climate change is a stark new direction. But Labour has also rowed back on one of the most radical policiesannounced by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnelllast year. The Inclusive Ownership Fund still involves taking 1%  year of the share value of listed UK companies and putting that into a pot to distribute to workers, up to 10% after a decade. But a number of refinements have now been made to the plan. Firstly, the shares and the profits distributed to UK workers would now only be based on UK profits alone, not on worldwide profits. Secondly, the amount of money distributed to the Exchequer over and above what goes to workers will be limited to 25%. That partially deals with some of the most acute concerns expressed by the private sector about the ""Â£300bn expropriation"" of shares. Dan Neidle, the City lawyer who calculated that figure, now says that limiting it to UK profits, roughly halves that number. In addition, the share of the funds that could go to the Exchequer is now limited to 25%, rather than 90% calculated for the original policy. All the Exchequer funding would go to apprenticeships in skills to help alleviate climate change. The net result is that Labour now calculate the policy as raising Â£2bn a year for workers and Â£700m a year for apprenticeships by 2024. While these are significant sums, in context they are equivalent to raising corporation tax by 0.5%. The CBI said Labour's shift showed it had ""started to listen"" but the effect ""remained severe"" for those companies affected. Labour itself denied it had reined in the policy but acknowledged it had ""listened to concerns"".

Johnson and Corbyn to face off in election debateIt comes after the Lib Dems and SNP lost their legal challenge to be included in the ITV programme.Election 2019Comments,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn locked horns over the NHS, Brexit and the Royal Family Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over Brexit in the first TV election debate of the campaign. Mr Johnson promised to ""end this national misery"" and said Labour offered ""only division and deadlock"". Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""get Brexit sorted by giving you, the people, the final say"". An average audience of 6.7m people watched the leaders lock horns over the NHS, trust and leadership, the future of Scotland - and the Royal Family. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear if either men had won or lost the debate but it was striking how the audience had been ready to laugh at their statements. A snap YouGov poll suggested the public were evenly split on who had won the debate, ""with most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won"". Tories criticised over 'factcheckUK' rebranding Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked How did the election debate play out online? Five things from the debate Reaction after Johnson and Corbyn go head-to-head Meanwhile, the Conservativesreceived criticismfor rebranding one of their Twitter accounts as ""factcheckUK"" during the debate. Will Moy, the chief executive of fact-checking website Full Fact, accused the party of trying to ""mislead"" voters and said Twitter ""could have acted sooner,"" including by forcibly renaming the account. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the move, saying it offered an ""instant rebuttal mechanism"" against ""nonsense thrown at the Conservatives"". The Electoral Commission said voters were entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners. It said it has no role in regulating campaign content but urged parties to ""undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""not impressed at all"" by the debate and said neither man was ""fit"" to be prime minister. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson dismissed the performances of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn as ""bluster and diversion from both of them"". Green Party co-leader Sian Berry expressed dismay at the ""climate chaos"" issue being ""relegated to the quickfire round in that debate"". And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Corbyn was the ""better debater"" but criticised him for not saying if he would Leave or Remain in a future referendum. The Lib Dems and SNP lost a court challengeto ITV's decision not to include their party leaders in the debate. The first half of the debate was dominated by questions on Brexit. Mr Johnson wants to win a majority in 12 December's general election so he can get the Brexit deal he struck with the EU into law and take the UK out of the bloc 31 January and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. Mr Corbyn says he would tear up Mr Johnson's agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU, with a customs union and a closer relationship with the single market, which he would then put to a public vote. A row broke out over the Labour leader's claim that US health firms will be given access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal. This video can not be played Moment Corbyn produces 'NHS dossier' Mr Corbyn told the PM: ""You are going to sell our National Health Service out to the United States and Big Pharma."" He held up redacted accounts of ""a series of secret meetings"" with the US, in which the government proposed ""full market access for US products to our NHS."" In response, Mr Johnson said the claims were ""an absolute invention"" and that there were ""no circumstances whatever in which this government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."" With Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. Read Laura's full blog The two leaders then clashed over whether Brexit put the future of the union between England and Scotland at risk. Mr Johnson claimed Labour would agree to another referendum on Scotland to get the support of the SNP and that isn't a price he would be willing to pay. But Mr Corbyn called the PM's comments ""nonsense"" and insisted his party would not form a coalition between with the SNP. Asked about the issue of trust, Mr Johnson said a toxic atmosphere in politics had been caused by MPs ""repeatedly refusing to honour the referendum"". The Labour leader said ""trust is something that has to be earned and as a public representative you have to listen"". He said his style of leadership was to ""listen to people and try to bring consensus"". Asked by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham if they would ""make a gesture"" to change the tone of the debate, the pair shook hands. Some audience members laughed at Mr Johnson's statement on trust, while others laughed at Mr Corbyn's statements on a Labour's proposal for a reduced working week and his party's Brexit stance. This video can not be played The two leaders had differing views on the monarchy On health, both men praised the NHS, with Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson describing it as ""one of the most civilised things about this country"" and ""one of the single most beautiful and brilliant things about Britain"" respectively. However they quickly differed over NHS management. Mr Corbyn called for an ""end to privatisation"" of services.  Mr Johnson insisted his party was not privatising the NHS. Asked if the monarchy was ""fit for purpose"", Mr Corbyn replied: ""Needs a bit of improvement."" Mr Johnson said: ""The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."" Asked if the Duke of York Prince Andrew was ""fit for the purpose"" following criticism over his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Mr Corbyn said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered"" adding ""nobody should be above the law"". Mr Johnson said ""The law must certainly take its course."" The final question pushed the leaders to say what Christmas present they would give each other. Mr Corbyn said he would get the PM a copy of Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ""and then he can understand how nasty Scrooge was"". Mr Johnson initially said he would buy the Labour leader ""a copy of my brilliant Brexit deal"" but when pushed to give a ""non-political answer"" he said he would get ""some damson jam"". Following the head-to-head between the Labour and Conservative leaders, the leaders of the Brexit Party, Greens, Lib Dems and SNP were interviewed separately on ITV. During her interview, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson emphasised her party's opposition to Brexit and said she could offer the country a ""better future"" than ""those two tired old parties"". She also said her party had plans for a frequent flyer tax to help combat climate change. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland's future"" and promised voters that her party would ensure people ""escape the chaos of Brexit"". She also insisted ""no deal has been done"" to form a coalition with the Labour Party in the event of a hung Parliament. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the current political system ""broken, rotten and corrupt"" and said he would change the voting system and scrap the House of Lords. Last up was Green Party co-leader Sian Berry, who accused Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson of failing properly to address climate change, which she said would leave young people feeling ""let down"". The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

Epstein guards charged with falsifying recordsThe two were responsible for watching over Epstein in prison on the night he killed himself.US & Canada,"Tova Noel (L) and Michael Thomas (R) - separated by a lawyer - have pleaded not guilty Two prison guards who were on duty on the night of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's death have been charged with falsifying records. They are accused of failing to check in on him every 30 minutes and fabricating log entries to show they had. Both appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The case of Jeffrey Epstein - in 300 words The 66-year-old was previously jailed in Florida in 2008 for procuring a minor for prostitution. The charges against the two guards are the first to arise from a criminal inquiry into his death. They were supposed to check on Epstein every 30 minutes on the night of his death. He had been taken off suicide watch after a previous suspected attempt to take his own life and was alone in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. But attorney Geoffrey Berman said the two guards had""repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction"",external. The guards were named in a statement by the Southern District of New York Attorney's Office on Tuesday as correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, aged 31 and 41 respectively. For ""substantial portions"" of their shifts, they ""sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the common area"", the statement said. They then signed ""false certifications"" showing that they had conducted counts of inmates. Both guards have been charged with ""making false records and conspiring to make false records and to defraud the United States"". ""We allege these officers falsified records to create the appearance they were following... protocols. The security risks created by this type of behaviour are immense,"" FBI assistant director William Sweeney said in the statement. Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sexually abusing dozens of girls Surveillance footage showed that no other people had entered the area where Epstein was held that evening, the statement added. Both guards appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. Bail was set at $100,000 (Â£77,000) each, US media reports. Both guards were previously reported to have beenworking overtime shifts on the night of Epstein's death. US Attorney General William Barr ordered their suspension in August after the FBI opened an investigation. Federal prosecutors later offered the guards a plea bargain but they turned it down, according to the Associated Press news agency. New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections.

Johnson and Corbyn to face off in election debate,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn locked horns over the NHS, Brexit and the Royal Family Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over Brexit in the first TV election debate of the campaign. Mr Johnson promised to ""end this national misery"" and said Labour offered ""only division and deadlock"". Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""get Brexit sorted by giving you, the people, the final say"". An average audience of 6.7m people watched the leaders lock horns over the NHS, trust and leadership, the future of Scotland - and the Royal Family. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear if either men had won or lost the debate but it was striking how the audience had been ready to laugh at their statements. A snap YouGov poll suggested the public were evenly split on who had won the debate, ""with most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won"". Tories criticised over 'factcheckUK' rebranding Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked How did the election debate play out online? Five things from the debate Reaction after Johnson and Corbyn go head-to-head Meanwhile, the Conservativesreceived criticismfor rebranding one of their Twitter accounts as ""factcheckUK"" during the debate. Will Moy, the chief executive of fact-checking website Full Fact, accused the party of trying to ""mislead"" voters and said Twitter ""could have acted sooner,"" including by forcibly renaming the account. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the move, saying it offered an ""instant rebuttal mechanism"" against ""nonsense thrown at the Conservatives"". The Electoral Commission said voters were entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners. It said it has no role in regulating campaign content but urged parties to ""undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""not impressed at all"" by the debate and said neither man was ""fit"" to be prime minister. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson dismissed the performances of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn as ""bluster and diversion from both of them"". Green Party co-leader Sian Berry expressed dismay at the ""climate chaos"" issue being ""relegated to the quickfire round in that debate"". And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Corbyn was the ""better debater"" but criticised him for not saying if he would Leave or Remain in a future referendum. The Lib Dems and SNP lost a court challengeto ITV's decision not to include their party leaders in the debate. The first half of the debate was dominated by questions on Brexit. Mr Johnson wants to win a majority in 12 December's general election so he can get the Brexit deal he struck with the EU into law and take the UK out of the bloc 31 January and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. Mr Corbyn says he would tear up Mr Johnson's agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU, with a customs union and a closer relationship with the single market, which he would then put to a public vote. A row broke out over the Labour leader's claim that US health firms will be given access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal. This video can not be played Moment Corbyn produces 'NHS dossier' Mr Corbyn told the PM: ""You are going to sell our National Health Service out to the United States and Big Pharma."" He held up redacted accounts of ""a series of secret meetings"" with the US, in which the government proposed ""full market access for US products to our NHS."" In response, Mr Johnson said the claims were ""an absolute invention"" and that there were ""no circumstances whatever in which this government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."" With Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. Read Laura's full blog The two leaders then clashed over whether Brexit put the future of the union between England and Scotland at risk. Mr Johnson claimed Labour would agree to another referendum on Scotland to get the support of the SNP and that isn't a price he would be willing to pay. But Mr Corbyn called the PM's comments ""nonsense"" and insisted his party would not form a coalition between with the SNP. Asked about the issue of trust, Mr Johnson said a toxic atmosphere in politics had been caused by MPs ""repeatedly refusing to honour the referendum"". The Labour leader said ""trust is something that has to be earned and as a public representative you have to listen"". He said his style of leadership was to ""listen to people and try to bring consensus"". Asked by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham if they would ""make a gesture"" to change the tone of the debate, the pair shook hands. Some audience members laughed at Mr Johnson's statement on trust, while others laughed at Mr Corbyn's statements on a Labour's proposal for a reduced working week and his party's Brexit stance. This video can not be played The two leaders had differing views on the monarchy On health, both men praised the NHS, with Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson describing it as ""one of the most civilised things about this country"" and ""one of the single most beautiful and brilliant things about Britain"" respectively. However they quickly differed over NHS management. Mr Corbyn called for an ""end to privatisation"" of services.  Mr Johnson insisted his party was not privatising the NHS. Asked if the monarchy was ""fit for purpose"", Mr Corbyn replied: ""Needs a bit of improvement."" Mr Johnson said: ""The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."" Asked if the Duke of York Prince Andrew was ""fit for the purpose"" following criticism over his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Mr Corbyn said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered"" adding ""nobody should be above the law"". Mr Johnson said ""The law must certainly take its course."" The final question pushed the leaders to say what Christmas present they would give each other. Mr Corbyn said he would get the PM a copy of Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ""and then he can understand how nasty Scrooge was"". Mr Johnson initially said he would buy the Labour leader ""a copy of my brilliant Brexit deal"" but when pushed to give a ""non-political answer"" he said he would get ""some damson jam"". Following the head-to-head between the Labour and Conservative leaders, the leaders of the Brexit Party, Greens, Lib Dems and SNP were interviewed separately on ITV. During her interview, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson emphasised her party's opposition to Brexit and said she could offer the country a ""better future"" than ""those two tired old parties"". She also said her party had plans for a frequent flyer tax to help combat climate change. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland's future"" and promised voters that her party would ensure people ""escape the chaos of Brexit"". She also insisted ""no deal has been done"" to form a coalition with the Labour Party in the event of a hung Parliament. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the current political system ""broken, rotten and corrupt"" and said he would change the voting system and scrap the House of Lords. Last up was Green Party co-leader Sian Berry, who accused Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson of failing properly to address climate change, which she said would leave young people feeling ""let down"". The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

"Bank cuts ties with Prince Andrew schemeStandard Chartered says it is not renewing its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace for ""commercial reasons"".UK","Standard Chartered has become the second corporate partner to sever ties with the Duke of York's business mentoring initiative, Pitch@Palace. The bank joined accountancy firm KPMG in pulling support for the scheme. It said it was not renewing its sponsorship for ""commercial reasons"". Several businesses and universities are reviewing their association with Prince Andrew following a BBC interview about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Sources have told the BBC the decisions by Standard Chartered and KPMG were made before the Newsnight interview. Prince Andrew cancelled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, three days after the interview aired,the Sun newspaper reported.,external It is understood the visit was deemed inappropriate in the midst of an election campaign. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were asked about whether the duke was ""fit for purpose"" during their head-to-head debate on ITV on Tuesday evening. The Labour leader said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law"". The prime minister said: ""I think all our sympathies should be, obviously, with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the law must certainly take its course."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says monarchy ""beyond reproach"" In his Newsnight interview,the Queen's third child said he still did not regret his friendship with US financier Epstein - who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. The interview has provoked a backlash, with businesses, charities and other institutions announcing that they were reviewing their association with the prince. In addition to Standard Chartered and KPMG ending their support for Pitch@Palace: Pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca and Hult International Business School are reviewing their partnerships with the business scheme Outward Bound, the charity the Duke of Edinburgh was patron of for 65 years, has called a board meeting to discuss the prince's patronage London Metropolitan University said it will consider the prince's role as its patron, saying it ""opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse and human trafficking"" University of Huddersfield students are calling for the prince to be sacked as their chancellor Three Australian universities listed as partners of Pitch@Palace Australia - Bond University, the University of Wollongong and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology - said they had either ended their relationship with the initiative or would not be continuing it On Monday, the Huddersfield students' union panel passed a motion to lobby the prince to resign as their chancellor. The university has since said that it listens to its students' views and will ""now be consulting with them over the coming weeks"". Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The duke has stood by his decision to speak out, aftercritics labelled the interview a ""car crash"". But speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Tuesday, Huddersfield student Tristan Smith criticised the prince over his friendship with Epstein. He accused Prince Andrew of ""trying to dismiss"" the row and failing to recognise Epstein's victims. Meanwhile, a woman who has accused Epstein of sexually abusing her as a 15-year-old hasurged Prince Andrew to share information about his former friend. The accuser, identified as ""Jane Doe 15"", did not accuse Prince Andrew of any wrongdoing but called on him and others to come forward and give a statement under oath. ""Jane Doe 15"", left, gave a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred Elsewhere, former home secretary Jacqui Smith alleged that Prince Andrew made racist comments to her during a state dinner. ""I have to say the conversation left us slack-jawed with the things that he felt it was appropriate to say,"" she told the LBC election podcast. And Rohan Silva, who was an adviser to former prime minister David Cameron, also accused the prince of using a racial slur in his presence. A Buckingham Palace spokesman strenuously denied the claims, adding that Prince Andrew ""does not tolerate racism in any form"". There is no wholesale repudiation of Prince Andrew's public role. But whether as a result of the interview he gave, or because of the continuing swirl of allegations, there is a falling away of support for the prince, both corporate and political. The former Labour lord chancellor and justice secretary, Lord Falconer, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he thought the time had come for Prince Andrew to step away from public duties. Those close to Prince Andrew say that a withdrawal from public life is not under consideration. But if support continues to seep from him, it will undermine his public position. There was also further reaction to the prince's BBC appearance. Actress Rose McGowan - one of the most prominent figures of the #MeToo movement - told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she thought it was not a truthful interview. ""It's also certainly not the mark of someone who is an empathetic character who cares about victims in any way,"" she added. The actress also said she wished more questions had been asked about Epstein's alleged victims. ""We can't forget there is human tragedy behind this... This has serious repercussions, serious ramifications and serious pain that is involved in this story."" However, Alastair Campbell - Tony Blair's ex-communications chief - said that although he thought the interview was a ""mistake"", it was not ""as bad as it is now being defined"". Mr Campbell, who was another high-profile Briton to be named in Epstein's 97-page ""black book"" of contacts, also told the Today programme that he met the financier on a visit to the US for a funeral and found him to be ""a bit creepy"". ANALYSIS:'Little apology or remorse' TRANSCRIPT:Read Prince Andrew's interview in full AS IT HAPPENED:Newsnight interview REACTION:Prince Andrew 'bulldozed' into interview Prince Andrew's BBC interview followed allegations by Virginia Giuffre, known at the time as Virginia Roberts, who claims the prince had sex with her on three occasions - the first when she was aged 17. Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having had sexual contact with her. In an extraordinary interview, which you can watch in full onBBC iPlayerin the UK orYouTube,externalelsewhere in the world, the duke said: He had investigations carried out to establish whether a photograph of him with Ms Giuffre was faked, but they were inconclusive He would testify under oath if ""push came to shove"" and his lawyers advised him to He was unaware of an arrest warrant against Epstein when he invited him to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle He does not regret his friendship with Epstein because of ""the opportunities I was given to learn"" from him about trade and business Speaking out about his relationship with the financier had become almost ""a mental health issue"" for him KPMG ends sponsorship of Prince Andrew's scheme New Epstein accuser calls on Andrew to talk LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Geoffrey Bran, 71, who ran The Chipoteria in Hermon, Carmarthenshire, had told police his wife Mavis slipped and pulled a deep fat fryer over herself. Mrs Bran, 69, died in hospital six days after receiving burns to 46% of her body on 23 October 2018. He was cleared after five hours of jury deliberations at Swansea Crown Court.

""She was the matriarch of the family and is missed every day. ""Now that the court case is over and we finally have closure, we can rebuild our lives as a family, remembering Mavis as the fun-loving person that she was."" Mavis Bran died six days after hot oil went over her at her chip shop The trial was told the couple, who had been married for more than 30 years, had a volatile relationship with arguments and swearing and it deteriorated over the last few months of Mrs Bran's life. The prosecution argued Mr Bran had thrown the oil at his wife after an argument over some burnt fish, but he told the jury sheaccidentally pulled it over herselfafter she slipped and fell. The week-long trial heard Mrs Bran was a heavy drinker and was over the legal drink-drive limit for alcohol on the day of the incident. After Mrs Bran was injured, the court was told she went into their house, which is next to the chip shop cabin, but Mr Bran did not assist her or call an ambulance and continued to serve customers.

Mr Bran said in evidence his wife had accidentally slipped and pulled a fat fryer over herself, saying: ""One of the legs [of the fryer] got to the edge [of the table] and the weight of the oil must have moved things fast and it was like a waterfall and it landed on her chest."" Steven Jeffrey, a consultant burns and plastic surgeon, agreed her burns could have been sustained by her falling to the floor and pulling the fryer down over herself, saying: ""This version of events is consistent with her injuries.""

Hardcore group still barricaded in HK campus,"This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Up to 200 anti-government protesters remain barricaded inside a Hong Kong university, surrounded by police, as the standoff continues for a third day. Those who are still inside Polytechnic University (PolyU) are said to be running low on supplies. Protesters have been inside the campus since last week, initially stopping police from entering by lighting fires and throwing petrol bombs. Adults who leave face arrest, and some are too scared to come out. Hundreds of protesters tried to run from the campus on Monday, but many were hit with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested. Police have revealed that on Monday alone, at the campus, they used: 1,458 tear gas canisters 1,391 rubber bullets 325 bean bag rounds 265 sponge bullets A small group of protesters managed to leave using rope ladders before being picked up and driven away by motorcyclists. Those arrested could be charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Protesters lower themselves down a rope from a bridge to a highway to escape the Polytechnic University campus On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus. Police later moved in, surrounding the campus, leading to protesters throwing petrol bombs and firing stones from catapults. The violence at PolyU is one of the biggest flare-ups Hong Kong has seen since protests broke out in June. Tuesday saw the UN human rights office urge the Hong Kong authorities to de-escalate the situation at PolyU and address the humanitarian situation of those inside which it said was ""clearly deteriorating"". This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met tear gas volleys It added that some demonstrators' use of violence, including against the police, ""cannot be condoned"". The mostly young protesters have five key demands, including an investigation into police brutality and universal suffrage. But underpinning it all is the fear Hong Kong's unique identity is threatened by China. Tensions now could be further inflamed after China condemned a decision by Hong Kong's high court to overturn a ban on facemasks. An estimated 100 to 200 protesters still remain in PolyU, authorities have said. One protester called Jeff told the BBC that he was hiding in a building on the campus. ""I have been trapped inside Polytechnic University for two days and food and water is running out,"" he said. ""Most people tried to get out of this hell-like place, most of them tried to escape but ended in failure, being arrested or wounded or something."" ""I didn't expect this incident to get so desperate in here. The campus is so desperate and I am not well prepared. I would call it a disaster."" He said his parents were concerned for his safety and he had told them he would make it out. Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words One tourist from mainland China is too scared to leave. He told BBC News Chinese that he was curious about what was going on at the university and had arrived on Sunday at the invitation of a friend who studies there. After a visit to the library and a meal, he learnt that police had cordoned off the whole area. ""I am not a rioter,"" the tourist, who wishes to stay anonymous said. ""I don't want to get caught and I just need to go back to China."" A handful of protesters have been trickling out of the university, some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries, according to news site SCMP. One protester said he had decided to come out because of ""hunger and cold"", adding that many inside were ""hurt without enough medical supplies"". Another 16-year-old protester told Reuters new agency she had chosen to ""surrender"". ""We have been trying to escape since yesterday morning. But then we couldn't find a way out [and] were afraid of being charged,"" she said. ""This is the only way... I was quite desperate."" In the early hours of Tuesday morning, more than 200 students below the age of 18 left, accompanied by education officials including high school principals. Those under the age of 18 had their identities recorded and were let go. Adults were arrested. A nun leading a protester out of PolyU Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam called on all protesters to surrender, saying no violence would happen if they came ""out in a peaceful manner"". However, she said police would have to take ""necessary action"" if that changed. Separately on Tuesday, Hong Kong's new police chief took office. Chris Tang said the force was not able to end the protests alone,external, saying the unrest would only end if society condemned the violence. A number of people have supported protesters behind the scenes, donating supplies to them or picking them up from protests and driving them home to avoid arrest. Pody Lui, BBC News Chinese, at PolyU We got into the university in the early hours of the morning. Police have cordoned off the area, making it almost impossible for new journalists to get in. Those trapped inside were desperate to get out. The mood darkened as the day continued. More and more protesters gave up and left the campus willingly to face police arrest. They will be charged with rioting, meaning they could be jailed for up to a decade. Those determined to stay were getting restless. They were not as friendly to journalists as before. They were scared and couldn't afford trusting a wrong person, fearing anyone could be an undercover police officer. I overheard a Polytechnic University student talking to her father on the phone. ""I don't want to get caught. I will lose everything if I do,"" she cried. Her tired friend next to her said, ""I just want to go home."" Hong Kong had previously banned protesters from wearing facemasks - but this was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by the city's high court on Monday. China has condemned the high court's decision. It says it has the sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in the region. Courts in Hong Kong have ruled on constitutional issues in the past. In 2017, the Court of Appeal found the Hong Kong government's decision to deny a partner visa to the wife of a female British expat was unconstitutional, despite the fact Hong Kong does not recognise same-sex marriage. It is unclear what action, if any, China might take next. This is a large part of what the ongoing protests in Hong Kong are about. Many in Hong Kong fear that its freedoms - including judicial independence - are slowly being eroded by Beijing. Campuses had remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests - despite the movement being led mainly by students and young people. But afterthe death of a 22-year-old student, that changed. Last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. Police revealed on Tuesday that some 3,900 petrol bombs were found at CUHK, adding that the university had 100 litres of sulphuric and nitric acids missing. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

Green manifesto pledges zero carbon by 2030,"This video can not be played Jonathan Bartley: ""The green new deal is an an idea whose time has come"" The Green Party of England and Wales has launched its election manifesto with a pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2030. The party says it would invest Â£100bn a year by 2030 as part of a ""green new deal"" to tackle climate change - to be mainly paid for by borrowing. The party will also pledge to increase NHS funding, hold a Brexit referendum and extend voting to 16-year-olds. The party is standing in 497 of the 650 UK constituencies. Launching themanifesto,externalat an event in London, co-leader Jonathan Bartley said his party was proposing the ""most ambitious green new deal anywhere in the world"". He said the document would ""put us on track to decarbonise every single sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain"". ""Our very planet is raising the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years is simply not an option,"" he said. A simple guide to the Green Party Key Green Party manifesto promises explained How would the Greens fund Â£1tn climate pledge? How much will this be a climate change election? Brighton MP Caroline Lucas was the party's only MP elected in the last general election, but the Greens have had more success in the European Parliament, where they currently have seven MEPs. The party is stepping aside in 50 seats across England and Wales to make way for the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, as part of the ""Unite to Remain"" agreement. In exchange, the Lib Dems will not compete with the Greens in nine seats, including the Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Exeter and Brighton Pavilion. The general election takes place on 12 December. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote increase funding for the NHS by at least Â£6bn per year, until 2030 introduce a universal basic income of at least Â£89 per week for every adult by 2025 build 100,000 new zero carbon homes for social rent each year hold a further Brexit referendum, at which the party will campaign to remain in the EU introduce a proportional representation voting system and extend votes to 16 and 17-year-olds Ban the construction of nuclear power stations and fracking for gas and oil The party proposes borrowing Â£91.2bn a year to pay for capital expenditure. A further Â£9bn would be raised through tax changes including increasing corporation tax to 24%. The manifesto also includes a promise to put a carbon tax on energy and fossil fuel imports, increased over 10 years to make coal, oil and gas ""financially unviable"". Greens co-leader Sian Berry said the party would push for its policy programme to be implemented with 10 new pieces of legislation. ""Ten bills ready for the next Parliament to hit the ground running - because the future won't give us another chance to get these next two years right,"" she said. ""The more Green MPs we have, the more chance we have to save the future."" In October the Extinction Rebellion group held protests calling for governments to drastically cut carbon emissions By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton Try not to get too confused. The Greens aren't the only party promising a Green New Deal at this election. Labour agreed to something with the same name at its party conference earlier this year. But there's no doubt what the Green Party is proposing today is far more ambitious. Â£100bn every year for 10 years - or to put it more boldly, Â£1tn over 10 years - to fight climate change and give the UK a zero-carbon economy by 2030. The questions though, are big: even with that level of investment, how realistic is it to completely decarbonise the UK within a decade? Do the Greens want to see every petrol and diesel car off the road? Heavy industry operating with net zero emissions? Can carbon capture and storage technology, or sufficient renewable energy capacity, be developed in time? But after a year which has seen activism on climate change, be it school strikes or Extinction Rebellion, grabbing the headlines, the Green Party thinks the time is right for what it is calling the ""climate election"". Key Green Party manifesto promises explained Who should I vote for? Read our policy guide,external TheLib Dems are promising to spend Â£100bnover five years to tackle the effects of climate change. Delegates at the Labour Party's conference approved a motion calling for zero net emissions by 2030. But it remains to be seen how firm this target will be in the party's manifesto, due to be unveiled later this week. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told BBC Radio 4's programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". Labouris also proposing to insulate 27 million households, which it says would cut UK carbon emissions by 10% by 2030. The Conservatives have said they want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while the SNP says it wants a 100% reduction in emissions as soon as possible. The Conservatives, Lib Dems and the Brexit Party have all pledged to plant millions of trees over the coming years. Do you have any questions about the election?

Breaking|Breaking newsEpstein guards charged with falsifying recordsTwo prison guards tasked with watching Jeffrey Epstein on night he killed himself charged with falsifying records.US & Canada,"Tova Noel (L) and Michael Thomas (R) - separated by a lawyer - have pleaded not guilty Two prison guards who were on duty on the night of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's death have been charged with falsifying records. They are accused of failing to check in on him every 30 minutes and fabricating log entries to show they had. Both appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The case of Jeffrey Epstein - in 300 words The 66-year-old was previously jailed in Florida in 2008 for procuring a minor for prostitution. The charges against the two guards are the first to arise from a criminal inquiry into his death. They were supposed to check on Epstein every 30 minutes on the night of his death. He had been taken off suicide watch after a previous suspected attempt to take his own life and was alone in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. But attorney Geoffrey Berman said the two guards had""repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction"",external. The guards were named in a statement by the Southern District of New York Attorney's Office on Tuesday as correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, aged 31 and 41 respectively. For ""substantial portions"" of their shifts, they ""sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the common area"", the statement said. They then signed ""false certifications"" showing that they had conducted counts of inmates. Both guards have been charged with ""making false records and conspiring to make false records and to defraud the United States"". ""We allege these officers falsified records to create the appearance they were following... protocols. The security risks created by this type of behaviour are immense,"" FBI assistant director William Sweeney said in the statement. Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sexually abusing dozens of girls Surveillance footage showed that no other people had entered the area where Epstein was held that evening, the statement added. Both guards appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. Bail was set at $100,000 (Â£77,000) each, US media reports. Both guards were previously reported to have beenworking overtime shifts on the night of Epstein's death. US Attorney General William Barr ordered their suspension in August after the FBI opened an investigation. Federal prosecutors later offered the guards a plea bargain but they turned it down, according to the Associated Press news agency. New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections.

"Hardcore group still barricaded in HK campusThe standoff is into a third day, but younger protesters have been allowed to leave without arrest.","This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Up to 200 anti-government protesters remain barricaded inside a Hong Kong university, surrounded by police, as the standoff continues for a third day. Those who are still inside Polytechnic University (PolyU) are said to be running low on supplies. Protesters have been inside the campus since last week, initially stopping police from entering by lighting fires and throwing petrol bombs. Adults who leave face arrest, and some are too scared to come out. Hundreds of protesters tried to run from the campus on Monday, but many were hit with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested. Police have revealed that on Monday alone, at the campus, they used: 1,458 tear gas canisters 1,391 rubber bullets 325 bean bag rounds 265 sponge bullets A small group of protesters managed to leave using rope ladders before being picked up and driven away by motorcyclists. Those arrested could be charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Protesters lower themselves down a rope from a bridge to a highway to escape the Polytechnic University campus On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus. Police later moved in, surrounding the campus, leading to protesters throwing petrol bombs and firing stones from catapults. The violence at PolyU is one of the biggest flare-ups Hong Kong has seen since protests broke out in June. Tuesday saw the UN human rights office urge the Hong Kong authorities to de-escalate the situation at PolyU and address the humanitarian situation of those inside which it said was ""clearly deteriorating"". This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met tear gas volleys It added that some demonstrators' use of violence, including against the police, ""cannot be condoned"". The mostly young protesters have five key demands, including an investigation into police brutality and universal suffrage. But underpinning it all is the fear Hong Kong's unique identity is threatened by China. Tensions now could be further inflamed after China condemned a decision by Hong Kong's high court to overturn a ban on facemasks. An estimated 100 to 200 protesters still remain in PolyU, authorities have said. One protester called Jeff told the BBC that he was hiding in a building on the campus. ""I have been trapped inside Polytechnic University for two days and food and water is running out,"" he said. ""Most people tried to get out of this hell-like place, most of them tried to escape but ended in failure, being arrested or wounded or something."" ""I didn't expect this incident to get so desperate in here. The campus is so desperate and I am not well prepared. I would call it a disaster."" He said his parents were concerned for his safety and he had told them he would make it out. Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words One tourist from mainland China is too scared to leave. He told BBC News Chinese that he was curious about what was going on at the university and had arrived on Sunday at the invitation of a friend who studies there. After a visit to the library and a meal, he learnt that police had cordoned off the whole area. ""I am not a rioter,"" the tourist, who wishes to stay anonymous said. ""I don't want to get caught and I just need to go back to China."" A handful of protesters have been trickling out of the university, some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries, according to news site SCMP. One protester said he had decided to come out because of ""hunger and cold"", adding that many inside were ""hurt without enough medical supplies"". Another 16-year-old protester told Reuters new agency she had chosen to ""surrender"". ""We have been trying to escape since yesterday morning. But then we couldn't find a way out [and] were afraid of being charged,"" she said. ""This is the only way... I was quite desperate."" In the early hours of Tuesday morning, more than 200 students below the age of 18 left, accompanied by education officials including high school principals. Those under the age of 18 had their identities recorded and were let go. Adults were arrested. A nun leading a protester out of PolyU Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam called on all protesters to surrender, saying no violence would happen if they came ""out in a peaceful manner"". However, she said police would have to take ""necessary action"" if that changed. Separately on Tuesday, Hong Kong's new police chief took office. Chris Tang said the force was not able to end the protests alone,external, saying the unrest would only end if society condemned the violence. A number of people have supported protesters behind the scenes, donating supplies to them or picking them up from protests and driving them home to avoid arrest. Pody Lui, BBC News Chinese, at PolyU We got into the university in the early hours of the morning. Police have cordoned off the area, making it almost impossible for new journalists to get in. Those trapped inside were desperate to get out. The mood darkened as the day continued. More and more protesters gave up and left the campus willingly to face police arrest. They will be charged with rioting, meaning they could be jailed for up to a decade. Those determined to stay were getting restless. They were not as friendly to journalists as before. They were scared and couldn't afford trusting a wrong person, fearing anyone could be an undercover police officer. I overheard a Polytechnic University student talking to her father on the phone. ""I don't want to get caught. I will lose everything if I do,"" she cried. Her tired friend next to her said, ""I just want to go home."" Hong Kong had previously banned protesters from wearing facemasks - but this was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by the city's high court on Monday. China has condemned the high court's decision. It says it has the sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in the region. Courts in Hong Kong have ruled on constitutional issues in the past. In 2017, the Court of Appeal found the Hong Kong government's decision to deny a partner visa to the wife of a female British expat was unconstitutional, despite the fact Hong Kong does not recognise same-sex marriage. It is unclear what action, if any, China might take next. This is a large part of what the ongoing protests in Hong Kong are about. Many in Hong Kong fear that its freedoms - including judicial independence - are slowly being eroded by Beijing. Campuses had remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests - despite the movement being led mainly by students and young people. But afterthe death of a 22-year-old student, that changed. Last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. Police revealed on Tuesday that some 3,900 petrol bombs were found at CUHK, adding that the university had 100 litres of sulphuric and nitric acids missing. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

Mr Houghton remains a candidate but the Conservatives have withdrawn their support for his campaign while an investigation takes place. The National listed a number of posts, including one where he argued that while there was ""no credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen"" he went on to say: ""I do find some of the events fabricated."" Mr Houghton was also quoted as saying he did not see how homosexuality was good for the human race. In other alleged comments he said Islam's core teachings had the goal of ""world domination"" and that some Muslims had big families with the aim of creating ""Eurabia"". He released a statement on his Twitter feed, saying the comments were taken ""out of context"" and insisted he had never held anti-Semitic, racist or homophobic views. Mr Houghton said: ""At the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions. These included terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism."" He said that in one of the threads he had discussed freedom of speech and he had discussed comments made by Holocaust denier David Irving. He said he made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending the views and strongly opposed Holocaust denial. The candidate added: ""I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen."" A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result. ""The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North. ""The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism.""

Arron Banks' Twitter account hacked,"The Twitter account of Arron Banks, the founder of the pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU, has been hacked. The perpetrator has leaked thousands of his private messages to and from dozens of other people spanning several years. In a statement, Mr Banks accused Twitter of taking too long to tackle the issue and said the social network had ""deliberately chosen"" to leave his personal information online. Twitter said it had ""taken steps to secure the compromised account"".

The data was made available by the hackers in the form of a link to a download. The original file is no longer online. One expert said the hacker, if caught, could be prosecuted under the Computer Misuse Act, and that others who made use of the material would be walking into a legal minefield. ""Even if Arron Banks was using Twitter in a private capacity rather than as Leave.EU, the data was misappropriated from Twitter and that likely engages the Data Protection Act,"" commented Tim Turner, a data protection consultant. ""There are public interest defences for using unlawfully obtained data, but that requires a journalist or other person to gamble that they can successfully argue that the public interest supports whatever use they make of it. ""You cannot know for certain that the public interest will back up any particular course of action; a person would have to act first, and see what follows."" Avon and Somerset Police has confirmed that it is investigating the matter. ""We're investigating whether any offences have been committed under the Computer Misuse Act after we received a report a Twitter account was compromised,"" said a spokesman. In February 2019, Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by Mr Banks werefined Â£120,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office for breaching data protection laws. ""Arron Banks has shown extraordinary contempt for the ICO and British data laws and so this is a moment for him to reflect on the need for those laws and a regulator to enforce them,"" said the journalist Carole Cadwalladr.

Taliban swap Western hostages for top militants,"Australian Timothy Weeks (left) and US citizen Kevin King appeared dishevelled in video in 2017 The Afghan Taliban have freed two Western academics held hostage since 2016 in exchange for three imprisoned senior militants. American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks were released three years after being kidnapped outside the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul where they worked as professors. The three militants arrived in Qatar from Afghanistan as part of the swap. Afghan officials say the deal is aimed at restarting talks with the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani said last week the decision was ""a tough, but important"" one and a ""humanitarian gesture"". Inside the prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban Who are the Taliban? Why is there a war in Afghanistan? The swap includes Anas Haqqani, a leading figure and fund-raiser in the Haqqani militant group, and two other senior commanders, who had been held in prison by Afghan authorities. Anas Haqqani's older brother, Sirajuddin, leads the Haqqani network of fighters and is a deputy leader of the Taliban, which has a political office in Qatar. The Taliban also announced they had released 10 captured Afghan National Security Force members, saying the  prisoner exchange had been ""successfully executed"". ""These actions are a step forward in good-will and confidence building measures that can aid the peace process,"" the group said in a statement. The two professors of English were ambushed by gunmen and taken from a vehicle while leaving their university campus in Kabul in August 2016. US Navy Seals attempted a rescue mission several days later but Mr Weeks, originally from Wagga Wagga in Australia, and Mr King, from Pennsylvania, had been moved on just hours before. The pair then appeared in a video, released in January 2017, appealing to then US President-elect Donald Trump to agree to a deal to secure their release. On Tuesday, a Taliban source in southern Afghanistan told the BBC the pair had been handed over in the Nawbahar district of Zabul province at 10:00 local time (05:30 GMT). This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? According to a local police officer, who was involved in the swap, a 48-hour ceasefire was observed before the swap. The men were then flown away in a US helicopter. The condition of the two men remains unclear, but in his speech last week Mr Ghani noted ""their health has been deteriorating while in the custody of the terrorists"". The American University of Afghanistan said in a statement that it ""shares the relief of the families of Kevin and Timothy, and we look forward to providing all the support we can"" to the two men and their families. Anas Haqqani, Haji Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid were sent to Qatar as part of the exchange. Haqqani is a leading figure in the Haqqani group, a militant group founded by his father Jalaluddin Haqqani, and now led by his older brother, Sirajuddin, who is also deputy leader of the Taliban, BBC Urdu's Riffat Orakzai says. Another four of his brothers been killed in various security operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The surviving family members are in hiding. The Haqqani network has been behind many of the co-ordinated attacks on Afghan and Nato forces in recent years and has been blamed for some of the deadliest blasts in the country, including a truck bomb in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people. Pakistan has been accused by the West of backing the Haqqani network to counter the influence of arch-rival India in Afghanistan, a charge it denies. Anas Haqqani, pictured in 2014, was flown to Qatar Anas was arrested in Bahrain in 2014. It is believed his captors, the Americans, kept him in a prison in the UAE for some time until he was handed over to the Afghan government in Kabul and imprisoned at Bagram air base. Hafiz Rashid is a senior Taliban commander who was involved in equipping suicide bombers and helped choose their targets, according to The New York Times. His brother is a member of the Taliban negotiating team in Qatar. Little is known about Haji Mali Khan, who is said to be a senior commander. Analysis by Auliya Atrafi, BBC Afghan, Kabul This is a huge gamble for President Ghani. The image of Anas Haqqani has been used by critics of the government and civil society protesters to represent the most extreme part of the Taliban - the part responsible for some of the deadliest and most high profile attacks in the heart of Kabul which left hundreds of civilians killed or wounded. The government recently said releasing him was a red line - but now it's being taunted for having crossed that very line. If this release is followed by a reduction in violence, it could repair the damage, but that remains to be seen. People protest against the prisoner swap in Kabul, Afghanistan However, on a positive point: the government managed the deal in a way which made it appear like it was in charge, and not the Americans. To drive this point home, the government seems to have delayed the planned release last week until there was an understanding with the Taliban. Officials hope this will make the Taliban accept direct talks with the Afghan government - something the militants have always refused up until now. The Scottish aid worker killed during a rescue attempt The documentary maker freed 'for a ransom' The governor's son who secretly listened to football The captured soldier who sparked a political row The talks collapsed in September, after President Donald Trump had invited senior Taliban leaders and Afghan president Ashraf Ghani to meet at Camp David, near Washington DC, aiming to end the US' longest war. But a Taliban attack in the Afghan capital two days earlier, which killed a US soldier and 11 others, prompted Mr Trump to pull out, saying the group ""probably don't have the power to negotiate"" if they were unable to agree to a ceasefire during talks. Mr Ghani said in a televised speech that the exchangeaimed to ""facilitate direct peace negotiations."",externalHowever, the Taliban have long refused to negotiate with Mr Ghani's administration, calling it a puppet of the US.

PM pledges to extend stop and search powers,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the move will deter people from getting back to ""the life of crime"" The police will be given ""greater freedoms"" to use stop and search on those known to have carried knives in the past, Boris Johnson has pledged. Stop and search powers have proved controversial  - and there is evidence that black people are disproportionately targeted. But the government has previously said they work and ""empower"" the police. Mr Johnson plans to speed up charging and prosecuting knife offenders as well, if the Tories win the election. Responding to the Tory leader's announcement, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Tinkering with police powers cannot disguise Tory failure for almost a decade. ""Johnson supported Tory cuts to the police and has no plans to restore the frontline officers that successive Tory governments have axed - just as he never did make good on his promise to recruit 'thousands of extra police' as London Mayor."" She said the Conservatives did not ""intend to do anything about the youth services they cut, or the funding for drug prevention or the increase in school exclusions that have all contributed to rising crime"". LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail What is knife crime like in your area? The key facts about rising knife crime Does stop and search solve crime? Knife crime remains at historically high levels across England and Wales and crime, more broadly, is a key concern among voters so the Conservatives' plans come as little surprise. Speeding up court proceedings in knife possession cases is a largely uncontroversial idea but will take a huge effort across all parts of the criminal justice system to make it happen. More contentious is the proposal to further increase stop and search powers at a time when police stops are on the rise after years of decline. Although police chiefs are convinced stop and search is effective, the research is inconclusive and the disproportionate use of the tactic against young black men has been blamed for fuelling tensions. The Tories' proposal to allow officers to search anyone previously cautioned or convicted for carrying a knife, without the need to have grounds to do so, is likely to be hotly contested. Speaking at a boxing ring in Manchester, Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""come down hard"" on the ""scourge"" of knife crime. Talking about his plans to extend stop and search to those with a previous conviction for carrying a knife, he said: ""We think that that will deter young people who have been convicted of carrying from getting back involved in that kind of life again."" This video can not be played Stop and search is a tactic used by police to crack down on crime Currently police officers are allowed to stop and search individuals if they have reason to suspect serious violence may take place. Speaking in August, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Stop and search works - we hear again and again from police that [they] need to be empowered."" But Ms Abbott said the powers did not reduce violent crime. Mr Johnson also said his government would be ""speeding up prosecutions to make sure the threat of being caught is always an effective deterrent"". Under his proposals, someone caught unlawfully with a knife would be arrested and charged within 24 hours - and appear in court within a week. The Conservatives say this would be three times faster than the current average. BBC home affairs journalist Gaetan Portal says although the current average time from offence to charge is 40 days, the median time - arguably a more representative measure - is just one day. The current median time between someone being charged with an offence and appearing in court is 17 days. Our Reality Check team says decreasing this time will require investment in the criminal justice system. Mr Johnson also said the solution lay in ""wrapping your arms around the kids and putting them on the right tracks in their lives"". He reiterated a previous pledge to boost funding for violence reduction units by Â£35m in 2020. These units tackle knife crime by involving multiple public service providers on early intervention projects. Thismethod of reducing knife crime was first tried in Scotlandin 2005.

TSB 'lacked common sense' before IT meltdown,"The board of TSB has been accused of a lack of ""common sense"" in the run-up to IT failures that left up to 1.9 million customers unable to bank online, some for several weeks, in April 2018. An independent report into the incident by law firm Slaughter and May blamed both TSB and IT provider Sabis. Customers were moved on to a new system, but the report said it had not been tested properly before going live. It found that the tests only took place offline and not in a live environment. It said that TSB accepted that had tests been run across both systems, it might have been able to identify the issues which affected customers before they happened. MPs demand action over rise in online bank crashes TSB suffers Â£105m loss after computer chaos TSB investigated over IT meltdown ""We have concluded that the new platform was not ready to support TSB's full customer base and Sabis was not ready to operate the new platform,"" the report said. ""While the TSB board asked a number of pertinent questions... there were certain additional common sense challenges that the TSB board did not put to the executive. ""These included why it was reasonable to expect that TSB would be 'migration ready' only four months later than originally planned, when certain workstreams were as much as seven months behind schedule."" The report also said that there were more than 2,000 defects relating to testing at the time the system went live, but the board were only told about 800. Other failings by TSB that it identified included setting ""unnecessary"" time constraints, which did not understand the complexity of the project, and being dishonest about the reasons for delays. TSB is part of the Spanish banking group Sabadell and its in-house IT provider Sabis built the system. The IT failure has cost TSB a total of Â£330m for customer compensation, fraud losses and other expenses. The IT fiasco at TSB left many thousands of customers in difficulty, calls were unanswered for 90 minutes and fraud attacks were 70 times higher than usual levels at their peak, the report reveals. Among those affected was photographer Paul Clarke, who could not use his accounts and was defrauded in the confusion. He says he left the bank as soon as was reasonably possible. ""After the fraud, there was a complete demolition of trust,"" he says. ""I was left for two weeks without being able to function financially."" Photographer Paul Clarke's business was affected by TSB's meltdown He was annoyed about the fraud, although the money was later refunded, but more so about the response from TSB to the situation. He described the failures of the IT switchover as ""basic stuff"". The timing of the IT mess could not have been worse for Sally and Chris Jones - TSB mortgage holders - whose house move turned into24 hours of chaos. ""It was terrible timing for us, that they were not ready [with the IT switchover],"" says Mrs Jones. Chris and Sally Jones spent 24 hours fearing they could be left stranded Problems at TSB meant funds were not released so they were stuck in limbo, waiting outside their new home in a removals van, facing the prospect of staying overnight in a hotel. ""It was all very chaotic,"" she says. Eventually they got inside, but there were still problems with completing the purchase and early in the mortgage term. They were compensated and have not had problems since, so have remained as customers. TSB executive chairman Richard Meddings said: ""Slaughter and May's report sets out a number of findings on aspects of the planning and preparation for migration which they believe could have been done differently. ""In light of the disruption customers experienced, TSB has made important changes to enable the bank to rebuild - including to leadership and management structures, as well as the decision to take direct control of its IT operations. ""Importantly, TSB has long since compensated every eligible customer who was impacted by the disruption."" Paul Pester left the bank in September 2018 TSB's former chief executive Paul Pester,who quit his job a few months after the incident,said: ""If these findings are right, Sabis rolled the dice by running tests on only one of TSB's two new data centres and this decision was kept from me and the rest of the TSB board. ""The report explains that this made it impossible for the TSB board to anticipate the serious problems experienced by many customers who could not access their accounts. ""Obviously, if we had been aware of Sabis's shortcuts in the testing programme, the TSB board and I would never have pressed ahead with switching to the new system at that time."" The Slaughter and May report was commissioned by TSB. Another joint report by two regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, will be published at a later date. Those regulators have the power to fine and reprimand businesses and individuals.

Babies and mums died 'amid toxic hospital culture'A leaked report into maternity care claims children were left disabled amid substandard care.Shropshire,"Rhiannon Davies campaigned for an independent inquiry after her baby, Kate, died in 2009 Babies and mothers died amid a ""toxic"" culture at a hospital trust stretching back 40 years, a report has said. The catalogue of maternity care failings at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust are contained in a reportleaked to The Independent,external. It reveals that some children were left disabled, staff got the names of some dead babies wrong and, in one case, referred to a child as ""it"". The trust apologised and said ""a lot"" had been done to address concerns. What do we know about the review? In 2017,then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced an investigationinto avoidable baby deaths at the trust, which runs Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal. It is being led by maternity expert Donna Ockenden, who authored the report for NHS Improvement. The trust runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital in Telford Its initial scope was to examine 23 cases but this has now grown tomore than 270, covering the period from 1979 to the present day. The cases include 22 stillbirths, three deaths during pregnancy, 17 deaths of babies after birth, three deaths of mothers, 47 cases of substandard care and 51 cases of cerebral palsy or brain damage. The interim report said the number of cases it is now being asked to review ""seems to represent a longstanding culture at this trust that is toxic to improvement effort"". The report details the issues experienced by affected families, including: Babies left brain-damaged because staff failed to realise labour was going wrong, or from group B strep or meningitis that can often be treated by antibiotics Heartbeats not monitored adequately during labour One father gaining his only feedback on his daughter's death after bumping into a hospital employee at a supermarket Family members being told they would have to leave if they did not ""keep the noise down"" when they were upset following their baby's death A baby girl's shawl, which her mother had planned to bury her in, was lost by staff Multiple families ""where deceased babies are given the wrong names by the trust - frequently in writing"" and ""on occasions referred to a deceased baby as 'it'"" It also points to an inadequate review carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in 2017 and the ""misplaced"" optimism of the regulator in charge in 2007. Donna Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019 Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton,whose baby Kate died in 2009, were among the families who first pushed for the independent inquiry. Ms Davies said she was already aware of many of the issues raised by the report but said she was ""shocked"" by the length of time covered by the report. ""The devastating reality of Kate's avoidable death, that I have to live with, is that she was condemned to her painful death by the culture at SaTH that wilfully refused to learn from earlier cases dating back decades,"" she said. ""That is why I have fought every body and every institution in Kate's name because no other baby will suffer the same harm while I have breath in my body. ""The only way I believe it will stop is if the police or Crown Prosecution Service bring corporate manslaughter charges against the trust."" Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent This report will unfortunately only confirm what dozens of families have been telling me since we first highlighted the problems at the trust in 2017. A staggering attitude towards any number of families - dismissing their questions, telling young women who'd just lost a healthy baby not to worry as they'll be pregnant again within the year - showed a wilful disregard to improving healthcare and learning from mistakes. But it would be wrong to simply blame SaTH, culpable as it is. NHS regulators as far back as 2007 drew attention to problems in the maternity unit and then failed to follow-up with any meaningful improvements. The trust has recently appointed a new chief executive - developing a new culture will take an awful lot longer. Det Supt Carl Moore, of West Mercia Police, said the force was liaising with the independent inquiry and awaiting its findings before any criminal proceedings would be considered - in line with protocol in health care settings. Mr Stanton said: ""My feelings are one of huge sorrow, huge sorrow for all the families who have had their lives ripped apart by this trust, by the avoidable death of their child, an avoidable death of a mother or the harm to their child. ""A death at the hands of a trust that has a toxic culture of lying and cover up."" Baby death investigation 'not watered down' Hundreds more cases in baby deaths review Sharon Morris, whose daughter Olivia suffered a brain injury 14 years ago, said she was ""not shocked"" by the findings. In a statement released by Lanyon Bowdler solicitors, she said: ""Every day for the last 14 years we are constantly reminded of the failure by SaTH to help me give birth to healthy twins. ""No amount of money can change things and all we can now hope for is that changes are made to ensure other families don't suffer like we do."" Olivia Morris (centre), pictured with her identical twin Beth and their mother Sharon, suffered a brain injury 14 years ago Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust (SaTH) said it had ""not been made aware of any interim report"" and awaited the findings of the full report. Paula Clark, interim chief executive, apologised ""unreservedly"" to the families affected. She added: ""A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases."" However, the report warned lessons were not being learned and staff at the trust were uncommunicative with families. Latest news from the West Midlands Ms Ockenden said the leaked document appeared to be an internal status update as of February 2019. ""This was produced at the request of NHS Improvement and was not meant for publication,"" she said. She said the independent review team was working to meet the family's request for ""one, single, comprehensive"" report covering all cases of serious concern within maternity services at the trust.

"Families 'devastated' by rail workers' deaths""Everyday is a living nightmare"" for the families of two men who were hit by a train.Wales","This video can not be played Gareth Delbridge's son-in-law calls for changes to rail line working conditions Families of two rail workers who died after being hit by a train have said every day is ""a living nightmare"". They want changes in rail line working conditions after Gareth Delbridge, 64, and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis, 58,were killed by a passenger train on 3 Julynear Margam in Port Talbot. Mr Delbridge's son-in-law Adrian Grant said the families were awaiting the conclusions of three inquiries. An initial report saidthere was ""no safe system in place"". Early investigations found Mr Delbridge, from Kenfig Hill, Bridgend, and Mr Lewis, from nearby North Cornelly,had been using a tool with a petrol engine and wearing ear defenders, meaning they did not hear the train, which was travelling from Swansea to London Paddington. A third worker was treated for shock but was not injured. Gareth Delbridge (L) and Michael Lewis (R) were hit by a train in July Network Rail and Great Western Railway's initial report said six staff were working on the line and separated of their own accord into groups of three and this meant there was no official lookout. Mr Grant, 54, from Porthcawl, said the bereaved families believed the men would have never jeopardised their safety and called on Network Rail to change working conditions for staff on the railway lines. Rail death families 'overwhelmed' by support Rail worker killed by train 'loved by everyone' Rail worker deaths prompt Â£70m safety task force Network Rail safety director Martin Frobisher said it was continuing its investigations and ""nothing will lessen the pain, but understanding what went wrong and learning from that will"". Mr Grant said the deaths had ""devastated both families"". ""Every day is a living nightmare at the moment and a challenge,"" he added. Michael Lewis and wife Dawn had been married for 35 years Mr Grant said: ""I understand that something went tragically wrong that day and I'm in a firm frame of mind that when you send people off to work, especially two people with all that experience of the rail, you expect them to come home. ""Both of these guys had worked on the rail for over 40 years with fantastic exemplary records of safety and - for them not to come home - something has gone tragically wrong. ""We will campaign hard to make sure this doesn't go away until things are changed."" Three official investigations have been launched by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and British Transport Police. Mr Delbridge had been married to wife Carol for 44 years and they had three children, seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren The Network Rail and Great Western Railway report said the men had been instructed to work on freeing, oiling and retightening bolts by the unofficial person in charge, who was also to act as a lookout. There was a problem with a bolt, meaning the lookout became involved in the rail work and suggested putting further oil on the bolt, despite being instructed to remain in a position of safety. It also said groups should be about 20 yards (18m) apart during work, but the workers split and were 150 yards (137m) apart. Mr Grant said: ""This was work they would always do. It was tools they would always use. ""The only thing we know [is] the work had changed and moved around quite a bit that day and, obviously, that's what the independent investigations at this time are looking into whether that had an impact on what happened or not."" Mr Grant said: ""Network Rail say they are carrying out aÂ£70m campaignto stop accidents happening like this. ""But they've tried this before but I'm hoping this time - from the findings of these three investigations - changes will happen... and we will see results from this investment rather than just words on paper."" Mr Frobisher said: ""The whole railway family shares the loss of Gareth Delbridge and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis. ""We have shared our initial investigation into what happened and are continuing our investigation into the root causes before we make recommendations for our organisation and all of our people for the future."" The company said the majority of its work was carried out on ""closed track"", where no trains run. ""Whether the train lines are open or closed, clear plans, roles and responsibilities are essential and no work should be done on the railway without a safe system of work plan, which is briefed to everyone in the team before they go on to the track to work,"" it said.

'My seat was won by 31 votes - but I'm not voting'," Election battleground: Southampton   By Jon Kelly   Tammy Cosens was four years old when she first started playing with other people’s hair. Her mum’s friends would come round to their flat and let Tammy style them. She adored it. When she learned she could make a living as a hairdresser, she set her heart on it as a career. Back then she lived on the third floor of a four-storey walk-up block in Holyrood, a post-war council estate near the centre of Southampton. It was a lively multicultural area, with many Indian, Pakistani and Jamaican families, and Tammy loved it there. This was the early 1980s and there wasn’t much traffic, so she’d play on the streets with the other children and walk each day to school. One of her neighbours was Craig David, the future UK garage star. Their families were friendly.  Then, when she was 13, Tammy’s mum moved the family to another estate in Swaythling, in the north of the city. They lived in a house now rather than a flat but Tammy didn’t like the area so much. In Holyrood there had been plenty of children her own age to make friends with, but now most of the kids were a few years older. For the first time Tammy, who is mixed-race, experienced racist abuse. Her mum didn’t like her hanging around in the street any more. Tammy only went to school to socialise. She was intelligent, but the teachers didn’t know how to deal with her dyslexia. “They would just class you as thick,” says Tammy, now 44. She’d play the class clown, but this was borne of insecurity. “I don’t think I was a very confident kid,” she says. “I was more of a follower than a leader.” Then it was time for all the pupils in her year to go out and do work experience, and Tammy thought she’d hit the jackpot - she was offered an interview for a job at a hairdresser’s salon. It was the opportunity she’d always dreamed of. “I really wanted to do it,” she says. “I really tried.” She did her best to be respectful and took care answering all the questions she was asked. But the owner reported back that Tammy had a “bad attitude”. Tammy didn’t understand why the owner would think this. “Could be a racist thing,” she says. When she returned to her classes, the teacher who’d been given the report from the salon owner slammed a door in her face. After that, Tammy never went back to school.  Southampton is a city of sharp contrasts. There are the marinas like Ocean Village and Shamrock Quay, with their yachts and luxury flats; then there are the sprawling council estates like Thornhill, Weston and Townhill Park. Its economy is a mixture of the traditional and the ultra-modern. While some other cities have seen their docks go into terminal decline, the port of Southampton is still a major employer, supporting an estimated 45,000 jobs. At the same time, high-tech jobs are on the rise and there’s a student population of 40,000 -19% of the population is aged 15-24, compared with a UK average of 12%. All these factors makes for closely fought electoral territory. Control of Southampton council changed hands six times between 1997 and 2012, and the Westminster seats reflect the varied communities that make up the city. To the east is Southampton Itchen, which the Conservatives snatched from Labour in 2015 and then held in 2017 by a margin of just 31 votes.    To the west is Southampton Test - slightly wealthier, a little more diverse and home to the University of Southampton, it was once considered a bellwether but has been held by Labour since 1997. There’s also Romsey and Southampton North, represented by the Tories since its creation in 2010, where the Liberal Democrats are the principal challengers.  In 2016, Southampton voted for Brexit by 53.8% to 46.2%, slightly above the UK average. And like the country as a whole it was divided along demographic lines, with the more cosmopolitan Test constituency choosing Remain, while in Itchen, with its higher proportion of white working-class voters, Leave came out on top.  Liam Doe looks elated. A serial entrepreneur, it’s only been a week since he launched his latest business venture, a luxury shared workspace called The Old Bond Store, right in the centre of Southampton. Built in a refurbished warehouse, it has business lounges, an events floor and tastefully furnished  work space over three storeys. Liam is pitching it at the higher end of the market - he’s aiming to sign up 100 business leaders at a rate of £300 a month, on the basis that it’s a more congenial spot for them to get things done than coffee shops or their kitchen tables.  His judgement is that Southampton has enough high-end clients to justify his investment - quite a vote of confidence in the city, the kind you’d expect from a proud native son. But Liam, 39, wasn’t born or raised there. In fact, he grew up 15 miles away in neighbouring Portsmouth, on the sprawling Paulsgrove estate. It was a close-knit place where generations of the same families lived - Liam’s dad, who had a small construction company, and his mum, a nurse, had been brought up there too. When Liam, a Portsmouth fan, was signed by Southampton FC’s youth team, he learned all about the sporting rivalry between the two cities. He was the first in his family to go to university, and then had a few years working for other people - a recruitment firm, a franchising company and so on. But he knew that eventually he wanted to be his own boss. Then one day Liam’s dad called to say he was thinking of retiring. Liam knew nothing about construction, but he when he looked at his dad’s books he could see it was a good business. With a bank loan, he bought a stake and, alongside a business parter, set about building up the firm. They were hugely successful at first. “At 27 years old I was running a £5m-turnover business and thinking I was bulletproof,” Liam says. He wasn’t. The recession hit and, eight years ago, the business failed. “We lost everything,” says Liam, now 39. “Which was tough. It wasn’t good for either of us or our families. But we learned from it.” The construction firm was re-purposed as a recruitment agency, finding work for its old employees. Liam and his partner set up an accountancy firm serving self-employed contractors - by the time he sold it this year it had 800 clients. He began investing in property, too. When the Old Bond Store came on the market, Liam saw an opportunity.  Liam believes that while his home city of Portsmouth aspires to be, like Brighton, a place you go to have fun, Southampton sees itself as a regional hub in the mould of Bristol or Birmingham - the capital of the south coast. “There is real ambition here,” he says. “It’s a thriving business community.” He sees commuters standing on the platform at Southampton Airport Parkway station at 5am each day and believes they and their employers will see the benefits of remote working. He stresses he isn’t very political. He’s voted maybe twice in his life. But there’s one thing about politics that annoys him - the way MPs talk about businessmen needing stability to make decisions. “You’re never going to get stability,” he says. That’s the most important thing he learned from building up a business, losing it and building it up again. “It doesn’t exist.”  Tammy sat in her chair at a salon. She was there as a client but she’d been studying for a hairdressing qualification. She made sure to let the owner know this. Could she come in and do work experience? The past few years had been hard for Tammy. She’d  worked for a while in a chicken factory until, at 18, she gave birth to her son. It was tough bringing him up on her own. Now, at the age of 25, she was relatively old for a hairdressing trainee. But she turned that to her advantage. “Because I was older I could see more, clean up more, be on the ball,” she says. “I was eager to ask questions, see what they were doing.” Four weeks after she started, she was offered a permanent job. At the time, the salon that took her on was the only one in Southampton specialising in afro-textured hair. Previously, many black people who lived in the city had felt obliged to travel to London. Like other UK cities, Southampton has become increasingly multicultural. In the 2011 census 14.2% of the population were recorded as black and minority ethnic (BAME) and 22.4% were non-white British. Ali Beg set up Awaaz Community Radio - a local station that broadcasts in nine languages - because he felt the growing Asian community wasn’t being catered for. “I believe that integration is better than isolation,” he says. “Growing up in the 70s and 80s, you used to listen to English music as much as ethnic music. Why not have a platform where we have both out there?”   Tammy had a similar philosophy. She cut hair for black people and white people alike. After two years in the salon, she’d built up enough of a clientele to set up on her own. At first she’d cut clients’ hair in her flat in Bitterne, in the east of the city. She removed a built-in wardrobe and fitted a mirror, lights and sockets. Later, she worked in a barber’s shop. By 2011 she’d saved up enough to take out a lease on a salon of her own. It was next to Ocean Village, a marina at the mouth of the River Itchen. There were four chairs, so she could rent three to other hairdressers. Tammy’s dream had come true at last. She’d recently given birth to her eldest daughter and this was a chance to give her the life she deserved.  It was hard work, though. After her second daughter, now seven, was born, Tammy had post-natal depression, but she only took two months' maternity leave. “When you’re depressed you have days where you don’t want to get dressed - but I had to open up the shop,” she says. “I couldn’t not open up the shop.” She stuck at it for eight years. This July, however, she had to let it go. Her children wanted to be at home, not with a childminder. It made sense to rent a chair in someone else’s salon instead and work around school hours. She was sorry that her dream didn’t last forever, but as a working single mother, this change has been better for her mental health. “My anxiety has gone down loads,” she says. Battlegrounds Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Bishop Auckland Cheltenham Enniskillen Norwich Pembrokeshire      There are issues that matter to Tammy, issues that Westminster has influence over. As well as wanting more support for small business, she’s concerned about the lack of affordable homes in Southampton. “They’re building more student accommodation, more private accommodation - there’s no social housing.” She can’t afford to buy her own flat. But on 12 December, she isn’t planning to vote for anyone.  So far, it seems to her these issues aren’t at the forefront of the election campaign. “Isn’t it just who’s running to see who’ll sort the Brexit deal out?” she asks. Like Liam, she’s voted a couple of times in her life - and the 2016 referendum on EU membership wasn't one of them. “I didn’t know anything about it, and I probably would have been choosing for the wrong reasons,” she says. Back then, she understood why many in Southampton had concerns about immigration. “What annoys me is that you can’t get a doctor’s appointment. School places are so strict now because they’re over-subscribed. But that’s not [the immigrants’] fault, at the end of the day - it’s the government’s fault.”  Over time, she’s become more sceptical about the supposed benefits of Brexit. At the salon where she now works there are hard-working Eastern European hairdressers who are fearful for their futures. “What they [the government] are actually doing is pointless,” she says. “It’s going to take longer at borders - what’s that going to achieve? I don’t feel that’s going to solve anything.” Liam didn’t vote in the EU referendum either. Like Tammy, he didn’t feel qualified enough to make a call. But unlike her, he’s shifted towards thinking the government needs to get Brexit over and done with. “I think it just needs to happen,” he says. “My business head says to me commerce has to happen, as it's happened for hundreds of years. BMW in Germany are going to need to sell the UK market cars. I’ll be glad to see it done.” Brexit supporters in Southampton have made much of the fact that most exports that pass through the city’s port are destined for non-EU countries. “None of our clients have said to me, ‘We are waiting to hear what’s happening with Brexit.’ We’ve all got a bit used to it, and are just getting on with it,” says Gill Gould, 69, who runs a marketing communications company, Carswell Gould.  Local companies are more concerned about finding the highly trained staff they need to compete in the high-tech marketplace, she says. “What we really need is people coming out of schools, colleges and universities who are ready with the skills that businesses require.” But others - not least the thousands of EU citizens who have come to Southampton to work and study - may be less relaxed about the situation. The council estimates that there are 8,391 Polish workers in the city. The universities, too, rely heavily on EU funding. In the end, non-voters - or at least irregular voters, like Tammy and Liam - might prove to be decisive, if this time they decide to exercise their right to cast a ballot. In 2017, there were 24,675 eligible voters in ultra-marginal Southampton Itchen who either didn't vote or spoiled their ballot paper. The winner, Conservative Royston Smith, won 21,773 to Labour’s 21,742. Had the non-votes counted as “none of the above”, then ""none of the above"" would have won the seat handily - a statistic that makes Tammy and Liam, for all their differences, representative of a bloc that could upset Southampton’s political equilibrium.

"Families 'devastated' by rail workers' deaths""Everyday is a living nightmare"" for the families of two men who were hit by a train.","This video can not be played Gareth Delbridge's son-in-law calls for changes to rail line working conditions Families of two rail workers who died after being hit by a train have said every day is ""a living nightmare"". They want changes in rail line working conditions after Gareth Delbridge, 64, and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis, 58,were killed by a passenger train on 3 Julynear Margam in Port Talbot. Mr Delbridge's son-in-law Adrian Grant said the families were awaiting the conclusions of three inquiries. An initial report saidthere was ""no safe system in place"". Early investigations found Mr Delbridge, from Kenfig Hill, Bridgend, and Mr Lewis, from nearby North Cornelly,had been using a tool with a petrol engine and wearing ear defenders, meaning they did not hear the train, which was travelling from Swansea to London Paddington. A third worker was treated for shock but was not injured. Gareth Delbridge (L) and Michael Lewis (R) were hit by a train in July Network Rail and Great Western Railway's initial report said six staff were working on the line and separated of their own accord into groups of three and this meant there was no official lookout. Mr Grant, 54, from Porthcawl, said the bereaved families believed the men would have never jeopardised their safety and called on Network Rail to change working conditions for staff on the railway lines. Rail death families 'overwhelmed' by support Rail worker killed by train 'loved by everyone' Rail worker deaths prompt Â£70m safety task force Network Rail safety director Martin Frobisher said it was continuing its investigations and ""nothing will lessen the pain, but understanding what went wrong and learning from that will"". Mr Grant said the deaths had ""devastated both families"". ""Every day is a living nightmare at the moment and a challenge,"" he added. Michael Lewis and wife Dawn had been married for 35 years Mr Grant said: ""I understand that something went tragically wrong that day and I'm in a firm frame of mind that when you send people off to work, especially two people with all that experience of the rail, you expect them to come home. ""Both of these guys had worked on the rail for over 40 years with fantastic exemplary records of safety and - for them not to come home - something has gone tragically wrong. ""We will campaign hard to make sure this doesn't go away until things are changed."" Three official investigations have been launched by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and British Transport Police. Mr Delbridge had been married to wife Carol for 44 years and they had three children, seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren The Network Rail and Great Western Railway report said the men had been instructed to work on freeing, oiling and retightening bolts by the unofficial person in charge, who was also to act as a lookout. There was a problem with a bolt, meaning the lookout became involved in the rail work and suggested putting further oil on the bolt, despite being instructed to remain in a position of safety. It also said groups should be about 20 yards (18m) apart during work, but the workers split and were 150 yards (137m) apart. Mr Grant said: ""This was work they would always do. It was tools they would always use. ""The only thing we know [is] the work had changed and moved around quite a bit that day and, obviously, that's what the independent investigations at this time are looking into whether that had an impact on what happened or not."" Mr Grant said: ""Network Rail say they are carrying out aÂ£70m campaignto stop accidents happening like this. ""But they've tried this before but I'm hoping this time - from the findings of these three investigations - changes will happen... and we will see results from this investment rather than just words on paper."" Mr Frobisher said: ""The whole railway family shares the loss of Gareth Delbridge and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis. ""We have shared our initial investigation into what happened and are continuing our investigation into the root causes before we make recommendations for our organisation and all of our people for the future."" The company said the majority of its work was carried out on ""closed track"", where no trains run. ""Whether the train lines are open or closed, clear plans, roles and responsibilities are essential and no work should be done on the railway without a safe system of work plan, which is briefed to everyone in the team before they go on to the track to work,"" it said.

TSB 'lacked common sense' before IT meltdownSome customers were left without online banking access for several weeks after the problems last year.Business,"The board of TSB has been accused of a lack of ""common sense"" in the run-up to IT failures that left up to 1.9 million customers unable to bank online, some for several weeks, in April 2018. An independent report into the incident by law firm Slaughter and May blamed both TSB and IT provider Sabis. Customers were moved on to a new system, but the report said it had not been tested properly before going live. It found that the tests only took place offline and not in a live environment. It said that TSB accepted that had tests been run across both systems, it might have been able to identify the issues which affected customers before they happened. MPs demand action over rise in online bank crashes TSB suffers Â£105m loss after computer chaos TSB investigated over IT meltdown ""We have concluded that the new platform was not ready to support TSB's full customer base and Sabis was not ready to operate the new platform,"" the report said. ""While the TSB board asked a number of pertinent questions... there were certain additional common sense challenges that the TSB board did not put to the executive. ""These included why it was reasonable to expect that TSB would be 'migration ready' only four months later than originally planned, when certain workstreams were as much as seven months behind schedule."" The report also said that there were more than 2,000 defects relating to testing at the time the system went live, but the board were only told about 800. Other failings by TSB that it identified included setting ""unnecessary"" time constraints, which did not understand the complexity of the project, and being dishonest about the reasons for delays. TSB is part of the Spanish banking group Sabadell and its in-house IT provider Sabis built the system. The IT failure has cost TSB a total of Â£330m for customer compensation, fraud losses and other expenses. The IT fiasco at TSB left many thousands of customers in difficulty, calls were unanswered for 90 minutes and fraud attacks were 70 times higher than usual levels at their peak, the report reveals. Among those affected was photographer Paul Clarke, who could not use his accounts and was defrauded in the confusion. He says he left the bank as soon as was reasonably possible. ""After the fraud, there was a complete demolition of trust,"" he says. ""I was left for two weeks without being able to function financially."" Photographer Paul Clarke's business was affected by TSB's meltdown He was annoyed about the fraud, although the money was later refunded, but more so about the response from TSB to the situation. He described the failures of the IT switchover as ""basic stuff"". The timing of the IT mess could not have been worse for Sally and Chris Jones - TSB mortgage holders - whose house move turned into24 hours of chaos. ""It was terrible timing for us, that they were not ready [with the IT switchover],"" says Mrs Jones. Chris and Sally Jones spent 24 hours fearing they could be left stranded Problems at TSB meant funds were not released so they were stuck in limbo, waiting outside their new home in a removals van, facing the prospect of staying overnight in a hotel. ""It was all very chaotic,"" she says. Eventually they got inside, but there were still problems with completing the purchase and early in the mortgage term. They were compensated and have not had problems since, so have remained as customers. TSB executive chairman Richard Meddings said: ""Slaughter and May's report sets out a number of findings on aspects of the planning and preparation for migration which they believe could have been done differently. ""In light of the disruption customers experienced, TSB has made important changes to enable the bank to rebuild - including to leadership and management structures, as well as the decision to take direct control of its IT operations. ""Importantly, TSB has long since compensated every eligible customer who was impacted by the disruption."" Paul Pester left the bank in September 2018 TSB's former chief executive Paul Pester,who quit his job a few months after the incident,said: ""If these findings are right, Sabis rolled the dice by running tests on only one of TSB's two new data centres and this decision was kept from me and the rest of the TSB board. ""The report explains that this made it impossible for the TSB board to anticipate the serious problems experienced by many customers who could not access their accounts. ""Obviously, if we had been aware of Sabis's shortcuts in the testing programme, the TSB board and I would never have pressed ahead with switching to the new system at that time."" The Slaughter and May report was commissioned by TSB. Another joint report by two regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, will be published at a later date. Those regulators have the power to fine and reprimand businesses and individuals.

PM and Corbyn to face off in TV election debate,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn locked horns over the NHS, Brexit and the Royal Family Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over Brexit in the first TV election debate of the campaign. Mr Johnson promised to ""end this national misery"" and said Labour offered ""only division and deadlock"". Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""get Brexit sorted by giving you, the people, the final say"". An average audience of 6.7m people watched the leaders lock horns over the NHS, trust and leadership, the future of Scotland - and the Royal Family. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear if either men had won or lost the debate but it was striking how the audience had been ready to laugh at their statements. A snap YouGov poll suggested the public were evenly split on who had won the debate, ""with most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won"". Tories criticised over 'factcheckUK' rebranding Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked How did the election debate play out online? Five things from the debate Reaction after Johnson and Corbyn go head-to-head Meanwhile, the Conservativesreceived criticismfor rebranding one of their Twitter accounts as ""factcheckUK"" during the debate. Will Moy, the chief executive of fact-checking website Full Fact, accused the party of trying to ""mislead"" voters and said Twitter ""could have acted sooner,"" including by forcibly renaming the account. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the move, saying it offered an ""instant rebuttal mechanism"" against ""nonsense thrown at the Conservatives"". The Electoral Commission said voters were entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners. It said it has no role in regulating campaign content but urged parties to ""undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""not impressed at all"" by the debate and said neither man was ""fit"" to be prime minister. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson dismissed the performances of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn as ""bluster and diversion from both of them"". Green Party co-leader Sian Berry expressed dismay at the ""climate chaos"" issue being ""relegated to the quickfire round in that debate"". And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Corbyn was the ""better debater"" but criticised him for not saying if he would Leave or Remain in a future referendum. The Lib Dems and SNP lost a court challengeto ITV's decision not to include their party leaders in the debate. The first half of the debate was dominated by questions on Brexit. Mr Johnson wants to win a majority in 12 December's general election so he can get the Brexit deal he struck with the EU into law and take the UK out of the bloc 31 January and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. Mr Corbyn says he would tear up Mr Johnson's agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU, with a customs union and a closer relationship with the single market, which he would then put to a public vote. A row broke out over the Labour leader's claim that US health firms will be given access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal. This video can not be played Moment Corbyn produces 'NHS dossier' Mr Corbyn told the PM: ""You are going to sell our National Health Service out to the United States and Big Pharma."" He held up redacted accounts of ""a series of secret meetings"" with the US, in which the government proposed ""full market access for US products to our NHS."" In response, Mr Johnson said the claims were ""an absolute invention"" and that there were ""no circumstances whatever in which this government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."" With Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. Read Laura's full blog The two leaders then clashed over whether Brexit put the future of the union between England and Scotland at risk. Mr Johnson claimed Labour would agree to another referendum on Scotland to get the support of the SNP and that isn't a price he would be willing to pay. But Mr Corbyn called the PM's comments ""nonsense"" and insisted his party would not form a coalition between with the SNP. Asked about the issue of trust, Mr Johnson said a toxic atmosphere in politics had been caused by MPs ""repeatedly refusing to honour the referendum"". The Labour leader said ""trust is something that has to be earned and as a public representative you have to listen"". He said his style of leadership was to ""listen to people and try to bring consensus"". Asked by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham if they would ""make a gesture"" to change the tone of the debate, the pair shook hands. Some audience members laughed at Mr Johnson's statement on trust, while others laughed at Mr Corbyn's statements on a Labour's proposal for a reduced working week and his party's Brexit stance. This video can not be played The two leaders had differing views on the monarchy On health, both men praised the NHS, with Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson describing it as ""one of the most civilised things about this country"" and ""one of the single most beautiful and brilliant things about Britain"" respectively. However they quickly differed over NHS management. Mr Corbyn called for an ""end to privatisation"" of services.  Mr Johnson insisted his party was not privatising the NHS. Asked if the monarchy was ""fit for purpose"", Mr Corbyn replied: ""Needs a bit of improvement."" Mr Johnson said: ""The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."" Asked if the Duke of York Prince Andrew was ""fit for the purpose"" following criticism over his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Mr Corbyn said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered"" adding ""nobody should be above the law"". Mr Johnson said ""The law must certainly take its course."" The final question pushed the leaders to say what Christmas present they would give each other. Mr Corbyn said he would get the PM a copy of Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ""and then he can understand how nasty Scrooge was"". Mr Johnson initially said he would buy the Labour leader ""a copy of my brilliant Brexit deal"" but when pushed to give a ""non-political answer"" he said he would get ""some damson jam"". Following the head-to-head between the Labour and Conservative leaders, the leaders of the Brexit Party, Greens, Lib Dems and SNP were interviewed separately on ITV. During her interview, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson emphasised her party's opposition to Brexit and said she could offer the country a ""better future"" than ""those two tired old parties"". She also said her party had plans for a frequent flyer tax to help combat climate change. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland's future"" and promised voters that her party would ensure people ""escape the chaos of Brexit"". She also insisted ""no deal has been done"" to form a coalition with the Labour Party in the event of a hung Parliament. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the current political system ""broken, rotten and corrupt"" and said he would change the voting system and scrap the House of Lords. Last up was Green Party co-leader Sian Berry, who accused Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson of failing properly to address climate change, which she said would leave young people feeling ""let down"". The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

By agreement with the broadcasters, each party is allowed a certain number according to its election strength and number of candidates fielded. Percentage swing The swing shows how far voter support for a party has changed between elections. It is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote won in a particular election to the figure obtained in the previous election. Polling day Election day Polling station Place where people go to cast their votes Postal vote People unable to get to a polling station are allowed to vote by post if they apply in advance. Proportional representation (PR) Any voting system where the share of seats represents the share of votes is described as proportional representation. The UK currently has a first past the post system. Prorogation Parliament is usually prorogued, or suspended, ahead of an election or Queen's Speech to allow for preparations. In September 2019 Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, but the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation unlawful and MPs returned to Parliament. Psephologist A person who studies voting and voting patterns. Purdah This is the time between the announcement of an election and the final election results. During this period media organisations have to ensure any political reporting is balanced and is not likely to influence the outcome of the election. Recount If a result is close, any candidate may ask for a recount. The process can be repeated several times if necessary until the candidates are satisfied. The returning officer has the final say on whether a recount takes place. Returning officer The official in charge of elections in each of the constituencies. On election night they read out the results for each candidate in alphabetical order by surname. Right wing Someone who is right wing in politics usually supports tradition and authority, as well as capitalism. The Conservative party is regarded as the main centre-right party in the UK. Safe seat A safe seat is a constituency where an MP has a sufficiently large majority to be considered unwinnable by the opposition. Spin room The attempt to place a favourable interpretation on an event so that people or the media will interpret it in that way. Those performing this act are known as spin doctors. Spoiled ballot Any ballot paper that is not marked clearly, eg with more than one box ticked or with writing scrawled across it, is described as a spoiled ballot and does not count towards the result. Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

'Hardcore' group still barricaded in HK campus,"This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Up to 200 anti-government protesters remain barricaded inside a Hong Kong university, surrounded by police, as the standoff continues for a third day. Those who are still inside Polytechnic University (PolyU) are said to be running low on supplies. Protesters have been inside the campus since last week, initially stopping police from entering by lighting fires and throwing petrol bombs. Adults who leave face arrest, and some are too scared to come out. Hundreds of protesters tried to run from the campus on Monday, but many were hit with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested. Police have revealed that on Monday alone, at the campus, they used: 1,458 tear gas canisters 1,391 rubber bullets 325 bean bag rounds 265 sponge bullets A small group of protesters managed to leave using rope ladders before being picked up and driven away by motorcyclists. Those arrested could be charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Protesters lower themselves down a rope from a bridge to a highway to escape the Polytechnic University campus On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus. Police later moved in, surrounding the campus, leading to protesters throwing petrol bombs and firing stones from catapults. The violence at PolyU is one of the biggest flare-ups Hong Kong has seen since protests broke out in June. Tuesday saw the UN human rights office urge the Hong Kong authorities to de-escalate the situation at PolyU and address the humanitarian situation of those inside which it said was ""clearly deteriorating"". This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met tear gas volleys It added that some demonstrators' use of violence, including against the police, ""cannot be condoned"". The mostly young protesters have five key demands, including an investigation into police brutality and universal suffrage. But underpinning it all is the fear Hong Kong's unique identity is threatened by China. Tensions now could be further inflamed after China condemned a decision by Hong Kong's high court to overturn a ban on facemasks. An estimated 100 to 200 protesters still remain in PolyU, authorities have said. One protester called Jeff told the BBC that he was hiding in a building on the campus. ""I have been trapped inside Polytechnic University for two days and food and water is running out,"" he said. ""Most people tried to get out of this hell-like place, most of them tried to escape but ended in failure, being arrested or wounded or something."" ""I didn't expect this incident to get so desperate in here. The campus is so desperate and I am not well prepared. I would call it a disaster."" He said his parents were concerned for his safety and he had told them he would make it out. Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words One tourist from mainland China is too scared to leave. He told BBC News Chinese that he was curious about what was going on at the university and had arrived on Sunday at the invitation of a friend who studies there. After a visit to the library and a meal, he learnt that police had cordoned off the whole area. ""I am not a rioter,"" the tourist, who wishes to stay anonymous said. ""I don't want to get caught and I just need to go back to China."" A handful of protesters have been trickling out of the university, some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries, according to news site SCMP. One protester said he had decided to come out because of ""hunger and cold"", adding that many inside were ""hurt without enough medical supplies"". Another 16-year-old protester told Reuters new agency she had chosen to ""surrender"". ""We have been trying to escape since yesterday morning. But then we couldn't find a way out [and] were afraid of being charged,"" she said. ""This is the only way... I was quite desperate."" In the early hours of Tuesday morning, more than 200 students below the age of 18 left, accompanied by education officials including high school principals. Those under the age of 18 had their identities recorded and were let go. Adults were arrested. A nun leading a protester out of PolyU Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam called on all protesters to surrender, saying no violence would happen if they came ""out in a peaceful manner"". However, she said police would have to take ""necessary action"" if that changed. Separately on Tuesday, Hong Kong's new police chief took office. Chris Tang said the force was not able to end the protests alone,external, saying the unrest would only end if society condemned the violence. A number of people have supported protesters behind the scenes, donating supplies to them or picking them up from protests and driving them home to avoid arrest. Pody Lui, BBC News Chinese, at PolyU We got into the university in the early hours of the morning. Police have cordoned off the area, making it almost impossible for new journalists to get in. Those trapped inside were desperate to get out. The mood darkened as the day continued. More and more protesters gave up and left the campus willingly to face police arrest. They will be charged with rioting, meaning they could be jailed for up to a decade. Those determined to stay were getting restless. They were not as friendly to journalists as before. They were scared and couldn't afford trusting a wrong person, fearing anyone could be an undercover police officer. I overheard a Polytechnic University student talking to her father on the phone. ""I don't want to get caught. I will lose everything if I do,"" she cried. Her tired friend next to her said, ""I just want to go home."" Hong Kong had previously banned protesters from wearing facemasks - but this was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by the city's high court on Monday. China has condemned the high court's decision. It says it has the sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in the region. Courts in Hong Kong have ruled on constitutional issues in the past. In 2017, the Court of Appeal found the Hong Kong government's decision to deny a partner visa to the wife of a female British expat was unconstitutional, despite the fact Hong Kong does not recognise same-sex marriage. It is unclear what action, if any, China might take next. This is a large part of what the ongoing protests in Hong Kong are about. Many in Hong Kong fear that its freedoms - including judicial independence - are slowly being eroded by Beijing. Campuses had remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests - despite the movement being led mainly by students and young people. But afterthe death of a 22-year-old student, that changed. Last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. Police revealed on Tuesday that some 3,900 petrol bombs were found at CUHK, adding that the university had 100 litres of sulphuric and nitric acids missing. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

Sydney blanketed by smoke from massive bushfires,"People in Sydney woke up to a city shrouded in smoke on Tuesday, as scores of bushfires rage across the region. Strong winds overnight brought smoke from fires inland, pushing the air quality in Australia's largest city to beyond ""hazardous"" levels at times. On social media, locals have described hazy skies and the stench of smoke in their homes. About five million people live in the state capital of New South Wales, which has been affected for weeks by fires. Six people have died in bushfires in the state's north since October. Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Rugby star's 'appalling' bushfire link draws anger Why extreme wildfires make their own storms How do you fight extreme wildfires? Sydney residents were warned about severe fire danger on Tuesday, as temperatures soared to 37C (98.6F) in the city's west. Parts of the city recorded air pollution levels at eight times higher than the national benchmark. Health officials advised people to stay indoors and avoid physical activity. They also shared first aid guides on how to help asthma sufferers and others with respiratory problems. ""The smoke is likely to hang around for the next few days,"" warned the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. This video can not be played People in Sydney woke up to a city shrouded in smoke on Tuesday, as bushfires rage across the region Frances Mao, BBC News, Sydney Sydney Opera House and the city skyline seen through a layer of smoke You could smell it the moment you woke up. At first I hoped that it was just my housemates smoking inside again - but I knew deep down it was another fire. The sky was a burnt grey. The first thing I checked on my phone wasn't Instagram, or emails, but the app I downloaded last week which shows where the bushfires are. Thankfully, no new fronts had sprung up overnight. But it's hard to predict these days - the blazes are so volatile and can flare up with a change in wind. I cut short my walk to work to get the bus instead. People were still coughing and spluttering on board. I made a mental note to buy a face mask - something I've never needed before in Sydney. Last week,Sydney faced unprecedented bushfire dangerwhen blazes hit its suburbs and parts of its outskirts. Authorities said the source of the smoke on Tuesday came from a blaze in Wollemi National Park, 150km (93 miles) north-west of the city, which had grown to 150,000 hectares in size. This video can not be played Warren Smith's home was destroyed in recent bushfires in Australia Close to 50 bushfires continue to burn in populated coastal and inland regions to the city's north. Authorities say 468 homes have been destroyed since blazes flared up on 8 November. Four people were confirmed to have died in the fires since then: Vivian Chaplain, 69, Julie Fletcher, 63, Barry Parsons, 58, and George Nole, whose age is unknown. They were found in separate locations in rural NSW. A couple, Bob Lindsey, 77, and Gwen Hyde, 68, were killed in a bushfire in the same regions in October. Many of the affected areas have experienced thick smoke and extremely poor air quality for weeks. Officials have warned that blazes could escalate later this week when heatwave conditions reach New South Wales and neighbouring Queensland, where scores of fires are burning. Meanwhile, a ""catastrophic"" fire danger warning has been issued for parts of South Australia. The state capital, Adelaide, is forecast to reach 42C on Wednesday. How do you fight extreme wildfires?

US settlement move 'endorses law of the jungle',"The mosque of the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Issawiya and the Maale Adumim settlement seen in the background Palestinians have condemned a decision by the US to abandon its four-decades-old position that Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank are inconsistent with international law. Chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said it threatened to replace international law with the ""law of the jungle"". But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US move, saying it ""rights a historical wrong"". The UN regards the settlements as being illegal under international law. Settlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. They have long been a source of dispute between Israel and the international community, and the Palestinians. This video can not be played Israelis and Palestinians react to the US decision to shift its policy on West Bank settlements On Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements is not, per se, inconsistent with international law"". The status of the West Bank, he added, was ""for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate"". The move was seen as a victory for Mr Netanyahu, who has pledged to apply Israeli sovereignty over all the settlements, as well as the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea. The Palestinians have long called for the removal of the settlements, where about 600,000 Jews live, arguing that their presence on land they claim for a future independent Palestinian state makes it almost impossible to make such a state a reality. ""Israeli colonial settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, are not only illegal under international law, they are war crimes,"" said Mr Erekat. ""Once the Trump administration decides to undermine international law... this constitutes a major threat to international peace and security."" This video can not be played Watch Mike Pompeo explain the shift in the US position Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""The United States is neither qualified nor is authorised to negate international legitimacy resolutions, and it has no right to give any legitimacy to Israeli settlement."" Palestinian militant groups also weighed in, calling it the official funeral of the Oslo peace process - which laid the foundations for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip - and urging stepped-up resistance to the Israeli occupation. In 2017, US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and ordered the relocation of the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. The decision was condemned by Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state, and the UN General Assembly demanded its cancellation. And earlier this year, Mr Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which were seized from Syria in the 1967 war. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Are there alternatives to a two-state solution? Mr Pompeo's announcement was made two days ahead of a deadline for Benny Gantz, Mr Netanyahu's political rival, to form a coalition government following an inconclusive general election in September. Mr Gantz was given the opportunity after Mr Netanyahu himself failed to form a ruling coalition. Hours later, the US state department alerted Americans planning to visit Jerusalem, West Bank or Gaza that ""those opposed to the secretary of state's announcement may target US [government] facilities, interests, and citizens"". In praising the US move, Mr Netanyahu said Israeli courts were the ""appropriate place"" to decide the legality of the settlements, ""not biased international forums that pay no attention to history or facts"". ""Israel remains ready and willing to conduct peace negotiations with the Palestinians regarding all final status issues in an effort to achieve a durable peace,"" he said, ""but will continue to reject all arguments regarding the illegality of the settlements."" This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Meanwhile, the UN human rights office reaffirmed its position that the settlements were unlawful, saying the change ""of one state does not modify existing international law nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the [UN] Security Council"". The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the bloc's position was that ""all settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace"". Ayman Safadi, Foreign Minister of Jordan - the custodian of a holy site in Jerusalem known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as the Temple Mount - said the change would ""kill"" a two-state solution, calling the settlements ""a blatant violation of international law"". Two years ago, Mr Trump promised a ""deal of the century"" to end the conflict created by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser. But, apart from an ambitious plan for investment in Palestinian areas and Arab countries, few details have been made public. Mike Pompeo said the decision would create the political space for a more likely resolution of the conflict. But that resolution is now more likely to be on Israel's terms, since it is by far the stronger party. Dismissing the international legal prohibitions on Jewish settlements undermines the legal framework for the peace process, including the notion of Palestinian national rights and the principle of self-determination. It will almost certainly boost the movement to expand and annex the Jewish settlements. There has already been a sharp increase in settlement planning and construction since Mr Trump took office. Palestinians will be dismayed, although not surprised. Palestinian analysts I have spoken with say the growth of Jewish settlements has essentially killed the potential for a viable two-state solution. They speak in terms of a war of position, saying that staying on the land and simply continuing their lives is a kind of non-violent resistance. In 1978, the Carter administration concluded that the establishment of civilian settlements was inconsistent with international law. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan disagreed with that conclusion, saying he did not believe the settlements were inherently illegal. Since then, the US has adopted a position of describing the settlements as ""illegitimate"" - though not ""illegal"" - and sheltering Israel from condemnatory resolutions on the issue at the United Nations. However, one of the last acts of the Obama administration, at the end of 2016, was to break with US practice by not vetoing a UN resolution that urged an end to illegal Israeli settlements. President Trump's administration has displayed a much more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity than President Obama's. Mr Pompeo said the Trump administration had studied all sides of the debate and agreed with Mr Reagan. Most of the international community, including the UN and the International Court of Justice, say the settlements are illegal. The basis for this is the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention which forbids the transfer by an occupying power of its people to occupied territory. However, Israel says the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the West Bank because, it says, the territory is not technically occupied. Israel says it is legally there as a result of a defensive war, and did not take control of the West Bank from a legitimate sovereign power. It says the legal right of Jewish settlement there, as recognised by the 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, was preserved under the UN's charter.

"Sweden drops Assange rape investigationSwedish prosecutors drop rape inquiry into Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently in custody in the UKEurope","This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Prosecutors in Sweden have dropped an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010. Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. The 48-year-old Australian was evicted in April and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline of saga The Swedish investigation had been shelved in 2017 but wasre-opened earlier this year following his eviction from the embassy. Separately, the US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010. Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson took the decision to ""discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange"", the Swedish Prosecution Authority said. ""The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,"" it added. Eva-Marie Persson said the decision had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses Ms Persson said: ""I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. ""Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation."" This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Prosecutors told reporters the decision to drop the inquiry had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses in the case. Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent With the end of Julian Assange's legal troubles in Sweden, one long chapter in the saga is over. But another one, in the United States, has barely begun. The Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police. Now Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail. From behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US. Assange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual. He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out. There was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation. Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: ""Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment."" Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,external. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a lengthy prison term. How likely is an Assange conviction in US? In June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US. Assange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London Assange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term. Buta judge ruled that Assange should remain in jailuntil his extradition hearing because of his ""history of absconding"". Last month,a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London in February.

"Grace died 'when sex act went wrong', says accused","University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand A British backpacker died when consensual sexual activity ""went wrong"", a court has heard. Grace Millane died on 1 December, the night before her 22nd birthday, while travelling in Auckland, New Zealand. A 27-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies her murder. His defence told Auckland High Court Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, died accidentally after being consensually choked during sex. The defendant has chosen not to give evidence himself. Prosecutors allege he strangled Ms Millane before disposing of her body. The court heard the pair had met through dating app Tinder and after drinking cocktails for several hours had returned to his hotel room at CityLife in Auckland's city centre. Ron Mansfield, defending the man, told the jury: ""If the couple engaged in consensual sexual activity and that went wrong, and no-one intended for it to go wrong, then that is not murder. ""And that is what [the defendant] has said took place, and that is what at the end you will be told the evidence reveals."" He said that while death from consensual choking was ""rare"", it was dangerous ""if two people are inebriated, relatively inexperienced and don't know each other too well"". Grace Millane was found buried in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland The man has admitted putting Ms Millane's body in a suitcase and burying it in the WaitÄkere Ranges, a mountainous woodland area outside Auckland.

"Grace died 'when sex act went wrong', says accusedThe man accused of murdering Grace Millane says she died accidentally during consensual sex.","University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand A British backpacker died when consensual sexual activity ""went wrong"", a court has heard. Grace Millane died on 1 December, the night before her 22nd birthday, while travelling in Auckland, New Zealand. A 27-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies her murder. His defence told Auckland High Court Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, died accidentally after being consensually choked during sex. The defendant has chosen not to give evidence himself. Prosecutors allege he strangled Ms Millane before disposing of her body. The court heard the pair had met through dating app Tinder and after drinking cocktails for several hours had returned to his hotel room at CityLife in Auckland's city centre. Ron Mansfield, defending the man, told the jury: ""If the couple engaged in consensual sexual activity and that went wrong, and no-one intended for it to go wrong, then that is not murder. ""And that is what [the defendant] has said took place, and that is what at the end you will be told the evidence reveals."" He said that while death from consensual choking was ""rare"", it was dangerous ""if two people are inebriated, relatively inexperienced and don't know each other too well"". Grace Millane was found buried in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland The man has admitted putting Ms Millane's body in a suitcase and burying it in the WaitÄkere Ranges, a mountainous woodland area outside Auckland. He told police he had ""freaked out"" after finding her dead in the morning after their date. ""He may not have done the right thing afterwards for fear no-one would believe him,"" Mr Mansfield told the jury.

Green manifesto pledges zero carbon by 2030The party wants to spend Â£100bn a year on tackling climate change - and calls for a new EU referendum.Election 2019Comments,"This video can not be played Jonathan Bartley: ""The green new deal is an an idea whose time has come"" The Green Party of England and Wales has launched its election manifesto with a pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2030. The party says it would invest Â£100bn a year by 2030 as part of a ""green new deal"" to tackle climate change - to be mainly paid for by borrowing. The party will also pledge to increase NHS funding, hold a Brexit referendum and extend voting to 16-year-olds. The party is standing in 497 of the 650 UK constituencies. Launching themanifesto,externalat an event in London, co-leader Jonathan Bartley said his party was proposing the ""most ambitious green new deal anywhere in the world"". He said the document would ""put us on track to decarbonise every single sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain"". ""Our very planet is raising the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years is simply not an option,"" he said. A simple guide to the Green Party Key Green Party manifesto promises explained How would the Greens fund Â£1tn climate pledge? How much will this be a climate change election? Brighton MP Caroline Lucas was the party's only MP elected in the last general election, but the Greens have had more success in the European Parliament, where they currently have seven MEPs. The party is stepping aside in 50 seats across England and Wales to make way for the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, as part of the ""Unite to Remain"" agreement. In exchange, the Lib Dems will not compete with the Greens in nine seats, including the Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Exeter and Brighton Pavilion. The general election takes place on 12 December. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote increase funding for the NHS by at least Â£6bn per year, until 2030 introduce a universal basic income of at least Â£89 per week for every adult by 2025 build 100,000 new zero carbon homes for social rent each year hold a further Brexit referendum, at which the party will campaign to remain in the EU introduce a proportional representation voting system and extend votes to 16 and 17-year-olds Ban the construction of nuclear power stations and fracking for gas and oil The party proposes borrowing Â£91.2bn a year to pay for capital expenditure. A further Â£9bn would be raised through tax changes including increasing corporation tax to 24%. The manifesto also includes a promise to put a carbon tax on energy and fossil fuel imports, increased over 10 years to make coal, oil and gas ""financially unviable"". Greens co-leader Sian Berry said the party would push for its policy programme to be implemented with 10 new pieces of legislation. ""Ten bills ready for the next Parliament to hit the ground running - because the future won't give us another chance to get these next two years right,"" she said. ""The more Green MPs we have, the more chance we have to save the future."" In October the Extinction Rebellion group held protests calling for governments to drastically cut carbon emissions By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton Try not to get too confused. The Greens aren't the only party promising a Green New Deal at this election. Labour agreed to something with the same name at its party conference earlier this year. But there's no doubt what the Green Party is proposing today is far more ambitious. Â£100bn every year for 10 years - or to put it more boldly, Â£1tn over 10 years - to fight climate change and give the UK a zero-carbon economy by 2030. The questions though, are big: even with that level of investment, how realistic is it to completely decarbonise the UK within a decade? Do the Greens want to see every petrol and diesel car off the road? Heavy industry operating with net zero emissions? Can carbon capture and storage technology, or sufficient renewable energy capacity, be developed in time? But after a year which has seen activism on climate change, be it school strikes or Extinction Rebellion, grabbing the headlines, the Green Party thinks the time is right for what it is calling the ""climate election"". Key Green Party manifesto promises explained Who should I vote for? Read our policy guide,external TheLib Dems are promising to spend Â£100bnover five years to tackle the effects of climate change. Delegates at the Labour Party's conference approved a motion calling for zero net emissions by 2030. But it remains to be seen how firm this target will be in the party's manifesto, due to be unveiled later this week. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told BBC Radio 4's programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". Labouris also proposing to insulate 27 million households, which it says would cut UK carbon emissions by 10% by 2030. The Conservatives have said they want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while the SNP says it wants a 100% reduction in emissions as soon as possible. The Conservatives, Lib Dems and the Brexit Party have all pledged to plant millions of trees over the coming years. Do you have any questions about the election?

"Breaking|Breaking newsSweden drops Assange rape investigationSwedish prosecutors drop rape inquiry into Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently in custody in the UKEurope","This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Prosecutors in Sweden have dropped an investigation into a rape allegation made against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange in 2010. Assange, who denies the accusation, has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. The 48-year-old Australian was evicted in April and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. He is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline of saga The Swedish investigation had been shelved in 2017 but wasre-opened earlier this year following his eviction from the embassy. Separately, the US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010. Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson took the decision to ""discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange"", the Swedish Prosecution Authority said. ""The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,"" it added. Eva-Marie Persson said the decision had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses Ms Persson said: ""I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. ""Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation."" This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Prosecutors told reporters the decision to drop the inquiry had been taken after interviews with seven witnesses in the case. Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent With the end of Julian Assange's legal troubles in Sweden, one long chapter in the saga is over. But another one, in the United States, has barely begun. The Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police. Now Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail. From behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US. Assange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual. He also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out. There was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation. Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: ""Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment."" Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,external. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a lengthy prison term. How likely is an Assange conviction in US? In June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US. Assange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London Assange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term. Buta judge ruled that Assange should remain in jailuntil his extradition hearing because of his ""history of absconding"". Last month,a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London in February.

"Sydney blanketed by smoke from massive bushfiresBushfires raging to the north of the city are creating a dense haze and ""hazardous"" air quality","People in Sydney woke up to a city shrouded in smoke on Tuesday, as scores of bushfires rage across the region. Strong winds overnight brought smoke from fires inland, pushing the air quality in Australia's largest city to beyond ""hazardous"" levels at times. On social media, locals have described hazy skies and the stench of smoke in their homes. About five million people live in the state capital of New South Wales, which has been affected for weeks by fires. Six people have died in bushfires in the state's north since October. Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Rugby star's 'appalling' bushfire link draws anger Why extreme wildfires make their own storms How do you fight extreme wildfires? Sydney residents were warned about severe fire danger on Tuesday, as temperatures soared to 37C (98.6F) in the city's west. Parts of the city recorded air pollution levels at eight times higher than the national benchmark. Health officials advised people to stay indoors and avoid physical activity. They also shared first aid guides on how to help asthma sufferers and others with respiratory problems. ""The smoke is likely to hang around for the next few days,"" warned the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. This video can not be played People in Sydney woke up to a city shrouded in smoke on Tuesday, as bushfires rage across the region Frances Mao, BBC News, Sydney Sydney Opera House and the city skyline seen through a layer of smoke You could smell it the moment you woke up. At first I hoped that it was just my housemates smoking inside again - but I knew deep down it was another fire. The sky was a burnt grey. The first thing I checked on my phone wasn't Instagram, or emails, but the app I downloaded last week which shows where the bushfires are. Thankfully, no new fronts had sprung up overnight. But it's hard to predict these days - the blazes are so volatile and can flare up with a change in wind. I cut short my walk to work to get the bus instead. People were still coughing and spluttering on board. I made a mental note to buy a face mask - something I've never needed before in Sydney. Last week,Sydney faced unprecedented bushfire dangerwhen blazes hit its suburbs and parts of its outskirts. Authorities said the source of the smoke on Tuesday came from a blaze in Wollemi National Park, 150km (93 miles) north-west of the city, which had grown to 150,000 hectares in size. This video can not be played Warren Smith's home was destroyed in recent bushfires in Australia Close to 50 bushfires continue to burn in populated coastal and inland regions to the city's north. Authorities say 468 homes have been destroyed since blazes flared up on 8 November. Four people were confirmed to have died in the fires since then: Vivian Chaplain, 69, Julie Fletcher, 63, Barry Parsons, 58, and George Nole, whose age is unknown. They were found in separate locations in rural NSW. A couple, Bob Lindsey, 77, and Gwen Hyde, 68, were killed in a bushfire in the same regions in October. Many of the affected areas have experienced thick smoke and extremely poor air quality for weeks. Officials have warned that blazes could escalate later this week when heatwave conditions reach New South Wales and neighbouring Queensland, where scores of fires are burning.

Charities call for homeless shelter to open earlyAn unexpected cold snap has seen winter supplies run low before seasonal appeals have even begun.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Charities in Glasgow are calling on the city council to open its winter shelter early after an unexpected cold snap saw temperatures plummet below freezing. Concern was raised after the death of a man who was found in acity centre car parkon Sunday although the council has now established he was not homeless. Temperatures in Scotland fell to -8.1C (17.4F) on Sunday, while it was -8C (17.6F) in Glasgow on Monday night. The city's winter night shelter is not due to open its doors until 1 December. Glasgow City Mission which runs the shelter, said it was monitoring the situation to see if action needed to be taken earlier. Glasgow's Health and Social Care partnership said that while the death of the man found in the car park was a ""tragedy"",  it was not directly related to provision of the temporary shelter service. A spokeswoman said: ""The man who died tragically after becoming unwell in a car park on Sunday was not homeless. Sadly, his death is believed to be drug-related. ""However, concerns about adverse weather and rough sleepers are completely understandable and as happens every year, homelessness services have already worked with partners, including Glasgow City Mission, on winter contingency plans which will be activated in exceptional circumstances."" Street charities have claimed Glasgow City Council is ""failing"" homeless people after almost Â£3m of budget cuts to services came into force on 1 October. These cuts affected 970 temporary properties managed by service providers for the council across the city, and equate to the loss of 99 beds. Simon Community Scotland, one of the organisations GCC employs to provide services to homeless people sleeping on the streets in Glasgow, said its supplies were running dangerously low. The charity plans for the coldest weather to come in February in March, so the past week's low temperatures have been a challenge. Director of services Hugh Hill told the BBC: ""We are rapidly going through our stocks of winter supplies - thermals, sleeping bags etc. We are flying through them and we are not due to launch our appeal until December."" Shelter staged a protest outside the city chambers in Glasgow last summer The Glasgow Winter Night Shelter opens on 1 December until 31 March. It is run by Glasgow City Mission on behalf of the council and several other partner charities and agencies to provide overnight emergency accommodation. The charity said it was monitoring overnight temperatures ""in case there's a requirement for an emergency shelter in the run up to 1 December"". A spokesman said: ""If this is necessary, we will call upon previously trained staff and volunteers to staff these nights. It is essential that any night shelter, emergency or planned, is a safe place for our guests. We will ensure the proper procedures and fully trained staff are in place."" Sean Clerkin, campaigns co-ordinator for the Scottish Tenants Organisation, says more buildings need to be made available for emergency accommodation. He said: ""We are calling for Glasgow City Council to open up some public buildings to house the homeless overnight. ""They need to provide a warm, secure environment with food, sleeping bags and medical advice."" In October the homelessness charity Shelter Scotlandannounced it was mounting a legal action against the council, claiming it was failing in its legal duty to provide temporary accommodation. It followed concerns over ""gatekeeping"", where a homeless person is denied access to services and the charity claimed people have been illegally denied a place in temporary accommodation. But the council said its services face ""significant, perhaps unique"" pressures compared to other parts of Scotland. The Winter night shelter will not open until 1 December The homelessness charity Crisis said there was  a wider failure by society to address the issues that lead to homelessness. Crisis Scotland director Grant Campbell told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland it was likely ""society didn't fail this individual last night or the night before but just over the past 10 years, 15 years, 20 years."" He added: ""Statistically we find out that often people who are stuck on the streets have been through sometimes a life of care, have been in and out of prison, often struggle with mental health issues. ""Society has had a touch point with an individual for many, many years and occasions - so this failure wasn't just at one point but was for a prolonged period of time."" Mr Campbell, however, said he believed temporary shelters were ""not the solution"". ""There is great compassion in society to say we want to do the right thing for people and that often leads us to build shelters,"" he said. ""However, the real challenge, if we really want to find solutions, is actually to look at housing. Each year we say 'we don't have enough housing, let's put a shelter in place', the temptation to grow shelters means we will fill more of them and they go on for longer. ""Next year we could have two or three and not move away from that. We have got to keep challenging Scottish government and local government to do more regarding housing and look for other solutions, which there are.""

It is essential that any night shelter, emergency or planned, is a safe place for our guests. We will ensure the proper procedures and fully trained staff are in place."" Sean Clerkin, campaigns co-ordinator for the Scottish Tenants Organisation, says more buildings need to be made available for emergency accommodation. He said: ""We are calling for Glasgow City Council to open up some public buildings to house the homeless overnight. ""They need to provide a warm, secure environment with food, sleeping bags and medical advice."" In October the homelessness charity Shelter Scotlandannounced it was mounting a legal action against the council, claiming it was failing in its legal duty to provide temporary accommodation. It followed concerns over ""gatekeeping"", where a homeless person is denied access to services and the charity claimed people have been illegally denied a place in temporary accommodation. But the council said its services face ""significant, perhaps unique"" pressures compared to other parts of Scotland. The Winter night shelter will not open until 1 December The homelessness charity Crisis said there was  a wider failure by society to address the issues that lead to homelessness. Crisis Scotland director Grant Campbell told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland it was likely ""society didn't fail this individual last night or the night before but just over the past 10 years, 15 years, 20 years."" He added: ""Statistically we find out that often people who are stuck on the streets have been through sometimes a life of care, have been in and out of prison, often struggle with mental health issues. ""Society has had a touch point with an individual for many, many years and occasions - so this failure wasn't just at one point but was for a prolonged period of time."" Mr Campbell, however, said he believed temporary shelters were ""not the solution"". ""There is great compassion in society to say we want to do the right thing for people and that often leads us to build shelters,"" he said. ""However, the real challenge, if we really want to find solutions, is actually to look at housing. Each year we say 'we don't have enough housing, let's put a shelter in place', the temptation to grow shelters means we will fill more of them and they go on for longer. ""Next year we could have two or three and not move away from that. We have got to keep challenging Scottish government and local government to do more regarding housing and look for other solutions, which there are.""

US settlement move 'endorses law of the jungle'Palestinians condemn the US for saying Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank are not illegal.Middle East,"The mosque of the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Issawiya and the Maale Adumim settlement seen in the background Palestinians have condemned a decision by the US to abandon its four-decades-old position that Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank are inconsistent with international law. Chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said it threatened to replace international law with the ""law of the jungle"". But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US move, saying it ""rights a historical wrong"". The UN regards the settlements as being illegal under international law. Settlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. They have long been a source of dispute between Israel and the international community, and the Palestinians. This video can not be played Israelis and Palestinians react to the US decision to shift its policy on West Bank settlements On Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements is not, per se, inconsistent with international law"". The status of the West Bank, he added, was ""for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate"". The move was seen as a victory for Mr Netanyahu, who has pledged to apply Israeli sovereignty over all the settlements, as well as the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea. The Palestinians have long called for the removal of the settlements, where about 600,000 Jews live, arguing that their presence on land they claim for a future independent Palestinian state makes it almost impossible to make such a state a reality. ""Israeli colonial settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, are not only illegal under international law, they are war crimes,"" said Mr Erekat. ""Once the Trump administration decides to undermine international law... this constitutes a major threat to international peace and security."" This video can not be played Watch Mike Pompeo explain the shift in the US position Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""The United States is neither qualified nor is authorised to negate international legitimacy resolutions, and it has no right to give any legitimacy to Israeli settlement."" Palestinian militant groups also weighed in, calling it the official funeral of the Oslo peace process - which laid the foundations for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip - and urging stepped-up resistance to the Israeli occupation. In 2017, US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and ordered the relocation of the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. The decision was condemned by Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state, and the UN General Assembly demanded its cancellation. And earlier this year, Mr Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which were seized from Syria in the 1967 war. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Are there alternatives to a two-state solution? Mr Pompeo's announcement was made two days ahead of a deadline for Benny Gantz, Mr Netanyahu's political rival, to form a coalition government following an inconclusive general election in September. Mr Gantz was given the opportunity after Mr Netanyahu himself failed to form a ruling coalition. Hours later, the US state department alerted Americans planning to visit Jerusalem, West Bank or Gaza that ""those opposed to the secretary of state's announcement may target US [government] facilities, interests, and citizens"". In praising the US move, Mr Netanyahu said Israeli courts were the ""appropriate place"" to decide the legality of the settlements, ""not biased international forums that pay no attention to history or facts"". ""Israel remains ready and willing to conduct peace negotiations with the Palestinians regarding all final status issues in an effort to achieve a durable peace,"" he said, ""but will continue to reject all arguments regarding the illegality of the settlements."" This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Meanwhile, the UN human rights office reaffirmed its position that the settlements were unlawful, saying the change ""of one state does not modify existing international law nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the [UN] Security Council"". The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the bloc's position was that ""all settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace"". Ayman Safadi, Foreign Minister of Jordan - the custodian of a holy site in Jerusalem known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as the Temple Mount - said the change would ""kill"" a two-state solution, calling the settlements ""a blatant violation of international law"". Two years ago, Mr Trump promised a ""deal of the century"" to end the conflict created by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser. But, apart from an ambitious plan for investment in Palestinian areas and Arab countries, few details have been made public. Mike Pompeo said the decision would create the political space for a more likely resolution of the conflict. But that resolution is now more likely to be on Israel's terms, since it is by far the stronger party. Dismissing the international legal prohibitions on Jewish settlements undermines the legal framework for the peace process, including the notion of Palestinian national rights and the principle of self-determination. It will almost certainly boost the movement to expand and annex the Jewish settlements. There has already been a sharp increase in settlement planning and construction since Mr Trump took office. Palestinians will be dismayed, although not surprised. Palestinian analysts I have spoken with say the growth of Jewish settlements has essentially killed the potential for a viable two-state solution. They speak in terms of a war of position, saying that staying on the land and simply continuing their lives is a kind of non-violent resistance. In 1978, the Carter administration concluded that the establishment of civilian settlements was inconsistent with international law. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan disagreed with that conclusion, saying he did not believe the settlements were inherently illegal. Since then, the US has adopted a position of describing the settlements as ""illegitimate"" - though not ""illegal"" - and sheltering Israel from condemnatory resolutions on the issue at the United Nations. However, one of the last acts of the Obama administration, at the end of 2016, was to break with US practice by not vetoing a UN resolution that urged an end to illegal Israeli settlements. President Trump's administration has displayed a much more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity than President Obama's. Mr Pompeo said the Trump administration had studied all sides of the debate and agreed with Mr Reagan. Most of the international community, including the UN and the International Court of Justice, say the settlements are illegal. The basis for this is the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention which forbids the transfer by an occupying power of its people to occupied territory. However, Israel says the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the West Bank because, it says, the territory is not technically occupied. Israel says it is legally there as a result of a defensive war, and did not take control of the West Bank from a legitimate sovereign power. It says the legal right of Jewish settlement there, as recognised by the 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, was preserved under the UN's charter. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved?

Taliban 'swap Western hostages for top militants'Two university professors have been freed in exchange for three high-ranking Taliban prisoners.Asia,"Australian Timothy Weeks (left) and US citizen Kevin King appeared dishevelled in video in 2017 The Afghan Taliban have freed two Western academics held hostage since 2016 in exchange for three imprisoned senior militants. American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks were released three years after being kidnapped outside the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul where they worked as professors. The three militants arrived in Qatar from Afghanistan as part of the swap. Afghan officials say the deal is aimed at restarting talks with the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani said last week the decision was ""a tough, but important"" one and a ""humanitarian gesture"". Inside the prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban Who are the Taliban? Why is there a war in Afghanistan? The swap includes Anas Haqqani, a leading figure and fund-raiser in the Haqqani militant group, and two other senior commanders, who had been held in prison by Afghan authorities. Anas Haqqani's older brother, Sirajuddin, leads the Haqqani network of fighters and is a deputy leader of the Taliban, which has a political office in Qatar. The Taliban also announced they had released 10 captured Afghan National Security Force members, saying the  prisoner exchange had been ""successfully executed"". ""These actions are a step forward in good-will and confidence building measures that can aid the peace process,"" the group said in a statement. The two professors of English were ambushed by gunmen and taken from a vehicle while leaving their university campus in Kabul in August 2016. US Navy Seals attempted a rescue mission several days later but Mr Weeks, originally from Wagga Wagga in Australia, and Mr King, from Pennsylvania, had been moved on just hours before. The pair then appeared in a video, released in January 2017, appealing to then US President-elect Donald Trump to agree to a deal to secure their release. On Tuesday, a Taliban source in southern Afghanistan told the BBC the pair had been handed over in the Nawbahar district of Zabul province at 10:00 local time (05:30 GMT). This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? According to a local police officer, who was involved in the swap, a 48-hour ceasefire was observed before the swap. The men were then flown away in a US helicopter. The condition of the two men remains unclear, but in his speech last week Mr Ghani noted ""their health has been deteriorating while in the custody of the terrorists"". The American University of Afghanistan said in a statement that it ""shares the relief of the families of Kevin and Timothy, and we look forward to providing all the support we can"" to the two men and their families. Anas Haqqani, Haji Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid were sent to Qatar as part of the exchange. Haqqani is a leading figure in the Haqqani group, a militant group founded by his father Jalaluddin Haqqani, and now led by his older brother, Sirajuddin, who is also deputy leader of the Taliban, BBC Urdu's Riffat Orakzai says. Another four of his brothers been killed in various security operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The surviving family members are in hiding. The Haqqani network has been behind many of the co-ordinated attacks on Afghan and Nato forces in recent years and has been blamed for some of the deadliest blasts in the country, including a truck bomb in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people. Pakistan has been accused by the West of backing the Haqqani network to counter the influence of arch-rival India in Afghanistan, a charge it denies. Anas Haqqani, pictured in 2014, was flown to Qatar Anas was arrested in Bahrain in 2014. It is believed his captors, the Americans, kept him in a prison in the UAE for some time until he was handed over to the Afghan government in Kabul and imprisoned at Bagram air base. Hafiz Rashid is a senior Taliban commander who was involved in equipping suicide bombers and helped choose their targets, according to The New York Times. His brother is a member of the Taliban negotiating team in Qatar. Little is known about Haji Mali Khan, who is said to be a senior commander. Analysis by Auliya Atrafi, BBC Afghan, Kabul This is a huge gamble for President Ghani. The image of Anas Haqqani has been used by critics of the government and civil society protesters to represent the most extreme part of the Taliban - the part responsible for some of the deadliest and most high profile attacks in the heart of Kabul which left hundreds of civilians killed or wounded. The government recently said releasing him was a red line - but now it's being taunted for having crossed that very line. If this release is followed by a reduction in violence, it could repair the damage, but that remains to be seen. People protest against the prisoner swap in Kabul, Afghanistan However, on a positive point: the government managed the deal in a way which made it appear like it was in charge, and not the Americans. To drive this point home, the government seems to have delayed the planned release last week until there was an understanding with the Taliban. Officials hope this will make the Taliban accept direct talks with the Afghan government - something the militants have always refused up until now. The Scottish aid worker killed during a rescue attempt The documentary maker freed 'for a ransom' The governor's son who secretly listened to football The captured soldier who sparked a political row The talks collapsed in September, after President Donald Trump had invited senior Taliban leaders and Afghan president Ashraf Ghani to meet at Camp David, near Washington DC, aiming to end the US' longest war. But a Taliban attack in the Afghan capital two days earlier, which killed a US soldier and 11 others, prompted Mr Trump to pull out, saying the group ""probably don't have the power to negotiate"" if they were unable to agree to a ceasefire during talks. Mr Ghani said in a televised speech that the exchangeaimed to ""facilitate direct peace negotiations."",externalHowever, the Taliban have long refused to negotiate with Mr Ghani's administration, calling it a puppet of the US.

TSB board 'lacked common sense' before IT meltdown,"The board of TSB has been accused of a lack of ""common sense"" in the run-up to IT failures that left up to 1.9 million customers unable to bank online, some for several weeks, in April 2018. An independent report into the incident by law firm Slaughter and May blamed both TSB and IT provider Sabis. Customers were moved on to a new system, but the report said it had not been tested properly before going live. It found that the tests only took place offline and not in a live environment. It said that TSB accepted that had tests been run across both systems, it might have been able to identify the issues which affected customers before they happened. MPs demand action over rise in online bank crashes TSB suffers Â£105m loss after computer chaos TSB investigated over IT meltdown ""We have concluded that the new platform was not ready to support TSB's full customer base and Sabis was not ready to operate the new platform,"" the report said. ""While the TSB board asked a number of pertinent questions... there were certain additional common sense challenges that the TSB board did not put to the executive. ""These included why it was reasonable to expect that TSB would be 'migration ready' only four months later than originally planned, when certain workstreams were as much as seven months behind schedule."" The report also said that there were more than 2,000 defects relating to testing at the time the system went live, but the board were only told about 800. Other failings by TSB that it identified included setting ""unnecessary"" time constraints, which did not understand the complexity of the project, and being dishonest about the reasons for delays. TSB is part of the Spanish banking group Sabadell and its in-house IT provider Sabis built the system. The IT failure has cost TSB a total of Â£330m for customer compensation, fraud losses and other expenses. The IT fiasco at TSB left many thousands of customers in difficulty, calls were unanswered for 90 minutes and fraud attacks were 70 times higher than usual levels at their peak, the report reveals. Among those affected was photographer Paul Clarke, who could not use his accounts and was defrauded in the confusion. He says he left the bank as soon as was reasonably possible. ""After the fraud, there was a complete demolition of trust,"" he says. ""I was left for two weeks without being able to function financially."" Photographer Paul Clarke's business was affected by TSB's meltdown He was annoyed about the fraud, although the money was later refunded, but more so about the response from TSB to the situation. He described the failures of the IT switchover as ""basic stuff"". The timing of the IT mess could not have been worse for Sally and Chris Jones - TSB mortgage holders - whose house move turned into24 hours of chaos. ""It was terrible timing for us, that they were not ready [with the IT switchover],"" says Mrs Jones. Chris and Sally Jones spent 24 hours fearing they could be left stranded Problems at TSB meant funds were not released so they were stuck in limbo, waiting outside their new home in a removals van, facing the prospect of staying overnight in a hotel. ""It was all very chaotic,"" she says. Eventually they got inside, but there were still problems with completing the purchase and early in the mortgage term. They were compensated and have not had problems since, so have remained as customers. TSB executive chairman Richard Meddings said: ""Slaughter and May's report sets out a number of findings on aspects of the planning and preparation for migration which they believe could have been done differently. ""In light of the disruption customers experienced, TSB has made important changes to enable the bank to rebuild - including to leadership and management structures, as well as the decision to take direct control of its IT operations. ""Importantly, TSB has long since compensated every eligible customer who was impacted by the disruption."" Paul Pester left the bank in September 2018 TSB's former chief executive Paul Pester,who quit his job a few months after the incident,said: ""If these findings are right, Sabis rolled the dice by running tests on only one of TSB's two new data centres and this decision was kept from me and the rest of the TSB board. ""The report explains that this made it impossible for the TSB board to anticipate the serious problems experienced by many customers who could not access their accounts. ""Obviously, if we had been aware of Sabis's shortcuts in the testing programme, the TSB board and I would never have pressed ahead with switching to the new system at that time."" The Slaughter and May report was commissioned by TSB. Another joint report by two regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, will be published at a later date. Those regulators have the power to fine and reprimand businesses and individuals.

Charges against Mr Deen were later dropped. He believes not killing him would have risked British casualties. ""I didn't feel like I did anything wrong,"" Mr Deen said. ""He was going to die anyway. He was probably already dead,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Mr Deen is speaking out for the first time, after a military court lifted an anonymity order. Charges against Mr Deen were dropped in February. He left the Marines in 2015 The insurgent who was killed had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter. He was shot by Blackman in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Mr Deen admitted he had told comrades: ""Let's just put one in his head, let's just do it."" He added: ""I said, 'I'll shoot him'."" The ex-Marine said that at the time the group had felt ""exposed"", having stormed a Taliban compound. ""We were like, 'What are we doing here? Let's just get out of here',"" he said. ""I was trying to influence it in a way to try and hurry up and get things done - and fit in as well."" Once the Taliban fighter had been shot, he said, ""It was like, 'Right that's done, let's just go'. ""It had to be that way. He was going to die anyway."" Mr Deen says he has struggled with his mental health Mr Deen said he was in Gibraltar - in October 2012 - when he first heard he was to be charged by British police. ""I was like... 'How can you charge me with full-on murder when I didn't kill anyone?' ""The whole situation was used as a scapegoat for the military. They had to be seen to be doing something. ""If they were going to do that, they should bring up thousands of cases in every single war."" Four months later charges against Mr Deen were dropped. He left the Royal Marines in 2015. It was then, he said, that his mental health suffered. ""I left the blanket of the military, the cover of protection, and then you're just a civilian now. ""I just totally went off the rails... hit rock bottom in my mind, in my brain."" Last year, he attempted to end his life. ""I was having panic attacks. I just thought, 'I don't want to live like this anymore'. I tried to take an overdose. ""You go from being a Royal Marine in control, knowing what he's doing in life, to then leaving and losing control."" Sgt Alexander Blackman - also known as Marine A - was released from prison in 2017 Blackman, Mr Deen's former comrade, was initially convicted of the insurgent's murder. This was reduced to manslaughter on appeal and he was released from prison in April 2017, having served more than three years. He told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that after a ""difficult"" time he was now moving on from the incident, ensuring it did not ""define who I am"". ""I look back and there's a lot to be proud of [from my time in the Royal Marines], I did a lot of things,"" he said. Blackman has now started a new role with not-for-profit community organisation ExFor+, supporting veterans returning to civilian life. ""The Royal Marines family as a whole have been very welcoming, very supportive when I've needed it. So for me it's not been too bad at all,"" he explained. Sgt Blackman had more than 13 years of service in the Armed Forces When Blackman was released from prison in 2017, judges were told he had a recognised mental illness at the time of the killing, in September 2011. He said this had been ""situation and location-specific"", and he was no longer suffering the same effects. But he said more needed to be done to help those who were struggling and ""perhaps slip throughout the cracks"". ""I've had colleagues I've worked with who, unfortunately, have taken their lives recently since they've left service, because they were struggling with mental health issues and they've kept it bottled up,"" he said. Mr Deen is now aiming to climb the highest mountain on each continent One of those being helped by ExFor+ is Mr Deen, who has challenged himself to climb the ""seven summits"" - the highest mountains across the seven continents of the world. ""Week by week, day by day, I'm changing,"" he said. ""When I started climbing it gave me the boost I needed, like I'm achieving something."" Update 19 November: An earlier version of this story said Mr Deen had been acquitted of murder. This has been changed to say that charges were dropped.

New Epstein accuser calls on Prince Andrew to talk,"This video can not be played Jane Doe 15: ""Epstein wielded great villainous power"" A woman has come forward to accuse the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein of sexually abusing her as a 15 year old, and urged Prince Andrew to share information on his former friend. The accuser, identified as ""Jane Doe 15"", told reporters she had suffered a ""vicious, prolonged sexual assault"". She is the latest of more than a dozen women to sue Epstein's estate for alleged sexual abuses. It comes amid controversy over Prince Andrew's ties to the sex offender. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Six things we learned from the Prince Andrew interview KPMG ends sponsorship of Prince Andrew's scheme In aninterview with the BBC aired on Saturday, Prince Andrew was pressed on his friendship with Epstein, and an accusation made by Virginia Giuffre that he had sex with her at Epstein's house when Ms Giuffre was 17. This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' Prince Andrew denied having sex with Ms Giuffre, but the interview created a wave of criticism directed at the royal. Accountancy firm KPMG on Monday announced it would not renew its sponsorship of the prince's entrepreneurship initiative, Pitch@Palace. Jane Doe 15, now 31, gave a press conference in Los Angeles on Monday with her lawyer, Gloria Allred. She accused Epstein of abusing her at his New Mexico ranch when she was 15, after she had met his secretary during a 2004 school trip to New York. According to her lawsuit, the secretary told her Epstein was interested in helping girls from poorer backgrounds. She was flown on his private jet to his ranch in New Mexico with several other young girls, she said. She alleges he told her to give him a massage, then sexually assaulted her. ""Epstein took my sexual innocence,"" she said during the press conference. A picture from the lawsuit showing ""Jane Doe 15"" as a teenager Epstein, 66, hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14. He was already a convicted sex offender, having been jailed in Florida in 2008 for procuring a minor for prostitution. Jane Doe 15 did not accuse Prince Andrew of any wrongdoing but called on him to come forward with more information. ""Prince Andrew, and any others who were close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have,"" she said. According to her lawyer, she called on Prince Andrew to ""voluntarily meet with the FBI and prosecutors who are investigating this criminal case in New York, and also to provide his deposition under oath"". While Epstein's death ended the federal government's prosecution of him, the criminal investigation that led to the charges is ongoing. The FBI and federal prosecutors continue to investigate the crimes, including a conspiracy charge, which could implicate Epstein associates. French prosecutors have also opened aninquiry into rape allegations against Epstein, who had an apartment in Paris. Meanwhile, lawsuits against the Epstein estate continue to arise, with Jane Doe 15's being the latest. This video can not be played Accuser Maria Farmer describes surveillance in Jeffery Epstein's home In other suits against the estate: Jennifer Araoz alleges she was sexually abused by Epstein when she was 14 and 15, including a forcible rape. Her lawsuit also names long-time Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell and three other female staff members Annie Farmer says she was 16 when Epstein groped, harassed and pressed his genitals against her. Her sister, Maria Farmer, says she was 20 when Epstein sexually abused her Juliette Bryant says Epstein forcibly raped her multiple times when she was 20 Teresa Helm says she was 22 when she visited Epstein's home for an interview to be a travelling masseuse and he sexually assaulted her Some accusers have remained anonymous, while others have come forward but have not filed lawsuits. Many of the women's accounts allege they were recruited to give massages to Epstein, with the massages leading to sexual abuse. Many also include promises made by Epstein to help them with things like college tuition, medical expenses or advancing their careers. Jennifer Araoz says Epstein raped her in 2002 when she was 15 Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview KPMG ends sponsorship of Prince Andrew's scheme LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Income tax rise will boost NHS budget - Lib Dems,"Adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax will allow the Liberal Democrats to spend more on the NHS if they get into power, the party says. The party said the tax hike will allow it to invest an extra Â£26bn a year above inflation by 2023-24 compared to what was being invested last year. That matchesLabour's general election pledge on health, the Lib Dems said. It equates to a rise of 3.9% rise on average each year, compared to the government's plan of 3.4%. More money would also be put into social care and other areas of health spending, including training, buildings and public health, under Lib Dem proposals. 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS Does UK lag other rich nations on health and care? A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats Speaking during a campaign visit to a hospital in Southampton, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said funding was ""not the only problem the NHS faces"". She said staffing vacancies had been ""made worse by the Conservatives"" and would be further worsened by the UK's departure from the EU. ""We've already lost 5,000 nurses from other EU countries - we can't afford to lose 5,000 nurses when we've got big shortages,"" she added. The penny rise in all the income tax bands would also mean more money for the health services in Wales and Northern Ireland. Under devolution, the Scottish government has control over income tax policy. Overall the tax rise would raise Â£7bn a year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the party said. The Health Foundation think-tank said the extra funding, if the Lib Dems win 12 December's general election, would help the NHS keep pace with rising demand, but was still short of what was needed to truly ""modernise"" the service.

Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.  It is hard to tell at this stage. Despite unveiling spending plans, there are still some details that are unclear. For example, Labour has only committed to what the budget will be in 2023-24, not a breakdown for each year so it is not known what its total spending commitments are worth for the whole period. Both the Tories - under their plans announced under Theresa May's premiership - and the Lib Dems, with this announcement, have provided these details for the front-line budget. There is then the wider health budget, which covers things like buildings, training and public health. The Tories have not set out what they would spend on these areas beyond next year. These budgets account for Â£17bn of the overall Â£138bn spending planned on health this year. However, both the Lib Dems and Labour have. The Lib Dems have also set out extra investment for social care - promising more than Â£3bn extra by 2023-24 to plug the shortfall in spending the Local Government Association is forecasting. There are also doubts over whether the spending plans are exactly like-for-like. The Tories have committed to providing NHS England with extra funding to meet rising pension costs. This may mean the spending claims of extra funds made by the other parties are not quite as generous as they seem. What is clear, however, is that all three main political parties are promising extra money - above what the NHS has been getting since 2010. The priorities for that extra spending - reducing waiting times, employing extra staff and investing in buildings - are also very similar.

EasyJet relaunches package holiday business,"EasyJet is relaunching its package holiday business as the airline looks to fill the gap in the industry left by Thomas Cook's demise earlier this year. About 20 million people fly with EasyJet to Europe annually but only 500,000 book accommodation through it. The news came as the carrier reported a 26% fall in pre-tax profits to Â£427m for the year to 30 September. EasyJet also said it would become the world's first major net zero carbon airline by offsetting carbon emissions. Chief executive Johan Lundgren told the BBC's Today programme: ""This is not a long-term solution, offsetting is not perfect. ""I don't think it's greenwashing, everyone recognises that it works, but this is in addition to the fact that since 2000, we've reduced our carbon emissions by 30%."" He said that the company would take on the Â£25m cost and added: ""That's not something we're adding on to ticket prices, which makes us one of the largest carbon emissions offsetting companies in the world."" 'We get our money's worth with package holidays' Passenger on wrong EasyJet flight causes Liverpool Airport security scare Thomas Cook airport slots bought by EasyJet and Jet2 Explaining the decision to relaunch its package holidays, EasyJet said: ""The total European package holidays market is worth around Â£61bn per year. The UK alone is a Â£13bn market and has grown by 6% annually. ""The way that customers are taking holidays is changing and we know customers want holidays with various durations and not the traditional seven and 14 nights. Philip Petty and his wife Lyn now prefer not to go on package holidays Not everyone thinks Easyjet's bet on the package holiday market is a good idea. Philip Petty says he has been booking holiday and flights separately ""for years"". ""Not only can I choose what time I want to fly, I like to hand-pick where I stay,"" he says. ""You can get a better price when you book directly with a hotel."" Mr Petty was on a package holiday in Greece and slipped on a wet floor at a hotel, breaking his leg. He felt he and his wife had little support from the reps, which led him to start looking at independent holidays. ""EasyJet is excited about the opportunity to build a major player in the holidays market for a low up-front investment and with limited risk."" The airline said it had conducted research which showed its customers wanted flexibility in flights and tailored holidays, and it had designed its business to respond to this. EasyJet's results showed that annual revenues rose 8.3% to Â£6.4bn, as it increased capacity, but total revenue per seat fell 1.8% to Â£60.81 due to ""some weakness in consumer confidence"". Passenger numbers for the year rose 8.6% to 96.1 million. Julie Palmer, regional partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor, said EasyJet was ""taking advantage of the current climate sweeping across the industry"". She added: ""EasyJet has been picking at the bones of other airlines who have suffered at the hands of falling demand, including Air Berlin's assets at Tegel Airport and Thomas Cook's runway slots at Gatwick and Bristol airports. ""With Brexit continuing to drag, EasyJet will be strapping itself in for further turbulence but will be cautiously optimistic for the future and hoping for an upwards trajectory."" However, last week the boss of rival budget airline Wizz Air, Jozesf Varadi, said he was ""surprised"" to hear of EasyJet's package holiday plans. He told the Telegraph:,external""I don't think this packaged holiday industry is going to flourish, I think that the model is outdated, Why should customers pay a premium for pretty much nothing?"" EasyJet's shift into package holidays is hardly a Pauline conversion. It already sells about half a million packages a year, and the demise of Thomas Cook has left a gap in the market that cannot have been lost on the airline's chief executive Johann Lundgren, a former employee of Tui, Thomas Cook's main rival. It plans to roughly double its package holiday sales, which will still make it a small player besides the likes of Tui (which has a Civil Aviation Authority licence to carry 5.6 million people a year) and putting it just above British Airways' in-house holiday operation, which is licensed for just under one million people. Mr Lundgren could undoubtedly do more - EasyJet is after all probably the biggest carrier of UK customers to traditional sunshine destinations in the Mediterranean - but he will be mindful that investors tend to be nervous about successful low-cost airlines that stray away from their core business. More eye-catching perhaps is the airline's pledge to offset all its carbon emissions. Environmental campaigners will be sceptical, and the real value of offsetting schemes, which see polluters pay for trees to be planted or for low-carbon energy generation schemes, are open to question. But Mr Lundgren and the EasyJet board realise that their passengers are becoming acutely sensitive to the environmental impact of flying, and that making them feel more comfortable with an EasyJet flight makes commercial sense. It is in any event only an interim step, Mr Lundgren says, until genuinely carbon-free methods of aircraft propulsion can be found.

Green manifesto to vow zero carbon by 2030The party wants to spend Â£100bn a year on tackling climate change - and calls for a new EU referendum.Election 2019,"This video can not be played Jonathan Bartley: ""The green new deal is an an idea whose time has come"" The Green Party of England and Wales has launched its election manifesto with a pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2030. The party says it would invest Â£100bn a year by 2030 as part of a ""green new deal"" to tackle climate change - to be mainly paid for by borrowing. The party will also pledge to increase NHS funding, hold a Brexit referendum and extend voting to 16-year-olds. The party is standing in 497 of the 650 UK constituencies. Launching themanifesto,externalat an event in London, co-leader Jonathan Bartley said his party was proposing the ""most ambitious green new deal anywhere in the world"". He said the document would ""put us on track to decarbonise every single sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain"". ""Our very planet is raising the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years is simply not an option,"" he said. A simple guide to the Green Party Key Green Party manifesto promises explained How would the Greens fund Â£1tn climate pledge? How much will this be a climate change election? Brighton MP Caroline Lucas was the party's only MP elected in the last general election, but the Greens have had more success in the European Parliament, where they currently have seven MEPs. The party is stepping aside in 50 seats across England and Wales to make way for the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, as part of the ""Unite to Remain"" agreement. In exchange, the Lib Dems will not compete with the Greens in nine seats, including the Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Exeter and Brighton Pavilion. The general election takes place on 12 December.

A further Â£9bn would be raised through tax changes including increasing corporation tax to 24%. The manifesto also includes a promise to put a carbon tax on energy and fossil fuel imports, increased over 10 years to make coal, oil and gas ""financially unviable"". Greens co-leader Sian Berry said the party would push for its policy programme to be implemented with 10 new pieces of legislation. ""Ten bills ready for the next Parliament to hit the ground running - because the future won't give us another chance to get these next two years right,"" she said. ""The more Green MPs we have, the more chance we have to save the future."" In October the Extinction Rebellion group held protests calling for governments to drastically cut carbon emissions By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton Try not to get too confused. The Greens aren't the only party promising a Green New Deal at this election. Labour agreed to something with the same name at its party conference earlier this year. But there's no doubt what the Green Party is proposing today is far more ambitious. Â£100bn every year for 10 years - or to put it more boldly, Â£1tn over 10 years - to fight climate change and give the UK a zero-carbon economy by 2030. The questions though, are big: even with that level of investment, how realistic is it to completely decarbonise the UK within a decade? Do the Greens want to see every petrol and diesel car off the road? Heavy industry operating with net zero emissions? Can carbon capture and storage technology, or sufficient renewable energy capacity, be developed in time? But after a year which has seen activism on climate change, be it school strikes or Extinction Rebellion, grabbing the headlines, the Green Party thinks the time is right for what it is calling the ""climate election"". Key Green Party manifesto promises explained Who should I vote for? Read our policy guide,external TheLib Dems are promising to spend Â£100bnover five years to tackle the effects of climate change. Delegates at the Labour Party's conference approved a motion calling for zero net emissions by 2030. But it remains to be seen how firm this target will be in the party's manifesto, due to be unveiled later this week. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told BBC Radio 4's programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". Labouris also proposing to insulate 27 million households, which it says would cut UK carbon emissions by 10% by 2030. The Conservatives have said they want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while the SNP says it wants a 100% reduction in emissions as soon as possible. The Conservatives, Lib Dems and the Brexit Party have all pledged to plant millions of trees over the coming years. Do you have any questions about the election?

Mr Houghton remains a candidate but the Conservatives have withdrawn their support for his campaign while an investigation takes place. The National listed a number of posts, including one where he argued that while there was ""no credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen"" he went on to say: ""I do find some of the events fabricated."" Mr Houghton was also quoted as saying he did not see how homosexuality was good for the human race. In other alleged comments he said Islam's core teachings had the goal of ""world domination"" and that some Muslims had big families with the aim of creating ""Eurabia"". He released a statement on his Twitter feed, saying the comments were taken ""out of context"" and insisted he had never held anti-Semitic, racist or homophobic views. Mr Houghton said: ""At the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions. These included terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism."" He said that in one of the threads he had discussed freedom of speech and he had discussed comments made by Holocaust denier David Irving. He said he made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending the views and strongly opposed Holocaust denial. The candidate added: ""I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen."" A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result. ""The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North. ""The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism.""

US settlement move 'endorses law of jungle',"The mosque of the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Issawiya and the Maale Adumim settlement seen in the background Palestinians have condemned a decision by the US to abandon its four-decades-old position that Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank are inconsistent with international law. Chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said it threatened to replace international law with the ""law of the jungle"". But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US move, saying it ""rights a historical wrong"". The UN regards the settlements as being illegal under international law. Settlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. They have long been a source of dispute between Israel and the international community, and the Palestinians. This video can not be played Israelis and Palestinians react to the US decision to shift its policy on West Bank settlements On Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements is not, per se, inconsistent with international law"". The status of the West Bank, he added, was ""for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate"". The move was seen as a victory for Mr Netanyahu, who has pledged to apply Israeli sovereignty over all the settlements, as well as the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea. The Palestinians have long called for the removal of the settlements, where about 600,000 Jews live, arguing that their presence on land they claim for a future independent Palestinian state makes it almost impossible to make such a state a reality. ""Israeli colonial settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, are not only illegal under international law, they are war crimes,"" said Mr Erekat. ""Once the Trump administration decides to undermine international law... this constitutes a major threat to international peace and security."" This video can not be played Watch Mike Pompeo explain the shift in the US position Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""The United States is neither qualified nor is authorised to negate international legitimacy resolutions, and it has no right to give any legitimacy to Israeli settlement."" Palestinian militant groups also weighed in, calling it the official funeral of the Oslo peace process - which laid the foundations for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip - and urging stepped-up resistance to the Israeli occupation. In 2017, US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and ordered the relocation of the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. The decision was condemned by Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state, and the UN General Assembly demanded its cancellation. And earlier this year, Mr Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which were seized from Syria in the 1967 war. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Are there alternatives to a two-state solution? Mr Pompeo's announcement was made two days ahead of a deadline for Benny Gantz, Mr Netanyahu's political rival, to form a coalition government following an inconclusive general election in September. Mr Gantz was given the opportunity after Mr Netanyahu himself failed to form a ruling coalition. Hours later, the US state department alerted Americans planning to visit Jerusalem, West Bank or Gaza that ""those opposed to the secretary of state's announcement may target US [government] facilities, interests, and citizens"". In praising the US move, Mr Netanyahu said Israeli courts were the ""appropriate place"" to decide the legality of the settlements, ""not biased international forums that pay no attention to history or facts"". ""Israel remains ready and willing to conduct peace negotiations with the Palestinians regarding all final status issues in an effort to achieve a durable peace,"" he said, ""but will continue to reject all arguments regarding the illegality of the settlements."" This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Meanwhile, the UN human rights office reaffirmed its position that the settlements were unlawful, saying the change ""of one state does not modify existing international law nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the [UN] Security Council"". The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the bloc's position was that ""all settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace"". Ayman Safadi, Foreign Minister of Jordan - the custodian of a holy site in Jerusalem known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as the Temple Mount - said the change would ""kill"" a two-state solution, calling the settlements ""a blatant violation of international law"". Two years ago, Mr Trump promised a ""deal of the century"" to end the conflict created by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser. But, apart from an ambitious plan for investment in Palestinian areas and Arab countries, few details have been made public. Mike Pompeo said the decision would create the political space for a more likely resolution of the conflict. But that resolution is now more likely to be on Israel's terms, since it is by far the stronger party. Dismissing the international legal prohibitions on Jewish settlements undermines the legal framework for the peace process, including the notion of Palestinian national rights and the principle of self-determination. It will almost certainly boost the movement to expand and annex the Jewish settlements. There has already been a sharp increase in settlement planning and construction since Mr Trump took office. Palestinians will be dismayed, although not surprised. Palestinian analysts I have spoken with say the growth of Jewish settlements has essentially killed the potential for a viable two-state solution. They speak in terms of a war of position, saying that staying on the land and simply continuing their lives is a kind of non-violent resistance. In 1978, the Carter administration concluded that the establishment of civilian settlements was inconsistent with international law. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan disagreed with that conclusion, saying he did not believe the settlements were inherently illegal. Since then, the US has adopted a position of describing the settlements as ""illegitimate"" - though not ""illegal"" - and sheltering Israel from condemnatory resolutions on the issue at the United Nations. However, one of the last acts of the Obama administration, at the end of 2016, was to break with US practice by not vetoing a UN resolution that urged an end to illegal Israeli settlements. President Trump's administration has displayed a much more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity than President Obama's. Mr Pompeo said the Trump administration had studied all sides of the debate and agreed with Mr Reagan. Most of the international community, including the UN and the International Court of Justice, say the settlements are illegal. The basis for this is the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention which forbids the transfer by an occupying power of its people to occupied territory. However, Israel says the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the West Bank because, it says, the territory is not technically occupied. Israel says it is legally there as a result of a defensive war, and did not take control of the West Bank from a legitimate sovereign power. It says the legal right of Jewish settlement there, as recognised by the 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, was preserved under the UN's charter.

"Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plastic""I think we're all shifting our behaviour,"" the BBC broadcaster says as he wins a prestigious award.Science & Environment","This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough says the response to plastic pollution has been encouraging The world is beginning to tackle the threat of plastic waste, according to the renowned broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. ""I think we're all shifting our behaviour, I really do,"" Sir David said in an interview with the BBC. Describing plastic pollution as ""vile"" and ""horrid"", he said there was growing awareness of the damage it can do. ""I think we are changing our habits, and the world is waking up to what we've done to the planet,"" he said. Sir David was speaking as he and the BBC's Natural History Unit (NHU) were announced as the winners of the prestigious Chatham House Prize for their Blue Planet II series of documentaries. Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank based in London, awards the prize to people or organisations making a significant contribution to improving international relations. Its director, Dr Robin Niblett, described plastic pollution as ""one of the gravest challenges facing the world's oceans"".

He said Sir David and the BBC Studios Natural History Unit played ""an instrumental role in helping to put this issue at the forefront of the public agenda"". ""Blue Planet II spurred a passionate global response and generated clear behavioural and policy change."" The series revealed how plastic items - estimated to total more than 150 million tonnes - are drifting in the world's oceans and causing the deaths of one million birds and 100,000 sea mammals each year. In one of the most moving scenes,albatrosses were seen feeding their chicks a diet of plasticwhich would doom them to die. The head of the NHU, Julian Hector, said he believed the programmes had ""struck a chord"" with the public because they showed ""the interaction of plastic and the natural world"". ""We're emotionally engaging the audience, giving them a connection with life histories, the behaviours, the plans that these animals have got, and how plastic in that case is getting in their way, reducing their chicks' survival."" This video can not be played David Shukman explains how plastic moves around the oceans For Sir David, these sights are ""very powerful - they speak to parental instinct""; and they seem to have helped motivate people to take action. ""It's the beginning, and people in all parts of society are aware of what's happening, and it's vile, it's horrid and it's something we are clearly seeing inflicted on the natural world and having a dreadful effect and there's something they can do about it. ""So in a way it's a bit of a litmus test to see if the population care about it and people do."" Sir David said that techniques needed to be devised for handling plastic waste. ""We still need to know how to dispose of the wretched material, surely if we can invent it, somebody somewhere is going to be able to deal with it, to deal with these mountains of this appalling material.""

"Sydney blanketed by smoke from massive bushfiresBushfires raging to the north of the city are creating a dense haze and ""hazardous"" air quality.Australia","People in Sydney woke up to a city shrouded in smoke on Tuesday, as scores of bushfires rage across the region. Strong winds overnight brought smoke from fires inland, pushing the air quality in Australia's largest city to beyond ""hazardous"" levels at times. On social media, locals have described hazy skies and the stench of smoke in their homes. About five million people live in the state capital of New South Wales, which has been affected for weeks by fires. Six people have died in bushfires in the state's north since October.

Sydney residents were warned about severe fire danger on Tuesday, as temperatures soared to 37C (98.6F) in the city's west. Parts of the city recorded air pollution levels at eight times higher than the national benchmark. Health officials advised people to stay indoors and avoid physical activity. They also shared first aid guides on how to help asthma sufferers and others with respiratory problems. ""The smoke is likely to hang around for the next few days,"" warned the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.

At first I hoped that it was just my housemates smoking inside again - but I knew deep down it was another fire. The sky was a burnt grey. The first thing I checked on my phone wasn't Instagram, or emails, but the app I downloaded last week which shows where the bushfires are. Thankfully, no new fronts had sprung up overnight. But it's hard to predict these days - the blazes are so volatile and can flare up with a change in wind. I cut short my walk to work to get the bus instead. People were still coughing and spluttering on board. I made a mental note to buy a face mask - something I've never needed before in Sydney. Last week,Sydney faced unprecedented bushfire dangerwhen blazes hit its suburbs and parts of its outskirts.

Backpacker died 'when sex act went wrong',"University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand A British backpacker died when consensual sexual activity ""went wrong"", a court has heard. Grace Millane died on 1 December, the night before her 22nd birthday, while travelling in Auckland, New Zealand. A 27-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies her murder. His defence told Auckland High Court Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, died accidentally after being consensually choked during sex. The defendant has chosen not to give evidence himself. Prosecutors allege he strangled Ms Millane before disposing of her body. The court heard the pair had met through dating app Tinder and after drinking cocktails for several hours had returned to his hotel room at CityLife in Auckland's city centre. Ron Mansfield, defending the man, told the jury: ""If the couple engaged in consensual sexual activity and that went wrong, and no-one intended for it to go wrong, then that is not murder. ""And that is what [the defendant] has said took place, and that is what at the end you will be told the evidence reveals."" He said that while death from consensual choking was ""rare"", it was dangerous ""if two people are inebriated, relatively inexperienced and don't know each other too well"". Grace Millane was found buried in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland The man has admitted putting Ms Millane's body in a suitcase and burying it in the WaitÄkere Ranges, a mountainous woodland area outside Auckland. He told police he had ""freaked out"" after finding her dead in the morning after their date. ""He may not have done the right thing afterwards for fear no-one would believe him,"" Mr Mansfield told the jury. Murder accused 'panicked and put body in suitcase' Grace Millane suspect 'cleaned up blood' in room Millane and murder accused 'seen kissing on CCTV' The defence claims Ms Millane had not suffered any injuries other than those the man said had occurred during sex, and neighbours had not heard anything which would suggest an argument had taken place. Mr Mansfield added he was not seeking to attach any blame or shame to Ms Millane for any sexual interests she may have had. Miss Millane died on the night before her 22nd birthday The court heard in statements from friends that she had discussed an interest in BDSM sexual conduct and had profiles on BDSM dating apps. Forensic pathologist and toxicologist Dr Fintan Garavan told jurors Ms Millane's injuries would ""favour consensual"" acts as there were no signs of a struggle. The trial continues.

""I think we're all shifting our behaviour, I really do,"" Sir David said in an interview with the BBC. Describing plastic pollution as ""vile"" and ""horrid"", he said there was growing awareness of the damage it can do. ""I think we are changing our habits, and the world is waking up to what we've done to the planet,"" he said. Sir David was speaking as he and the BBC's Natural History Unit (NHU) were announced as the winners of the prestigious Chatham House Prize for their Blue Planet II series of documentaries. Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank based in London, awards the prize to people or organisations making a significant contribution to improving international relations. Its director, Dr Robin Niblett, described plastic pollution as ""one of the gravest challenges facing the world's oceans"".

He said Sir David and the BBC Studios Natural History Unit played ""an instrumental role in helping to put this issue at the forefront of the public agenda"". ""Blue Planet II spurred a passionate global response and generated clear behavioural and policy change."" The series revealed how plastic items - estimated to total more than 150 million tonnes - are drifting in the world's oceans and causing the deaths of one million birds and 100,000 sea mammals each year. In one of the most moving scenes,albatrosses were seen feeding their chicks a diet of plasticwhich would doom them to die. The head of the NHU, Julian Hector, said he believed the programmes had ""struck a chord"" with the public because they showed ""the interaction of plastic and the natural world"". ""We're emotionally engaging the audience, giving them a connection with life histories, the behaviours, the plans that these animals have got, and how plastic in that case is getting in their way, reducing their chicks' survival."" This video can not be played David Shukman explains how plastic moves around the oceans For Sir David, these sights are ""very powerful - they speak to parental instinct""; and they seem to have helped motivate people to take action. ""It's the beginning, and people in all parts of society are aware of what's happening, and it's vile, it's horrid and it's something we are clearly seeing inflicted on the natural world and having a dreadful effect and there's something they can do about it. ""So in a way it's a bit of a litmus test to see if the population care about it and people do."" Sir David said that techniques needed to be devised for handling plastic waste. ""We still need to know how to dispose of the wretched material, surely if we can invent it, somebody somewhere is going to be able to deal with it, to deal with these mountains of this appalling material."" Also nominated for the Chatham House Prize were Abiy Ahmed, prime minister of Ethiopia, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize; and KatrÃ­n JakobsdÃ³ttir, prime minister of Iceland for her commitment to gender equality.

"Tories back 'whole life orders' for child murderThe party wants to tackle ""sickening injustice"" but the final decision will remain with judges.Election 2019","Adults who murder children will face life in prison without parole if the Conservatives are elected in December. The party said it would bring in a new law to make ""whole life orders"" the starting point when sentencing over 21-year-olds for the premeditated murder of a child under 16. However, the final sentencing decision would remain with judges. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the policy would tackle ""genuine concern"" about sentencing. Similar plans were reported by the Sunday Telegraph in Septemberand were expected to form part of the Queen's Speech after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered an urgent review into sentencing policy in August - but the policy was not announced. Why do prisoners only serve half their sentence? Boris Johnson's crime promises crunched Who should I vote for? Election policy guide The Conservatives' plan would see changes to Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which provides the starting point for judges considering whole life orders for murderers in exceptionally grave cases. This happened in the case of Mark Bridger, who was given a whole life sentence in 2013 when he was convicted of abducting and murdering five-year-old April Jones in a sexually motivated attack. Currently, for a judge to grant such an order, the rules require the murder to be of multiple children, to be sexually or sadistically motivated or to involve a child's abduction. If there is not evidence of these conditions, the offender must still be given a life sentence, but that differs from a whole life order, as a judge can specify the minimum term they must spend in prison before becoming eligible to apply for parole. This happened in the case of Louise Porton, who killed her daughters - aged three and 17 months - and wassentenced to life with a minimum of 32 years. The Tories want to extend Schedule 21 to cover any premeditated murder of a child by an adult. However, judicial discretion will come into play - meaning a judge can decide not to enforce a whole life order when they see fit. The message from Boris Johnson, since he became prime minister, is that the Conservatives are ""the party of law and order"". More police, new prisons, tougher sentences. The latest proposed measures continue that theme. They're largely symbolic - designed to boost confidence in the criminal justice system - and would affect only a dozen or so of the 50 to 60 child homicide cases every year. Arguably, what's more significant is the Tories' plan to improve education and training across prisons to increase employment levels on release. Justice secretaries have tried and failed to do this before, so expectation levels will be low - but the prize for success, in terms of reduced reoffending rates and fewer victims, is huge. Mr Buckland acknowledged that the new rules would only affect a limited number of cases, but child murders can ""send a real shockwave, either through the local community or the wider public"". ""That's why I think it's important we send a clear message,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Amending the law to make the starting point a whole life order means that there would have to be particular reasons, spelt out clearly, for a judge to depart from that."" There is already a mandatory life sentence for murder, but that does not mean murderers necessarily spend their whole life in prison. It does mean after release that they remain on licence for the rest of their life, having to meet certain conditions or else be recalled to prison. But some crimes can carry a ""whole life"" sentence meaning a criminal will never be eligible for parole. The Conservatives' proposals would change the sentencing ""starting point"" for all child murderers to a whole life tariff. When it comes to sentencing, each crime has a ""starting point"" - a presumed minimum term from which the judge subtracts, or to which they add based on any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. For example, a murder involving a knife committed by someone over the age of 18 carries a starting point of 25 years. But a judge may choose a harsher or more lenient sentence than 25 years depending on the individual case. As it stands, a judge can already choose to hand down a whole life sentence for the murder of a child - this would just mean it is the automatic starting point. And this will apply to a small number of cases - there are typically fewer than 50 homicides of under-16s per year, of which a far smaller number will be premeditated murders where there was an intent to kill. The Conservatives have also announced plans to try to get more former prisoners into work after they complete their sentences. The goal is to double the number of those in employment six weeks after their release, with measures including a ""prison education service"" to oversee learning across all jails, more workshops to employ prisoners during their sentences, and a dedicated work coach in every prison to link inmates with job centres ahead of their release. Meanwhile, Labour has pledged to reverse cuts to prison staff and prisons, as well as improve pay and conditions. The party has also promised to scrap shorter prison sentences, which it argues will reduce reoffending. The Lib Dems also want to increase the use of non-custodial punishments - such as curfews, community service and GPS tagging - rather than short prison sentences.

Did a 'soap spill' really divert a flight?,"American Airlines flight 729 bound for Philadelphia was diverted to Dublin Documents seen by the BBC cast doubt on a claim by American Airlines that an ""odour"" on a flight, which led to two cabin crew falling unconscious, was due to ""a spilled cleaning solution"". The incident led to the diversion of a Heathrow to Philadelphia flight,and a passenger being sent to hospital. Records show part of the aircraft had been leaking oil prior to the flight. BBC sources say it is likely the leak caused toxic fumes to enter the cabin. However, American Airlines denies that. One assertion made in an internal American Airlines report on the incident on 21 October does stick out. It states that ""dish soap in a bottle caused two flight attendants to get medical attention and one passenger"". Dish soap is the American term for washing-up liquid. An American Airlines insider, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said it was ""inconceivable"" that dish soap, or any other cleaning product approved for use on aircraft, could cause two people to pass out. So far, American Airlines has not responded to the BBC's query on this specific point. In public statements the company has not used the term ""dish soap"", instead describing it as a ""cleaning solution"". It says the aircraft involved was ""thoroughly inspected"" after the incident by its ""highly-skilled"" maintenance team who conduct ""an in-depth investigationâ¦ whenever a cabin odour event is reported."" American Airlines says: ""Cabin odours are a priority for American's leadership team at the highest level of the organisation"", and insists the incident was caused by a cleaning agent which spilled mid-flight. However, BBC News has seen and heard evidence that casts doubt on that claim. Firstly, we've been told that a strange ""metallic"" odour was detected on the same aircraft before the cleaning solution spilled. The ""overpowering"" smell was detected on the previous flight, when the plane was travelling in the opposite direction from Philadelphia to Heathrow. We've also discovered that there was an oil leak on part of the aircraft days before the incident, which could have been the cause. The part of the plane that was leaking oil is called the Auxiliary Power Unit, or APU. The APU provides power to start up the engines and to run the electrics on the aircraft when the main engines are not running. Three days before the aircraft was diverted to Dublin, an engineering maintenance report stated that its APU showed a ""high oil consumption"". The leak meant it had guzzled an unusually large amount of oil, 31.75 pints, in the previous two weeks. Another American Airlines maintenance document stated that the APU was inoperable, and determined that it should be repaired in the coming days. A ""noxious odour"" which resulted in ""eye and throat irritation"" was also recorded on the same plane on 23 October, two days after the flight from Heathrow was diverted to Dublin. In another report from the same day, the APU on the plane is then described as ""wet with oil"". American Airlines claims the odour, which caused two cabin crew to pass out, ""was not related to the APU"" because the Auxiliary Power Unit was ""not operational during this time period and did not operate during this flight."" However, a document written by aircraft manufacturer Airbus clearly states that an APU, which has leaked oil, can contaminate the air supply in the cabin, even when the unit is switched off. The Airbus document, entitled ""APU bleed air oil contamination"", states that ""oil smell or smoke in the cabin resulting from APU oil contamination can occur at almost any time and not necessarily when the APU is running"". That's because if oil leaks from the APU it can spill into the ducting of the plane's air conditioning system. ""If an APU leaks oil then it goes into the ducting"", said Captain Tristan Loraine, a former British Airways pilot. ""So these guys have an APU leaking oil. They can fix the APU but they can't fix the contamination of the ducting."" Captain Loraine has spent years raising awareness about so-called ""fume events"", where oil or other fluids leak and potentially contaminate the air supply in the cabin mid-flight. The airline industry is generally reluctant to talk about the problem, and it is by no means an issue which is specific to American Airlines. The two cabin crew members who passed out on the flight from Heathrow are not authorised to speak to the BBC. However, we understand that nearly a month on from the incident, one of them is experiencing heavy migraines. Previously that person did not experience regular headaches. American Airlines said: ""It cannot be emphasised enough that the health and welfare of our crews and customers continues to be our top priority.

Did a 'soap spill' really divert a flight?Evidence seen by the BBC casts doubt on American Airlines' reason for two crew members falling unconscious.Business,"American Airlines flight 729 bound for Philadelphia was diverted to Dublin Documents seen by the BBC cast doubt on a claim by American Airlines that an ""odour"" on a flight, which led to two cabin crew falling unconscious, was due to ""a spilled cleaning solution"". The incident led to the diversion of a Heathrow to Philadelphia flight,and a passenger being sent to hospital. Records show part of the aircraft had been leaking oil prior to the flight. BBC sources say it is likely the leak caused toxic fumes to enter the cabin. However, American Airlines denies that. One assertion made in an internal American Airlines report on the incident on 21 October does stick out. It states that ""dish soap in a bottle caused two flight attendants to get medical attention and one passenger"". Dish soap is the American term for washing-up liquid. An American Airlines insider, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said it was ""inconceivable"" that dish soap, or any other cleaning product approved for use on aircraft, could cause two people to pass out. So far, American Airlines has not responded to the BBC's query on this specific point. In public statements the company has not used the term ""dish soap"", instead describing it as a ""cleaning solution"". It says the aircraft involved was ""thoroughly inspected"" after the incident by its ""highly-skilled"" maintenance team who conduct ""an in-depth investigationâ¦ whenever a cabin odour event is reported."" American Airlines says: ""Cabin odours are a priority for American's leadership team at the highest level of the organisation"", and insists the incident was caused by a cleaning agent which spilled mid-flight. However, BBC News has seen and heard evidence that casts doubt on that claim. Firstly, we've been told that a strange ""metallic"" odour was detected on the same aircraft before the cleaning solution spilled. The ""overpowering"" smell was detected on the previous flight, when the plane was travelling in the opposite direction from Philadelphia to Heathrow. We've also discovered that there was an oil leak on part of the aircraft days before the incident, which could have been the cause. The part of the plane that was leaking oil is called the Auxiliary Power Unit, or APU. The APU provides power to start up the engines and to run the electrics on the aircraft when the main engines are not running. Three days before the aircraft was diverted to Dublin, an engineering maintenance report stated that its APU showed a ""high oil consumption"". The leak meant it had guzzled an unusually large amount of oil, 31.75 pints, in the previous two weeks.

"Amateur MMA fighter dies after match injurySai Aletaha, 26, suffered a brain injury during a Fast and Furious Series event in Southampton.","Sai Aletaha was described as ""a lovely character with a beautiful soul"" An amateur kickboxer has died after suffering a brain injury during a match. Saeideh Aletaha, 26, was critically injured at a Fast and Furious Fight Series event in Central Hall in Southampton on Saturday night. She was taken to Southampton General Hospital shortly before 21:00 GMT, but died later, police said. Hampshire Police said it had launched an investigation into exactly what happened. FFS posted a statement on Facebook confirming Ms Aletaha had not recovered from her injury, and urged any family and friends needing support to get in touch. It said: ""All competitors get in prepared that they may be injured, and this is something not expected to happen 99.9% of the time. ""But, it can, and in this we make the environment as safe as possible with pre and post medicals from a doctor, and full medical cover throughout."" It said it had a doctor, paramedic and an ambulance on site alongside its own team at the event organised by Lookborai and Exile Gym. ""Safety is not something ever skimped on in any of our 19 shows and all matches are made equal,"" it added. Fellow martial artists and friends have paid tribute to Ms Aletaha, known as Sai.

Marine E reveals identity and suicide attemptThe ex-Royal Marine was acquitted of the murder of a wounded Taliban fighter in 2011.UK,"This video can not be played ""I didn't feel like I did anything wrong,"" Mr Deen told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme An ex-Royal Marine who was accused of the murder of a wounded Taliban fighter has told the BBC he tried to kill himself after hitting ""rock bottom"". Sam Deen, known until now as Marine E, admitted that in Afghanistan in 2011 he offered to shoot the insurgent, who was then killed by Sgt Alexander Blackman - also known as Marine A. Charges against Mr Deen were later dropped. He believes not killing him would have risked British casualties. ""I didn't feel like I did anything wrong,"" Mr Deen said. ""He was going to die anyway. He was probably already dead,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Mr Deen is speaking out for the first time, after a military court lifted an anonymity order. Charges against Mr Deen were dropped in February. He left the Marines in 2015 The insurgent who was killed had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter. He was shot by Blackman in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Mr Deen admitted he had told comrades: ""Let's just put one in his head, let's just do it."" He added: ""I said, 'I'll shoot him'."" The ex-Marine said that at the time the group had felt ""exposed"", having stormed a Taliban compound. ""We were like, 'What are we doing here? Let's just get out of here',"" he said. ""I was trying to influence it in a way to try and hurry up and get things done - and fit in as well."" Once the Taliban fighter had been shot, he said, ""It was like, 'Right that's done, let's just go'. ""It had to be that way. He was going to die anyway."" Mr Deen says he has struggled with his mental health Mr Deen said he was in Gibraltar - in October 2012 - when he first heard he was to be charged by British police. ""I was like... 'How can you charge me with full-on murder when I didn't kill anyone?' ""The whole situation was used as a scapegoat for the military. They had to be seen to be doing something. ""If they were going to do that, they should bring up thousands of cases in every single war."" Four months later charges against Mr Deen were dropped. He left the Royal Marines in 2015. It was then, he said, that his mental health suffered. ""I left the blanket of the military, the cover of protection, and then you're just a civilian now. ""I just totally went off the rails... hit rock bottom in my mind, in my brain."" Last year, he attempted to end his life. ""I was having panic attacks. I just thought, 'I don't want to live like this anymore'. I tried to take an overdose. ""You go from being a Royal Marine in control, knowing what he's doing in life, to then leaving and losing control."" Sgt Alexander Blackman - also known as Marine A - was released from prison in 2017 Blackman, Mr Deen's former comrade, was initially convicted of the insurgent's murder. This was reduced to manslaughter on appeal and he was released from prison in April 2017, having served more than three years. He told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that after a ""difficult"" time he was now moving on from the incident, ensuring it did not ""define who I am"". ""I look back and there's a lot to be proud of [from my time in the Royal Marines], I did a lot of things,"" he said. Blackman has now started a new role with not-for-profit community organisation ExFor+, supporting veterans returning to civilian life. ""The Royal Marines family as a whole have been very welcoming, very supportive when I've needed it. So for me it's not been too bad at all,"" he explained. Sgt Blackman had more than 13 years of service in the Armed Forces When Blackman was released from prison in 2017, judges were told he had a recognised mental illness at the time of the killing, in September 2011. He said this had been ""situation and location-specific"", and he was no longer suffering the same effects. But he said more needed to be done to help those who were struggling and ""perhaps slip throughout the cracks"". ""I've had colleagues I've worked with who, unfortunately, have taken their lives recently since they've left service, because they were struggling with mental health issues and they've kept it bottled up,"" he said. Mr Deen is now aiming to climb the highest mountain on each continent One of those being helped by ExFor+ is Mr Deen, who has challenged himself to climb the ""seven summits"" - the highest mountains across the seven continents of the world. ""Week by week, day by day, I'm changing,"" he said. ""When I started climbing it gave me the boost I needed, like I'm achieving something."" Update 19 November: An earlier version of this story said Mr Deen had been acquitted of murder. This has been changed to say that charges were dropped.

Backpacker died 'when sex act went wrong'The man accused of murdering Grace Millane says she died accidentally during consensual sex.Essex,"University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand A British backpacker died when consensual sexual activity ""went wrong"", a court has heard. Grace Millane died on 1 December, the night before her 22nd birthday, while travelling in Auckland, New Zealand. A 27-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies her murder. His defence told Auckland High Court Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, died accidentally after being consensually choked during sex. The defendant has chosen not to give evidence himself. Prosecutors allege he strangled Ms Millane before disposing of her body. The court heard the pair had met through dating app Tinder and after drinking cocktails for several hours had returned to his hotel room at CityLife in Auckland's city centre. Ron Mansfield, defending the man, told the jury: ""If the couple engaged in consensual sexual activity and that went wrong, and no-one intended for it to go wrong, then that is not murder. ""And that is what [the defendant] has said took place, and that is what at the end you will be told the evidence reveals."" He said that while death from consensual choking was ""rare"", it was dangerous ""if two people are inebriated, relatively inexperienced and don't know each other too well"". Grace Millane was found buried in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland The man has admitted putting Ms Millane's body in a suitcase and burying it in the WaitÄkere Ranges, a mountainous woodland area outside Auckland. He told police he had ""freaked out"" after finding her dead in the morning after their date. ""He may not have done the right thing afterwards for fear no-one would believe him,"" Mr Mansfield told the jury. Murder accused 'panicked and put body in suitcase' Grace Millane suspect 'cleaned up blood' in room Millane and murder accused 'seen kissing on CCTV' The defence claims Ms Millane had not suffered any injuries other than those the man said had occurred during sex, and neighbours had not heard anything which would suggest an argument had taken place. Mr Mansfield added he was not seeking to attach any blame or shame to Ms Millane for any sexual interests she may have had. Miss Millane died on the night before her 22nd birthday The court heard in statements from friends that she had discussed an interest in BDSM sexual conduct and had profiles on BDSM dating apps. Forensic pathologist and toxicologist Dr Fintan Garavan told jurors Ms Millane's injuries would ""favour consensual"" acts as there were no signs of a struggle. The trial continues. Murder accused 'panicked and put body in suitcase' CCTV 'shows accused wheeling body in suitcase' Grace Millane suspect 'cleaned up blood' in room Millane and murder accused 'seen kissing on CCTV' Millane suspect 'went on date while body in room' New 24-hour gym plans revealed for New Look set to close in south Essex town âMy dream has come trueâ - Essex airport worker wins Â£100k cash and car competition Aftermath of Home Bargains break-in by ram raiders who were jailed yesterday Calls for action over continued flooding at junction near A120 Reform MP dubbed âcriminal in our midstâ in violence against women debate Care sector âcould collapseâ before review concludes LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Hundred protesters still barricaded in HK campus,"This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Up to 200 anti-government protesters remain barricaded inside a Hong Kong university, surrounded by police, as the standoff continues for a third day. Those who are still inside Polytechnic University (PolyU) are said to be running low on supplies. Protesters have been inside the campus since last week, initially stopping police from entering by lighting fires and throwing petrol bombs. Adults who leave face arrest, and some are too scared to come out. Hundreds of protesters tried to run from the campus on Monday, but many were hit with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested. Police have revealed that on Monday alone, at the campus, they used: 1,458 tear gas canisters 1,391 rubber bullets 325 bean bag rounds 265 sponge bullets A small group of protesters managed to leave using rope ladders before being picked up and driven away by motorcyclists. Those arrested could be charged with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Protesters lower themselves down a rope from a bridge to a highway to escape the Polytechnic University campus On Sunday night, police warned protesters they had until 22:00 (14:00 GMT) to leave the campus. Police later moved in, surrounding the campus, leading to protesters throwing petrol bombs and firing stones from catapults. The violence at PolyU is one of the biggest flare-ups Hong Kong has seen since protests broke out in June. Tuesday saw the UN human rights office urge the Hong Kong authorities to de-escalate the situation at PolyU and address the humanitarian situation of those inside which it said was ""clearly deteriorating"". This video can not be played These protesters attempting to leave PolyU met tear gas volleys It added that some demonstrators' use of violence, including against the police, ""cannot be condoned"". The mostly young protesters have five key demands, including an investigation into police brutality and universal suffrage. But underpinning it all is the fear Hong Kong's unique identity is threatened by China. Tensions now could be further inflamed after China condemned a decision by Hong Kong's high court to overturn a ban on facemasks. An estimated 100 to 200 protesters still remain in PolyU, authorities have said. One protester called Jeff told the BBC that he was hiding in a building on the campus. ""I have been trapped inside Polytechnic University for two days and food and water is running out,"" he said. ""Most people tried to get out of this hell-like place, most of them tried to escape but ended in failure, being arrested or wounded or something."" ""I didn't expect this incident to get so desperate in here. The campus is so desperate and I am not well prepared. I would call it a disaster."" He said his parents were concerned for his safety and he had told them he would make it out. Timeline of unrest How is Hong Kong run? Protests explained in 100 and 500 words One tourist from mainland China is too scared to leave. He told BBC News Chinese that he was curious about what was going on at the university and had arrived on Sunday at the invitation of a friend who studies there. After a visit to the library and a meal, he learnt that police had cordoned off the whole area. ""I am not a rioter,"" the tourist, who wishes to stay anonymous said. ""I don't want to get caught and I just need to go back to China."" A handful of protesters have been trickling out of the university, some suffering from hypothermia and leg injuries, according to news site SCMP. One protester said he had decided to come out because of ""hunger and cold"", adding that many inside were ""hurt without enough medical supplies"". Another 16-year-old protester told Reuters new agency she had chosen to ""surrender"". ""We have been trying to escape since yesterday morning. But then we couldn't find a way out [and] were afraid of being charged,"" she said. ""This is the only way... I was quite desperate."" In the early hours of Tuesday morning, more than 200 students below the age of 18 left, accompanied by education officials including high school principals. Those under the age of 18 had their identities recorded and were let go. Adults were arrested. A nun leading a protester out of PolyU Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam called on all protesters to surrender, saying no violence would happen if they came ""out in a peaceful manner"". However, she said police would have to take ""necessary action"" if that changed. Separately on Tuesday, Hong Kong's new police chief took office. Chris Tang said the force was not able to end the protests alone,external, saying the unrest would only end if society condemned the violence. A number of people have supported protesters behind the scenes, donating supplies to them or picking them up from protests and driving them home to avoid arrest. Pody Lui, BBC News Chinese, at PolyU We got into the university in the early hours of the morning. Police have cordoned off the area, making it almost impossible for new journalists to get in. Those trapped inside were desperate to get out. The mood darkened as the day continued. More and more protesters gave up and left the campus willingly to face police arrest. They will be charged with rioting, meaning they could be jailed for up to a decade. Those determined to stay were getting restless. They were not as friendly to journalists as before. They were scared and couldn't afford trusting a wrong person, fearing anyone could be an undercover police officer. I overheard a Polytechnic University student talking to her father on the phone. ""I don't want to get caught. I will lose everything if I do,"" she cried. Her tired friend next to her said, ""I just want to go home."" Hong Kong had previously banned protesters from wearing facemasks - but this was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by the city's high court on Monday. China has condemned the high court's decision. It says it has the sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in the region. Courts in Hong Kong have ruled on constitutional issues in the past. In 2017, the Court of Appeal found the Hong Kong government's decision to deny a partner visa to the wife of a female British expat was unconstitutional, despite the fact Hong Kong does not recognise same-sex marriage. It is unclear what action, if any, China might take next. This is a large part of what the ongoing protests in Hong Kong are about. Many in Hong Kong fear that its freedoms - including judicial independence - are slowly being eroded by Beijing. Campuses had remained relatively free of violence during the Hong Kong protests - despite the movement being led mainly by students and young people. But afterthe death of a 22-year-old student, that changed. Last week,the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) became a battleground. Police say protesters threw petrol bombs on a major road near the university in an effort to stop traffic. Officers attempted to reclaim the road, leading to major clashes. Police revealed on Tuesday that some 3,900 petrol bombs were found at CUHK, adding that the university had 100 litres of sulphuric and nitric acids missing. A protester arrested while trying to leave the campus The university then cancelled all classes for the rest of the term. Days later, protesters at PolyU also tried to block access to a key tunnel near the university. Protests have also been held at other locations in Hong Kong. Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, it has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

Green manifesto to vow zero carbon by 2030,"This video can not be played Jonathan Bartley: ""The green new deal is an an idea whose time has come"" The Green Party of England and Wales has launched its election manifesto with a pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2030. The party says it would invest Â£100bn a year by 2030 as part of a ""green new deal"" to tackle climate change - to be mainly paid for by borrowing. The party will also pledge to increase NHS funding, hold a Brexit referendum and extend voting to 16-year-olds. The party is standing in 497 of the 650 UK constituencies. Launching themanifesto,externalat an event in London, co-leader Jonathan Bartley said his party was proposing the ""most ambitious green new deal anywhere in the world"". He said the document would ""put us on track to decarbonise every single sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain"". ""Our very planet is raising the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years is simply not an option,"" he said. A simple guide to the Green Party Key Green Party manifesto promises explained How would the Greens fund Â£1tn climate pledge? How much will this be a climate change election? Brighton MP Caroline Lucas was the party's only MP elected in the last general election, but the Greens have had more success in the European Parliament, where they currently have seven MEPs. The party is stepping aside in 50 seats across England and Wales to make way for the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, as part of the ""Unite to Remain"" agreement. In exchange, the Lib Dems will not compete with the Greens in nine seats, including the Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Exeter and Brighton Pavilion. The general election takes place on 12 December.

A further Â£9bn would be raised through tax changes including increasing corporation tax to 24%. The manifesto also includes a promise to put a carbon tax on energy and fossil fuel imports, increased over 10 years to make coal, oil and gas ""financially unviable"". Greens co-leader Sian Berry said the party would push for its policy programme to be implemented with 10 new pieces of legislation. ""Ten bills ready for the next Parliament to hit the ground running - because the future won't give us another chance to get these next two years right,"" she said. ""The more Green MPs we have, the more chance we have to save the future."" In October the Extinction Rebellion group held protests calling for governments to drastically cut carbon emissions By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton Try not to get too confused. The Greens aren't the only party promising a Green New Deal at this election. Labour agreed to something with the same name at its party conference earlier this year. But there's no doubt what the Green Party is proposing today is far more ambitious. Â£100bn every year for 10 years - or to put it more boldly, Â£1tn over 10 years - to fight climate change and give the UK a zero-carbon economy by 2030. The questions though, are big: even with that level of investment, how realistic is it to completely decarbonise the UK within a decade? Do the Greens want to see every petrol and diesel car off the road? Heavy industry operating with net zero emissions? Can carbon capture and storage technology, or sufficient renewable energy capacity, be developed in time? But after a year which has seen activism on climate change, be it school strikes or Extinction Rebellion, grabbing the headlines, the Green Party thinks the time is right for what it is calling the ""climate election"". Key Green Party manifesto promises explained Who should I vote for? Read our policy guide,external TheLib Dems are promising to spend Â£100bnover five years to tackle the effects of climate change. Delegates at the Labour Party's conference approved a motion calling for zero net emissions by 2030. But it remains to be seen how firm this target will be in the party's manifesto, due to be unveiled later this week. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told BBC Radio 4's programme Labour was committed to ""a net zero economy well before 2050"". Labouris also proposing to insulate 27 million households, which it says would cut UK carbon emissions by 10% by 2030. The Conservatives have said they want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while the SNP says it wants a 100% reduction in emissions as soon as possible. The Conservatives, Lib Dems and the Brexit Party have all pledged to plant millions of trees over the coming years. Do you have any questions about the election?

Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plastic,"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough says the response to plastic pollution has been encouraging The world is beginning to tackle the threat of plastic waste, according to the renowned broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. ""I think we're all shifting our behaviour, I really do,"" Sir David said in an interview with the BBC. Describing plastic pollution as ""vile"" and ""horrid"", he said there was growing awareness of the damage it can do. ""I think we are changing our habits, and the world is waking up to what we've done to the planet,"" he said. Sir David was speaking as he and the BBC's Natural History Unit (NHU) were announced as the winners of the prestigious Chatham House Prize for their Blue Planet II series of documentaries. Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank based in London, awards the prize to people or organisations making a significant contribution to improving international relations. Its director, Dr Robin Niblett, described plastic pollution as ""one of the gravest challenges facing the world's oceans"". 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Plastic 'berg chokes Indonesian river Plastic particles found in bottled water Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

He said Sir David and the BBC Studios Natural History Unit played ""an instrumental role in helping to put this issue at the forefront of the public agenda"". ""Blue Planet II spurred a passionate global response and generated clear behavioural and policy change."" The series revealed how plastic items - estimated to total more than 150 million tonnes - are drifting in the world's oceans and causing the deaths of one million birds and 100,000 sea mammals each year. In one of the most moving scenes,albatrosses were seen feeding their chicks a diet of plasticwhich would doom them to die. The head of the NHU, Julian Hector, said he believed the programmes had ""struck a chord"" with the public because they showed ""the interaction of plastic and the natural world"". ""We're emotionally engaging the audience, giving them a connection with life histories, the behaviours, the plans that these animals have got, and how plastic in that case is getting in their way, reducing their chicks' survival."" This video can not be played David Shukman explains how plastic moves around the oceans For Sir David, these sights are ""very powerful - they speak to parental instinct""; and they seem to have helped motivate people to take action. ""It's the beginning, and people in all parts of society are aware of what's happening, and it's vile, it's horrid and it's something we are clearly seeing inflicted on the natural world and having a dreadful effect and there's something they can do about it. ""So in a way it's a bit of a litmus test to see if the population care about it and people do."" Sir David said that techniques needed to be devised for handling plastic waste. ""We still need to know how to dispose of the wretched material, surely if we can invent it, somebody somewhere is going to be able to deal with it, to deal with these mountains of this appalling material."" Also nominated for the Chatham House Prize were Abiy Ahmed, prime minister of Ethiopia, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize; and KatrÃ­n JakobsdÃ³ttir, prime minister of Iceland for her commitment to gender equality.

"Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plasticThe world is starting to tackle the threat of plastic waste, according to Sir David Attenborough.Science & Environment","This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough says the response to plastic pollution has been encouraging The world is beginning to tackle the threat of plastic waste, according to the renowned broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. ""I think we're all shifting our behaviour, I really do,"" Sir David said in an interview with the BBC. Describing plastic pollution as ""vile"" and ""horrid"", he said there was growing awareness of the damage it can do. ""I think we are changing our habits, and the world is waking up to what we've done to the planet,"" he said. Sir David was speaking as he and the BBC's Natural History Unit (NHU) were announced as the winners of the prestigious Chatham House Prize for their Blue Planet II series of documentaries. Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank based in London, awards the prize to people or organisations making a significant contribution to improving international relations. Its director, Dr Robin Niblett, described plastic pollution as ""one of the gravest challenges facing the world's oceans"". 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Plastic 'berg chokes Indonesian river Plastic particles found in bottled water Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

He said Sir David and the BBC Studios Natural History Unit played ""an instrumental role in helping to put this issue at the forefront of the public agenda"". ""Blue Planet II spurred a passionate global response and generated clear behavioural and policy change."" The series revealed how plastic items - estimated to total more than 150 million tonnes - are drifting in the world's oceans and causing the deaths of one million birds and 100,000 sea mammals each year. In one of the most moving scenes,albatrosses were seen feeding their chicks a diet of plasticwhich would doom them to die. The head of the NHU, Julian Hector, said he believed the programmes had ""struck a chord"" with the public because they showed ""the interaction of plastic and the natural world"". ""We're emotionally engaging the audience, giving them a connection with life histories, the behaviours, the plans that these animals have got, and how plastic in that case is getting in their way, reducing their chicks' survival."" This video can not be played David Shukman explains how plastic moves around the oceans For Sir David, these sights are ""very powerful - they speak to parental instinct""; and they seem to have helped motivate people to take action. ""It's the beginning, and people in all parts of society are aware of what's happening, and it's vile, it's horrid and it's something we are clearly seeing inflicted on the natural world and having a dreadful effect and there's something they can do about it. ""So in a way it's a bit of a litmus test to see if the population care about it and people do."" Sir David said that techniques needed to be devised for handling plastic waste. ""We still need to know how to dispose of the wretched material, surely if we can invent it, somebody somewhere is going to be able to deal with it, to deal with these mountains of this appalling material."" Also nominated for the Chatham House Prize were Abiy Ahmed, prime minister of Ethiopia, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize; and KatrÃ­n JakobsdÃ³ttir, prime minister of Iceland for her commitment to gender equality. Sir David's current series with the BBC NHU -Seven Worlds, One Planet- is broadcast on BBC One on Sunday nights.

NHS to pay tax bills to get doctors back to workThe row over pensions has led to doctors refusing to do overtime because they were being landed with hefty tax bills.Health,"Doctors in England have been promised their tax bills will be covered by the NHS in an attempt to get them back doing overtime shifts. Doctors have been refusing to do extra work because they were being landed with bills after changes to how much can be accrued in pensions tax-free. Senior NHS figures and ministers have signed off on the plan amid concern about the impact on waiting times. Waiting times have hit theirworst levels on record. The data released last week showed delays in A&E and for routine operations were at their highest levels since targets were introduced more than a decade ago. Therow over the pension changesis considered to be just one factor in that. But NHS leaders have been pushing ministers to agree to a short-term fix with pressure growing ahead of winter. The proposal will mean doctors can take money out of their pension pots to pay the tax bills they get next year. The NHS will then top up their pension pots before retirement, meaning the cost of the measure to the health service will be spread out over time while doctors will not be out of pocket. The emergency measure will only apply for the 2019-20 tax year. The Treasury is still looking at how the pension changes have been implemented in an attempt to find a long-term solution ahead of the start of the next financial year in April. The amount people can put into pensions tax free has been reduced for all workers. In 2010-11 it was Â£255,000, but has now been cut to Â£40,000 a year - and drops still further for the highest earners. The changes tends to affect those earning more than Â£110,000, around a third of senior doctors and GPs. A number of short-term fixes have already been tried, including allowing staff to temporarily opt out of the scheme and get any pension payments that they would have got put into their pay packet instead. But these have had a limited impact on the stand-off, prompting NHS England to agree to the latest step. There are differences to how pensions work elsewhere in the UK, although tax-free allowances have been reduced in each nation. Currently only the NHS in England has taken this step.
