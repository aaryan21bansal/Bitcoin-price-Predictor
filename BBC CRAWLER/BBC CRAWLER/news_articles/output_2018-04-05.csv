Grenfell cladding failed to meet standardThe manufacturer knew its test rating had been downgraded but did not tell the UK certification body.,"This video can not be played ""You wouldn't put 'E' on a dog kennel"": An industry source talks to the BBC's Tom Symonds Fire tests carried out as early as 2014 showed cladding used on Grenfell Tower failed to meet the safety standards originally claimed by its manufacturer, a BBC investigation has found. The firm Arconic knew the test rating had been downgraded, but the UK body that certifies building products said it was not told about the change. An industry source, who has worked on a number of cladding schemes, said he believed there should have been a product recall. Arconic said it did share the rating with ""various customers and certification authorities"". It said the results were also published on the website of the French facility that carried out the tests in 2014 and 2015. Grenfell cladding 'changed to cheaper version' Grenfell cladding '14 times combustibility limit' Grenfell fire: Polyethylene cladding on scores of towers The cladding used on Grenfell was Reynobond PE, aluminium panels containing a plastic filling, that werepopular in cost-conscious council refurbishment schemes. While zinc cladding was initially considered when the tower was refurbished in 2015, Reynobond PE was a cheaper option,saving nearly Â£300,000. In the standard European tests for ""reaction to fire"", products are rated A to F - with A being the top rating. Reynobond PE had a certificate based on a rating of B. Some in the construction industry regarded this to be the required standard for use on buildings over 18m in height, though the government says this was wrong and it should have been A rated. The rating was issued in 2008 by the British Board of AgrÃ©ment (BBA), which used technical data provided by the manufacturer to assess the standard of the panels. However, the BBC has uncovered a series of reports commissioned by the manufacturer in 2014 and 2015, during the planning for the Grenfell refurbishment. Two configurations of the cladding, both later to be fitted at Grenfell, were tested. One, known as ""riveted"",was given a classification of C, not B as was stated on the certificate. Another type, the ""cassette system"", where the panels are formed into shapes before being fitted, was classified as E.  In this case, the reports suggest the testing process was not completed. However, the BBC also obtained Arconic correspondence sent to clients from late 2015 in which the company appears to confirm some of the panels were rated class E. The email specifically addresses ""concerns about the product's fire reaction class in the UK"". The BBC spoke to one source, who has worked on major cladding schemes, though not Grenfell. He told us the email was not sent to his company's technical department and was only found after an intensive search of all company records following the Grenfell fire. The source said E rated cladding would have been unacceptable in the projects he worked on. ""To be blunt,"" he said, ""you wouldn't put E on a dog kennel"". He said he should have been informed of the classification results by Arconic with a product recall. ""We would have had to inform our client who would have had a duty of care to say this material is no longer compliant with building control or building regs and should be removed from buildings."" That will now happen, but only as a result of theGrenfell fire and the loss of 71 lives. The fire is believed to have started in a fourth floor flat but spread quickly to engulf the whole building Fire testing is carried out regularly by companies producing building materials and, because the results are commercially sensitive, they are not made public. Instead, manufacturers share their results with The British Board of AgrÃ©ment (BBA). After seeing the BBC's evidence the BBA said it ""was not notified that there were other test results available in addition to those quoted in the BBA Certificate. ""It is a requirement of the certification process that the BBA is informed of information like this."" The inspectors who ""sign off"" construction projects rely on the accuracy of the BBA certificates. Barry Turner, the technical director of Local Authority Building Control, which represents all council building control teams, said: ""We are very dependent on the manufacturer telling us there has been a change to that product. ""If someone comes with a classification which doesn't meet what's indicated in the building control guidance then we would say 'that's not suitable. Go away and find another product.'"" Since the Grenfell Tower fire, ministers and experts have argued that buildings over 18m needed to meet a class A standard, not B. But many in the construction industry claim the guidance for meeting the building regulations was unclear until after the fire. In England and Wales, class B is still regarded as the required standard for some buildings of less than 18m in height which are close to other structures. The BBC's latest findings could also result in scrutiny of buildings in Scotland where a B classification can also be used on tall buildings under certain circumstances. Arconic told us: ""We previously provided the classification results to various customers and certification authorities, and they were also posted on the CSTB's publicly available website."" The CSTB is the French facility which carried out the tests. If the reports were available on its website, they are not now, and the CSTB was not able to provide them. The BBC obtained them through other sources. We could find no mention in Arconic's marketing material of the lower classifications for the cheaper Reynobond PE cladding. However, the company advertises more expensive versions of its cladding that were classified A2 and B in the European tests. Arconic also suggested the BBA certificate could not be relied on alone as a mark of fire safety. Its statement said: ""The relevant UK building codes and regulations require entities who design the cladding system, such as architects, fabricators, contractors, or building owners, to conduct their own full systems testing or analysis of the entire cladding system."" Grenfell fire: Safety rule shortcuts Grenfell fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell Tower doors resisted fire for half the time expected The BBC can also reveal Grenfell Tower was fitted with two different versions of the Reynobond PE cladding. Arconic changed the makeup of its product, replacing the grey translucent plastic with a black material, also plastic, during the refurbishment of the tower. It said the change was made to ensure cladding would weather better in direct sunlight and the test results suggest the new version performed better when exposed to flames. Yet some of the older cladding was already installed on Grenfell and other towers, and was not removed. In a flammability demonstration for BBC News, both types of cladding dropped streams of melted, flaming plastic. We asked plastics experts at Impact Solutions near Edinburgh to analyse the older and newer versions of the panel for the BBC. They concluded both were made of polyethylene plastic. However, chemical analysis suggested the original Reynobond panel had a wax ingredient, possibly added to make it easier and cheaper to form into sheets. The Impact Solutions experts believe this substance was removed for the newer version of the cladding. At our request, the company exposed the panels to a flame under laboratory conditions, demonstrating that the newer version burned for a slightly shorter period than the older. But both samples caught fire within two minutes, both dropped streams of melted, flaming plastic. Les Rose, from Impact Solutions, described the speed at which the plastic burnt as ""fairly dramatic"", observing that it appeared to be ""feeding the flames"". He regarded neither type of cladding as adequate for fixing to tall buildings. Since the Grenfell disaster, Arconic haswithdrawn Reynobond PE from the market for all building uses.

Female first-aiders ordered from sumo ringThey went to aid a man who had collapsed but were told to leave as women are banned from the space.,"Women are forbidden from entering the sumo ring Women who rushed to perform first aid on a man who collapsed in a sumo ring in Japan were ordered by a referee to leave the ring, because females are banned from the space. The ring is regarded as sacred and women, traditionally seen as ""impure"", are forbidden from entering. They ran into the ring when Maizuru city mayor Ryozo Tatami collapsed while giving a speech. The head of Japan's sumo association later apologised to the women. ""The announcement [to get off the stage] was made by a referee who was upset, but it was an inappropriate act in a situation that involves one's life,"" Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, the sumo association's chief said in a statement. ""We deeply apologise."" Local reports later emerged that spectators saw salt being thrown into the ring after the women had left. In Japanese culture, salt is thrown into the sumo ring before a match to purify it. Some on social media said the gesture implied that the women had ""dirtied"" the ring. Women are not permitted in the sumo wrestling ring as they are seen as ""impure"" ""How rude is it that they threw salt to cleanse the ring after the women went in?"" one Japanese Twitter user said. ""This is the response to someone who tried to save a life? I think we'd better sprinkle salt on the head of the sumo association,"" another added. What is sumo wrestling? Inside the scandal-hit world of sumo Mr Tatami was taken to hospital and is in a stable condition. It is not the first time women entering the sumo ring has sparked controversy. In 2000, the then governor of Osaka Fusae Ota asked the sumo association to allow her to enter the ring so she could present a trophy to the champion wrestler, but her request was rejected.

Trump 'unaware of porn star payment',"Mr Trump referred reporters to his lawyer President Trump has said he did not know about a $130,000 (Â£92,000) payment made by his lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election  - his first public comment on the issue. Asked on board Air Force One if he knew about the payment or where the money had come from, Mr Trump said ""No"". Asked why his lawyer Michael Cohen made the payment, Mr Trump said: ""You'll have to ask Michael."" The actress says she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006. He denies it. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, says she signed an agreement to keep quiet about her claims in exchange for $130,000 in October 2016, days before the presidential election. Mr Cohen has admitted to making the payment privately, but has denied that Mr Trump was a party to the transaction. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels?

Ex-Catalan leader freed by German court,"Spain accuses Mr Puigdemont of rebellion, sedition and corruption A German court has rejected ""rebellion"" as grounds to extradite Catalonia's ex-leader Carles Puigdemont and ordered his release on bail. The Schleswig-Holstein court said he could still face corruption charges in Spain, and it has only suspended extradition - not ruled it out. He was arrested in the north German region last month, after Spain issued a European Arrest Warrant. Spain charged top Catalan separatists over October's independence referendum. The court has been considering what to do about a Spanish extradition request for Mr Puigdemont for more than a week. Mr Puigdemont faces charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of public funds in Spain as a result of his role in last year's Catalan banned independence referendum. He was detained on 25 March while crossing into Germany from Denmark on his way to Belgium, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. Spain has accused the former Catalan president of rebellion, but the court concluded that the closest equivalent to this in German law was high treason. But it ruled that in Mr Puigdemont's case there was no element of violence, so the charge was inadmissible. Who is Carles Puigdemont? Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain's distinctive north-eastern region However, the court in the northern city of Schleswig said there could be a case to answer for misusing public funds last October to hold an unauthorised independence referendum. It has asked for further information on these charges and set bail at 75,000 euros (Â£65,000; $90,000). The president of the Catalan parliamentRoger Torrent described Mr Puigdemont's conditional release as ""very good news"" on Twitter,external. ""We always said that we were not violent. The charge of rebellion is totally invalid. This political persecution has to end it is as it is driven by completely false narrative."" Mr Torrent said. The Spanish government said it respected the decision of the German court. ""The government never gives an opinion on court decisions, especially when it concerns court decisions made in another country. It always respects them, whether it likes them or not,"" a government spokeswoman said.

"1,500 companies miss gender pay deadline","This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? More than 1,500 companies have failed to report their gender pay gap figures before Wednesday night's deadline. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said 1,557 firms had missed the deadline. It will now contact these companies to remind them of their legal obligations. The equalities watchdog will investigate those firms that fail to comply and could take legal action against them, with penalties including an unlimited fine. All companies, charities and public sector bodies with more than 250 employees were required to submit their gender pay figures before Wednesday's deadline. The EHRC will check whether those firms that failed to report fall into this category. One organisation that missed the deadline was the Unite union, which belatedly published its figures on Thursday. The union, which describes itself as being ""at the forefront of the trade union campaign to achieve equal pay"", revealed that its female employees' median hourly pay was 29.6% lower than what male workers are paid. Want to find out the median gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here. More than 10,000 firms have published data, with in excess of 1,000 firms reporting on the last day. More than three-quarters of UK companies pay men more on average than women, BBC analysis of government figures suggests. The median pay gap among those companies was 9.7%. The figures indicate 78% of firms pay men more than women on average, while 14% pay women more. This is based on the median measure, which is the level of pay that separates the top half of earners from the lower half. In total, 8% said they had no pay gap between men and women. The gender pay gap is not the same as having unequal pay, which would be against the law. By law, men and women with the same jobs have to be paid the same wages. A gender pay gap can arise if there are more highly paid men than women in a company, or if women are deemed to be less experienced than their male counterparts, or if women take a hit to their salary after taking maternity leave. In reporting gender pay, firms with more than 250 staff have to publish data on the average difference between male and female employees. Nine ways to narrow the gender pay gap Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap? Rebecca Hilsenrath, EHRC chief executive, said it was pleased with the rate of reporting, but added: ""It is the law, it's not an option. It is the right thing to do, and we will be enforcing against all those organisations which failed to meet the deadline."" The EHRC will send letters to all of those organisations next week and they will then have 28 days to respond. Terms of reference will then be issued for the enforcement process, which will be made public. She said the more important issue is what companies will do to address the pay gap: ""We want them to look at their flexible working practices, we want to look at them tackling bias, conscious and unconscious, and we're looking to them to address instances of pregnancy and maternity pay discrimination."" Airline Ryanair was one of the companies reporting a large difference, with a 71.8% gender pay gap. Boux Avenue, the lingerie firm owned by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, reported a median hourly pay gap of 75.7%, while fashion retailer Karen Millen had a gap of 49%. High Street brands Costa, KFC, Matalan, McDonald's, Primark and Starbucks reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. Some firms reported so-called ""negative"" pay gaps, where women are paid on average more than men. These included electric car maker Tesla Motors, babywear retailer Mamas and Papas and electronics retailer Richer Sounds. Some have said reporting the pay gap is crude and open to misinterpretation, but gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society said it is an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn. Want to learn more about the gender gap? Try asking our bot below. The median pay gap among the 10,000 companies with more than 250 employees that have reported figures in the government's pay portal is 9.7%. But according to the Office of National Statistics the UK's median gender pay gap is 18.4%. Why is there a difference between the figures? The ONS figure is based on its annual survey of hours and earnings, and that includes both full and part-time workers, and covers all employers. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees. The national and sector gender pay gap figures come from the 2017 ONS ASHE survey.

Pressure builds on Trump environment chief,"The White House reportedly views the Pruitt situation as ""unsustainable"" Pressure is building on embattled US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Scott Pruitt, who is embroiled in allegations of ethics violations. President Donald Trump has expressed tepid support for him, but the White House is said to be losing patience. Mr Pruitt is already under scrutiny for renting an apartment with ties to a fossil fuels lobbyist. He is also accused of bypassing the White House to secure big pay rises for two long-time staff members. Asked if he still has confidence in Mr Pruitt while boarding Air Force One on Thursday, President Trump said: ""I do."" But deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News earlier in the day: ""I can't speak to the future of Scott Pruitt."" Mr Pruitt was paying $50-a-night for a Capitol Hill apartment leased from the wife of an energy lobbyist The EPA's top ethics official said on Wednesday he was not provided with the full facts when he ruled there was no ethics violation in Mr Pruitt's $50-a-night lease of a Capitol Hill apartment from the wife of an energy lobbyist. A Democratic congresswoman, who lives in the same Washington condo complex where Mr Pruitt has been staying, recalled an occasion when his security detail broke down a door when Mr Pruitt did not respond to them because he was napping. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington In the latest episode of the running soap opera that is the Trump White House, a Washington-based EPA newsletter is reporting that Rob Porter, the exiled former White House staff secretary, is behind therecent spate of revelations,externaldamaging to the administration environment chief, Scott Pruitt. It gets juicier. According to InsideEPA, Porter's motivation for the leaks is because a former girlfriend, who until last week served as a senior Pruitt adviser, was the one who first informed White House officials of Porter's alleged history of spousal abuse. The outlook for Mr Pruitt is darkening by the hour. While some conservatives, who approve of his efforts to curtail EPA regulation and trim its budget, are sticking by the former Oklahoma attorney general, support from the White House - publicly and on background - is tepid at best. Perhaps the strongest card remaining in Mr Pruitt's deck is that there are already three senior vacancies the Trump administration needs to fill - secretary of state, director of the CIA and secretary of veterans affairs. Adding one more bruising Senate confirmation battle to the docket, when politicians are trying to turn their focus on the upcoming mid-term elections, would be a most unwelcome prospect. ""I know that Congress appropriates money for the EPA to protect human health and the environment - not for repairs to the administrator's residence,"" Minnesota Democrat Betty McCollum wrote in a letter to the EPA this week, querying how the damage to the door was paid for. That housing agreement is now being investigated by the department's inspector general. Mr Pruitt also found himself engaged in a combative exchange with a reporter on Fox News on Wednesday. Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? He denied orchestrating pay rises - of almost $57,000 and $28,000 - for top aides who have worked with him since he was the attorney general of Oklahoma. The Trump administration had previously rejected a request to increase the employees' salary, according to the Atlantic. Mr Pruitt said he only found out about the salary hikes on Tuesday and did not know who made the decision. But Fox reporter Ed Henry asked: ""You don't know? You run the agency. You don't know who did this?"" ""I found out about this yesterday, and I corrected the action,"" Mr Pruitt said. The Associated Press reports that White House officials regard the Pruitt situation as ""unsustainable"". They warned Mr Pruitt before the Fox interview ""that if he failed to clear the ethical cloud his job would be in serious doubt"", reports the news agency. Mr Pruitt has also been under scrutiny for his first-class travel, including a $120,000 work trip to Italy last year. According to CBS News, the head of his security detail was removed after he objected to Mr Pruitt's suggestion shortly after taking office that his motorcade use sirens to get through dense traffic in Washington. The 16-year security veteran of the EPA was replaced with an agent who argued that Mr Pruitt must fly first-class due to ""specific, ongoing threats associated with the Administrator's air travel"". The New York Times on Thursday reported at least five EPA officials were re-assigned, demoted or requested new jobs after raising concerns about Mr Pruitt's spending and management of the agency. But conservatives such as Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and radio host Rush Limbaugh have rallied to Mr Pruitt's defence. Mr Trump will not fire Mr Pruitt, because he ""is too cagey to be duped and bullied by the Obama groupies"", Senator Cruz predicted. Senator Paul called Mr Pruitt ""the bravest and most conservative member of Trump's Cabinet,"" in a Twitter post. Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face?

Teenager dies in latest London attack,"Israel Ogunsola was stabbed to death in Link Street, Hackney, just before 20:00 BST Two boys have been arrested after an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death in an east London street. Police officers found Israel Ogunsola wounded in Link Street, Hackney, after they were alerted by a motorist just before 20:00 BST on Wednesday. He was given first aid, but died at the scene. He was initially thought to be aged in his 20s. Less than two miles away a 53-year-old man earlier died at a bookmakers following reports of an assault. It takes the number of people killed in the capital to more than 50 this year. The faces of those killed in London Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales On Thursday, a man in his mid-20s was stabbed in Walthamstow, in Billet Road near Chingford Road, at about 12:50. It is understood his injuries are not considered to be life-threatening. The Hackney stabbing victim was found injured in Link Street, the Met Police said Meanwhile, a man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after three boys were taken to hospital following a stabbing in east London. London Ambulance Service said it treated the patients after being called to Grove Road, Mile End, shortly after 18:00 on Thursday. Police said one boy has minor injuries, but the condition of the other two, both aged 15, is unknown. Flowers and tributes have been left on Link Street near where the 18-year-old was killed The deaths in Hackney follow two fatal shootings on Monday and thefatal stabbing of a suspected burglar on Wednesday. Sixteen-year-oldAmaan Shakoor, from Leyton, was left critically illand died on Tuesday after he was shot in the face in Walthamstow. A 15-year-old boy was stabbed in the same incident but survived. Amaan's death followed that of a17-year-old girl, named locally as Tanesha Melbourne, who was shot and killed in Tottenham. Amaan Shakoor was shot and another boy stabbed in Walthamstow, east London The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Following the Hackney stabbing, two boys, both aged 17, were arrested on suspicion of murder late on Wednesday night. The dead man's next of kin have been informed. Mark Easton, BBC Home Editor The deliberate killing of one human being by another is a crime that defies easy characterisation. Among the more than 50 tragedies that make up the current spike in homicides in the capital this year are some that may be premeditated or gang-related, but most will be unpredictable acts of violence in moments of mental anguish, involving a victim and a perpetrator who are well known to each other. By far the most likely year of life in which we might be unlawfully killed is not in our teens or early 20s but our first year - babies aged under one are more than twice as likely to be murdered as a 20-year-old.

""You can't cut 40% from the Met Police and 46% from youth provisions in London and not expect to see consequences"".

Six of the reported stabbings on Thursday happened within 95 minutes of each other. Over the past two years there have been between eight and 15 ""knife crimes with injury"" on average each day in London, according to the Metropolitan Police.

Protesters and community leaders gathered at Hackney Central station, east London, to call for an end to the recent bloodshed.

Che Donald said the recent spike in violent crime had led to questions ""that the police can't answer on their own"". He said London must learn from the joined up approach taken byGlasgow more than a decade ago, where knife crime was treated as a public health problem. ""We have to look at the fundamental root causes of why people - young men in particular - are carrying knives on the street. Do they feel unsafe? Is it a cultural issue, is it a social issue, is it an ideological issue?"" he added. ""What we do not want to do is turn it into a police state, but unfortunately we are left with very little options and opportunities to address this growing crime.""

Five-time world champion Bristow dies,"Eric Bristow was awarded an MBE for his services to sport in 1989 Five-time world darts champion Eric Bristow has died at the age of 60 after suffering a heart attack. Professional Darts Corporation chairman Barry Hearn told BBC Sport he collapsed at a Premier League event in Liverpool. As news of his death reached the crowd at the Echo Arena, fans repeatedly sang: ""There's only one Eric Bristow."" Hearn said Bristow, known by his nickname the Crafty Cockney, would ""always be a legend in the world of darts and British sport"". World champion five times between 1980 and 1986, Bristow also won five World Masters titles and was a founder player when the PDC was formed in 1993. He was awarded an MBE for his services to sport in 1989. He also worked as a TV pundit and appeared on ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here in 2012. READ MORE: 'The Crafty Cockney' - a darts pioneer This video can not be played Archive: Bristow wins first BDO World Championship in 1980 In November he lost his role with Sky aftersuggesting sexual abuse victims were not ""proper men"". After more than 20 former footballers made allegations of child sex abuse, Bristow asked on social media why victims did not ""sort out"" their abusers ""when they got older and fitter"". He later apologised for his comments, describing himself as a ""bull in a China shop"" and said he ""appreciated my wording was wrong and offended many people"". ""Eric was never afraid of controversy, but he spoke as he found and was honest and straightforward, which is what people admired about him,"" Hearn added. ""The PDC, and the sport of darts, will miss him."" Bristow competed at a World Championship for the final time in 2000 - his 23rd in a career during which he won more than 70 professional titles. He was inducted into the PDC Hall of Fame in 2005 and retired from competing at the end of 2007. PDC chief executive Matthew Porter posted on social media that he had been with Bristow at Thursday's event in Liverpool before the 60-year-old collapsed. He wrote: ""Awful evening here in Liverpool. Was with Eric earlier and he was in great spirits. A massive character. There are tears for a legend backstage here tonight."" Keith Deller, who beat Bristow to win the 1983 title, said on stage at the Echo Arena on Thursday: ""I'm devastated, me and Eric were together all the time. ""What he's done for our game, tonight, if it wasn't for Eric, no-one would be here tonight."" PDC chairman Barry Hearn, speaking to BBC Sport It's just unbelievable. He was working as normal in hospitality, started feeling ill and collapsed and died. Our thoughts go out to his family because this has come as a massive shock to the whole sport of darts. You had players in tears on the Premier League stage tonight and the crowd chanting his name endlessly because of the influence he had on darts. The word legend is overused but it's an understatement for Eric Bristow. We often talk about the absence of characters in sport but Eric Bristow was a character with a capital 'c'. He was very much a man of the people. He understood what crowds wanted to see - he was controversial, he was a maverick, he spoke his mind and upset a few people from time to time, but the man in the street warmed to him because he was very much one of theirs. He had time for people, he knew how to entertain, he developed his own style, his own persona and he transcended the sport for 10-15 years and to this day people still remember the Crafty Cockney in his pomp. He is probably one of the reasons why darts is where it is today - it hasn't lost that touch with the ordinary man, because it is made up of ordinary men with extraordinary ability, and Bristow was the ringleader from the beginning. His name is synonymous with darts. Eric Bristow and Phil Taylor are the two legendary names from that era that took the sport out of the pubs and onto the global stage. It has come out from the ordinary working man's game and Eric Bristow epitomised where the game came from but had the star quality to take it to the next level. For that, every player playing today should be grateful, because he blazed a trail. I think Eric deserves to be remembered and we'll discuss how but at the moment we're just shocked by a great player and great personality leaving us far too early at age of 60. Two-time world championMichael van Gerwenon BBC Radio Merseyside: ""It's a huge shock. He's a legend in what he did. Look at what he did for darts, how many titles he won. ""He was someone with very honest opinions. He's going to be a big miss. He was one of the makers of darts, great for the sport. He was still working always and never gave up and to hear of this - I know him quite well - I have goosebumps all over my body at the moment. ""I just heard the news straight after my game, no-one ever saw this coming. My thoughts are with his family who must be going through a horrible time right now."" Sixteen-time world championPhil Taylor, who was mentored by Bristow, wrote on Twitter: ""Words cannot express how sad and shocked I am to hear the terrible news about Eric's passing. A huge influence on my career and a larger than life character, the world has lost a legend. RIP pal."" Two-time world championDennis Priestleyalso wrote on Twitter: ""Absolutely devastated to be told earlier that my good friend Eric Bristow has passed away. We shared some great times together and I'm so saddened that we won't get to share anymore. Rest in peace old friend."" Five-time world championRaymond van Barneveld:""I am lost for words and really devastated! He was darts. He meant so much to me, I cannot believe it. My thoughts go out to his wife and family."" Two-time World Championship runner-upSimon Whitlock:""Shocked and saddened to hear the news about a true legend of the sport I love. RIP Eric Bristow. Thanks for everything you did for darts."" Former Doctor Who starColin Baker, who appeared with Bristow in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here: ""So very sad to hear about Eric Bristow tonight. He kept me sane and focused in I'm A Celeb and was a funny, forthright, no-nonsense friend. My thoughts are with his family. I'll miss him."" Kevin Painter, PDC World Championship runner-up in 2004: ""Devastated to hear the news that my great pal and darting legend Eric Bristow has passed away, RIP my friend."" Former world heavyweight boxing championFrank Bruno:""Very saddened to hear the news that Eric Bristow has passed away today, God rest his soul. RIP."" Ex-heavyweight world boxing championDavid Haye, who appeared with Bristow in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here in 2012: ""So sad to hear darts legend and great guy Eric Bristow passed away. I was fortunate to spend three weeks as his camp mate living in the jungle. Even on the toughest of days his dry sense of humour and quick wit truly made the trip memorable.

"1,500 companies miss gender pay deadlineThousands of firms break the law by failing to submit their pay figures before Wednesday's deadline.1han hour agoBusiness","This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? More than 1,500 companies have failed to report their gender pay gap figures before Wednesday night's deadline. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said 1,557 firms had missed the deadline. It will now contact these companies to remind them of their legal obligations. The equalities watchdog will investigate those firms that fail to comply and could take legal action against them, with penalties including an unlimited fine. All companies, charities and public sector bodies with more than 250 employees were required to submit their gender pay figures before Wednesday's deadline. The EHRC will check whether those firms that failed to report fall into this category. One organisation that missed the deadline was the Unite union, which belatedly published its figures on Thursday. The union, which describes itself as being ""at the forefront of the trade union campaign to achieve equal pay"", revealed that its female employees' median hourly pay was 29.6% lower than what male workers are paid. Want to find out the median gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here. More than 10,000 firms have published data, with in excess of 1,000 firms reporting on the last day. More than three-quarters of UK companies pay men more on average than women, BBC analysis of government figures suggests. The median pay gap among those companies was 9.7%. The figures indicate 78% of firms pay men more than women on average, while 14% pay women more. This is based on the median measure, which is the level of pay that separates the top half of earners from the lower half. In total, 8% said they had no pay gap between men and women. The gender pay gap is not the same as having unequal pay, which would be against the law. By law, men and women with the same jobs have to be paid the same wages. A gender pay gap can arise if there are more highly paid men than women in a company, or if women are deemed to be less experienced than their male counterparts, or if women take a hit to their salary after taking maternity leave. In reporting gender pay, firms with more than 250 staff have to publish data on the average difference between male and female employees. Nine ways to narrow the gender pay gap Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap? Rebecca Hilsenrath, EHRC chief executive, said it was pleased with the rate of reporting, but added: ""It is the law, it's not an option. It is the right thing to do, and we will be enforcing against all those organisations which failed to meet the deadline."" The EHRC will send letters to all of those organisations next week and they will then have 28 days to respond. Terms of reference will then be issued for the enforcement process, which will be made public. She said the more important issue is what companies will do to address the pay gap: ""We want them to look at their flexible working practices, we want to look at them tackling bias, conscious and unconscious, and we're looking to them to address instances of pregnancy and maternity pay discrimination."" Airline Ryanair was one of the companies reporting a large difference, with a 71.8% gender pay gap. Boux Avenue, the lingerie firm owned by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, reported a median hourly pay gap of 75.7%, while fashion retailer Karen Millen had a gap of 49%. High Street brands Costa, KFC, Matalan, McDonald's, Primark and Starbucks reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. Some firms reported so-called ""negative"" pay gaps, where women are paid on average more than men. These included electric car maker Tesla Motors, babywear retailer Mamas and Papas and electronics retailer Richer Sounds. Some have said reporting the pay gap is crude and open to misinterpretation, but gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society said it is an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn. Want to learn more about the gender gap? Try asking our bot below. The median pay gap among the 10,000 companies with more than 250 employees that have reported figures in the government's pay portal is 9.7%. But according to the Office of National Statistics the UK's median gender pay gap is 18.4%. Why is there a difference between the figures? The ONS figure is based on its annual survey of hours and earnings, and that includes both full and part-time workers, and covers all employers. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees. The national and sector gender pay gap figures come from the 2017 ONS ASHE survey.

"Plastic bag litter falls in UK seasA study shows the number of plastic bags has fallen, amid a rise in other types of plastic rubbish.7h7 hours agoScience & EnvironmentComments","A study of litter in UK seas shows the number of plastic bags has fallen, amid a rise in other types of plastic rubbish. The authors say this could be due to several things - the introduction of charges for plastic bags across Europe, manufacturing changes and shifts in ocean dynamics. The research found a rise in the proportion of fishing debris. Some of the plastic debris is likely to be coming from outside the UK. The reduced proportion of plastic bags in marine litter was found from 2010 onwards. There was a drop of around 30% from the pre-2010 period compared with afterwards. If charging is a potential contributor, the downward trend could suggest that policies can affect the amount and distribution of certain marine litter items on short timescales. But in their scientific paper, the researchers add that this point is controversial. A change in the composition of plastic bags, which may speed up the rate at which they decompose, could also be another factor. Co-author Thomas Maes, who is a marine litter scientist at the government's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), said: ""It is encouraging to see that efforts by all of society, whether the public, industry, NGOs or government to reduce plastic bags are having an effect. ""We observed sharp declines in the percentage of plastic bags as captured by fishing nets trawling the seafloor around the UK compared to 2010 and this research suggests that by working together we can reduce, reuse and recycle to tackle the marine litter problem."" A UK levy of 5p per bag was introduced in 2015. The study,published in the journal Science of the Total Environment,external, looked at plastic debris on the seabed off UK coasts over a 25-year period. It compiles the results of 39 separate boat surveys that trawled for plastic between 1992 and 2017. Bags, bottles and fishing related debris were commonly observed across all areas. There was no significant trend over time in the percentage of seafloor trawls that contained any plastic litter or in the total plastic litter items found across the long-term datasets. However, statistically significant trends were found for fishing debris such as nets and lines. The researchers suggest that better training and action by the industry could help reduce the amount of fishing-related items found on the sea bottom.

Yulia Skripal: I'm getting stronger daily,"Ms Skripal and her father are in hospital in Salisbury after the attack UK police have issued a statement on behalf of Russian spy Sergei Skripal's daughter, the first since the pair were poisoned by a nerve agent in March. The statement quoted Yulia Skripal as saying her ""strength is growing daily"". Ms Skripal, 33, and her father are in hospital in Salisbury, southern England, where the attack took place. The UK Foreign Office says Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen, has not yet taken up Russia's offer of consular assistance. The Russian embassy in London said last week that it was insisting on its right to see her after it emerged that she was conscious and talking. Earlier on Thursday, Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Ms Skripal and her cousin. However, doubts have been cast on how authentic the recording is; the presenters of the programme said they had been unable to verify it and themselves had doubts about it. Mr Skripal, 66, remains critically ill but stable. The UK government has accused Russia of being behind the 4 March attack, but Russia's ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. The incident has sparked an international diplomatic crisis. The United Nations Security Council has been discussing the poisoning in a meeting called by Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the British accusations against Russia as horrific and unsubstantiated. The UK is ""playing with fire"", he said. In the statement released by the police, Ms Skripal said she was grateful for the many messages of goodwill she had received. ""I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily,"" the statement said. ""I have many people to thank for my recovery and would especially like to mention the people of Salisbury that came to my aid when my father and I were incapacitated,"" it went on. ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" The Russian TV recording is purported to be between Ms Skripal and her cousin Viktoria, who lives in Russia. The woman described as Yulia says: ""Everything is ok. He [her father] is resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I will be discharged soon. Everything is ok."" Russian bid for joint spy probe rejected Russia asks to visit Yulia Skripal in UK Viktoria Skripal says she hopes to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be that of Yulia tells her that no-one will give her one. Correspondents say that what Yulia says in the recording about her father ""resting"" does not chime with what we know of the Skripals' health, and the conversation about the visa is strange. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa, possibly on Thursday, and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Russian news agency Interfax also quoted the cousin as saying in an interview that they had spoken and that Yulia had told her that all was well. Viktoria expressed surprise that the phone call had come a day after she had told media that she was not allowed to speak to Yulia, Interfax reported. ""Do you believe in coincidences? I don't,"" it quoted her as saying. Viktoria is said to be one of the pair's closest living relatives after a series of family deaths. Skripal poisoning: What we know so far Full coverage of the Russian spy poisoning This video can not be played Russian news channel airs Yulia Skripal hospital 'recording' The hosts of the 60 Minute show on state-owned Rossiya 1 - Yevgeny Popov and Olga Skabeyeva - said they were unable to confirm the authenticity of the phone call. Viktoria: Hello? ""Yulia"": Hello. Can you hear me? Viktoria: Yes, I can hear you. ""Yulia"": It is Yulia Skripal. Viktoria: Oh, Yulka [diminutive of Yulia] it's you! I can tell it's you from your voice but I don't understand. So, they gave you a telephone, did they? ""Yulia"": Yes, yes. Viktoria: Thanks God! Yulyasha [diminutive of Yulia], is everything okay? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok, everything's fine. Viktoria: Look, if tomorrow I get a [British] visa, I'll come to you on Monday. ""Yulia"": Vika, no-one will give you a visa. Viktoria: Well I thought so too. Oh well. ""Yulia"": Most likely. Viktoria: If they do, I need you to tell me whether I can visit you or not, tell me that I can. ""Yulia"": I don't think so, that's the situation at the moment, we'll sort it out later. Viktoria: I know, I know. ""Yulia"": Later, we'll get it sorted later, everything's fine, we'll see later. Viktoria: Is that your phone? ""Yulia"": It's a temporary phone. Everything's fine, but we'll see how it goes, we'll decide later. You know what the situation is here. Everything is fine, everything is solvable, everyone is recovering and is alive. Viktoria: Understood. Is everything ok with your dad? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok. He's resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I'll be discharged soon. Everything is ok. Viktoria: Kisses, babes. ""Yulia"": Bye. The recording was reportedly made on the morning of 5 April The poisoning, which the UK blames on Russia, has led to worsening relations between Moscow and many Western countries, with more than 150 diplomats expelled on each side. Speaking shortly after the alleged conversation was released, Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko denied statements by UK officials that Russia did not respond to the poisoning allegations immediately. He read out a letter which he said Russia had sent denying involvement, adding that claims that Russia had a nerve agent stockpile were not true.

Russian bid for joint probe rejected,"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Russia's proposal for a new, joint investigation into the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter in England has been voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hague. Russia has accused Britain of blocking access to an investigation being carried out by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Britain earlier said Russia's call for an inquiry with the UK was ""perverse"". Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. China, Azerbaijan, Sudan, Algeria and Iran were among the countries that backed Russia's motion at the OPCW executive council, Reuters reported. Russia called the meeting to challenge the UK, which has blamed Moscow for the March 4 poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, southern England. Russia has strongly denied any involvement and in a press conference after the vote said what happened in Salisbury looked like a ""terrorist attack"". It strongly criticised the US and EU countries for siding with the UK. The votes backing Russia and the abstentions showed that more than half of the council ""refused to associate themselves with the West's point of view,"" said Russia's ambassador to the OPCW Aleksander Shulgin, He said the UK had told the council ""a dirty flow of complete lies... outright Russophobia"". At the Hague meeting, UK acting representative John Foggo had said the victim of a chemical weapons' attack was not required to work with the ""likely perpetrator"".Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson later accused Russia of trying to undermine the watchdog's work,externaland said the international community had ""seen through these tactics"". Row over Johnson's Salisbury response Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. On Tuesday the UK's Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used in Salisbury, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The comments were seized upon by Russia to discredit the UK's accusations. It has requested that the UN Security Council meet on Thursday to discuss the situation for a second time. At The Hague on Wednesday,the European Union offered its full support to Britain and reiterated that it backed the UK's assessment,externalthat it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was responsible. British envoy Mr Foggo told the emergency OPCW meeting,externalthat the UK had blamed Russia based on: the identification of the nerve agent used knowledge that Russia ""has produced this agent and remains capable of doing so"" Russia's record of conducting state sponsored assassinations The assessment that Russia ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"" He said that Russia had offered more than 24 ""contradictory and changing counter-narratives"" about the attack, including ""preposterous"" suggestions that Sweden, the US or Britain itself could have been responsible. This video can not be played UK Security Minister: It is ""beyond reasonable doubt"" Russia is responsible Russia's President Putin, speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara, said he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail. Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russia called the meeting to confront Britain and to propose a new joint investigation with the UK into the Salisbury attack. Western powers portrayed the bid as an attempt to undermine the OPCW's existing investigation. The global watchdog is analysing samples from Salisbury in order to identify the nerve agent used. It was asked to do so by the UK, and Russia was not invited to participate. A team believed to be from the OPCW carry out tests in Salisbury The OPCW expects to receive the results of its independent laboratory tests within a week. Russia has signalled it will reject the results of the investigation if its experts are prohibited from taking part. The watchdog does not have the power to attribute blame, but it could ask the Kremlin to grant its inspectors access to former Soviet Union production facilities to check all of their chemical weapons stockpiles have been destroyed. Analysis by the BBC's David Shukman The only way that scientists can be totally sure who made the Novichok agent is to compare it with another sample of the substance made in the same lab. That's what happened when Sarin was used by Saddam Hussein in Iraq and more recently by President Assad in Syria. Experts already knew which clues to look for, and that allowed them to lay the blame definitively. Novichok is much less well known. The traces of it gathered in Salisbury will have been put through detailed scientific screening and that would reveal the ingredients of the chemical and maybe also its basic structure. That could be matched with whatever is known about Novichok, maybe from lab notes handed over by defectors. And for Porton Down to describe it as ""military grade"" suggests a sophisticated state producer, not an amateur, though that itself is not categorical proof of Russian involvement. That leaves another scenario in this secretive world of smoke and mirrors - that Britain did already have a sample of Novichok and was able to compare it to the agent used on the Skripals but does not want to reveal the fact, to protect a valuable source of intelligence. What are Novichok nerve agents? Questions arose about whether the UK had been too quick to point the finger at Russia after the Porton Down laboratory said that it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent. Porton Down dismissed Russian claims the nerve agent might have come from the laboratory The laboratory said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"" but that it was not its job to say where the agent was manufactured. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. On Twitter, the Russian Embassy highlighted a now-deleted tweet by the UK Foreign Office which suggested Porton Down had said the nerve agent had been produced in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

""Unlike Russia, we allow the media to come and meet our scientists and question the science,"" he said. ""That's important. That's why we have this debate today: we have nothing to hide.""

Russia: UK 'playing with fire' over Skripals,"This video can not be played Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia: ""You are playing with fire and you will be sorry"" Russia has accused the UK of inventing a ""fake story"" and ""playing with fire"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning. At a UN Security Council meeting, Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia with ""unsubstantiated accusations"". The UK says Russia is behind the attack but Moscow denies responsibility. Britain's UN representative Karen Pierce said the UK's actions ""stand up to any scrutiny"". She likened Moscow's requests to take part in the investigation to an arsonist investigating his own fire. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Russian tensions with West 'worse than Cold War' Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on 4 March. Ms Skripal, 33, is recovering in hospital andhas released a statementsaying her ""strength is growing daily"". Her father, 66, remains critically ill but stable. Meanwhile it has emerged that when police sealed off Mr Skripal's home at the start of the investigation. there were two guinea pigs and a cat inside. The BBC understands the guinea pigs died of starvation and the cat, distressed from dehydration, was put down. Moscow called the special meeting of the Security Council in New York to discuss the attack, saying Britain had ""legitimate questions"" to answer. Mr Nebenzia said the accusations were ""horrific and unsubstantiated"", and claimed the UK was waging a ""propaganda war"" against Russia. He said Novichok - the group of nerve agent used in the poisoning - is ""not copyrighted by Russia, in spite of the obviously Russian name"" and has been developed in many countries. ""It's some sort of theatre of the absurd. Couldn't you come up with a better fake story?"" he asked. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital In his statement to the 15-member council, Mr Nebenzia questioned why Russia would eliminate someone using a ""dangerous and highly public"" method. He contrasted the use of a chemical with the ""hundreds of clever ways of killing someone"" shown in British series Midsomer Murders. Responding, the British Ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, accused Russia of seeking to ""undermine the international institutions that have kept us safe since the Second World War"". She said Russia came under suspicion for several reasons, saying it had ""a record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations"" and that it ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"". Ms Pierce told delegates that Russia's request to visit Ms Skripal had been passed on and ""we await her response"". ""Ms Skripal's own wishes need to be taken into account,"" Ms Pierce added. This video can not be played Viktoria, the cousin of Yulia Skripal, says she is 100% certain it was her cousin who rang her On Friday, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Russia's comments were a ""classic Russian attempt to obfuscate"". He said: ""They are in a very serious position because it's not just the UK that has taken action against them. In an unprecedented way, that did not even happen in the Cold War, 29 countries have withdrawn their diplomats."" He also said the UK had shared ""highly classified information"" with the other countries which was also ""unprecedented"". Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be wrong to think Russia would end up ""admitting to all terrible sins and saying 'I was wrong, please forgive me, I will now act by your rules'. Meanwhile, US representative Kelley Currie said Russia was attempting to use the Security Council ""for political gains"", adding: ""This is not a tactic that is appropriate for this body."" The escalating diplomatic crisis between Moscow and the West saw 60 expelled US envoys leave Russia on Thursday. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. The UK government has constantly maintained Russia was behind the attack, claiming there is ""no other plausible explanation"". Chemical weapons expert Hamish De Bretton Gordon said he had seen some of the intelligence in the Skripals' case and was ""100% sure"" Russia was responsible. He told BBC Radio 5 live ""we know almost 100%"" that Novichok, which requires a ""sophisticated laboratory, a lot of money, resources and expertise to make"", was made at Shikhany, a military facility ""the size of Salisbury"" in central Russia, and the agent used in the attack on the Skripals was ""military grade"". He added: ""We are talking a tiny amount [of Novichok], a quarter of an egg cup full which would be very easy to smuggle."" On Wednesday,Russia proposed a joint investigation into the poisoningbut the idea was voted down by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In a press conference, Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said it marked a vote against ""transparency"". Meanwhile on Thursday, ina statement issued through UK police, Ms Skripal thanked those who came to her and her father's aid. It came shortly afterRussian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversationbetween Ms Skripal and her cousin. Doubts were raised over the authenticity of the recording but the cousin, Viktoria, hastold Newsnight she is 100% certain it was Yulia.

'Burglar' murder probe suspect bailed,"Richard Osborn-Brooks has been bailed until May A 78-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder after a suspected burglar was stabbed to death has been bailed. The man, named locally as Richard Osborn-Brooks, foundtwo intruders in South Park Crescent, Hither Green, south-east London, early on Wednesday. A man armed with a screwdriver forced the homeowner into his kitchen where there was a struggle and the suspect was stabbed, the Met said. The suspected burglar who died has been named as Henry Vincent, 37, from Kent. Mr Vincent was named and pictured by Kent Police in January as part of an investigation into a distraction burglary. What are your rights if someone breaks into your home? Jewellery and valuables were stolen from a man in his 70s, police said at the time. Mr Osborn-Brooks has been bailed until May pending further inquiries. Henry Vincent, 37, was under investigation over a separate burglary involving another elderly victim Police said they were called to the property over reports of a burglary when they found Mr Vincent collapsed in nearby Further Green Road with a stab wound to the upper body. A witness said an accomplice dragged Mr Vincent toward a van before leaving him for dead. A second suspect fled the scene and is still being hunted by police. Forensic officers investigate the drains near the scene in South Park Crescent Det Ch Insp Simon Harding appealed for anyone with information regarding the second suspect - who is believed to be a white male and fled the scene in a white van - to come forward. ""He may have told someone what happened at the address,"" he added. On Thursday, a team used machinery to move a parked car so that officers could access a drain on the street. Investigators lifted off the cover and sifted through buckets of liquid pulled from the drain before putting the green Rover back. A woman also left a bunch of flowers at the police cordon on Further Green Road, yards from where Mr Vincent fell. Flowers addressed to Mr Osborn-Brooks's home were delivered to the police cordon on South Park Crescent by a courier. A forensic tent was set up outside Richard Osborn-Brooks' home in Hither Green One man who lives on the street said there had been a recent spate of burglaries in the area and his home had been broken into in recent months. Adam Lake, another local resident, said he ""wasn't surprised"" to hear about the burglary. ""I feel terrible for the man that was burgled. He doesn't deserve to be punished for defending himself,"" he said. A neighbour of Mr Osborn-Brooks, who asked not to be named, supported his right to defend the neighbourhood. She said: ""[I've heard] he's a carer - this is a pensioner that has worked all his life who wants to live and die quietly."" What are your rights in tackling burglars?

OU staff want chief Horrocks to resign,"Academic staff at the Open University have passed a vote of no confidence in their vice-chancellor, Peter Horrocks. Members of the University and College Union are now calling on Mr Horrocks to resign ""as soon as possible"". Mr Horrocks had angered staff by saying academics ""get away with not teaching"" and that impending cuts were ""reprioritising"". He later apologised by letter, saying: ""I sincerely regret that my careless language caused offence or hurt."" He went on: ""I would like to meet with as many of you as possible in coming weeks, so you can express your concerns and so I can address any misconceptions that some of you believe I have about your teaching."" The row comes as the OU is planning a ""radical overhaul"" of the nearly 50-year-old institution, which aims to save Â£100m from an annual budget of Â£420m. The OU, which is projecting an annual deficit of around Â£20m and has been badly affected by a collapse in the number of part-time students in England, says half of the money saved will be reinvested into the institution. Mr Horrocks said the changes would result in""a revitalised and redesigned OU"". But now at a UCU branch meeting, members have passed a motion saying: ""This general meeting has no confidence in our current vice-chancellor, or in his plans and intentions for the future of our university. ""On the basis of recent events, he has shown that he does not understand the university's teaching model, nor the importance of the OU's research base. ""We believe the best way of avoiding damage to the public image of the OU is for the VC to step down as soon as possible. We therefore call upon the VC to resign."" A spokesman for the OU said: ""We are midway through an ambitious programme to transform the way we teach and support our students so that they have the best preparation for the challenges of a rapidly changing world. ""The plans have sparked a lively internal debate as well as a degree of concern. ""We can confirm that these concerns will be discussed more thoroughly at a special meeting of the University Council and later at the OU's academic governing body, the Senate."" Mr Horrocks had previously worked at the BBC for 33 years, leaving his post as director of the BBC World Service Group in 2014. He took up the post at the OU three years ago in 2015. The OU was founded in 1969 to offer higher education distance learning to students who often did not fit the traditional undergraduate mould - many were older and studying part-time while working.

Scammers abused Facebook phone search,"Facebook was warned by security researchers that attackers could abuse its phone number and email search facility to harvest people's data. On Wednesday, the firm said ""malicious actors"" had been harvesting profiles for years by abusing the search tool. It said anybody that had not changed their privacy settings after adding their phone number should assume their information had been harvested. One security expert told the BBC the attack had been possible ""for years"". Until Wednesday, Facebook let people search for their friends' profiles by typing in a phone number or email address. But it said scammers had abused the facility and used it to link phone numbers and emails to people's names and profile information. An attacker could type in any phone number - even one they had made up by guessing - and link it to a person's profile. Often this would reveal their name, location and other profile information. This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded By linking a phone number to personal details, a scammer could telephone the victim and address them by name. They could pretend to be from a bank or other organisation. ""This is known as enumeration, going through all the iterations of a number,"" said security researcher Ken Munro from Pen Test Partners. ""If you wanted to scam somebody, you had a route to find their details and know their name - a fantastic set-up for a scam."" Facebook said it had put measures in place to limit how often people could search. But the measures were ""not able to prevent malicious actors who cycled through hundreds of thousands of different IP addresses,"" Mark Zuckerberg explained. An IP address can be used to identify an individual computer using the internet, but the attackers changed theirs frequently to avoid detection. Facebook has previously encouraged people to add their phone number to their account. It said doing so would make it easier to connect with friends, or improve account security. By default, anybody could then find the Facebook profile by typing the phone number in the search box. Facebook said the facility had been ""useful"" for finding friends, especially in countries where many people have the same name. It said phone number searches made up ""7% of all searches"" in Bangladesh. However, while members could choose not to display their phone number on their profile, it was not possible to completely opt out of the search facility. Security researchers have previously written about how the feature could be abused by scammers. In August 2015, Facebook told onesecurity researcher,externalthat it did not consider the issue a security vulnerability. News siteWired,externalhas also spoken to another developer that raised the issue with Facebook. Facebook has faced scrutiny after it was revealed that the data of millions of people was improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. On Thursday, Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport said Facebook had put ""the data of over a million of our citizens at risk"". Facebook said an audit had revealed that scammers had managed to act with ""scale and sophistication"" to overcome its technical measures. It said ""most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way"". Speaking to reporters, Mr Zuckerberg said: ""It is reasonable to expect that if you had that [default] setting turned on, that in the last several years someone has probably accessed your public information in this way. ""Given that and what we know today, it just makes sense to shut that down."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plastic bag litter falls in UK seas,"A study of litter in UK seas shows the number of plastic bags has fallen, amid a rise in other types of plastic rubbish. The authors say this could be due to several things - the introduction of charges for plastic bags across Europe, manufacturing changes and shifts in ocean dynamics. The research found a rise in the proportion of fishing debris. Some of the plastic debris is likely to be coming from outside the UK. The reduced proportion of plastic bags in marine litter was found from 2010 onwards. There was a drop of around 30% from the pre-2010 period compared with afterwards. If charging is a potential contributor, the downward trend could suggest that policies can affect the amount and distribution of certain marine litter items on short timescales. But in their scientific paper, the researchers add that this point is controversial. A change in the composition of plastic bags, which may speed up the rate at which they decompose, could also be another factor. Co-author Thomas Maes, who is a marine litter scientist at the government's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), said: ""It is encouraging to see that efforts by all of society, whether the public, industry, NGOs or government to reduce plastic bags are having an effect. ""We observed sharp declines in the percentage of plastic bags as captured by fishing nets trawling the seafloor around the UK compared to 2010 and this research suggests that by working together we can reduce, reuse and recycle to tackle the marine litter problem."" A UK levy of 5p per bag was introduced in 2015. The study,published in the journal Science of the Total Environment,external, looked at plastic debris on the seabed off UK coasts over a 25-year period. It compiles the results of 39 separate boat surveys that trawled for plastic between 1992 and 2017. Bags, bottles and fishing related debris were commonly observed across all areas. There was no significant trend over time in the percentage of seafloor trawls that contained any plastic litter or in the total plastic litter items found across the long-term datasets. However, statistically significant trends were found for fishing debris such as nets and lines. The researchers suggest that better training and action by the industry could help reduce the amount of fishing-related items found on the sea bottom.

Firearms A&E doctor jailed for 12 years,"Martin Watt had worked at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie until 2012 A former A&E consultant has been jailed for 12 years for possessing firearms with intent to endanger life. Dr Martin Watt, who worked at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie from 1994, was sacked in 2012 following disciplinary proceedings. The 62-year-old was later found with three sub-machine guns, two pistols, ammunition and an ""assassination list"" of those he blamed for his dismissal. He wasfound guilty last monthafter a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. The court had heard how he compiled a list of ""bad guys"", and hatched a plan to ""assassinate"" them. Watt used the weapons for target practice to make himself a better marksman. He also researched the best routes to the addresses of some of the people on his list, and compiled a list of some of their car registration numbers. His home in Lanarkshire was raided by police last year after a tip-off. Jailing him, judge Lady Stacey told Watt: ""These are lethal weapons. Not only did you have the guns, you had live ammunition. The weapons were all in working order because you reactivated them. ""You had them with intent to endanger life and any court must take a very serious view of this. You represent a danger to members of the public. ""You had researched routes to some addresses, you told the jury you practised shooting to make yourself a better marksman."" The judge added: ""It is sad to see a man who has held position you have, in this situation, but I must protect the public."" She ordered Watt to be on licence for three years after his release from prison.  A Serious Crime Prevention Order was also granted restricting his internet use, travel and NHS visits for five years after his release from custody. Skorpion sub-machine guns like these were discovered by police Several replica weapons were also found by police in the former consultant's home Officers also found information about the people involved in Watt's disciplinary hearing Watt, who continues to insist he did not plan to harm anyone with the weapons, smiled as sentence was passed and nodded while the judge was speaking. He had claimed he had merely compiled the ""hit list"" as a way of making himself feel better, and had no intention of carrying out any attacks. Defence QC John Scott said: ""This is clearly a most unusual case and Dr Watt is an unusual person to be sitting in the dock at the High Court. ""He is a medical man who with over 30 years of significant public service in the NHS. ""He had a prominent role in the campaign to keep Monklands Hospital, He is an intelligent man who has made a positive contribution to society."" Police found three Skorpion sub-machine guns, two Valtro pistols and bullets including 57 dum-dum bullets when they searched his home in Condorrat in May of last year. The court heard that Watt bought decommissioned weapons legally from the Czech Republic and put them back into working order in his workshop. They also uncovered the ""bad guys"" list, along with information on individual addresses and car registrations. The ""template"" for the attacks was based on a film about a group of mercenaries. Watt also carried out target practice with a Skorpion sub-machine gun at a forest area close to a motorway near his home. Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for homicide and major crime, said: ""Martin Watt put together the collection of guns for a particular purpose and there would have had extreme consequences had he been able to carry out his intentions. ""It was clear from the case presented in court that he had gone beyond simply thinking about his actions and there was a clear plan in place to carry out a dreadful event.

J Rose +1, D Johnson E, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (17) None of the lads behind can catch Spieth, although Rafa Cabrera-Bello could still take a share of second place. The Spaniard is sitting pretty in the centre of the 18th green for two, but must convert a 53-foot putt if he is to record only the 10th birdie of the day on the last. J Spieth -6 (18) Ahhh, another stunner from Jordan Spieth. A gentle, precise swing of the wedge from the left side of the green leaves him with a simple tap-in. He escapes with a bogey on the last, signing for a six-under 66. The 2015 champion is our overnight leader, two shots clear of fellow Americans Tony Finau and Matt Kuchar. That's the third time in four years that Spieth has been the overnight leader after day one at Augusta. Rory McIlroy signed for a three-under-par 69 - his best opening round since 2011.

On his birdie on the par-five 13, after landing in a greenside bunker with his second shot, he said it was the ""best up and down I've made all year"". He added: ""If you shortside yourself, you're in trouble. They (tournament officials) turn something on overnight because those greens are firmer and faster than what we were practicing on."" J Rose +1, D Johnson E, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (17) Nothing is dropping for Dustin Johnson today. The world number one is getting himself into positions, but can't convert with the short stick. Another birdie chance slides by on 17, while Justin Rose drops back with a bogey. Rafa Cabrera-Bello is the in-form man among this trio, three birdies in four holes putting the Spaniard into that seven-strong pack in tied fourth.

Jordan Spieth has hooked his tee shot on the last into the trees on the left. Big bother for the leader... McIlroy -3 (18) Rory McIlroy tugs his approach on the last left, knocking a precise chip back to within a few feet. Some top-drawer scrambling from the four-time major winner today. He knocks that in to complete a very tidy card - four birdies and just the one bogey. He said he wanted a fast start and that's only his second sub-70 opening round at Augusta. Unfortunately for him, Jordan Spieth is sprinting out ahead in front of him. J Spieth -7 (17) Here's one stat fans: Jordan Spieth has never birdied the 17th at Augusta. Neither have I. Guess what? Spieth has a golden chance of putting one over me here. The ice-veined Texan drills a seven-foot putt straight down the middle, that's a career-best fifth birdie on the bounce in a major. Any bookies paying out yet? P Mickelson -2, R Fowler -2, M Kuchar -4 (18) Matt Kuchar rounds off a brilliant back nine by sinking his fifth birdie, propelling him into a share of second spot with Tony Finau. His compatriots Mickelson and Fowler can't add to their tallies on the last, nevetheless these three will be happy with their work when they chat about their rounds over an ice-cold bev. J Rose E, D Johnson E (12) Justin Rose's charge has stalled a little with successive pars on 14 and 15, while Dustin Johnson also impressively pars the 15th after plopping his second shot in the drink. R McIlroy -3 (17) McIlroy's putter has been as hot as a poker on this back nine too. Not quite as red as Spieth's, but still. Chasing the Rory Slam remember, he saves a sandy par after finding the trap at the front of the green and needing his putter to rescue a seven footer. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Plastic bag litter falls in UK seasA study shows the number of plastic bags has fallen, amid a rise in other types of plastic rubbish.","A study of litter in UK seas shows the number of plastic bags has fallen, amid a rise in other types of plastic rubbish. The authors say this could be due to several things - the introduction of charges for plastic bags across Europe, manufacturing changes and shifts in ocean dynamics. The research found a rise in the proportion of fishing debris. Some of the plastic debris is likely to be coming from outside the UK. The reduced proportion of plastic bags in marine litter was found from 2010 onwards. There was a drop of around 30% from the pre-2010 period compared with afterwards. If charging is a potential contributor, the downward trend could suggest that policies can affect the amount and distribution of certain marine litter items on short timescales. But in their scientific paper, the researchers add that this point is controversial. A change in the composition of plastic bags, which may speed up the rate at which they decompose, could also be another factor. Co-author Thomas Maes, who is a marine litter scientist at the government's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), said: ""It is encouraging to see that efforts by all of society, whether the public, industry, NGOs or government to reduce plastic bags are having an effect. ""We observed sharp declines in the percentage of plastic bags as captured by fishing nets trawling the seafloor around the UK compared to 2010 and this research suggests that by working together we can reduce, reuse and recycle to tackle the marine litter problem."" A UK levy of 5p per bag was introduced in 2015. The study,published in the journal Science of the Total Environment,external, looked at plastic debris on the seabed off UK coasts over a 25-year period. It compiles the results of 39 separate boat surveys that trawled for plastic between 1992 and 2017. Bags, bottles and fishing related debris were commonly observed across all areas. There was no significant trend over time in the percentage of seafloor trawls that contained any plastic litter or in the total plastic litter items found across the long-term datasets. However, statistically significant trends were found for fishing debris such as nets and lines. The researchers suggest that better training and action by the industry could help reduce the amount of fishing-related items found on the sea bottom.

Female first-aiders ordered from sumo ring,"Women are forbidden from entering the sumo ring Women who rushed to perform first aid on a man who collapsed in a sumo ring in Japan were ordered by a referee to leave the ring, because females are banned from the space. The ring is regarded as sacred and women, traditionally seen as ""impure"", are forbidden from entering. They ran into the ring when Maizuru city mayor Ryozo Tatami collapsed while giving a speech. The head of Japan's sumo association later apologised to the women. ""The announcement [to get off the stage] was made by a referee who was upset, but it was an inappropriate act in a situation that involves one's life,"" Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, the sumo association's chief said in a statement. ""We deeply apologise."" Local reports later emerged that spectators saw salt being thrown into the ring after the women had left. In Japanese culture, salt is thrown into the sumo ring before a match to purify it. Some on social media said the gesture implied that the women had ""dirtied"" the ring. Women are not permitted in the sumo wrestling ring as they are seen as ""impure"" ""How rude is it that they threw salt to cleanse the ring after the women went in?"" one Japanese Twitter user said. ""This is the response to someone who tried to save a life? I think we'd better sprinkle salt on the head of the sumo association,"" another added. What is sumo wrestling? Inside the scandal-hit world of sumo Mr Tatami was taken to hospital and is in a stable condition. It is not the first time women entering the sumo ring has sparked controversy. In 2000, the then governor of Osaka Fusae Ota asked the sumo association to allow her to enter the ring so she could present a trophy to the champion wrestler, but her request was rejected.

Scammers abused Facebook phone number searchThe company was warned by security researchers that the search tool could be abused.3h3 hours agoTechnology,"Facebook was warned by security researchers that attackers could abuse its phone number and email search facility to harvest people's data. On Wednesday, the firm said ""malicious actors"" had been harvesting profiles for years by abusing the search tool. It said anybody that had not changed their privacy settings after adding their phone number should assume their information had been harvested. One security expert told the BBC the attack had been possible ""for years"". Until Wednesday, Facebook let people search for their friends' profiles by typing in a phone number or email address. But it said scammers had abused the facility and used it to link phone numbers and emails to people's names and profile information. An attacker could type in any phone number - even one they had made up by guessing - and link it to a person's profile. Often this would reveal their name, location and other profile information. This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded By linking a phone number to personal details, a scammer could telephone the victim and address them by name. They could pretend to be from a bank or other organisation. ""This is known as enumeration, going through all the iterations of a number,"" said security researcher Ken Munro from Pen Test Partners. ""If you wanted to scam somebody, you had a route to find their details and know their name - a fantastic set-up for a scam."" Facebook said it had put measures in place to limit how often people could search. But the measures were ""not able to prevent malicious actors who cycled through hundreds of thousands of different IP addresses,"" Mark Zuckerberg explained. An IP address can be used to identify an individual computer using the internet, but the attackers changed theirs frequently to avoid detection. Facebook has previously encouraged people to add their phone number to their account. It said doing so would make it easier to connect with friends, or improve account security. By default, anybody could then find the Facebook profile by typing the phone number in the search box. Facebook said the facility had been ""useful"" for finding friends, especially in countries where many people have the same name. It said phone number searches made up ""7% of all searches"" in Bangladesh. However, while members could choose not to display their phone number on their profile, it was not possible to completely opt out of the search facility. Security researchers have previously written about how the feature could be abused by scammers. In August 2015, Facebook told onesecurity researcher,externalthat it did not consider the issue a security vulnerability. News siteWired,externalhas also spoken to another developer that raised the issue with Facebook. Facebook has faced scrutiny after it was revealed that the data of millions of people was improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. On Thursday, Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport said Facebook had put ""the data of over a million of our citizens at risk"". Facebook said an audit had revealed that scammers had managed to act with ""scale and sophistication"" to overcome its technical measures. It said ""most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way"". Speaking to reporters, Mr Zuckerberg said: ""It is reasonable to expect that if you had that [default] setting turned on, that in the last several years someone has probably accessed your public information in this way. ""Given that and what we know today, it just makes sense to shut that down."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Plastic bag litter falls in UK seasA study of litter in UK seas shows the number of plastic bags has fallen, amid a rise in other types of plastic rubbish.1han hour agoScience & Environment","A study of litter in UK seas shows the number of plastic bags has fallen, amid a rise in other types of plastic rubbish. The authors say this could be due to several things - the introduction of charges for plastic bags across Europe, manufacturing changes and shifts in ocean dynamics. The research found a rise in the proportion of fishing debris. Some of the plastic debris is likely to be coming from outside the UK. The reduced proportion of plastic bags in marine litter was found from 2010 onwards. There was a drop of around 30% from the pre-2010 period compared with afterwards. If charging is a potential contributor, the downward trend could suggest that policies can affect the amount and distribution of certain marine litter items on short timescales. But in their scientific paper, the researchers add that this point is controversial. A change in the composition of plastic bags, which may speed up the rate at which they decompose, could also be another factor. Co-author Thomas Maes, who is a marine litter scientist at the government's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), said: ""It is encouraging to see that efforts by all of society, whether the public, industry, NGOs or government to reduce plastic bags are having an effect. ""We observed sharp declines in the percentage of plastic bags as captured by fishing nets trawling the seafloor around the UK compared to 2010 and this research suggests that by working together we can reduce, reuse and recycle to tackle the marine litter problem."" A UK levy of 5p per bag was introduced in 2015. The study,published in the journal Science of the Total Environment,external, looked at plastic debris on the seabed off UK coasts over a 25-year period. It compiles the results of 39 separate boat surveys that trawled for plastic between 1992 and 2017. Bags, bottles and fishing related debris were commonly observed across all areas. There was no significant trend over time in the percentage of seafloor trawls that contained any plastic litter or in the total plastic litter items found across the long-term datasets. However, statistically significant trends were found for fishing debris such as nets and lines. The researchers suggest that better training and action by the industry could help reduce the amount of fishing-related items found on the sea bottom.

"Bollywood star Khan jailed for five yearsSalman Khan is jailed after he was convicted of poaching rare antelope in 1998, but can appeal.3h3 hours agoIndia","Khan can appeal against the verdict An Indian court has sentenced Bollywood superstar Salman Khan to five years in jail for poaching rare antelope back in 1998. The court in Jodhpur also fined him 10,000 rupees ($154; Â£109) for the crime. He has since been taken to jail. Khan killed the two blackbucks, a protected species, in the western state of Rajasthan while shooting a film. Four other actors who starred with him in the movie and were also charged with the offence have been acquitted. Khan, 52, can appeal against the verdict in a higher court. Correspondents say he will have to spend at least a few days in prison. The Bollywood superstar who lives dangerously Salman Khan acquitted in firearms case This is the fourth case filed against the actor in connection with poaching animals during the filming of the 1998 movie Hum Saath Saath Hain. In 2006, a trial court convicted the actor in two cases of poaching and sentenced him separately to one year and five years in prison. The Rajasthan high court suspended the sentences the following year, and eventually quashed both convictions in 2016. The state government has appealed against that order in the Supreme Court. Khan was then acquitted of a third case in 2017, which was for possessing unlicensed weapons used to poach the wildlife in 1998. The original poaching complaint against him was filed by the local Bishnoi community, who revere and worship the blackbuck. In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died and four others were in injured. His car allegedly ran over them while they were sleeping on a street in the western city of Mumbai. A lower court had convicted him in May 2015. During his trial, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Seven months later, the high court acquitted him. It said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who had since died - was not reliable. In January 2017, Khan was also acquitted in another case that charged him with using illegal firearms to kill the blackbucks. One of Bollywood's biggest stars, the actor has appeared in more than 100 films and has a huge fan following across the vast spectrum of Indian society. His fans include the middle-class English-speaking audiences as well as poor slum dwellers for whom the 350-rupee ($5.20; Â£3.40) tickets do not come cheap. Known for his romantic roles as well as action films, Khan has won several prestigious Indian cinema awards. The eldest of the three sons of well-known screenplay writer Salim Khan, he is a hit on social media too - his Facebook page is liked by more than 36 million fans, while on Twitter he has 32.5 million followers. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Delhi Every day in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra, fans flock to Salman Khan's apartment building to catch a glimpse of the Bollywood actor. I once met a group of fans who had travelled more than five hours by bus to wait in the searing heat in the hope he would wave at them from his balcony. His films continue to draw mass audiences across urban and rural India. In a country where Bollywood is revered, Khan is one of the most worshipped. While his time in the spotlight has attracted praise and controversy in equal measure, this latest conviction is unlikely to dent his popularity or damage his career due to the cult-like status he enjoys. Khan's conviction is making waves on both mainstream and social media. The hashtag #BlackBuckPoachingCase is the top trend on Twitter India while #Salman Khan is also trending. Many of the tweets addressed the fact that the case has gone on for years. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, most Bollywood actors have refrained from commenting. Khan was convicted under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, the law that prohibits the hunting of hundreds of different species. Black buck deer, tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and Tibetan antelope are among the species given the highest level of protection. Punishment for first-time offenders can be imprisonment for up to seven years or a fine of up to 25,000 rupees (Â£276; $386), or both. Figures from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau show 148 recorded convictions for offences under the Wildlife Protection Act in 2016. The records also show 2,096 pending cases awaiting trial, 207 cases which were discharged and a 71.5% conviction rate. According to the State of India's Environment, the report published annually by the country's Centre for Science and Environment, there was a 52% spike in poaching and wildlife crimes between 2014 and 2016. More than 30,382 wildlife crimes were recorded in the country during that period.

UK car registrations plunge in March,"Car registrations plunged in March, according to figures from industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Preliminary data shows the UK new car market shrank by 15.7% last month compared with 2017. Demand for diesel vehicles fell 37%, but demand for petrol was flat and that for alternative fuel models rose 5.7%. March 2017 was a record month as customers bought new vehicles ahead of a change in Vehicle Excise Duty. New car sales fell for the first time in six years in 2017, with a 5.7% decrease to about 2.5 million vehicles. Demand for diesel cars plunged by 17% last year, meaning the pace of decline for such vehicles in March has more than doubled. At first glance, this looks like deeply worrying news for the automotive industry. But it it's worth remembering that in March 2017, new car registrations hit a record high. Buyers were rushing to get hold of new vehicles ahead of big changes to the vehicle excise duty regime, which sharply increased the rates payable on some cars. But we can say with certainty that registrations have now been falling steadily for a whole calendar year. The SMMT has consistently blamed economic uncertainty, which it links to Brexit and the collapse in diesel sales. The latest figures show that the move away from diesel seems to have accelerated. That suggests that the industry's attempts to convince consumers and politicians that modern diesels are clean and have a future are failing badly. By historical standards, new car registrations are still at pretty high levels. The steep fall in March might be a glitch. However, the overall trend cannot be ignored - and that is what the industry will be worried about. Diesel cars: Your questions answered What's gone wrong in the UK car market? Car sales: six charts that tell a story Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ""March's decline is not unexpected, given the huge surge in registrations in the same month last year. ""Despite this, the market itself is relatively high with the underlying factors in terms of consumer choice, finance availability and cost of ownership all highly competitive. ""Consumer and business confidence, however, has taken a knock in recent months and a thriving new car market is essential to the overall health of our economy.""

Final gender pay gap figures revealed,"This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? More than 1,500 companies have failed to report their gender pay gap figures before Wednesday night's deadline. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said 1,557 firms had missed the deadline. It will now contact these companies to remind them of their legal obligations. The equalities watchdog will investigate those firms that fail to comply and could take legal action against them, with penalties including an unlimited fine. All companies, charities and public sector bodies with more than 250 employees were required to submit their gender pay figures before Wednesday's deadline. The EHRC will check whether those firms that failed to report fall into this category. One organisation that missed the deadline was the Unite union, which belatedly published its figures on Thursday. The union, which describes itself as being ""at the forefront of the trade union campaign to achieve equal pay"", revealed that its female employees' median hourly pay was 29.6% lower than what male workers are paid. Want to find out the median gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here. More than 10,000 firms have published data, with in excess of 1,000 firms reporting on the last day. More than three-quarters of UK companies pay men more on average than women, BBC analysis of government figures suggests. The median pay gap among those companies was 9.7%. The figures indicate 78% of firms pay men more than women on average, while 14% pay women more. This is based on the median measure, which is the level of pay that separates the top half of earners from the lower half. In total, 8% said they had no pay gap between men and women. The gender pay gap is not the same as having unequal pay, which would be against the law. By law, men and women with the same jobs have to be paid the same wages. A gender pay gap can arise if there are more highly paid men than women in a company, or if women are deemed to be less experienced than their male counterparts, or if women take a hit to their salary after taking maternity leave. In reporting gender pay, firms with more than 250 staff have to publish data on the average difference between male and female employees. Nine ways to narrow the gender pay gap Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap? Rebecca Hilsenrath, EHRC chief executive, said it was pleased with the rate of reporting, but added: ""It is the law, it's not an option. It is the right thing to do, and we will be enforcing against all those organisations which failed to meet the deadline."" The EHRC will send letters to all of those organisations next week and they will then have 28 days to respond. Terms of reference will then be issued for the enforcement process, which will be made public. She said the more important issue is what companies will do to address the pay gap: ""We want them to look at their flexible working practices, we want to look at them tackling bias, conscious and unconscious, and we're looking to them to address instances of pregnancy and maternity pay discrimination."" Airline Ryanair was one of the companies reporting a large difference, with a 71.8% gender pay gap. Boux Avenue, the lingerie firm owned by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, reported a median hourly pay gap of 75.7%, while fashion retailer Karen Millen had a gap of 49%. High Street brands Costa, KFC, Matalan, McDonald's, Primark and Starbucks reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. Some firms reported so-called ""negative"" pay gaps, where women are paid on average more than men. These included electric car maker Tesla Motors, babywear retailer Mamas and Papas and electronics retailer Richer Sounds. Some have said reporting the pay gap is crude and open to misinterpretation, but gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society said it is an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn.

The median pay gap among the 10,000 companies with more than 250 employees that have reported figures in the government's pay portal is 9.7%. But according to the Office of National Statistics the UK's median gender pay gap is 18.4%. Why is there a difference between the figures? The ONS figure is based on its annual survey of hours and earnings, and that includes both full and part-time workers, and covers all employers. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees. The national and sector gender pay gap figures come from the 2017 ONS ASHE survey.

Russian TV airs 'Yulia Skripal phone call',"Ms Skripal and her father are in hospital in Salisbury after the attack UK police have issued a statement on behalf of Russian spy Sergei Skripal's daughter, the first since the pair were poisoned by a nerve agent in March. The statement quoted Yulia Skripal as saying her ""strength is growing daily"". Ms Skripal, 33, and her father are in hospital in Salisbury, southern England, where the attack took place. The UK Foreign Office says Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen, has not yet taken up Russia's offer of consular assistance. The Russian embassy in London said last week that it was insisting on its right to see her after it emerged that she was conscious and talking. Earlier on Thursday, Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Ms Skripal and her cousin. However, doubts have been cast on how authentic the recording is; the presenters of the programme said they had been unable to verify it and themselves had doubts about it. Mr Skripal, 66, remains critically ill but stable. The UK government has accused Russia of being behind the 4 March attack, but Russia's ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. The incident has sparked an international diplomatic crisis. The United Nations Security Council has been discussing the poisoning in a meeting called by Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the British accusations against Russia as horrific and unsubstantiated. The UK is ""playing with fire"", he said. In the statement released by the police, Ms Skripal said she was grateful for the many messages of goodwill she had received. ""I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily,"" the statement said. ""I have many people to thank for my recovery and would especially like to mention the people of Salisbury that came to my aid when my father and I were incapacitated,"" it went on. ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" The Russian TV recording is purported to be between Ms Skripal and her cousin Viktoria, who lives in Russia. The woman described as Yulia says: ""Everything is ok. He [her father] is resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I will be discharged soon. Everything is ok."" Russian bid for joint spy probe rejected Russia asks to visit Yulia Skripal in UK Viktoria Skripal says she hopes to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be that of Yulia tells her that no-one will give her one. Correspondents say that what Yulia says in the recording about her father ""resting"" does not chime with what we know of the Skripals' health, and the conversation about the visa is strange. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa, possibly on Thursday, and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Russian news agency Interfax also quoted the cousin as saying in an interview that they had spoken and that Yulia had told her that all was well. Viktoria expressed surprise that the phone call had come a day after she had told media that she was not allowed to speak to Yulia, Interfax reported. ""Do you believe in coincidences? I don't,"" it quoted her as saying. Viktoria is said to be one of the pair's closest living relatives after a series of family deaths. Skripal poisoning: What we know so far Full coverage of the Russian spy poisoning This video can not be played Russian news channel airs Yulia Skripal hospital 'recording' The hosts of the 60 Minute show on state-owned Rossiya 1 - Yevgeny Popov and Olga Skabeyeva - said they were unable to confirm the authenticity of the phone call. Viktoria: Hello? ""Yulia"": Hello. Can you hear me? Viktoria: Yes, I can hear you. ""Yulia"": It is Yulia Skripal. Viktoria: Oh, Yulka [diminutive of Yulia] it's you! I can tell it's you from your voice but I don't understand. So, they gave you a telephone, did they? ""Yulia"": Yes, yes. Viktoria: Thanks God! Yulyasha [diminutive of Yulia], is everything okay? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok, everything's fine. Viktoria: Look, if tomorrow I get a [British] visa, I'll come to you on Monday. ""Yulia"": Vika, no-one will give you a visa. Viktoria: Well I thought so too. Oh well. ""Yulia"": Most likely. Viktoria: If they do, I need you to tell me whether I can visit you or not, tell me that I can. ""Yulia"": I don't think so, that's the situation at the moment, we'll sort it out later. Viktoria: I know, I know. ""Yulia"": Later, we'll get it sorted later, everything's fine, we'll see later. Viktoria: Is that your phone? ""Yulia"": It's a temporary phone. Everything's fine, but we'll see how it goes, we'll decide later. You know what the situation is here. Everything is fine, everything is solvable, everyone is recovering and is alive. Viktoria: Understood. Is everything ok with your dad? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok. He's resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I'll be discharged soon. Everything is ok. Viktoria: Kisses, babes. ""Yulia"": Bye. The recording was reportedly made on the morning of 5 April The poisoning, which the UK blames on Russia, has led to worsening relations between Moscow and many Western countries, with more than 150 diplomats expelled on each side. Speaking shortly after the alleged conversation was released, Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko denied statements by UK officials that Russia did not respond to the poisoning allegations immediately. He read out a letter which he said Russia had sent denying involvement, adding that claims that Russia had a nerve agent stockpile were not true.

'McMafia gangs' fuel London violence - MP,"This video can not be played Tottenham MP David Lammy tells Today the London mayor is yet to visit Drug gangs controlled by Eastern European criminals are fuelling the rising tide of violent crime in London, a Labour MP has claimed. Tottenham MP David Lammy said drugs were as ""prolific as ordering a pizza"", comparing the situation to McMafia, a BBC drama about Russian gangsters. The MP said political leaders were doing nothing about it. The Metropolitan Police is now investigating more than 50 suspected murders this year. Police patrols have been stepped up and officers are using stop-and-search powers to seize weapons after the increase in violence. The government says it is ""taking action to restrict access to offensive weapons"", with consultations about new weapons laws, including banning online stores from delivering knives to homes. But Mr Lammy said violent crime in his part of London, where there have been four murders, was the worst he had seen in 18 years as an MP. Reality Check: Is UK the 'drugs market of Europe'? London murders - Fact-checking the statistics - BBC News He toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethere was ""no single cause"" for it but ""turf wars"" between drug gangs was a major factor. ""What drives the gangs and the turf wars is an Â£11bn cocaine drugs market,"" he said. ""We are the drugs market of Europe and I'm hearing nothing about what we're going to do about that rising drugs market. ""Drugs are prolific. It's like Deliveroo. They're as prolific as ordering a pizza.  You can get them on Snapchat, WhatsApp.  That in the end is driving the turf war and it's driving the culture of violence."" He added: ""I think the police and our country has lost control of that drugs market."" Asked who he thought was behind it, he said: ""I do know from the police that there are big gangs - Eastern European, Albanian - they traffic people, they traffic drugs and they traffic guns."" He said the police and Border Force did not have the resources they needed to tackle the gangs - but the issue was being ignored by politicians and not being debated in Parliament. Flowers were left at the scene where 17-year-old Tanesha Melborne was killed in Tottenham He also pointed the finger at Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who he suggested were not taking the issue seriously enough. ""I have not had a phone call from the home secretary, I have not had a phone call from the mayor, no one has come to visit my constituency. This is happening across London at large. ""Frankly, I am sick of the political football. What I want is a political consensus."" He added: ""There is a McMafia out there that needs to be tackled."" In a BBC London interview, Sadiq Khan denied suggestions he had not shown enough leadership this week: ""I have been around, speaking to my team, I've been in contact with the [Metropolitan Police] commissioner."" ""We are doing what we can, working around the clock to make sure we grapple with this issue."" He said he was ""working closely with the Met Police""  on a ""number of initiatives"" including youth facilities and services. He said he did not accept Mr Lammy's claim that the police had ""lost control"" of crime in London: ""What I do accept is there is a crime issue across the country. There's been an increase since 2014. ""It's a national problemâ¦ You can't cut 40% from the Met Police, 46% from youth provisions in London and not expect to see consequences."" Mr Khan said he had asked for a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May about the issue six weeks ago but so far, had not secured one.

Bollywood star Khan jailed for five years,"Khan can appeal against the verdict An Indian court has sentenced Bollywood superstar Salman Khan to five years in jail for poaching rare antelope back in 1998. The court in Jodhpur also fined him 10,000 rupees ($154; Â£109) for the crime. He has since been taken to jail. Khan killed the two blackbucks, a protected species, in the western state of Rajasthan while shooting a film. Four other actors who starred with him in the movie and were also charged with the offence have been acquitted. Khan, 52, can appeal against the verdict in a higher court. Correspondents say he will have to spend at least a few days in prison. The Bollywood superstar who lives dangerously Salman Khan acquitted in firearms case This is the fourth case filed against the actor in connection with poaching animals during the filming of the 1998 movie Hum Saath Saath Hain. In 2006, a trial court convicted the actor in two cases of poaching and sentenced him separately to one year and five years in prison. The Rajasthan high court suspended the sentences the following year, and eventually quashed both convictions in 2016. The state government has appealed against that order in the Supreme Court. Khan was then acquitted of a third case in 2017, which was for possessing unlicensed weapons used to poach the wildlife in 1998. The original poaching complaint against him was filed by the local Bishnoi community, who revere and worship the blackbuck. In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died and four others were in injured. His car allegedly ran over them while they were sleeping on a street in the western city of Mumbai. A lower court had convicted him in May 2015. During his trial, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Seven months later, the high court acquitted him. It said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who had since died - was not reliable. In January 2017, Khan was also acquitted in another case that charged him with using illegal firearms to kill the blackbucks. One of Bollywood's biggest stars, the actor has appeared in more than 100 films and has a huge fan following across the vast spectrum of Indian society. His fans include the middle-class English-speaking audiences as well as poor slum dwellers for whom the 350-rupee ($5.20; Â£3.40) tickets do not come cheap. Known for his romantic roles as well as action films, Khan has won several prestigious Indian cinema awards. The eldest of the three sons of well-known screenplay writer Salim Khan, he is a hit on social media too - his Facebook page is liked by more than 36 million fans, while on Twitter he has 32.5 million followers. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Delhi Every day in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra, fans flock to Salman Khan's apartment building to catch a glimpse of the Bollywood actor. I once met a group of fans who had travelled more than five hours by bus to wait in the searing heat in the hope he would wave at them from his balcony. His films continue to draw mass audiences across urban and rural India. In a country where Bollywood is revered, Khan is one of the most worshipped. While his time in the spotlight has attracted praise and controversy in equal measure, this latest conviction is unlikely to dent his popularity or damage his career due to the cult-like status he enjoys. Khan's conviction is making waves on both mainstream and social media. The hashtag #BlackBuckPoachingCase is the top trend on Twitter India while #Salman Khan is also trending. Many of the tweets addressed the fact that the case has gone on for years. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, most Bollywood actors have refrained from commenting. Khan was convicted under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, the law that prohibits the hunting of hundreds of different species. Black buck deer, tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and Tibetan antelope are among the species given the highest level of protection. Punishment for first-time offenders can be imprisonment for up to seven years or a fine of up to 25,000 rupees (Â£276; $386), or both. Figures from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau show 148 recorded convictions for offences under the Wildlife Protection Act in 2016. The records also show 2,096 pending cases awaiting trial, 207 cases which were discharged and a 71.5% conviction rate. According to the State of India's Environment, the report published annually by the country's Centre for Science and Environment, there was a 52% spike in poaching and wildlife crimes between 2014 and 2016. More than 30,382 wildlife crimes were recorded in the country during that period.

Scammers abused Facebook phone number search,"Facebook was warned by security researchers that attackers could abuse its phone number and email search facility to harvest people's data. On Wednesday, the firm said ""malicious actors"" had been harvesting profiles for years by abusing the search tool. It said anybody that had not changed their privacy settings after adding their phone number should assume their information had been harvested. One security expert told the BBC the attack had been possible ""for years"". Until Wednesday, Facebook let people search for their friends' profiles by typing in a phone number or email address. But it said scammers had abused the facility and used it to link phone numbers and emails to people's names and profile information. An attacker could type in any phone number - even one they had made up by guessing - and link it to a person's profile. Often this would reveal their name, location and other profile information. This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded By linking a phone number to personal details, a scammer could telephone the victim and address them by name. They could pretend to be from a bank or other organisation. ""This is known as enumeration, going through all the iterations of a number,"" said security researcher Ken Munro from Pen Test Partners. ""If you wanted to scam somebody, you had a route to find their details and know their name - a fantastic set-up for a scam."" Facebook said it had put measures in place to limit how often people could search. But the measures were ""not able to prevent malicious actors who cycled through hundreds of thousands of different IP addresses,"" Mark Zuckerberg explained. An IP address can be used to identify an individual computer using the internet, but the attackers changed theirs frequently to avoid detection. Facebook has previously encouraged people to add their phone number to their account. It said doing so would make it easier to connect with friends, or improve account security. By default, anybody could then find the Facebook profile by typing the phone number in the search box. Facebook said the facility had been ""useful"" for finding friends, especially in countries where many people have the same name. It said phone number searches made up ""7% of all searches"" in Bangladesh. However, while members could choose not to display their phone number on their profile, it was not possible to completely opt out of the search facility. Security researchers have previously written about how the feature could be abused by scammers. In August 2015, Facebook told onesecurity researcher,externalthat it did not consider the issue a security vulnerability. News siteWired,externalhas also spoken to another developer that raised the issue with Facebook. Facebook has faced scrutiny after it was revealed that the data of millions of people was improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. On Thursday, Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport said Facebook had put ""the data of over a million of our citizens at risk"". Facebook said an audit had revealed that scammers had managed to act with ""scale and sophistication"" to overcome its technical measures. It said ""most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way"". Speaking to reporters, Mr Zuckerberg said: ""It is reasonable to expect that if you had that [default] setting turned on, that in the last several years someone has probably accessed your public information in this way. ""Given that and what we know today, it just makes sense to shut that down."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Bollywood star Khan jailed for five yearsSalman Khan is jailed after he was convicted of poaching rare antelope in 1998, but can appeal.1han hour agoIndia","Khan can appeal against the verdict An Indian court has sentenced Bollywood superstar Salman Khan to five years in jail for poaching rare antelope back in 1998. The court in Jodhpur also fined him 10,000 rupees ($154; Â£109) for the crime. He has since been taken to jail. Khan killed the two blackbucks, a protected species, in the western state of Rajasthan while shooting a film. Four other actors who starred with him in the movie and were also charged with the offence have been acquitted. Khan, 52, can appeal against the verdict in a higher court. Correspondents say he will have to spend at least a few days in prison. The Bollywood superstar who lives dangerously Salman Khan acquitted in firearms case This is the fourth case filed against the actor in connection with poaching animals during the filming of the 1998 movie Hum Saath Saath Hain. In 2006, a trial court convicted the actor in two cases of poaching and sentenced him separately to one year and five years in prison. The Rajasthan high court suspended the sentences the following year, and eventually quashed both convictions in 2016. The state government has appealed against that order in the Supreme Court. Khan was then acquitted of a third case in 2017, which was for possessing unlicensed weapons used to poach the wildlife in 1998. The original poaching complaint against him was filed by the local Bishnoi community, who revere and worship the blackbuck. In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died and four others were in injured. His car allegedly ran over them while they were sleeping on a street in the western city of Mumbai. A lower court had convicted him in May 2015. During his trial, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Seven months later, the high court acquitted him. It said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who had since died - was not reliable. In January 2017, Khan was also acquitted in another case that charged him with using illegal firearms to kill the blackbucks. One of Bollywood's biggest stars, the actor has appeared in more than 100 films and has a huge fan following across the vast spectrum of Indian society. His fans include the middle-class English-speaking audiences as well as poor slum dwellers for whom the 350-rupee ($5.20; Â£3.40) tickets do not come cheap. Known for his romantic roles as well as action films, Khan has won several prestigious Indian cinema awards. The eldest of the three sons of well-known screenplay writer Salim Khan, he is a hit on social media too - his Facebook page is liked by more than 36 million fans, while on Twitter he has 32.5 million followers. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Delhi Every day in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra, fans flock to Salman Khan's apartment building to catch a glimpse of the Bollywood actor. I once met a group of fans who had travelled more than five hours by bus to wait in the searing heat in the hope he would wave at them from his balcony. His films continue to draw mass audiences across urban and rural India. In a country where Bollywood is revered, Khan is one of the most worshipped. While his time in the spotlight has attracted praise and controversy in equal measure, this latest conviction is unlikely to dent his popularity or damage his career due to the cult-like status he enjoys. Khan's conviction is making waves on both mainstream and social media. The hashtag #BlackBuckPoachingCase is the top trend on Twitter India while #Salman Khan is also trending. Many of the tweets addressed the fact that the case has gone on for years. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, most Bollywood actors have refrained from commenting. Khan was convicted under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, the law that prohibits the hunting of hundreds of different species. Black buck deer, tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and Tibetan antelope are among the species given the highest level of protection. Punishment for first-time offenders can be imprisonment for up to seven years or a fine of up to 25,000 rupees (Â£276; $386), or both. Figures from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau show 148 recorded convictions for offences under the Wildlife Protection Act in 2016. The records also show 2,096 pending cases awaiting trial, 207 cases which were discharged and a 71.5% conviction rate. According to the State of India's Environment, the report published annually by the country's Centre for Science and Environment, there was a 52% spike in poaching and wildlife crimes between 2014 and 2016. More than 30,382 wildlife crimes were recorded in the country during that period.

"Scammers abused Facebook phone number searchFacebook says ""most people"" could have had their profile information harvested by scammers.12m12 minutes agoTechnology","Facebook was warned by security researchers that attackers could abuse its phone number and email search facility to harvest people's data. On Wednesday, the firm said ""malicious actors"" had been harvesting profiles for years by abusing the search tool. It said anybody that had not changed their privacy settings after adding their phone number should assume their information had been harvested. One security expert told the BBC the attack had been possible ""for years"". Until Wednesday, Facebook let people search for their friends' profiles by typing in a phone number or email address. But it said scammers had abused the facility and used it to link phone numbers and emails to people's names and profile information. An attacker could type in any phone number - even one they had made up by guessing - and link it to a person's profile. Often this would reveal their name, location and other profile information. This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded By linking a phone number to personal details, a scammer could telephone the victim and address them by name. They could pretend to be from a bank or other organisation. ""This is known as enumeration, going through all the iterations of a number,"" said security researcher Ken Munro from Pen Test Partners. ""If you wanted to scam somebody, you had a route to find their details and know their name - a fantastic set-up for a scam."" Facebook said it had put measures in place to limit how often people could search. But the measures were ""not able to prevent malicious actors who cycled through hundreds of thousands of different IP addresses,"" Mark Zuckerberg explained. An IP address can be used to identify an individual computer using the internet, but the attackers changed theirs frequently to avoid detection. Facebook has previously encouraged people to add their phone number to their account. It said doing so would make it easier to connect with friends, or improve account security. By default, anybody could then find the Facebook profile by typing the phone number in the search box. Facebook said the facility had been ""useful"" for finding friends, especially in countries where many people have the same name. It said phone number searches made up ""7% of all searches"" in Bangladesh. However, while members could choose not to display their phone number on their profile, it was not possible to completely opt out of the search facility. Security researchers have previously written about how the feature could be abused by scammers. In August 2015, Facebook told onesecurity researcher,externalthat it did not consider the issue a security vulnerability. News siteWired,externalhas also spoken to another developer that raised the issue with Facebook. Facebook has faced scrutiny after it was revealed that the data of millions of people was improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. On Thursday, Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport said Facebook had put ""the data of over a million of our citizens at risk"". Facebook said an audit had revealed that scammers had managed to act with ""scale and sophistication"" to overcome its technical measures. It said ""most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way"". Speaking to reporters, Mr Zuckerberg said: ""It is reasonable to expect that if you had that [default] setting turned on, that in the last several years someone has probably accessed your public information in this way. ""Given that and what we know today, it just makes sense to shut that down."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Greens urge end to 'one-party' councilsCo-leader Jonathan Bartley calls for a ""Green on every council"" as he launches English local election campaign.2h2 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played The Green Party launched its local election campaign The Green Party has urged an end to ""one-party-state councils"" as it launches its campaign for next month's English local elections. Co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for ""a Green on every council"", saying this could ""change everything"". He predicted the Greens would be celebrating ""some massive wins"" when the results are revealed. The party is looking to recover from last year's disappointing general election showing. Voters go to the polls across England on 3 May for local elections with seats on about 150 councils up for grabs. A guide to the 2018 council elections Local elections: Are they about bins or Brexit? The Greens saw their UK-wide vote share fall from 3.8% to 1.6% in the general election - although the party held onto its sole Parliamentary seat in Brighton Pavilion - and Mr Bartley has said the result ""hurt"". But the leadership has urged supporters to look on the bright side, saying some Green policies are now ""common currency"". In a speech in south-east London, Mr Bartley - who shares the leadership with MP Caroline Lucas - said more representation for his party at local level will ""build a better Britain from the bottom up"". ""We are taking the next step towards getting a Green at every table in every room - a Green on every council,"" he said, claiming he could ""feel change coming right across the country"". ""There's not a seat in this country where the Greens cannot win,"" he told supporters. Voters are ""tired of the status quo"" of ""cosy, complacent"" councils dominated by just one party, he said, attacking councillors ""sat down with a dozen of their mates, toeing the party line"". The Green Party said it was contesting 2,200 seats this time, more than half of the total. These include defending seats in Norwich and Solihull, where it is the official opposition party. It is fielding its largest ever number of candidates in London. What to look out for in May's local elections Local elections: Do voters care more about bins than Brexit?

Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to run Facebook,"Mr Zuckerberg says he will not step down Despite the turmoil that continues to surround his company, Mark Zuckerberg has insisted he is still the best person to lead Facebook. ""When you're building something like Facebook which is unprecedented in the world,"" he said on Wednesday, ""there are things that you're going to mess up. ""What I think people should hold us accountable for is if we are learning from our mistakes."" As well as being Facebook's chief executive, Mr Zuckerberg is chairman of the company's board. When asked if his position had been discussed, he replied: ""Not that I know of!"" The mere possibility that his leadership is in question is a scenario few would have predicted even a month ago. But recent reports around improper data gathering by third parties - as well as fake news and propaganda - have prompted some to question Mr Zuckerberg's ability to lead a company that some think has grown beyond his control. Facebook scandal 'hit 87 million users' Zuckerberg to testify before US committee Facebook chief fires back at Apple's Tim Cook Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo Scott Stringer, head of New York City's pension fund, said this week that Mr Zuckerberg should step aside. The fund owns approximately $1bn-worth of the social network. ""They have two billion users,"" Mr Stringer told CNBC. ""They are in uncharted waters, and they have not comported themselves in a way that makes people feel good about Facebook and secure about their own data."" A piece in technology magazine Wired called for Mr Zuckerberg to step down,externalin order to let Facebook start a ""reputation-enhancing second chapter"". ""He doesnât just lead an institution that touches almost every person on the planet,"" wrote Felix Salmon. ""He also, thanks to financial engineering, has a majority of shareholder votes and controls the board, and is therefore answerable to no one. ""By design, he canât be fired - he can only resign. Which is exactly what he should now do."" Mr Zuckerberg's conference call went as well as the 33-year-old could have expected. Indeed, at one point he encouraged more time to take more questions. From his answers we learned a little more about the real toll of the negative publicity and the ""deleteFacebook"" movement. And so far the answer is: not much. There has been ""no meaningful impact that weâve observed"" he said, before quickly adding: ""But look, it's not good!"" Mr Zuckerberg said the ""deleteFacebook"" movement had had little impact What we couldn't tell during the call, of course, was to what extent Mr Zuckerberg was being quietly guided by his team in the room. But for a man often criticised as lacking empathy, it was a strong display lasting almost an hour. Investors certainly thought so - shares were up 3% once the call ended. Next week he will face a potentially tougher prospect, this time in front of the cameras, when he heads to Washington to testify before Congress. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Indeed, this session with the press was perhaps the ideal dress rehearsal. The dynamic around Mr Zuckerberg's leadership could change dramatically in the coming months, as investigations - most notably from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - begin to probe deeper into how Facebook handled the public's data. If the company is seen to have fallen short of its responsibility, and is hit with a potentially enormous fine, it could increase pressure on Facebook to make serious personnel changes. So far, despite all of the apologies and admissions of poor judgement, Mr Zuckerberg told reporters that not a single person at the company had been fired over the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. The buck stops with him, he said - and indeed it might.

Facebook scandal 'hit 87 million users' Zuckerberg to testify before US committee Facebook chief fires back at Apple's Tim Cook Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo Scott Stringer, head of New York City's pension fund, said this week that Mr Zuckerberg should step aside. The fund owns approximately $1bn-worth of the social network. ""They have two billion users,"" Mr Stringer told CNBC. ""They are in uncharted waters, and they have not comported themselves in a way that makes people feel good about Facebook and secure about their own data."" A piece in technology magazine Wired called for Mr Zuckerberg to step down,externalin order to let Facebook start a ""reputation-enhancing second chapter"". ""He doesnât just lead an institution that touches almost every person on the planet,"" wrote Felix Salmon. ""He also, thanks to financial engineering, has a majority of shareholder votes and controls the board, and is therefore answerable to no one. ""By design, he canât be fired - he can only resign. Which is exactly what he should now do."" Mr Zuckerberg's conference call went as well as the 33-year-old could have expected. Indeed, at one point he encouraged more time to take more questions. From his answers we learned a little more about the real toll of the negative publicity and the ""deleteFacebook"" movement. And so far the answer is: not much. There has been ""no meaningful impact that weâve observed"" he said, before quickly adding: ""But look, it's not good!"" Mr Zuckerberg said the ""deleteFacebook"" movement had had little impact What we couldn't tell during the call, of course, was to what extent Mr Zuckerberg was being quietly guided by his team in the room. But for a man often criticised as lacking empathy, it was a strong display lasting almost an hour. Investors certainly thought so - shares were up 3% once the call ended. Next week he will face a potentially tougher prospect, this time in front of the cameras, when he heads to Washington to testify before Congress. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Indeed, this session with the press was perhaps the ideal dress rehearsal. The dynamic around Mr Zuckerberg's leadership could change dramatically in the coming months, as investigations - most notably from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - begin to probe deeper into how Facebook handled the public's data. If the company is seen to have fallen short of its responsibility, and is hit with a potentially enormous fine, it could increase pressure on Facebook to make serious personnel changes. So far, despite all of the apologies and admissions of poor judgement, Mr Zuckerberg told reporters that not a single person at the company had been fired over the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. The buck stops with him, he said - and indeed it might.

Brazil's Lula 'must start prison term'The former president could be jailed within days after Supreme Court judges ruled against him.,"Lula claims charges against him are politically motivated Brazil's ex-President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva will be jailed while he appeals against a graft conviction, the Supreme Court has ruled. He is facing 12 years in jail on charges of accepting a bribe but had asked to remain free during his appeal. Lula claims the charges are politically motivated, and designed to prevent him from running for president in October. He has a lead in opinion polls. His Workers' Party said the ruling was a ""tragic day for democracy and Brazil"". The Supreme Court judges ruled against him by six to five after a marathon session, which ended in the early hours of Thursday. Read more about Lula A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Key words and names in Brazil's corruption cases Lula watched the ruling at the Metalworker's Union, where his supporters held an upbeat concert. The 72-year-old former president is likely to remain free until paperwork for his arrest is completed. Anti-Lula demonstrators celebrated Lula served as president between 2003 and 2011. Despite his lead in the polls, he remains a divisive figure. Up to 20,000 people protested in SÃ£o Paulo on Tuesday calling for his immediate imprisonment, while supporters also rallied in large numbers in a rival demonstration. While Brazilians are used to frequent delays and rambling verdicts in their courts, this 10-hour deliberation felt particularly long in this highly charged atmosphere. Lula's legal battles have divided Brazilians and this decision was no different. His critics launched fireworks in celebration. Lula's supporters went home angry about what they say is an affront to democracy and a coup. Lula's critics though see this as a victory. He's a politician who's been proven to be corrupt at the highest level, they say, and deserves to be behind bars - within days that could become a reality, crushing his hopes of returning to power. This has been a massive fall from grace for a man who was once one of the world's most loved politicians. It was a historic day for Brazilian politics too. Until recently, defendants in Brazil were allowed to remain free until their final appeal had been exhausted. However, the Supreme Court was considering a 2016 ruling from a lower court, under which defendants could be sent to jail after a failed first appeal. Lula lost his first appeal in January, when the appeals court not only upheld his conviction, but increased the sentence from nine and a half years to 12. Pro-Lula demonstrators were left disappointed The charges came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has implicated top politicians from several parties. A former metalworker and trade union activist, he was the first left-wing leader to make it to the presidency in Brazil in nearly half a century. During his presidency, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. In 2014, after Lula left office, prosecutors started investigating allegations that executives at the state oil company Petrobras had accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms. The investigation, dubbed Operation Car Wash, uncovered a huge web of corruption involving top-level politicians from a broad spectrum of parties taking kickbacks. Lula himself was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7 million reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe by engineering firm OAS. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula has described the battle against his conviction and prison term as a continuation of his fight against Brazil's military rule, which came to an end in 1985. ""I did not accept the military dictatorship and I will not accept this dictatorship of the prosecutors,"" he told a gathering of supporters on Monday. The judge in charge of Operation Car Wash, SÃ©rgio Moro, is expected to issue a warrant for Lula's arrest within days. But this does not necessarily mean that Lula will go to jail for 12 years. His supporters want Lula to remain free He has not exhausted his appeals yet. There are two higher courts which he can still turn to, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court - the latter has only ruled for far on whether he should go to jail pending further appeals, rather than on the underlying case. Neither of those courts would re-examine whether Lula was guilty of corruption. They would look into whether legal procedures were followed correctly and whether his constitutional rights were breached. This process could take months or even years. If either court were to rule in Lula's favour, his conviction could be annulled and he would be released. Under a 2010 Brazilian law called ""clean slate law"", no one convicted of a crime upheld on appeal can run for elected office for at least eight years. That law would rule Lula out from running for the presidency in October. However, exceptions have been made to the law before. The decision as to whether Lula can stand for president will rest with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). The TSE will not make a decision on whether Lula can run or not until he has registered as a candidate and he has until 15 August to do so. So we may not know for months to come whether he will be able to stand.

"Man bailed in 'burglar' murder probeAn intruder was stabbed during a struggle at the man's house in Hither Green, south-east London.5m6 minutes agoLondon","Richard Osborn-Brooks has been bailed until May A 78-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder after a suspected burglar was stabbed to death has been bailed. The man, named locally as Richard Osborn-Brooks, foundtwo intruders in South Park Crescent, Hither Green, south-east London, early on Wednesday. A man armed with a screwdriver forced the homeowner into his kitchen where there was a struggle and the suspect was stabbed, the Met said. The suspected burglar who died has been named as Henry Vincent, 37, from Kent. Mr Vincent was named and pictured by Kent Police in January as part of an investigation into a distraction burglary. What are your rights if someone breaks into your home? Jewellery and valuables were stolen from a man in his 70s, police said at the time. Mr Osborn-Brooks has been bailed until May pending further inquiries. Henry Vincent, 37, was under investigation over a separate burglary involving another elderly victim Police said they were called to the property over reports of a burglary when they found Mr Vincent collapsed in nearby Further Green Road with a stab wound to the upper body. A witness said an accomplice dragged Mr Vincent toward a van before leaving him for dead. A second suspect fled the scene and is still being hunted by police. Forensic officers investigate the drains near the scene in South Park Crescent Det Ch Insp Simon Harding appealed for anyone with information regarding the second suspect - who is believed to be a white male and fled the scene in a white van - to come forward. ""He may have told someone what happened at the address,"" he added. On Thursday, a team used machinery to move a parked car so that officers could access a drain on the street. Investigators lifted off the cover and sifted through buckets of liquid pulled from the drain before putting the green Rover back. A woman also left a bunch of flowers at the police cordon on Further Green Road, yards from where Mr Vincent fell. Flowers addressed to Mr Osborn-Brooks's home were delivered to the police cordon on South Park Crescent by a courier. A forensic tent was set up outside Richard Osborn-Brooks' home in Hither Green One man who lives on the street said there had been a recent spate of burglaries in the area and his home had been broken into in recent months. Adam Lake, another local resident, said he ""wasn't surprised"" to hear about the burglary. ""I feel terrible for the man that was burgled. He doesn't deserve to be punished for defending himself,"" he said. A neighbour of Mr Osborn-Brooks, who asked not to be named, supported his right to defend the neighbourhood. She said: ""[I've heard] he's a carer - this is a pensioner that has worked all his life who wants to live and die quietly."" What are your rights in tackling burglars?

"MPs assess threat posed to UK by N KoreaBut a strike seems ""highly unlikely"", say MPs, who describe Kim Jong-un as ""ruthless but rational"".9h9 hours agoUK","Kim Jong-un is ruthless but rational, say MPs North Korea will almost certainly be able to reach UK shores with an intercontinental ballistic missile within six to 18 months, MPs have said. However, the Commons' Defence Select Committee report said there was as yet no evidence that North Korea could arm these missiles with nuclear warheads. MPs, who have been investigating the threat posed by North Korea, added that such a strike seemed ""highly unlikely"". They described the country's ruler, Kim Jong-un, as ""ruthless but rational"". He was ""ruthless, like other Communist dictators before him, but he is rational"" and could be ""dissuaded from the use of nuclear weapons, by means of a policy of deterrence and containment"", the report said. North Korea has carried out six nuclear tests, and has a ballistic missile that experts believe could put the whole of the US in striking range. In doing so, Pyongyang said it had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state. However, last month, after months of mutual hostility, Mr Kim was said to be ""committed to denuclearisation"" as he and US President Donald Trump agreed to talks, in an unprecedented move. Trump accepts 'milestone' meeting with Kim North Korea crisis in 300 words What missiles does North Korea have? Despite the developments, the MPs' report said North Korea was unlikely to abandon its weapon programme and would achieve its goal of posing a nuclear threat to its opponents soon. The committee said a North Korean nuclear strike against the UK seemed ""highly unlikely"", given its focus on threatening the US. ""It is obvious to North Korea that launching such weapons would lead inescapably to devastating military consequences,"" the report goes on. If there were conflict in the region, the UK was unlikely to stand aside and would assist the US, it said. North Korea tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile last July The MPs' report issued a further warning that the UK could be the target of cyber attacks from the regime. North Korea was believed to be behind last May's WannaCry attack, which affected NHS hospitals, businesses and banks across the world causing billions of dollars of damage. Committee chairman Julian Lewis said the threats posed by the regime were typical of the intensifying dangers confronting the UK and underlined the need to spend more on defence. He told the BBC he wanted to see spending increased from 2% of GDP to nearer 3% to cope with new cyber and nuclear threats, as well as older ones.

Bollywood star Khan guilty of poaching,"Khan can appeal against the verdict An Indian court has sentenced Bollywood superstar Salman Khan to five years in jail for poaching rare antelope back in 1998. The court in Jodhpur also fined him 10,000 rupees ($154; Â£109) for the crime. He has since been taken to jail. Khan killed the two blackbucks, a protected species, in the western state of Rajasthan while shooting a film. Four other actors who starred with him in the movie and were also charged with the offence have been acquitted. Khan, 52, can appeal against the verdict in a higher court. Correspondents say he will have to spend at least a few days in prison. The Bollywood superstar who lives dangerously Salman Khan acquitted in firearms case This is the fourth case filed against the actor in connection with poaching animals during the filming of the 1998 movie Hum Saath Saath Hain. In 2006, a trial court convicted the actor in two cases of poaching and sentenced him separately to one year and five years in prison. The Rajasthan high court suspended the sentences the following year, and eventually quashed both convictions in 2016. The state government has appealed against that order in the Supreme Court. Khan was then acquitted of a third case in 2017, which was for possessing unlicensed weapons used to poach the wildlife in 1998. The original poaching complaint against him was filed by the local Bishnoi community, who revere and worship the blackbuck. In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died and four others were in injured. His car allegedly ran over them while they were sleeping on a street in the western city of Mumbai. A lower court had convicted him in May 2015. During his trial, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Seven months later, the high court acquitted him. It said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who had since died - was not reliable. In January 2017, Khan was also acquitted in another case that charged him with using illegal firearms to kill the blackbucks. One of Bollywood's biggest stars, the actor has appeared in more than 100 films and has a huge fan following across the vast spectrum of Indian society. His fans include the middle-class English-speaking audiences as well as poor slum dwellers for whom the 350-rupee ($5.20; Â£3.40) tickets do not come cheap. Known for his romantic roles as well as action films, Khan has won several prestigious Indian cinema awards. The eldest of the three sons of well-known screenplay writer Salim Khan, he is a hit on social media too - his Facebook page is liked by more than 36 million fans, while on Twitter he has 32.5 million followers. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Delhi Every day in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra, fans flock to Salman Khan's apartment building to catch a glimpse of the Bollywood actor. I once met a group of fans who had travelled more than five hours by bus to wait in the searing heat in the hope he would wave at them from his balcony. His films continue to draw mass audiences across urban and rural India. In a country where Bollywood is revered, Khan is one of the most worshipped. While his time in the spotlight has attracted praise and controversy in equal measure, this latest conviction is unlikely to dent his popularity or damage his career due to the cult-like status he enjoys. Khan's conviction is making waves on both mainstream and social media. The hashtag #BlackBuckPoachingCase is the top trend on Twitter India while #Salman Khan is also trending. Many of the tweets addressed the fact that the case has gone on for years. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, most Bollywood actors have refrained from commenting. Khan was convicted under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, the law that prohibits the hunting of hundreds of different species. Black buck deer, tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and Tibetan antelope are among the species given the highest level of protection. Punishment for first-time offenders can be imprisonment for up to seven years or a fine of up to 25,000 rupees (Â£276; $386), or both. Figures from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau show 148 recorded convictions for offences under the Wildlife Protection Act in 2016. The records also show 2,096 pending cases awaiting trial, 207 cases which were discharged and a 71.5% conviction rate. According to the State of India's Environment, the report published annually by the country's Centre for Science and Environment, there was a 52% spike in poaching and wildlife crimes between 2014 and 2016. More than 30,382 wildlife crimes were recorded in the country during that period.

Pro-Lula demonstrators were left disappointed The charges came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has implicated top politicians from several parties. A former metalworker and trade union activist, he was the first left-wing leader to make it to the presidency in Brazil in nearly half a century. During his presidency, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. In 2014, after Lula left office, prosecutors started investigating allegations that executives at the state oil company Petrobras had accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms. The investigation, dubbed Operation Car Wash, uncovered a huge web of corruption involving top-level politicians from a broad spectrum of parties taking kickbacks. Lula himself was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7 million reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe by engineering firm OAS. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula has described the battle against his conviction and prison term as a continuation of his fight against Brazil's military rule, which came to an end in 1985. ""I did not accept the military dictatorship and I will not accept this dictatorship of the prosecutors,"" he told a gathering of supporters on Monday. The judge in charge of Operation Car Wash, SÃ©rgio Moro, is expected to issue a warrant for Lula's arrest within days. But this does not necessarily mean that Lula will go to jail for 12 years. His supporters want Lula to remain free He has not exhausted his appeals yet. There are two higher courts which he can still turn to, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court - the latter has only ruled for far on whether he should go to jail pending further appeals, rather than on the underlying case. Neither of those courts would re-examine whether Lula was guilty of corruption. They would look into whether legal procedures were followed correctly and whether his constitutional rights were breached. This process could take months or even years. If either court were to rule in Lula's favour, his conviction could be annulled and he would be released. Under a 2010 Brazilian law called ""clean slate law"", no one convicted of a crime upheld on appeal can run for elected office for at least eight years. That law would rule Lula out from running for the presidency in October. However, exceptions have been made to the law before. The decision as to whether Lula can stand for president will rest with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). The TSE will not make a decision on whether Lula can run or not until he has registered as a candidate and he has until 15 August to do so. So we may not know for months to come whether he will be able to stand.

Fire warning over plastic-backed fridges,"Consumer watchdog Which? has called for plastic-backed fridges to be ""urgently"" removed from sale because they pose fire risks and could speed up blazes. Its investigation of 500 refrigeration appliances found backing material on almost half was made of unsafe plastic. Which? has labelled 250 models ""don't buys"" and is recommending consumers do not purchase plastic-backed models. It says a number of plastic-backed models sold as ""flame-retardant"" could also speed up the spread of a fire. All plastic-backed fridges, freezers and fridge-freezers on the market pass current safety standards but Which? says the tests are ""inadequate, not fit for purpose and do not come close to replicating the source of a real house fire"". The current British Standard requires refrigeration appliances to pass a glow wire test to assess their fire resistance. This involves putting a hot wire through a sample of the fridge or freezer backing material to determine if it catches alight. This video can not be played Is your fridge or freezer a fire risk? However, when conducting more stringent fire tests, Which? found that no plastic backing sample was able to withstand a flame for 30 seconds. In the event of a fire, it would not sufficiently prevent the flame from reaching the flammable insulation used in all fridges. In similar testing of metal and aluminium laminate-backed fridges, none caught alight after the 30-second test. Samples of metal and aluminium laminate backing less than 1mm thick were also able to withstand an open flame for a full five minutes. Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith said: ""People will rightly be outraged to learn that manufacturers and retailers are selling potentially unsafe products that could be putting their lives at risk. ""If manufacturers and retailers fail to act and leave plastic-backed fridges, freezers or fridge-freezers on sale, the Office for Product Safety and Standards must step in and take action."" Fires due to faults with refrigeration appliances are rare, with recent Which? research analysing UK fire statistics suggesting that they are responsible for just 8% of domestic fires. A spokesman for the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances said fires starting in fridges was extremely rare. ""All appliances on the market have to be safe and tested to the rigorous safety standards prevailing at the time. These standards are continuously revised,"" he said. ""The aim of the latest revision in relation to refrigeration, now being rolled out around the world, is to improve fire retardance in case a fire starts elsewhere in the home."" A Department for Business spokesman said the UK had some of the world's strictest safety laws for white goods and the government was working with Which? and other groups to see if standards could be made even more stringent. Faulty appliances 'cause 60 fires a week' Fire risk fridges standards 'deficient' Do not buy fire-risk fridges, says Which?

"Girl, 17, shot in drive-by killing","The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Two shootings in London in the space of an hour - including a drive-by attack - have left a 17-year-old girl and a boy, 16, dead. Friends said the girl, named locally as Tanesha Melbourne, was killed ""for no reason"" in Tottenham on Monday night. The Met has confirmed she died when ""shots were fired"" from a vehicle as it drove past a group of young people. Two miles away, in Walthamstow, the boy was found with gunshot wounds, with another boy, 15, who had stab injuries. The boy who suffered gunshot wounds died later in hospital, police said. Both attacks come amid concernsover rising violent crime in London. Police say the shootings are not linked. Tanesha, whose name has not been officially confirmed, was pronounced dead at 22:43 BST near Northumberland Park, Tottenham. Police remain at the scene. Grieving family members and friends left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road on Tuesday. One friend described her as a ""very lovable little girl in the community, she was not involved in any sort of problems with anyone"". Friends and family members left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road Tyesha, 21, who knew Tanesha, told the BBC she was ""just chilling with her friends"" when she was shot. ""The car just pulled up and just started shooting,"" she said. ""Her friend came banging on my door so I came out quickly. I even tried to save her - had to, had to."" She said the gunshot wound, below the victim's breast, was not immediately visible and it looked like she was ""having a fit"". ""I put her on her side and I was just rubbing her back, saying 'Everything's going to be OK'. I just can't believe it - so young. It's ridiculous now."" A witness said a woman, believed to be the victim's mother, began ""screaming"" when she discovered the girl shortly after the shooting. Det Ch Supt Richard Wood described the attack as ""terrible"". ""At this stage we're keeping a completely open mind, it's too early to say what the motive is or indeed if it's just a case of wrong place, wrong time,"" he said. ""We do know that a vehicle drove past a group of young people, shots were fired from the vehicle and sadly the young lady lost her life."" Are black knife deaths being ignored? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was ""deeply worried"" about London's rise in violent crime - particularly in his area. ""There is no single cause, but there has been a big spike in both gun crime and knife crime across London,"" he said. ""Certainly my constituency finds itself at the epicentre of that."" He said cuts to police budgets meant fewer neighbourhood officers on the streets who were ""able to pick up intelligence"" within communities. The 17-year-old girl is the ninth teenager to be murdered in London this year Two teenagers were shot and stabbed in a separate incident in Walthamstow, east London A local resident, who did not want to be named, said she heard multiple shots, which sounded like a ""bomb"" exploding. She said: ""It's not nice. I've lived here for 40 years, and in the last two or three years it's become not a nice place. ""There are so many drugs, stabbings and killings."" Greg McKenzie, BBC London The community in Tottenham has already been gripped with grief and shock that a young woman has had her life ended so tragically. I'm told there were dozens of people out until 02:00 BST consoling each other, while other residents woke to see police cordons and press at the scene. There was a poignant silence when the body of the 17-year-old was taken away, broken only by the sound of people crying. In this area there are people - no matter what age - who are fearful. Residents spoke about self-imposed curfews and mothers not letting their children out after 19:00. Amid the sadness, there is also anger and questions over what the Mayor of London is doing. David Lammy MP claimed Tottenham was at the ""epicentre"" of London's rising violent crime Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said stabbings were common in the area. The Tottenham resident said: ""It's so violent around here. I nearly got stabbed the other day. If you've been around Tottenham a long time you get it."" Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Watch: ""My kids don't see this side of me"" One witness, who works in a nearby shop, said he heard three distinct bangs, which sounded like ""fireworks"". He said he saw the victim with blood on her chest sitting with friends following the shooting, before police cars and ambulances arrived. Close to the scene, residents held an impromptu celebration of Tanesha's life until the early morning. ""We were out here until one o'clock in the morning,"" a neighbour said. ""It was really heart-breaking. We were here for ages but clearly she was already gone."" Forensic officers have spent most of the day at the scene gathering any evidence School friend Candice Hassan said she found out about the murder on social media just half-an-hour after the shooting. ""It was shocking. Everyone's upset obviously - one minute I see her and the next minute I don't,"" she said. ""One hour before her death, I saw her on Snapchat - one hour before she got shot. Everyone knows Tanesha, she's just a humble girl. ""It was just the wrong place at the wrong time. She didn't deserve any of that."" The 17-year-old, who went to the Gladesmore Community School with Tanesha, added: ""I have heard it was a drive-by shooting - obviously gang-related - Wood Green and Tottenham."" Formal identification has yet to take place. However, Tanesha's next-of-kin have been informed of her death. The Walthamstow crime scene, in Markhouse Road, is just over two miles (3.5km) from the site of the Tottenham killing. A police cordon remains in place around Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where the girl was pronounced dead Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the 16-year-old boy was taken to a hospital in east London. He had been in ""intensive care"". Scotland Yard said the 15-year-old boy who was stabbed in Walthamstow has life-changing but not life-threatening injuries. There have been no arrests in either investigation. It brings the total of fatal shootings in London this year to seven, including one man who died after being shot and stabbed. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""There can be no place in our society for violent crime. The government is determined to do everything it can to break the cycle. ""We have already consulted on new laws on offensive and dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in private.""

Amaan died in hospital at 17:45 BST on Tuesday with his next of kin at his side, becoming the youngest murder victim to die in London this year. Friends and family laid flowers at the scene of the shooting outside Walthamstow Leisure Centre The 15-year-old boy who was stabbed in the same attack has been released from hospital. Amaan was shot in a case of ""mistaken identity"", a family friend said. Speaking outside the scene of the shooting at Walthamstow Leisure Centre, Osman, 32, said Amaan had ""got caught up"" in ""gang wars"" in the area. Another friend, who did not want to give his name, told the BBC he no longer feels safe in the area. He said: ""There's nothing to do for the youths. It's getting out of control. ""The youth centre's football pitches are the one place people can come to get away from whatever they're getting away from."" Extra police are on the streets of Walthamstow and officers said they were using stop-and-search powers to seize weapons. DCI Gary Holmes said: ""This is a tragic murder of a young man which has shocked the local community and the rest of London."" David Rhodes, BBC England Data Unit Overall, recorded gun crime in London is down by a third over 10 years. Yet the latest available figures, for 2016-17, showed an increase. There were 2,136 firearms offences recorded by the Metropolitan Police, a rise of 580 in a year. Across England and Wales the number of people dying due to injuries from firearms is also down significantly compared with a decade ago, although the most recent figures show a rise. There were 32 homicides involving guns in 2016-17, compared with 53 in 2007-08. Yet the number of people dying has risen every year for the past three years.

The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Tanesha, whose name has not been officially confirmed, was pronounced deadat 22:43 on Monday after a drive-by shooting in Chalgrove Road near Northumberland Park, Tottenham. Her death came as police were already at the scene two miles away in Markhouse Road, Walthamstow, after being called at about 22:00. There have been no arrests in either investigation. Friends and family members left floral tributes and candles at the scene in Chalgrove Road Acting Det Ch Insp Glenn Butler, who is investigating the Walthamstow shooting, said: ""I fully appreciate the alarm, shock and revulsion caused by this murder and other fatal shootings we have seen across London over the last few months.

Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? Met chief blames social media for violence Acting Ch Supt Tania Coulson said officers had met community leaders about the murder investigation. ""Section 60 - an intelligence-led pre-authorised power to stop and search - has been continually reviewed and put in place since the evening of Monday 2 April,"" she said. ""My officers have been on the streets using this power really effectively, seizing knives, stopping cars of young men carrying weapons and making arrests. That will continue... if necessary."" Greg McKenzie, BBC London The police tents and forensic officers who were outside Walthamstow Leisure Centre yesterday have gone but there are remnants of police tape around the area. Flowers and tributes have been laid near the site where 16-year-old Amaan was shot.  One card simply reads: ""I'm so sorry this has happened to you."" One resident described him as ""a beautiful young boy"". Another local resident said the increasing number of murders which have happened in the area was worrying. ""It's getting out of control. It used to feel like a safe neighbourhood but everything has changed,"" he said. A police cordon was in place around Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where the girl was pronounced dead London's Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Sophie Linden described the murders as ""truly shocking and worrying"" and said City Hall was ""prioritising tackling this violence"". ""We're not pretending there isn't a problem in London but we will get on top of it,"" she said. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott warned against the use of random stop and search tactics, saying it ""poisoned relationships"" between police and the community. Speaking to the BBC, the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP suggested lessons could be learned from how Scotland dealt with knife crime. ""They implemented a public health approach to knife crime - where police worked with education and other parts of the state, and last year... there were no deaths from knife crime in Scotland,"" she said. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn called for an end to cuts in police budgets. He said: ""We need to make sure there's complete prosecution for anyone holding a weapon; but also much better police and community support arrangements and no longer cuts in London's policing."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""There can be no place in our society for violent crime. The government is determined to do everything it can to break the cycle.

"Final gender pay gap figures revealedMore than 10,000 companies publish gender pay gap data ahead of Wednesday's midnight deadline.19m19 minutes agoBusiness","This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? More than 1,500 companies have failed to report their gender pay gap figures before Wednesday night's deadline. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said 1,557 firms had missed the deadline. It will now contact these companies to remind them of their legal obligations. The equalities watchdog will investigate those firms that fail to comply and could take legal action against them, with penalties including an unlimited fine. All companies, charities and public sector bodies with more than 250 employees were required to submit their gender pay figures before Wednesday's deadline. The EHRC will check whether those firms that failed to report fall into this category. One organisation that missed the deadline was the Unite union, which belatedly published its figures on Thursday. The union, which describes itself as being ""at the forefront of the trade union campaign to achieve equal pay"", revealed that its female employees' median hourly pay was 29.6% lower than what male workers are paid. Want to find out the median gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here. More than 10,000 firms have published data, with in excess of 1,000 firms reporting on the last day. More than three-quarters of UK companies pay men more on average than women, BBC analysis of government figures suggests. The median pay gap among those companies was 9.7%. The figures indicate 78% of firms pay men more than women on average, while 14% pay women more. This is based on the median measure, which is the level of pay that separates the top half of earners from the lower half. In total, 8% said they had no pay gap between men and women. The gender pay gap is not the same as having unequal pay, which would be against the law. By law, men and women with the same jobs have to be paid the same wages. A gender pay gap can arise if there are more highly paid men than women in a company, or if women are deemed to be less experienced than their male counterparts, or if women take a hit to their salary after taking maternity leave. In reporting gender pay, firms with more than 250 staff have to publish data on the average difference between male and female employees. Nine ways to narrow the gender pay gap Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap? Rebecca Hilsenrath, EHRC chief executive, said it was pleased with the rate of reporting, but added: ""It is the law, it's not an option. It is the right thing to do, and we will be enforcing against all those organisations which failed to meet the deadline."" The EHRC will send letters to all of those organisations next week and they will then have 28 days to respond. Terms of reference will then be issued for the enforcement process, which will be made public. She said the more important issue is what companies will do to address the pay gap: ""We want them to look at their flexible working practices, we want to look at them tackling bias, conscious and unconscious, and we're looking to them to address instances of pregnancy and maternity pay discrimination."" Airline Ryanair was one of the companies reporting a large difference, with a 71.8% gender pay gap. Boux Avenue, the lingerie firm owned by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, reported a median hourly pay gap of 75.7%, while fashion retailer Karen Millen had a gap of 49%. High Street brands Costa, KFC, Matalan, McDonald's, Primark and Starbucks reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. Some firms reported so-called ""negative"" pay gaps, where women are paid on average more than men. These included electric car maker Tesla Motors, babywear retailer Mamas and Papas and electronics retailer Richer Sounds. Some have said reporting the pay gap is crude and open to misinterpretation, but gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society said it is an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn.

The median pay gap among the 10,000 companies with more than 250 employees that have reported figures in the government's pay portal is 9.7%. But according to the Office of National Statistics the UK's median gender pay gap is 18.4%. Why is there a difference between the figures? The ONS figure is based on its annual survey of hours and earnings, and that includes both full and part-time workers, and covers all employers. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

"Tribe's treehouses were staged, BBC saysIn a 2011 episode of Human Planet, the Korowai tribe are shown moving into a house as a real home.","The segment featuring treehouses in West Papua was misleading, the BBC has admitted The BBC has said a scene in its Human Planet series, which featured a tribe from West Papua, in Indonesia, was not accurate. In the 2011 episode, the Korowai people were shown moving into a treehouse as a real home. But during recent filming for a different programme, the tribe said the houses were ""commissioned for filming"". The BBC said it ""breached editorial standards"" and had since revised its guidelines. The error was discovered as producers made BBC Two's upcoming series, My Year With The Tribe. The corporation said a member of the tribe told presenter Will Millard the very high treehouses were built for ""the benefit of overseas programme makers"". Human Planet: The challenges and joys of filming In the new programme, Millard tells viewers: ""This is not where they live, this is total artifice"". A BBC spokeswoman said: ""The BBC has reviewed a sequence in Human Planet depicting this [the treehouses] and found that the portrayal of the tribe moving into the treehouse as a real home is not accurate. ""Since this programme was broadcast in 2011, we have strengthened our mandatory training for all staff in editorial guidelines, standards and values.""

Facebook scandal 'hit 87 million users',"This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded Facebook believes the data of up to 87 million people was improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica - many more than previously disclosed. The BBC has been told that about 1.1 million of them are UK-based. The overall figure had been previously quoted as being 50 million by the whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said ""clearly we should have done more, and we will going forward"". Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to lead Facebook During a press conference he said that he had previously assumed that if Facebook gave people tools, it was largely their responsibility to decide how to use them. But he added that it was ""wrong in retrospect"" to have had such a limited view. Mark Zuckerberg answered questions from the press for nearly an hour ""Today, given what we know... I think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility,"" he said. ""That we're not just building tools, but that we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well."" Mr Zuckerberg also announced an internal audit had uncovered a fresh problem. Malicious actors had been abusing a feature that let users search for one another by typing in email addresses or phone numbers into Facebook's search box. As a result, many people's public profile information had been ""scraped"" and matched to the contact details, which had been obtained from elsewhere. Facebook has now blocked the facility. ""It is reasonable to expect that if you had that [default] setting turned on, that in the last several years someone has probably accessed your public information in this way,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. The estimates of how many people's data had been exposed wererevealed in a blog,externalby the tech firm's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer. The BBC has also learned that Facebook now estimates that about 305,000 people had installed the This Is Your Digital Life quiz that had made the data-harvesting possible. The previously suggested figure had been 270,000. About 97% of the installations occurred within the US. However, just over 16 million of the total number of users affected are thought to be from other countries. Zuckerberg to testify before US committee Facebook chief fires back at Apple's Tim Cook Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo A spokeswoman for the UK's Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that it was continuing to assess and consider the evidence before deciding what steps to take. Facebook has faced intense criticism after it emerged that it had known for years that Cambridge Analytica had collected data from millions of its users, but had relied on the London-based firm to self-certify that it had deleted the information. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Cambridge Analytica said it had bought the information from the creator of the This Is Your Digital Life app without knowing that it had been obtained improperly. The firm says it deleted all the data as soon as it was made aware of the circumstances. But Channel 4 Newshas since reported that at least,externalsome of the data in question is still in circulation despite Cambridge Analytica insisting it had destroyed the material. During Mr Zuckerberg's press conference,Cambridge Analytica tweeted,externalit had only obtained data for 30 million individuals - not 87 million - from the app's creator, and again insisted it had deleted all records.

The latest revelations came several hours after the US House Commerce Committee announced that Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before it on 11 April. Facebook's share price has dropped sharply in the weeks since the allegations emerged. In his Wednesday blog post, Mr Schroepfer detailed new steps being taken by Facebook in the wake of the scandal. They include: a decision to stop third-party apps seeing who is on the guest lists of Events pages and the contents of messages posted on them a commitment to only hold call and text history logs collected by the Android versions of Messenger and Facebook Lite for a year. In addition, Facebook said the logs would no longer include the time of the calls a link will appear at the top of users' News Feeds next week, prompting them to review the third-party apps they use on Facebook and what information is shared as a consequence An alert will remind users they can remove any apps they no longer want to access their data Facebook has also published proposed new versions of itsterms of service,externalanddata use policy,external. The documents are longer than the existing editions in order to make the language clearer and more descriptive. Another change the company announced involved limiting the type of information that can be accessed by third-party applications. Immediately after the changes were announced, however, users of the widely popular dating app Tinder were hit by login errors, leaving them unable to use the service. Allow Twitter content?

The Cambridge Analytica scandal follows earlier controversies about ""fake news"" and evidence that Russia tried to influence US voters via Facebook. Mr Zuckerberg has declined to answer questions from British MPs. Mr Zuckerberg now regrets saying it was a ""pretty crazy idea"" that fake news on Facebook could have helped Donald Trump become president When asked about this by the BBC, he said he had decided that his chief technology officer and chief product officer should answer questions from countries other than the US. He added, however, that he had made a mistake in 2016 by dismissing the notion that fake news had influenced the US Presidential election. ""People will analyse the actual impact of this for a long time to come,"" he added. ""But what I think is clear at this point is that it was too flippant and I should never have referred to it as crazy.""

Good causes 'losing out' to Lottery profits,"National Lottery funding for good causes is under threat while profits for its operator grow, a parliamentary committee has said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said Camelot had made profits ""well in excess"" of what was expected by its original licence. Returns for good causes were only 2% higher in 2016-17 than in 2009-10, while Camelot's profits rose by 122%. A Camelot spokesman said it was working to ""maximise returns to good causes."" Camelot's profits have increased to 1% of sales after tax, rather than the 0.6% anticipated by the Gambling Commission when it agreed the original licence in 2009. Light trick 'caused lottery number change' US jackpot claimed amid anonymity battle National Lottery rule changes explained in under 90 secs - BBC News Meanwhile, returns for good causes have fallen from 27p per pound spent in 2009-10 to 22p in 2016-17. The PAC said the current licence did not have enough flexibility to protect good causes when consumer behaviour changed. Camelot said scratch cards and instant win games, which have become more popular, provide a lower return to good causes because they need to offer a higher proportion of proceeds as prizes to encourage consumers to buy them. The return for good causes from a scratch card is on average 10p per pound spent, much lower than the draw-based game average of 30p. The PAC criticised the Gambling Commission for not including a break clause in the 2012 renegotiation of Camelot's licence, meaning its terms could not be changed without the company's agreement. However the committee said falling public's awareness of the Lottery's charity work, and the ""detrimental effects of tinkering with the format of the Lottery,"" were also relevant. Among other changes brought in in 2015,the number of Lotto balls was increased from 49 to 59.The PAC described the decision as ""unpopular"". The resulting fall in sales led to a corresponding decline in returns to good causes. The committee also said it did not believe that Camelot was doing ""all it can"" to support education and research on gambling awareness, Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""Raising money for good causes is one of the founding principles of the National Lottery but this objective is under threat."" She added that ""it would be a sad and significant loss to many deserving organisations and individuals"" if that funding was lost ""as a result of inaction now."" Camelot said: ""During the third licence period, annual returns to good causes have been, on average, 30% higher than under the previous licence. ""We've already seen some encouraging signs that the initiatives from the strategic review that we carried out last summer are working, and are confident that we have strong plans to get The National Lottery back into growth.""

Choir of male PCs 'not very PC',"Derbyshire Constabulary Male Voice Choir is ""severing association"" with the force A police male voice choir is changing its name and distancing itself from its force after being told it went against equal opportunities policies. Derbyshire Constabulary Male Voice Choir was asked to become a mixed-voice group in September last year. But chairman Kevin Griffiths said it would be ""difficult"" to hire the 50 women needed to balance the sound. Derbyshire Police chief constable Peter Goodman said the group was ""incompatible"" with force policies. Earlier this week, Derbyshire was announced asthe force with the largest gender pay gapin the country. East Midlands Live: Charity to work with crime victims in hospitals; Missing tortoise found after nine months The choir is made up of about 35 ex-officers and has raised Â£750,000 for charity since it was founded. It will now be known as the Derbyshire Community Male Voice Choir. Mr Griffiths said the group met with the chief constable in January to discuss the issue, but was given a notice in March saying authorisation to use the force in its name had been revoked. ""We fully understand the rationale behind Mr Goodman's decision,"" he said. ""We are very good at what we do, and to undertake such a change [becoming a mixed choir] would have required the recruitment of up to 50 new female members with a host of associated costs. ""We felt that to attempt such a change would have destroyed the choir and felt it was better to sever our association with the constabulary and continue the good work we do under a new name."" Mr Griffiths added that no women had asked to become members of the choir in its history. ""[Our members] sing in mixed choirs, and we enjoy it, but there's just something about a male voice choir,"" he said. Mr Goodman said his force is ""an equal opportunities employer"" and ""committed to having an organisation where there are no enclaves where people from different backgrounds cannot go"". ""I wish [the choir] all the very best for the future,"" he added.

"Breaking|Breaking newsBrazil's Lula must start prison termBrazil's ex-President Lula must go to prison on corruption charges pending appeal, Supreme Court judges rule by 6-55m6 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean","Lula claims charges against him are politically motivated Brazil's ex-President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva will be jailed while he appeals against a graft conviction, the Supreme Court has ruled. He is facing 12 years in jail on charges of accepting a bribe but had asked to remain free during his appeal. Lula claims the charges are politically motivated, and designed to prevent him from running for president in October. He has a lead in opinion polls. His Workers' Party said the ruling was a ""tragic day for democracy and Brazil"". The Supreme Court judges ruled against him by six to five after a marathon session, which ended in the early hours of Thursday. Read more about Lula A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Key words and names in Brazil's corruption cases Lula watched the ruling at the Metalworker's Union, where his supporters held an upbeat concert. The 72-year-old former president is likely to remain free until paperwork for his arrest is completed. Anti-Lula demonstrators celebrated Lula served as president between 2003 and 2011. Despite his lead in the polls, he remains a divisive figure. Up to 20,000 people protested in SÃ£o Paulo on Tuesday calling for his immediate imprisonment, while supporters also rallied in large numbers in a rival demonstration. While Brazilians are used to frequent delays and rambling verdicts in their courts, this 10-hour deliberation felt particularly long in this highly charged atmosphere. Lula's legal battles have divided Brazilians and this decision was no different. His critics launched fireworks in celebration. Lula's supporters went home angry about what they say is an affront to democracy and a coup. Lula's critics though see this as a victory. He's a politician who's been proven to be corrupt at the highest level, they say, and deserves to be behind bars - within days that could become a reality, crushing his hopes of returning to power. This has been a massive fall from grace for a man who was once one of the world's most loved politicians. It was a historic day for Brazilian politics too. Until recently, defendants in Brazil were allowed to remain free until their final appeal had been exhausted. However, the Supreme Court was considering a 2016 ruling from a lower court, under which defendants could be sent to jail after a failed first appeal. Lula lost his first appeal in January, when the appeals court not only upheld his conviction, but increased the sentence from nine and a half years to 12. Pro-Lula demonstrators were left disappointed The charges came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has implicated top politicians from several parties. A former metalworker and trade union activist, he was the first left-wing leader to make it to the presidency in Brazil in nearly half a century. During his presidency, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. In 2014, after Lula left office, prosecutors started investigating allegations that executives at the state oil company Petrobras had accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms. The investigation, dubbed Operation Car Wash, uncovered a huge web of corruption involving top-level politicians from a broad spectrum of parties taking kickbacks. Lula himself was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7 million reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe by engineering firm OAS. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula has described the battle against his conviction and prison term as a continuation of his fight against Brazil's military rule, which came to an end in 1985. ""I did not accept the military dictatorship and I will not accept this dictatorship of the prosecutors,"" he told a gathering of supporters on Monday. The judge in charge of Operation Car Wash, SÃ©rgio Moro, is expected to issue a warrant for Lula's arrest within days. But this does not necessarily mean that Lula will go to jail for 12 years. His supporters want Lula to remain free He has not exhausted his appeals yet. There are two higher courts which he can still turn to, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court - the latter has only ruled for far on whether he should go to jail pending further appeals, rather than on the underlying case. Neither of those courts would re-examine whether Lula was guilty of corruption. They would look into whether legal procedures were followed correctly and whether his constitutional rights were breached. This process could take months or even years. If either court were to rule in Lula's favour, his conviction could be annulled and he would be released. Under a 2010 Brazilian law called ""clean slate law"", no one convicted of a crime upheld on appeal can run for elected office for at least eight years. That law would rule Lula out from running for the presidency in October. However, exceptions have been made to the law before. The decision as to whether Lula can stand for president will rest with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). The TSE will not make a decision on whether Lula can run or not until he has registered as a candidate and he has until 15 August to do so. So we may not know for months to come whether he will be able to stand.

"Man, 78, held in 'burglar' murder probeAn intruder was stabbed during a struggle at the man's house in Hither Green, south-east London.","A forensic tent has been set up outside Richard Osborn-Brooks' home in Hither Green A 78-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a suspected burglar was stabbed to death. The man, named locally as Richard Osborn-Brooks, discovered two intruders in South Park Crescent, Hither Green, south-east London, at about 00:45 BST. One suspect, armed with a screwdriver, forced the man into his kitchen where a struggle ensued and he was stabbed, Scotland Yard said. The 38-year-old was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead at 03:40. The suspected burglar was found collapsed in Further Green Road, south-east London The homeowner discovered two intruders in his house in South Park Crescent Mr Osborn-Brooks, who suffered bruising to his arms, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody at a south London police station. The other intruder remains at large. The CPS and police urge people to always call the police first - if you are able. But according toofficial guidance,external, anyone can use reasonable force to protect themselves. As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and the fear felt, the more force you can lawfully use in self-defence. The law doesn't require you to wait to be attacked before using defensive force, but does not protect you if, for example, your action is over-the-top or calculated revenge. You are given greater protection under the law if force is used to protect yourself or others when dealing with a burglar or trespasser on your property. The CPS says if you have acted in reasonable self-defence, as described above, and the intruder dies you will still have acted lawfully. Police said they were called to the property over reports of a burglary when they found the man collapsed in nearby Further Green Road with a stab wound to the upper body. One man who lives on the street said there had been a recent spate of burglaries in the area and his home had been broken into in recent months. ""I was renovating the house and they broke in and took a laptop. I know this has happened to others recently,"" he said. Adam Lake, another local resident, said he ""wasn't surprised"" to hear about the burglary. ""We've even had to put up CCTV at home because we didn't feel safe,"" he said. ""I feel terrible for the man that was burgled. He doesn't deserve to be punished for defending himself,"" he said. Forensic officers are carrying out investigations at the scene Keith Doyle, BBC News For now, the streets are cordoned off as police in blue boiler suits search gardens and bins for anything that will help their investigation. Neighbours say there have been quite a few burglaries in this area recently - this is a relatively well-off part of south east-London with streets of semi-detached houses. The chair of the residents' association told me it is trying to make the area safer, working with police and the council to close off alleyways. At the same time it has been trying to bring the community together with street parties and other events. The dead man's next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination would take place ""in due course"", the Met said. Local ward Councillor Mark Ingleby described the killing as a ""tragedy"" and said it had come ""out of the blue"". He said there had been a ""definite improvement"" on tackling burglaries in the area thanks to an active Neighbourhood Watch scheme. New security gates had also been installed to prevent trespassers accessing alleyways behind houses, he said.

The dead man's next of kin have been informed. Mark Easton, BBC Home Editor The deliberate killing of one human being by another is a crime that defies easy characterisation. Among the more than 50 tragedies that make up the current spike in homicides in the capital this year are some that may be premeditated or gang-related, but most will be unpredictable acts of violence in moments of mental anguish, involving a victim and a perpetrator who are well known to each other. By far the most likely year of life in which we might be unlawfully killed is not in our teens or early 20s but our first year - babies aged under one are more than twice as likely to be murdered as a 20-year-old.
