Boeing agrees deal with Ethiopia crash families,"A total of 157 people died when Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 crashed Boeing has reached an agreement with the families of the 157 people who died in the Ethiopia 737 Max crash in 2019. The plane maker accepts liability for their deaths, according to court documents in Chicago. In return, families of the victims will not seek punitive damages from the company. Lawyers for the victims' families said Boeing would still be held ""fully accountable"", welcoming the agreement as a significant milestone. Boeing shares fell 1% to $218.50 on the news. The agreement opens the way for families outside the US, in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, to claim compensation through the US courts, rather than in their home countries, which might be more difficult and result in lower payments. Former Boeing 737 Max pilot charged with fraud Boeing directors face investor lawsuit over crashes Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy Mark Pegram in the UK, whose son Sam was one of the victims, said: ""The main positive for us is that Boeing is admitting liability, and not diverting blame onto Ethiopian Airlines or the pilots... we wanted them to hold their hands up."" Sam's mother Debbie told the BBC: ""All we are looking to do with any compensation is set up a charity in Sam's name. It's what we want to do and it's what Sam would have wanted us to do."" At the time of the crash, the 737 Max was Boeing's best-selling plane. But two fatal accidents within five months - the Ethiopia Airlines flight out of Addis Ababa and before that a Lion Air jet that came down into the sea off Indonesia - signalled there were serious faults with the aircraft. The planes were grounded for 20 months, while investigations took place, but have since been allowed to return to operations after the firm made significant changes to their software and training. Words are important and in this agreement Boeing accepts responsibility for the crash of ET302 - a disaster which claimed the lives of 157 people from 35 different countries. The world may have moved on and the 737 Max may be flying again, but for many of the families of those who died, the grief and sense of loss remains very raw indeed. In the period since the two accidents involving the 737 Max, Boeing has faced criticism for appearing to deflect blame elsewhere, for example by questioning the abilities of the pilots. So that admission of liability really does matter. For Boeing, the agreement provides some protection, by removing the possibility of relatives seeking potentially very high punitive damages and by making it unlikely current or former executives will be called to testify in court. Alongside the settlement reached ina lawsuit bought by shareholderslast week - who had been suing the company over unsafe business practices - it removes much of the legal jeopardy the aerospace giant had been facing. But the company has made a significant concession. It has agreed that all compensation claims can be made under US law, which provides for much higher levels of compensation than would apply in many other countries. The families of the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash holding a vigil in front of the US Department of Transportation headquarters in Washington, DC in September 2019 The agreement reached in Chicago, Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, opens the way for compensation claims to be made. While it does not stipulate any specific level of compensation for the victims' families, the agreement will limit the scale and scope of any further procedures. Legal experts say it makes the prospect of current or former Boeing executives testifying in court much less likely. ""Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,"" the plane maker said in a statement. ""By accepting responsibility, Boeing's agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family."" Lawyers for the victims released a statement saying that under the agreement, Boeing admitted ""that the 737 Max had an unsafe condition, and that it will not attempt to blame anyone else"" for the crash. ""This is a significant milestone for the families in their pursuit of justice against Boeing, as it will ensure they are all treated equitably and eligible to recover full damages under Illinois law, while creating a pathway for them to proceed to a final resolution, whether through settlements or trial,"" the lawyers said. In January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice, including $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn) in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 Max crashes, including the Lion Air crash in October 2018.

"UK is not a corrupt country, says Johnson","This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson says he does not believe UK institutions are corrupt Boris Johnson has hit back at sleaze allegations, insisting the UK is not ""remotely a corrupt country"". The prime minister said MPs faced ""tough"" scrutiny - and those who broke the rules should be punished. He was speaking to the world's media at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It comes amid controversy over Conservative MPs with second jobs - and an investigation into Sir Geoffrey Cox doing paid outside work in his House of Commons office. This, as well as paid lobbying - attempting to influence government policy in return for money - is banned under MPs' rules. Cox denies breaking rules on Commons office use What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? Which MPs have second jobs? Asked if he had a message to voters concerned by headlines about the return of Tory sleaze, Mr Johnson said: ""I genuinely believe that the UK is not remotely a corrupt country and I genuinely think that our institutions are not corrupt. ""We have a very, very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media. ""I think what you have got is cases where, sadly, MPs have broken the rules in the past, may be guilty of breaking the rules today. What I want to see is them facing appropriate sanctions."" But he added that MPs had been allowed to do other jobs, such as lawyers and doctors, for ""hundreds of years"", and ""on the whole"" this had strengthened British democracy by giving them ""some experience of the world"". An awkward truth for Downing Street is that even though it's the behaviour of just a few dozen MPs that's being called into question, most of them are Conservatives, which is a fact they cannot avoid. The prime minister's own handling of what's happening and his own attitude to the rules has infuriated many of his own colleagues, and that feeling has not gone. By mentioning the allegations of corruption laid at the government's door, Boris Johnson has perhaps reinforced the criticism from the opposition, even if, by international standards, it is important to say the UK is nowhere near the top of the list. Read more from Laura Sir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, is facing questions after video footage emerged of him carrying out paid legal work from what appears to be his Commons office. The former attorney-general, who continues to practise as a barrister alongside being an MP, was participating in a virtual hearing for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the British Virgin Islands. MPs are allowed to have second jobs but their code of conduct says they cannot use public resources, including parliamentary offices, for ""personal or financial benefit"". Sir Geoffrey denies any wrongdoing. Geoffrey Cox says he will ""fully co-operate"" with any inquiry into how he used his Commons office Last month, Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken rules by lobbying the government on behalf of companies who were paying him - and for using his Commons office for business meetings, which is prohibited. He resigned from Parliament last week. Mr Paterson has denied breaking the Commons lobbying rules, and says an investigation into his conduct by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, was conducted unfairly. Last week the government blocked a proposal to suspend him for 30 days, instead suggesting that the whole system for investigating MPs should be reviewed. But ministers U-turned the next day, amid a furious backlash from opposition MPs and some Tories. On Wednesday, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the controversy had been a ""dark day"" for Parliament - and urged MPs from different parties to help ""move Parliament to a better place"". This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle: MPs must ""move forward"" Mr Johnson has been repeatedly asked if he will apologise for his botched attempt to rewrite the rules last week, but has declined to do so. On Wednesday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said his failure to say sorry ""proves that he doesn't care about tackling the corruption that has engulfed Downing Street, his government and the Conservative Party"". ""Instead of taking responsibility, the prime minister is taking the mickey out of the British people and won't clean up his mess."" Mr Johnson has himself been found to have broken MPs' standards rules on several occasions. In 2019, he was judged to havefailed to declare a financial interestin a Somerset property in time. It followed a similar finding in 2018, when he was ordered to apologise over thelate declarationof Â£52,000 in book royalty payments. The code of conduct prohibits: Paid lobbying (attempts to alter policy) of government or other public bodies The use of ""public resources"", including parliamentary premises, for work not carried out as an MP or minister MPs must also declare: Any ""relevant"" outside interests when speaking in debates or taking part in other parliamentary activities Individual payments of more than Â£100 from an outside source Gifts totalling Â£300 or more from a single source in the course of a year Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Cox denies breaking rules on Commons office use,"This video can not be played Video shows Sir Geoffrey Cox's work for British Virgin Islands inquiry Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Cox has said he did not break parliamentary rules by carrying out paid legal work in his House of Commons office. The ex-attorney general, who has made almost Â£900,000 in the last year as a barrister, apparently took part in a virtual meeting there on 14 September. MPs cannot use public resources, including parliamentary offices, for ""personal or financial benefit"". Sir Geoffrey said it was up to voters to decide whether he remains an MP. Labour has referred his case for investigation to the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Cox under fire over office use for Caribbean work PM says MPs must be visible in constituencies Which MPs have second jobs? Constituents split over MP's second job Last month, Conservative MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken rules by lobbying the government on behalf of companies who were paying him - and for using his Commons office for business meetings, which is prohibited. His case has raised questions about the extra work some MPs do on top of their parliamentary jobs. MPs are allowed to do extra jobs - for example, as doctors or lawyers, or writing books or giving speeches - but they must declare their additional income along with gifts and donations. Sir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, has continued to practise as a barrister. His work includes advising the British Virgin Islands government inquiry into alleged corruption. Video footage from September,external- revealed by the Times newspaper on Wednesday - is available online of Sir Geoffrey participating in a virtual hearing for the inquiry from what appears to be his Commons office. At one point he gets up from his chair, returning to it around half an hour later. His absence occurred at about the same time as MPs, including Sir Geoffrey, were voting on the government's health and social care funding reforms. At a later point, he excuses himself for the rest of the hearing, saying: ""Would you forgive me for not being present this afternoon? I'm afraid I have compelling other commitments... ""Forgive my absence during some of the morning. I'm afraid the bell went off."" This appears to be a reference to the division bell, which rings when MPs are summoned to the Commons to vote. This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid says MPs must be ""open and transparent"" A statement on behalf of Sir Geoffrey, posted on his website, says: ""He does not believe that he breached the rules but will of course accept the judgement of the Parliamentary Commissioner or of the Committee [on Public Standards] on the matter."" ""Sir Geoffrey regularly works 70-hour weeks and always ensures that his casework on behalf of his constituents is given primary importance and fully carried out."" And it adds: ""Sir Geoffrey's view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practises that profession. ""That has been the consistent view of the local Conservative Association and although at every election his political opponents have sought to make a prominent issue of his professional practice, it has so far been the consistent view of the voters of Torridge and West Devon. Sir Geoffrey is very content to abide by their decision."" Sir Geoffrey is also under fire for voting from the British Virgin Islands, while working there during the period when MPs were permitted to vote by proxy, or remotely, because of the pandemic. In his statement, he says he consulted the Conservative chief whip ""specifically on this issue and was advised that it was appropriate"". Torridge and West Devon Conservative Association chairman John Gray said: ""Geoffrey Cox is a superb constituency MP. ""He combines a strong ethos of public service with an astonishing work ethic and valuable legal expertise."" Meanwhile, it has also emerged that Sir Geoffrey - who was sacked from the cabinet last February - spoke at a webinar on Brexit, hosted by Withers, the law firm he was working for, in November 2020. Sir Geoffrey has represented the Torridge and West Devon constituency since 2005 He had been told by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, the watchdog that is meant to police jobs taken on by former ministers, not to offer ""privileged insight"" from his time in government, including on Brexit negotiations, to the law firm. During his remarks, Sir Geoffrey talked in general terms about his experience preparing for Brexit in cabinet committees. A spokesperson for Withers said: ""In all activities in connection with Withers - whether it be at speaking engagements or in his legal advice - Geoffrey Cox QC has not disclosed any privileged information from his time in Government and has been very conscious of the constraints that apply to him."" Sir Geoffrey's lengthy statement is a clear attempt to offer a thorough defence of his actions. He makes the point that he's never sought to hide his highly paid work as a barrister and that voters in his constituency have so far not seen it as a problem. Local Tories talk in glowing terms about the ""astonishing work ethic"" of their ""superb"" MP. But Labour won't let this go and have zeroed in on Sir Geoffrey's reported use of his office while undertaking additional paid work. On that he seems to believe he's done nothing wrong. Interestingly, he draws into this drama a couple of government figures whose approval he sought along the way. The Conservative chief whip Mark Spencer, who Sir Geoffrey says he consulted about voting by proxy while abroad and was told it was ""appropriate"". And the Attorney General Suella Braverman whose office advised there was no conflict of interest around his work in the British Virgin Islands. The code of conduct prohibits: Paid lobbying (attempts to alter policy) of government or other public bodies The use of ""public resources"", including parliamentary premises, for work not carried out as an MP or minister MPs must also declare: Any ""relevant"" outside interests when speaking in debates or taking part in other parliamentary activities Individual payments of more than Â£100 from an outside source Gifts totalling Â£300 or more from a single source in the course of a year Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: ""A Conservative MP using a taxpayer funded office in Parliament to work for a tax haven facing allegations of corruption is a slap in the face and an insult to British taxpayers. ""The prime minister needs to explain why he has an MP in his parliamentary party that treats Parliament like a co-working space allowing him to get on with all of his other jobs instead of representing his constituents."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has himself earned more than Â£100,000 from legal work since he became an MP in 2015, performing some legal work while he was a shadow cabinet member. He stopped in 2019 when he stood to be party leader. Asked about MPs working outside Parliament, Sir Keir said Labour wanted consultancies and partnerships ruled out, but that some types of employment, such as doctors working in hospitals, should be allowed. He said the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards should be the person to decide which jobs were allowed, saying: ""I think there has to be a bit of common sense on this, which side of the line cases fall.""

Meghan apologises to court over biography briefings,"The Duchess of Sussex has apologised to a court for making a misleading statement in her privacy case against the Mail on Sunday's publishers. The Appeal Court heard she had asked an aide to pass on information to the authors of a biography - despite having earlier said she ""did not contribute"". Meghan said she had forgotten the events and had not intended to mislead. Associated Newspapers is trying to overturn a ruling after it published a letter from the duchess to her father. Meghan, 40, won her privacy case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday earlier this year, when the High Courtfound its publication of the letter was unlawful. Associated Newspapers' legal team are now seeking to overturn this judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the ""possibility of public consumption"" in mind. Meghan weighed up calling father 'daddy' Privacy damage 'runs deep', says Meghan Newspaper must publish statement on Meghan case A spokesman for the Sussexes had previously said the couple""did not contribute"" to the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. But in new evidence heard on Wednesday, Jason Knauf, the couple's former communications secretary, said the book was ""discussed on a routine basis"" and ""discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email"". He also discussed planning a meeting with the authors to provide background information and said Meghan had given him briefing points to share with them, including information on how she had ""very minimal contact"" with her half-siblings during her childhood. Two of the arguments put forward by Meghan's lawyers in her battle with the Mail on Sunday would appear to have been compromised by these latest revelations. She has always claimed that she did not co-operate with the authors of the book Finding Freedom, but she has now remembered that she provided ""briefing notes"" to one of her key aides who she knew was in touch with the book's authors. The second strand of her case that would appear to have been undermined is her assertion that she had an ""expectation of privacy"" when she sent her handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle, which was partially published by the Mail on Sunday. It has now emerged in previously unpublished texts that she accepted the possibility the letter might be leaked. She had used language, she said in one text to her head of communications, that ""would pull at the heartstrings"". It will now be for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to stand by or overturn the original finding that was in favour of the duchess. Inthe second day of the appeal hearing,lawyers for Associated Newspapers had also challenged the extent to which the letter from Meghan to her father - at the centre of the case it is trying to overturn - was ""private"". They quoted an exchange of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf in which Meghan said: ""Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice."" Mr Knauf's evidence to the court also included emails with the Duke of Sussex, discussing the proposed meeting with the authors and the need to conceal any involvement by Prince Harry and Meghan. The former aide said Prince Harry replied: ""I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn't have anything to do with it. ""Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there."" In a witness statement to the court the duchess said she accepted that her aide did provide information to the authors of the book with her knowledge but she said the ""extent of the information he shared is unknown to me"". ""When I approved the passage... I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time,"" she said. ""I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court."" The court heard Prince Harry - pictured with Meghan at an event in New York on Wednesday - had said the couple needed to be able to deny any involvement in briefing the authors The duchess added that she would have been ""more than happy"" to refer to the exchanges with Mr Knauf if she had been aware of them at the time, but said they were ""a far cry from the very detailed personal information that the defendant alleges that I wanted or permitted to put into the public domain"". Another reason the duchess gave for not discovering the emails between her and Mr Knauf sooner was that the disclosure stage of the litigation had not yet been reached, and in October last year her lawyers applied to adjourn the trial date as she was pregnant. She said she was advised to avoid stress after a recent miscarriage, which came shortly after Associated Newspapers Limited indicated it wished to reveal the identities of her five friends who gave an interview to the US magazine People, in which they referred to her relationship with her father. Meghan said: ""I was in the first trimester of my third pregnancy at the time, having suffered a miscarriage a few months prior, and was feeling very unwell. ""My doctor advised me to avoid stress, particularly given the recent miscarriage days after the defendant threatened to break the confidentiality of the original 'sources' for the People magazine article, which resulted in my having to make an urgent application for an anonymity order. ""This was granted... but I found the process extremely stressful, and it took its toll physically and emotionally. ""I have at all times wanted to protect the privacy of those friends, while the defendant was, it seemed to me, doing everything it could to make this litigation as intrusive as possible.""

Banksy art painted over by Walken on TV show's set,"Banksy went on to the show's Bristol set to paint his rat Banksy painted one of his trademark rats on the set of BBC TV drama The Outlaws - before actor Christopher Walken painted over it as part of the storyline, it has been revealed. The show was filmed in the secretive artist's home city, Bristol. Banksy agreed to leave his mark on a wall of the set. It was then painted over by Walken's character for a scene in the final episode, which was releasedon BBC iPlayeron Wednesday. ""We can confirm that the artwork at the end of The Outlaws was an original Banksy, and that Christopher Walken painted over that artwork during the filming of this scene, ultimately destroying it,"" a spokesperson for the show said. Christopher Walken (left) with the cast of The Outlaws The Outlaws, written and directed by Stephen Merchant, stars Hollywood veteran Walken as one of a group of minor criminals refurbishing a building for their community service. The last episode sees his character uncover the Banksy rat and two spray cans behind some wooden boards, and ask his supervisor if he should paint over it. The probation officer is looking the other way so doesn't realise it's a Banksy and tells him all graffiti must be painted over, which he does. The rat was painted over for real Banksy works can be worth huge sums, with his infamous shredded Love In The Binfetching Â£16m at auction last month.

Belarus accused of terrorism over migrant crisis,"At least 2,000 people are now gathered at the Belarusian border with Poland Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has accused Belarus of committing ""terrorism"" over its role in an escalating border row between the two countries. ""It's clear that what we are confronted with here is a demonstration of state terrorism,"" he told a news conference. Thousands of migrants are stuck at the border in freezing weather, attempting to enter EU member Poland. The EU has also accused Belarus's leader of provoking the crisis. But Alexander Lukashenko, who won a largely discredited election last year, denies claims Belarus is sending people over the border in revenge for EU sanctions. The migrants - mostly from the Middle East - are mainly young men but there are also women and children. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side, and Belarusian guards on the other. The situation has come to a head this week with repeated attempts to tear down the razor-wire fence erected on Poland's eastern frontier. Mr Morawiecki's latest comments came at a news conference in Warsaw with European Council President Charles Michel. He said he believed the crisis was a result of Mr Lukashenko's ""quiet revenge"" for Poland's support of the Belarusian opposition. Mr Michel said he had come to Warsaw to show the EU's solidarity with Poland. He said the use of men, women and children as tools to achieve political goals was ""shameful and unacceptable"". Aid agencies are only able to help migrants who successfully cross the border into Poland and get beyond the immediate zone ""Sanctions are on the table. We must now co-ordinate with member states to identify most efficient tools"", he told the conference. ""This hybrid attack against Poland and the EU must stop."" He said the EU must decide whether to fund fences by member states in the face of such crises, adding it was legally possible. President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that sanctions would be widened against Belarus next week. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel phoned Mr Putin on Wednesday, asking him to press Belarus to stop the ""instrumentalisation of migrants"", her spokesman said. But Russia said on Wednesday it was ""irresponsible"" for Poland to blame Russia for the crisis. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the EU should provide financial support to Belarus to deal with migrants. Ukraine, which shares a border with Belarus, is doubling the number of border guards on its frontier to prevent migrants from entering the country illegally. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on Thursday. Dozens of Polish police vehicles race to the village of Kuznica where up to 4,000 migrants are effectively trapped on the other side of the border. The area remains out of bounds for media and, crucially, aid agencies - much to their despair. This video can not be played In September Nick Beake met the migrants freezing on the Belarus-Poland border One man we contacted, an Iraqi Kurd, told us they'd endured another night in freezing conditions and asked us in exasperation what sort of life this was. When I then asked what they were all doing for food, he said the Belarusians were providing supplies. But other migrants have also told us the Belarus security forces are also giving out wire-cutters to help break through the fence in places where Poland's numerous guards are thin on the ground. The European Commission says Belarus enticed migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an ""inhuman, gangster-style approach"" and it has listed some 20 countries from which migrants have flown into Minsk, mainly on tourist visas. Poland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. ""Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,"" said 33-year-old Shwan Kurd, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November. ""There's no way to escape,"" he said.

Meghan weighed up calling father 'daddy',"The Duchess of Sussex won a previous court case that publishing the letter was a breach of her privacy The Duchess of Sussex questioned whether she should call her father ""daddy"" in a letter and whether it would ""pull at the heartstrings"" if leaked, the Court of Appeal has heard. The letter is at the centre of a legal battle over privacy between the duchess and publishers of the Mail on Sunday. The paper claimed it was written with an awareness it could be made public. The duchess won a previous court case that found publishing the letter was a misuse of her private information. Associated Newspapers' legal team are seeking to overturn this judgement. They are disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the ""possibility of public consumption"" in mind. The court heard lawyers for the duchess reiterate that this was a ""highly personal"" family letter touching on her private feelings, and that its publication was against the rights to a private life, family life and the protection of private correspondence. In the second day of the appeal hearing, lawyers for the publisher challenged the extent to which it was really a ""private"" letter, sent by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to her estranged father Thomas Markle. The newspaper's lawyers highlighted a witness statement from Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to Meghan and Prince Harry. Mail on Sunday questions 'private' letter Privacy damage 'run deeps', says Meghan Newspaper must publish statement on Meghan case The court heard of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf about the drafting of the letter, sent in August 2018. This included whether it should begin by addressing Mr Markle as ""daddy"". The court heard that the duchess had written: ""Given I've only ever called him 'daddy' it may make sense to open as such, despite him being less than paternal, and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstrings."" Andrew Caldecott, representing the news organisation, quoted Meghan in a further exchange, saying the letter was ""real, honest and factual, and if he leaks it, then that's on his conscience, and at least the world will know the truth. Words I could never voice publicly"". And the court heard, quoted from the exchange, that: ""Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice."" Justin Rushbrooke, representing the Duchess of Sussex, said this was a more straightforward case than might appear from the challenges against it. Extensive parts of a private, family letter had been shared without the consent of the sender, he said. And he told the court that if it had become public, that was because it had been published by the news organisation. In a statement sent to the Press Association, the duchess said she had never expected the letter to be leaked and that it was ""absurd"" to see the recognition that a letter could be leaked as being the same as expecting that to happen. The duchess said that Mr Markle's involvement in media coverage was putting pressure on Prince Harry and the letter was a way of addressing that. ""I felt that, even if my attempt to stop my father talking to the media failed, at least my husband would be able to say to his family that I had done everything I could to stop it,"" said the statement from the duchess. The letter had been sent to Mr Markle a few months after the duchess had married Prince Harry and it challenged her father's dealings with the media. Mr Markle, who was said to be unhappy at other media accounts of his relationship with his daughter, had given the letter to the Mail on Sunday. Lawyers for the newspaper suggested he wanted to challenge a ""false narrative"" of the run-up to his daughter's wedding and that revealing the letter was a form of right of reply. The duchess's legal team is seeking to uphold the finding of the earlier court. Welcoming the earlier ruling, Meghan had said it was a victory against ""dehumanising"" media behaviour. ""The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep,"" she said. The Mail on Sunday faced a requirement to publish a front-page statement on the Duchess of Sussex's case, which has been put on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. The hearing is due to end on Thursday.

Testing could be part of vaccine passport expansion,"People may be able to show a negative lateral flow test result in place of a vaccine passport in the future, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said. He said there was a ""stronger case"" for allowing people to use test results to gain entry to venues if the scheme was widened. The Scottish government is considering the moveamid fears of a surge in Covid-19 cases over winter. Critics have said there is no evidence base for expanding the passport scheme. People over the age of 18 currently need to show proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and large events such as football matches and concerts. Mr Swinney said this could now be expanded to more hospitality and leisure venues with any changes set to be confirmed at the next review of the restrictions on 16 November. Other countries with vaccine certification schemes, such as Wales, allow people to show proof of a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours as an alternative to showing a certificate. Scottish vaccine passport scheme could be expanded What do we know about the vaccine passport? 'I've cancelled plans over vaccine passport error' Asked on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandif this testing alternative would be introduced, Mr Swinney said: ""We didn't do it in the first place because the purpose of applying the vaccination certification scheme was to drive up vaccine certification levels. ""If we're going to apply this in a more widespread level then there is a stronger case for using a negative later flow device test to gain entry."" People who take lateral flow test are asked to register their results online but there is no way of checking an accurate result has been entered. The deputy first minister insisted that no decisions have yet been taken, arguing instead that ministers are simply being open that changes to the passport scheme is a possibility. Asked which parts of hospitality and leisure it could be applied to, Mr Swinney said: ""We've not made any decisions. ""The reason we've not made any decisions is that government has got to be satisfied any decisions it takes are proportionate in the context of the state of the pandemic - that is the legal test we are obliged to follow."" Cinemas and other seated venues could be affected by any change to the Covid vaccine scheme Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was introduced at the start of October and applies to nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event where more than 10,000 people are present. The controversial vaccine passport scheme had no shortage of critics when it was introduced in October including anunsuccessful legal challengemounted by the hospitality industry. John Swinney says its ""core purpose"" was to drive up vaccine uptake, which he argues has been achieved if you look at the jump in vaccination rates among the younger people who are most likely to go to bars and clubs. He said that in September, 53% of 18 to 29-year-olds were vaccinated and by 1 November that had risen to 68%. Now the Scottish government is considering expanding the scheme in a move tied to concerns about a surge in Covid cases over the winter months. The idea has set off alarm bells in parts of the hospitality industry which feels it has been disproportionately affected by the government's Covid-tackling public health measures. It has also raised questions about how an expansion of the certification scheme would work. Proof of vaccination or a negative test is needed in Wales In Wales, its Covid passes are used for entry into nightclubs and this is to beextended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls from 15 November. Their NHS Covid pass shows your vaccination status but also if you have tested negative for Coronavirus in the last 48 hours via a lateral flow test where a person has reported the results. Anyone caught using a fake Covid pass or lateral flow test result faces a fine of up to Â£60. The introduction of lateral flow tests would ""would alleviate some of the problem but it will not solve everything"" says the Scottish Hospitality Group. And the move to start using lateral flow tests would also likely win opposition party support in Holyrood. Opposition politicians have criticised the Scottish government for considering expanding the scheme which they say will be of ""significant concern"" to businesses. Stephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents some of the country's bars, restaurants and clubs, said: ""We expect the Scottish government to work constructively, intensively, and with proper consultation with our industry should there be an extension of vaccine passports to all indoor hospitality venues. ""We would hope that this would include discussion of appropriate government support for additional staffing and costs, with many businesses in the hospitality sector currently struggling to cope with the financial burden of the pandemic as well as an acute recruitment crisis.""

Suspension of NI-EU deal 'may be only option',"UK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said he would not give up until all negotiating possibilities had been exhausted Suspending the Northern Ireland part of the Brexit deal will be the ""only option"" if UK-EU talks fail to resolve problems, Lord Frost has said. The UK's Brexit minister gave an update after almost four weeks of intensive talks to address the standoff. But he said the UK was ""not giving up"" yet and he wished to remain positive. The EU has promised a ""clear response"" if the UK triggers Article 16 - a safeguarding mechanism within the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is a post-Brexit trading arrangement specific to Northern Ireland, but the UK wants changes to the deal it agreed with the EU in 2019. The deal struck two years ago was aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland but critics argue it is disrupting trade and undermining Northern Ireland's position within the UK. Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol is a measure which allows either the UK or the EU to take unilateral action if they believe the arrangement is causing serious problems. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem The UK has been warning since July that it believes the conditions have already been met to trigger Article 16 but is still trying to avoid that outcome through further talks. There is growing speculation that the move could be just weeks away. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic has finished briefing EU ambassadors on the negotiations. Suggestions out of the private meeting are that he did not bring much ""good news"", although hope remained for ""productive"" negotiations. Maros Sefcovic has briefed EU ambassadors on negotiations One diplomat told the BBC's Katya Adler the EU was ""preparing for the triggering of Article 16 by the UK"". ""There is consensus among EU member states that such an arbitrary and unjustified move by the UK will be met with a clear European response,"" they said. Another diplomat suggested Britain's demands on the protocol remained unrealistic. ""The UK wants to eliminate checks altogether and have a system where only goods going through to Ireland are checked, though UK has no idea how we should do that."" Speaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Lord Frost said: ""If the talks do in the end fail, we will of course publish in full our assessment of the EU's proposals and set out why they fall short of a durable settlement, but we will not do so until we have exhausted all the negotiating possibilities."" There is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks. The Irish government says such a move would be ""reckless and irresponsible"", and Maros Sefcovic has warned it could result in ""serious consequences"". Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods - but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. The arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol. Then the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA. It could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation. There is a potentially faster legal track - known as infringement proceedings - which could lead to the UK being fined. Read the full analysis here. The minister argued that triggering Article 16 would be ""wholly consistent"" with the UK's legal obligations even though the EU disputes that position. However, Lord Frost urged the EU to ""stay calm"" and ""turn away from confrontation"" over the protocol. ""If the EU were to choose to react in a disproportionate way, and decide to aggravate the problems in Northern Ireland rather than reduce them, that is of course a matter for them,"" he said. ""But at that point we would be entitled to come to our own judgement about how much value we could attach to their commitment to supporting the peace process and the people of Northern Ireland as against protecting their own interests."" Lord Frost will meet his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic on Friday for a fourth round of discussions. Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he had a ""useful discussion"" with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin. ""Dublin is a key influencer in Brussels. They must use that influence to reach a sensible outcome which is sustainable and can command the support of unionists in Northern Ireland,"" he said. Speaking to the in the DÃ¡il (lower house of parliament) on Wednesday, Mr Martin called on the UK government to ""double down on dialogue"" over the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""Discussions are still ongoing,"" he said. ""I would just sound a note of caution that we don't automatically assume that anything is going to be triggered. ""We don't want a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy either."" He also warned that the move would impact Northern Ireland's dual access to European and UK markets provided under the protocol. Tanaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar said suspending the protocol would be a ""big mistake"" and urged UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to do so. ""It's a mistake to think that, by escalating tensions, by withdrawing from any part of it or trying to withdraw from any part of it, that you'll end up with a better deal,"" he said. ""You won't."" Alliance MP Stephen Farry said triggering Article 16 had become a ""Sword of Damocles"" over negotiations. ""Its [Article 16] use will do nothing to address the issues around the protocol, and will only bring greater instability and uncertainty for Northern Ireland, while sparking wider confrontation with the EU that would only damage the overall UK economy,"" he said. In the US, several senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committeepublished a joint statement,externalcriticising the UK's position on the protocol standoff as ""dangerous"". ""The Good Friday Agreement and broader peace process took patience and time to build, with good faith contributions from the communities in Northern Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and others,"" they said. ""In threatening to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the United Kingdom threatens to not only destabilize trade relations, but also that hard earned peace. ""We call on the UK to abandon this dangerous path, and to commit to implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full."" What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

LiveLiveChina and US agree to 'work together' on climate change2 minutes ago,"China and the US pledge to work together on climate action, saying they recognise ""the urgency of the climate crisis"" The two countries are the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and US climate envoy John Kerry says it marks a ""new step"" The BBC's environment correspondent says regardless of the agreement's contents, it hands COP26 a boost Negotiations are going into overdrive in Glasgow to try and secure an ambitious agreement before COP26 ends on Friday UK PM Boris Johnson earlier urged delegates to ""bridge the gap"" between long-term goals and immediate action to ""keep 1.5 alive"" A draft agreement calls on governments to strengthen their climate targets by the end of 2022, putting pressure on big emitters Saudi Arabia denies it is obstructing progress towards a strong deal, calling such allegations ""a cheat and a lie"" Edited by Marie Jackson We are ending our live coverage of COP26 for the day - but will be back again tomorrow. Wednesday's live page was edited by Lauren Turner and Marie Jackson. Our writers today were Alex Kleiderman, Paul McLaren, Toby Luckhurst, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Max Mazta. It's been a busy day at COP26. Here's what's been happening: The final question is about the US's ability to deliver on its own climate promises under the Paris Agreement. Kerry says: ""The answer is yes we will."" He says the ""aggressive"" $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill just passed will have many of the things the US needs to do to help climate change such as electric charging stations across the country. He says 50% of all the cars sold in the US in 2030 will be electric and by 2035 hopefully all of them. US climate envoy John Kerry cracks a slight joke while commenting on when both countries expect Chinese greenhouse gas emissions to peak. ""President Xi has set a time frame for when he sees a peak. We have had lots of discussions about peaking. ""We peaked out on peaking."" ""We embraced, I think, what we know to be the science,"" he continues, adding that there is a chance that the data is wrong about when emissions will peak. China has said that they expect emissions to peak by 2030, if not before. The next question is from Reuters news agency which asks how the US addressed the issue of China's use of forced labour for building solar panels? He says: ""We are honest about the differences...but that's not my lane here. My job is to be the climate guy and stay focused on trying to move the climate agenda forward."" He says the presidents made it clear when they talked in February that while they have differences, it was important to focus on global crises. Now to questions at the US press conference. The first is whether the deal includes anything on the use of coal in China. John Kerry says China has laid out its current timetable and the things its going to do to reduce emissions. But what this agreement does is underscores that there is a plan in place, he says. He reads what he calls some ""important paragraphs"" about the intention of the two sides to continue concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions - but does not specifically mention coal. He says: ""But the whole point of this is that the steps we are taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us and others to be able to accelerate their efforts."" Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Perhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate actionin the 2020s. If the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical. While China has been reluctant to take action to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action. So the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms. The agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date and what science says is necessary for a safer world. Closing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow. The optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost. ""Now, with this announcement we've arrived at a new step,"" Mr Kerry continues, calling this moment a ""roadmap"" for the future. This statement makes it ""an imperative to co-operate,"" he says, referring to the deal that the US and China have just agreed. The US climate envoy adds that both sides have agreed to ""work together to limit methane emissions"". He said that China's pledge to create ""a comprehensive and ambitious national action plan on methane"" will have a ""significant effect"" on the climate crisis. ""The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done."" He appeals to all countries to work together, as the two largest emitters are doing today, and adds ""that he looks forward to stepping up our work with China"".  John Kerry, the US climate envoy, is speaking in more detail about the US-China climate deal. He says it sets out how together the nations will take action at COP26 as well as in the years to come. He says US President Biden and China's President Xi had a conversation a few weeks ago and they agreed to work together to raise climate ambition. He says the US and Chinese teams have worked together for months and have met 30 times both virtually and in person. They've agreed to a basic framework and shared desire for success on mitigation, adaptation, support and all of the key issues. The deal is a roadmap for our present and future collaboration on this issue, he says. ""We need to do it far faster in this decisive decade - not because China or the US say that we must - but because science says we must,"" he says. The text of the US-China climate deal has just been released. The bilateral statement says both sides ""recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"" and will work to address the issue together. The document says that both sides will ""recall their firm commitment to work together"" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. They also call for ""stepped-up efforts"" to close the ""significant gap"" that remains to achieve that goal. Both sides pledge to co-operate on regulatory standards, the transition to clean energy, de-carbonisation and ""green design and renewable resource utilisation"". They also pledge to tackle methane emissions. China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The deal was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a ""national plan"" to address methane. The document says that both also pledge to form a working group that will meet regularly to discuss climate solutions. We're hearing more from China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua on details of the new US-China declaration. It appears to be quite thin on specific details and concrete targets. Calling climate change an ""existential"" crisis for humanity, Xie says the declaration will address clean energy, clean coal, methane reduction and banning deforestation. China will ""develop a national plan"" on methane, he says, and encourage ""joint research"" on the greenhouse gas. The two sides are also committing to ""strengthen goals"" on deforestation, he adds. ""In areas of climate change there is more agreement between China and US than divergence,"" Xie says.  The US and China have released a rare joint declaration pledging action on climate change. The document, called ""enhancing climate action in the 2020s"", commits the countries to develop long-term strategies to reach net-zero. Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate negotiator, is explaining what's in the statement at a press conference in Glasgow. He says the declaration - agreed this afternoon - commits the two countries to ""concrete measures"" to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming below 2C and ""pursuing efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C by the end of the century. ""We committed to adopt enhanced climate actions  in order to achieve the Paris agreement goal and strengthen its implementation,"" he adds. Some unexpected news this evening. We are now expecting a joint declaration on climate action from China and the US shortly. These two countries are the world's largest emitters of carbon dioxide. A spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation said China's top envoy would speak at 18:00 GMT. It's unclear what will be announced and it looks like even though it's a ""joint declaration"" that the delegations will hold separate press briefings, with the US following at 18:30. We'll bring you the latest as we get it. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent Boris Johnson
called on world leaders to give their negotiating teams in Glasgow more leeway
to reach a deal. He didnât name
any countries as blockers but he seemed to pin the blame for any hold-ups on
richer countries who had ""patted themselves on the back"" after the Paris
climate change agreement was negotiated in 2015 but had ""defaulted"" on their
promises to developing countries since then. He then
clarified that progress basically came down to one thing: money. But he must be
worried about what the current saga around MPs' second jobs is doing to the
host countryâs international reputation, asserting that the UK wasnât corrupt
in response to a journalist who hadnât asked if it was. And he raised
the prospect of what happens at every COP conference happening here  â
negotiations overrunning. He said talks might have to go into âextra timeâ
despite the COP Presidencyâs insistence that they will finish on Friday at 6pm. Here's a quick recap of the main points Boris Johnson made. He admits whether we can keep to the 1.5C temperature rise target is ""in the balance"". During his speech, and in answers to journalists, he also says:  The PM says it is frustrating ""to see countries that have spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back"" for signing that agreement now ""quietly edging towards default"". But Johnson adds that, as seen in Glasgow, the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change. ""It is now within reach,"" he says. He concludes by saying: ""So my question to my fellow world leaders as we enter the last hours of COP26 is: will you help us do that? Will you help us grasp the opportunity or will you stand in the way?"" This video can not be played WATCH: Johnson warns of 'immense' backlash if negotiations fail After his statement pushing for further climate action and taking a handful of questions from journalists, the PM ends his press conference. ""I'm very sorry to tell you I have to go and catch a climate-friendly means of transport back to London,"" he says, giving a thumbs up and leaving the stage. Johnson, who went to Glasgow today by train, faced criticism last week for flying back from the summit. Jitendra Joshi from AFP asks the PM what tangible difference his presence at the summit has made and if positive at all why doesn't he stay until the end of get the ball over the line. And he asks if the PM is confident that his own actions as an MP and minister would pass any standards investigation. The PM says all his declarations conform to the rules and are there to be studied. He says what he's tried to do at COP26 today is to listen to what the NGOs have to say and speak to ministerial negotiating teams and encourage them to make progress. They've been working unbelievably hard but progress will depend on finance, he says. The Telegraph newspaper asks Mr Johnson what his message would be to voters about headlines saying Tory sleaze has
returned. On COP, the newspaper asks if he has any messages for specific countries about their responsibilities and actions at the conference. ""I genuinely
believe the UK is not remotely a corrupt country, nor do I believe our institutions
are corrupt,"" Johnson says. ""We have a very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media - and I think everyone can see that."" Johnson then adds he doesn't want to single out any country for ""chivvying and hectoring"". But he does call on leaders to call up their negotiators and urge them ""to make progress"". Boris Johnson is asked by ITV's Robert Peston about what can be done in the remaining days of the conference to keep the ambition of capping the global temperature rise at 1.5C alive. The prime minister says ""we're now finding things tough"" after an initial surge of progress  in the first few days of the conference. ""But that doesn't mean it's impossible,"" he says of the temperature goal, again urging world leaders to call their negotiators with more leverage power. ""I still think we can achieve it but I'm not going to pretend to you - by any means - that it is a done deal,"" he adds. Sky's political editor Beth Rigby asks if the PM accepts that the summit could end up as the start of many months of negotiations. Johnson says the summit is ""not going to fix it in one go, we are not going to arrest climate change right here, right now"". But if things go well in the remaining hours, there is the possibility that we will come away from this with the first genuine roadmap to tackle climate change, he says. Rigby also asks if Johnson believes MPs have been putting their political roles first. He says he will not comment on individual cases but, those who do break the rules and do not put constituents first, should face appropriate sanctions and punishment. Â© 2025 BBC.

COP26 draft deal calls for stronger carbon targets,"Countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit. The document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming. It also says countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of next year. Critics have said the draft pact does not go far enough but others welcomed its focus on the 1.5C target. The document, which has been published by the UK COP26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. COP26 president Alok Sharma said he expected ""near final texts"" to be published overnight, adding that the agreement that comes out of the conference would ""set the future for our children and grandchildren"". The horse trading begins as first COP26 text is released World headed for 2.4C warming despite COP - report Rich countries 'push back' on climate loss payment Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century. With the world off track to meet the goal, the draft document urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C or 1.5C by the end of 2022. Loss and damage - an issue of key importance to the developing world - has been included in the draft, calling for more support from developed countries and other organisations to address the damage caused by extreme weather and rising seas in vulnerable nations. It also recognises that more finance is needed for developing countries beyond the long-promised $100bn a year by 2020, which will not be delivered until at least 2022. But campaigners say these parts of the text are weak and essentially a ""box ticking exercise"". The document also calls on countries to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue. It also asks UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to convene world leaders in 2023 to consider how efforts to reach targets for 2030 are shaping up. Some 200 countries are meeting at COP to try to keep the lid on rising temperatures. Today, a document that forms the basis of what they could sign up to in Glasgow has been released by the hosts of the conference, the UK presidency. It sums up everything that has been discussed so far, but is very much a draft. There are bits missing and a number of contentious issues, which could get strengthened or watered down over the next few days. The reference to phasing out fossil fuels will undoubtedly be opposed by some nations. And countries vulnerable to the most destructive effects of climate change will want assurances that more money is coming their way to help protect their people against rising sea levels, drought and storms. At COP26 nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and getting a consensus among so many countries is never easy. COP veterans expect ""one hell of a fight"" ahead - with all to play for in the next few days. The World Wide Fund for Nature said the call for enhanced 2030 targets and references to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, among other proposals, ""must stick"". Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF Global Lead Climate & Energy said it was essential ministers worked to include ""a clear plan to close the 2030 ambition gap and the timeframe to do this"", adding that the draft text ""must be a floor not a ceiling"". But there have been warnings that there would be opposition to the idea of coming back with new plans next year. David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute, said: ""The Saudis and Russians have been quite clear on that, others have been less blunt."" He added many of the other countries pushing back were vulnerable and either did not produce a large percentage of global emissions or had ""very limited resources to develop nationally-determined contributions and then to implement them"". The Alliance of Small Island States, whose members are among the nations least responsible for climate change, said the text needed to be strengthened in ""key areas"" to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable countries, particularly on finance. And Jennifer Morgan, from Greenpeace International, said the draft deal was ""not a plan to solve the climate crisis"" but an agreement that ""we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to COP26 on Wednesday Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to ""take charge of a summit that is not on track to deliver"". ""We are miles off where we need to be in the halving of emissions required by 2030,"" he said. ""It's time the government faced this truth, stopped the greenwash, and put maximum pressure on all parties to step up and agree a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive."" Ina video made on the train up to Glasgow,externalas the UK prime minister returned to COP26, Boris Johnson said all countries had made ""significant progress"" in the last few days but there was ""still a long way to go"". No 10 said that Mr Johnson spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia earlier on Wednesday about the country's climate pledges and the need to make ""progress in negotiations"" taking place in Glasgow. Saudi Arabia was among a number of countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels,according to leaked documents. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of COP26, including on finalising the outstanding elements of the Paris rulebook. ""The prime minister said all countries needed to come to the table with increased ambition if we are to keep the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive."" Research published at the summit on Tuesday indicated the short-term plans put in place by countries would see a rise of 2.4C. While about 140 nations have pledged to reach net zero emissions by around the middle of the century, scientists have said their short-term plans for 2030 are not strong enough to limit the rise in temperatures.

Horse trading starts as draft released,"The UK presidency team have set out an ambitious stall in their first attempt to capture progress here at COP26. As well as the specific items mentioned in the document, it also gives us a sense of how the negotiations are going more generally. It's clear that there's a sense of urgency, and a willingness to go high on the key question of cutting carbon more rapidly. If this idea survives the next couple of days, then Glasgow may well be seen as a success. But there's a long way to go until the final gavel comes down. The idea of getting countries to come back more regularly started with the most vulnerable nations. COP26: Time to sober up This meeting floated the idea of countries coming back with new plans every year - and this draft nods to that by asking everyone to come back next year with a new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which outlines their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But there are some interesting wrinkles in that request. Parties are urged to come back in 2022 with plans that ""align with the Paris temperature goal"". Which one do they mean - 1.5C or 2C? That will need clarifying in the hours and days ahead. The UK have attempted to copper-fasten the idea of rapid improvement in national plans by asking all countries to attend a high-level ministerial meeting on climate change every year. They've also asked the UN Secretary-General to convene a world leaders meeting in 2023, just ahead of a global stock-take, which will examine how countries are performing on restricting emissions. That all sounds like a nice day out for presidents and prime ministers, but doesn't commit them to do anything. There is also some quite progressive language in this draft decision that will hearten campaigners, specifically the mention of coal. According to seasoned observer this is the first mention of the ""c"" word in a UN climate change document. However, before everyone gets carried away, the give and take nature of the drafting process means that there is no end date given, meaning it is an aspiration and not a timeline. The same paragraph also mentions the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, but there's no specific mention of oil and gas. Is that to try and keep Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers on board? There is some nice language on doubling the amount of finance given for adaptation. But there's no baseline against which to measure the increase and no timeline for delivery. The issue of loss and damage finally gets its own significant section in the draft decision. This is the idea that rich nations bear a historical responsibility for global warming and should compensate poorer ones for the harms visited on them. Its inclusion will hearten many developing nations, which have been asking for a clear financial commitment to tackle the impacts of climate change that they can't adapt to. However, the document is very woolly on this question. Now that the UK has played its main negotiating card, much will likely change over the next two days of hardball negotiations. There will be pressure from countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and India to water down the idea of coming back next year with a new plan. Strangely there are many developing nations who might also oppose this - the time, effort and costs associated with a new NDC should not be underestimated. Developing nations will also seek more clarity on two key issues. They will want a strengthening of the language around finance so that a new goal for 2025 represents a significant increase on the much derided $100bn. They will also want to see a stronger emphasis on spending up to half that money on adaptation. The other question is over the loss and damage issue. Right now, the UN's response to this amounts to a single website for countries affected. Emerging economies will want to see this strengthened in the draft decision, with a new secretariat dedicated to the question - and most importantly a separate stream of funding.

What do scientists want?,"COP26 is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week. The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful. Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. What does net zero mean? What's been agreed at COP26 so far? What is the Paris climate agreement? ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters,such as ChinaandSaudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050.One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later. The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Prof Martin Siegert: ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050"" Last week at COP, there were announcements oncuts to coalandmethane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne. And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets. Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrentlytrying to open a new oil fieldat the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible."" One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. The summit is moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour."" COP26: Time to sober up What action are the biggest carbon polluters taking? There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure."" The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. TheUS is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important. Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. Rich countries 'push back' on climate loss payment Life where it's too hot to work, too hot to sleep ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods."" There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed toa major UN report on climate change, published this year. ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""

"LiveLiveDo not sit on your hands, Johnson tells COP263 minutes ago","China and the US pledge to work together on climate action, saying they recognise ""the urgency of the climate crisis"" The two countries are the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and US climate envoy John Kerry says it marks a ""new step"" The BBC's environment correspondent says regardless of the agreement's contents, it hands COP26 a boost Negotiations are going into overdrive in Glasgow to try and secure an ambitious agreement before COP26 ends on Friday UK PM Boris Johnson earlier urged delegates to ""bridge the gap"" between long-term goals and immediate action to ""keep 1.5 alive"" A draft agreement calls on governments to strengthen their climate targets by the end of 2022, putting pressure on big emitters Saudi Arabia denies it is obstructing progress towards a strong deal, calling such allegations ""a cheat and a lie"" Edited by Marie Jackson We are ending our live coverage of COP26 for the day - but will be back again tomorrow. Wednesday's live page was edited by Lauren Turner and Marie Jackson. Our writers today were Alex Kleiderman, Paul McLaren, Toby Luckhurst, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Max Mazta. It's been a busy day at COP26. Here's what's been happening: The final question is about the US's ability to deliver on its own climate promises under the Paris Agreement. Kerry says: ""The answer is yes we will."" He says the ""aggressive"" $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill just passed will have many of the things the US needs to do to help climate change such as electric charging stations across the country. He says 50% of all the cars sold in the US in 2030 will be electric and by 2035 hopefully all of them. US climate envoy John Kerry cracks a slight joke while commenting on when both countries expect Chinese greenhouse gas emissions to peak. ""President Xi has set a time frame for when he sees a peak. We have had lots of discussions about peaking. ""We peaked out on peaking."" ""We embraced, I think, what we know to be the science,"" he continues, adding that there is a chance that the data is wrong about when emissions will peak. China has said that they expect emissions to peak by 2030, if not before. The next question is from Reuters news agency which asks how the US addressed the issue of China's use of forced labour for building solar panels? He says: ""We are honest about the differences...but that's not my lane here. My job is to be the climate guy and stay focused on trying to move the climate agenda forward."" He says the presidents made it clear when they talked in February that while they have differences, it was important to focus on global crises. Now to questions at the US press conference. The first is whether the deal includes anything on the use of coal in China. John Kerry says China has laid out its current timetable and the things its going to do to reduce emissions. But what this agreement does is underscores that there is a plan in place, he says. He reads what he calls some ""important paragraphs"" about the intention of the two sides to continue concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions - but does not specifically mention coal. He says: ""But the whole point of this is that the steps we are taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us and others to be able to accelerate their efforts."" Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Perhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate actionin the 2020s. If the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical. While China has been reluctant to take action to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action. So the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms. The agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date and what science says is necessary for a safer world. Closing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow. The optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost. ""Now, with this announcement we've arrived at a new step,"" Mr Kerry continues, calling this moment a ""roadmap"" for the future. This statement makes it ""an imperative to co-operate,"" he says, referring to the deal that the US and China have just agreed. The US climate envoy adds that both sides have agreed to ""work together to limit methane emissions"". He said that China's pledge to create ""a comprehensive and ambitious national action plan on methane"" will have a ""significant effect"" on the climate crisis. ""The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done."" He appeals to all countries to work together, as the two largest emitters are doing today, and adds ""that he looks forward to stepping up our work with China"".  John Kerry, the US climate envoy, is speaking in more detail about the US-China climate deal. He says it sets out how together the nations will take action at COP26 as well as in the years to come. He says US President Biden and China's President Xi had a conversation a few weeks ago and they agreed to work together to raise climate ambition. He says the US and Chinese teams have worked together for months and have met 30 times both virtually and in person. They've agreed to a basic framework and shared desire for success on mitigation, adaptation, support and all of the key issues. The deal is a roadmap for our present and future collaboration on this issue, he says. ""We need to do it far faster in this decisive decade - not because China or the US say that we must - but because science says we must,"" he says. The text of the US-China climate deal has just been released. The bilateral statement says both sides ""recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"" and will work to address the issue together. The document says that both sides will ""recall their firm commitment to work together"" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. They also call for ""stepped-up efforts"" to close the ""significant gap"" that remains to achieve that goal. Both sides pledge to co-operate on regulatory standards, the transition to clean energy, de-carbonisation and ""green design and renewable resource utilisation"". They also pledge to tackle methane emissions. China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The deal was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a ""national plan"" to address methane. The document says that both also pledge to form a working group that will meet regularly to discuss climate solutions. We're hearing more from China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua on details of the new US-China declaration. It appears to be quite thin on specific details and concrete targets. Calling climate change an ""existential"" crisis for humanity, Xie says the declaration will address clean energy, clean coal, methane reduction and banning deforestation. China will ""develop a national plan"" on methane, he says, and encourage ""joint research"" on the greenhouse gas. The two sides are also committing to ""strengthen goals"" on deforestation, he adds. ""In areas of climate change there is more agreement between China and US than divergence,"" Xie says.  The US and China have released a rare joint declaration pledging action on climate change. The document, called ""enhancing climate action in the 2020s"", commits the countries to develop long-term strategies to reach net-zero. Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate negotiator, is explaining what's in the statement at a press conference in Glasgow. He says the declaration - agreed this afternoon - commits the two countries to ""concrete measures"" to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming below 2C and ""pursuing efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C by the end of the century. ""We committed to adopt enhanced climate actions  in order to achieve the Paris agreement goal and strengthen its implementation,"" he adds. Some unexpected news this evening. We are now expecting a joint declaration on climate action from China and the US shortly. These two countries are the world's largest emitters of carbon dioxide. A spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation said China's top envoy would speak at 18:00 GMT. It's unclear what will be announced and it looks like even though it's a ""joint declaration"" that the delegations will hold separate press briefings, with the US following at 18:30. We'll bring you the latest as we get it. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent Boris Johnson
called on world leaders to give their negotiating teams in Glasgow more leeway
to reach a deal. He didnât name
any countries as blockers but he seemed to pin the blame for any hold-ups on
richer countries who had ""patted themselves on the back"" after the Paris
climate change agreement was negotiated in 2015 but had ""defaulted"" on their
promises to developing countries since then. He then
clarified that progress basically came down to one thing: money. But he must be
worried about what the current saga around MPs' second jobs is doing to the
host countryâs international reputation, asserting that the UK wasnât corrupt
in response to a journalist who hadnât asked if it was. And he raised
the prospect of what happens at every COP conference happening here  â
negotiations overrunning. He said talks might have to go into âextra timeâ
despite the COP Presidencyâs insistence that they will finish on Friday at 6pm. Here's a quick recap of the main points Boris Johnson made. He admits whether we can keep to the 1.5C temperature rise target is ""in the balance"". During his speech, and in answers to journalists, he also says:  The PM says it is frustrating ""to see countries that have spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back"" for signing that agreement now ""quietly edging towards default"". But Johnson adds that, as seen in Glasgow, the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change. ""It is now within reach,"" he says. He concludes by saying: ""So my question to my fellow world leaders as we enter the last hours of COP26 is: will you help us do that? Will you help us grasp the opportunity or will you stand in the way?"" This video can not be played WATCH: Johnson warns of 'immense' backlash if negotiations fail After his statement pushing for further climate action and taking a handful of questions from journalists, the PM ends his press conference. ""I'm very sorry to tell you I have to go and catch a climate-friendly means of transport back to London,"" he says, giving a thumbs up and leaving the stage. Johnson, who went to Glasgow today by train, faced criticism last week for flying back from the summit. Jitendra Joshi from AFP asks the PM what tangible difference his presence at the summit has made and if positive at all why doesn't he stay until the end of get the ball over the line. And he asks if the PM is confident that his own actions as an MP and minister would pass any standards investigation. The PM says all his declarations conform to the rules and are there to be studied. He says what he's tried to do at COP26 today is to listen to what the NGOs have to say and speak to ministerial negotiating teams and encourage them to make progress. They've been working unbelievably hard but progress will depend on finance, he says. The Telegraph newspaper asks Mr Johnson what his message would be to voters about headlines saying Tory sleaze has
returned. On COP, the newspaper asks if he has any messages for specific countries about their responsibilities and actions at the conference. ""I genuinely
believe the UK is not remotely a corrupt country, nor do I believe our institutions
are corrupt,"" Johnson says. ""We have a very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media - and I think everyone can see that."" Johnson then adds he doesn't want to single out any country for ""chivvying and hectoring"". But he does call on leaders to call up their negotiators and urge them ""to make progress"". Boris Johnson is asked by ITV's Robert Peston about what can be done in the remaining days of the conference to keep the ambition of capping the global temperature rise at 1.5C alive. The prime minister says ""we're now finding things tough"" after an initial surge of progress  in the first few days of the conference. ""But that doesn't mean it's impossible,"" he says of the temperature goal, again urging world leaders to call their negotiators with more leverage power. ""I still think we can achieve it but I'm not going to pretend to you - by any means - that it is a done deal,"" he adds. Sky's political editor Beth Rigby asks if the PM accepts that the summit could end up as the start of many months of negotiations. Johnson says the summit is ""not going to fix it in one go, we are not going to arrest climate change right here, right now"". But if things go well in the remaining hours, there is the possibility that we will come away from this with the first genuine roadmap to tackle climate change, he says. Rigby also asks if Johnson believes MPs have been putting their political roles first. He says he will not comment on individual cases but, those who do break the rules and do not put constituents first, should face appropriate sanctions and punishment. Â© 2025 BBC.

Suspension of NI-EU deal 'may be only option'The UK's Brexit minister gave an update after talks to address issues with the trade arrangement.Northern Ireland,"UK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said he would not give up until all negotiating possibilities had been exhausted Suspending the Northern Ireland part of the Brexit deal will be the ""only option"" if UK-EU talks fail to resolve problems, Lord Frost has said. The UK's Brexit minister gave an update after almost four weeks of intensive talks to address the standoff. But he said the UK was ""not giving up"" yet and he wished to remain positive. The EU has promised a ""clear response"" if the UK triggers Article 16 - a safeguarding mechanism within the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is a post-Brexit trading arrangement specific to Northern Ireland, but the UK wants changes to the deal it agreed with the EU in 2019. The deal struck two years ago was aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland but critics argue it is disrupting trade and undermining Northern Ireland's position within the UK. Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol is a measure which allows either the UK or the EU to take unilateral action if they believe the arrangement is causing serious problems. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem The UK has been warning since July that it believes the conditions have already been met to trigger Article 16 but is still trying to avoid that outcome through further talks. There is growing speculation that the move could be just weeks away. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic has finished briefing EU ambassadors on the negotiations. Suggestions out of the private meeting are that he did not bring much ""good news"", although hope remained for ""productive"" negotiations. Maros Sefcovic has briefed EU ambassadors on negotiations One diplomat told the BBC's Katya Adler the EU was ""preparing for the triggering of Article 16 by the UK"". ""There is consensus among EU member states that such an arbitrary and unjustified move by the UK will be met with a clear European response,"" they said. Another diplomat suggested Britain's demands on the protocol remained unrealistic. ""The UK wants to eliminate checks altogether and have a system where only goods going through to Ireland are checked, though UK has no idea how we should do that."" Speaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Lord Frost said: ""If the talks do in the end fail, we will of course publish in full our assessment of the EU's proposals and set out why they fall short of a durable settlement, but we will not do so until we have exhausted all the negotiating possibilities."" There is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks. The Irish government says such a move would be ""reckless and irresponsible"", and Maros Sefcovic has warned it could result in ""serious consequences"". Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods - but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. The arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol. Then the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA. It could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation. There is a potentially faster legal track - known as infringement proceedings - which could lead to the UK being fined. Read the full analysis here. The minister argued that triggering Article 16 would be ""wholly consistent"" with the UK's legal obligations even though the EU disputes that position. However, Lord Frost urged the EU to ""stay calm"" and ""turn away from confrontation"" over the protocol. ""If the EU were to choose to react in a disproportionate way, and decide to aggravate the problems in Northern Ireland rather than reduce them, that is of course a matter for them,"" he said. ""But at that point we would be entitled to come to our own judgement about how much value we could attach to their commitment to supporting the peace process and the people of Northern Ireland as against protecting their own interests."" Lord Frost will meet his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic on Friday for a fourth round of discussions. Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he had a ""useful discussion"" with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin. ""Dublin is a key influencer in Brussels. They must use that influence to reach a sensible outcome which is sustainable and can command the support of unionists in Northern Ireland,"" he said. Speaking to the in the DÃ¡il (lower house of parliament) on Wednesday, Mr Martin called on the UK government to ""double down on dialogue"" over the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""Discussions are still ongoing,"" he said. ""I would just sound a note of caution that we don't automatically assume that anything is going to be triggered. ""We don't want a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy either."" He also warned that the move would impact Northern Ireland's dual access to European and UK markets provided under the protocol. Tanaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar said suspending the protocol would be a ""big mistake"" and urged UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to do so. ""It's a mistake to think that, by escalating tensions, by withdrawing from any part of it or trying to withdraw from any part of it, that you'll end up with a better deal,"" he said. ""You won't."" Alliance MP Stephen Farry said triggering Article 16 had become a ""Sword of Damocles"" over negotiations. ""Its [Article 16] use will do nothing to address the issues around the protocol, and will only bring greater instability and uncertainty for Northern Ireland, while sparking wider confrontation with the EU that would only damage the overall UK economy,"" he said. In the US, several senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committeepublished a joint statement,externalcriticising the UK's position on the protocol standoff as ""dangerous"". ""The Good Friday Agreement and broader peace process took patience and time to build, with good faith contributions from the communities in Northern Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and others,"" they said. ""In threatening to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the United Kingdom threatens to not only destabilize trade relations, but also that hard earned peace. ""We call on the UK to abandon this dangerous path, and to commit to implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full."" What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

LiveLiveSaudi Arabia denies obstructing climate talks8 minutes ago,"China and the US pledge to work together on climate action, saying they recognise ""the urgency of the climate crisis"" The two countries are the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and US climate envoy John Kerry says it marks a ""new step"" The BBC's environment correspondent says regardless of the agreement's contents, it hands COP26 a boost Negotiations are going into overdrive in Glasgow to try and secure an ambitious agreement before COP26 ends on Friday UK PM Boris Johnson earlier urged delegates to ""bridge the gap"" between long-term goals and immediate action to ""keep 1.5 alive"" A draft agreement calls on governments to strengthen their climate targets by the end of 2022, putting pressure on big emitters Saudi Arabia denies it is obstructing progress towards a strong deal, calling such allegations ""a cheat and a lie"" Edited by Marie Jackson We are ending our live coverage of COP26 for the day - but will be back again tomorrow. Wednesday's live page was edited by Lauren Turner and Marie Jackson. Our writers today were Alex Kleiderman, Paul McLaren, Toby Luckhurst, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Max Mazta. It's been a busy day at COP26. Here's what's been happening: The final question is about the US's ability to deliver on its own climate promises under the Paris Agreement. Kerry says: ""The answer is yes we will."" He says the ""aggressive"" $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill just passed will have many of the things the US needs to do to help climate change such as electric charging stations across the country. He says 50% of all the cars sold in the US in 2030 will be electric and by 2035 hopefully all of them. US climate envoy John Kerry cracks a slight joke while commenting on when both countries expect Chinese greenhouse gas emissions to peak. ""President Xi has set a time frame for when he sees a peak. We have had lots of discussions about peaking. ""We peaked out on peaking."" ""We embraced, I think, what we know to be the science,"" he continues, adding that there is a chance that the data is wrong about when emissions will peak. China has said that they expect emissions to peak by 2030, if not before. The next question is from Reuters news agency which asks how the US addressed the issue of China's use of forced labour for building solar panels? He says: ""We are honest about the differences...but that's not my lane here. My job is to be the climate guy and stay focused on trying to move the climate agenda forward."" He says the presidents made it clear when they talked in February that while they have differences, it was important to focus on global crises. Now to questions at the US press conference. The first is whether the deal includes anything on the use of coal in China. John Kerry says China has laid out its current timetable and the things its going to do to reduce emissions. But what this agreement does is underscores that there is a plan in place, he says. He reads what he calls some ""important paragraphs"" about the intention of the two sides to continue concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions - but does not specifically mention coal. He says: ""But the whole point of this is that the steps we are taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us and others to be able to accelerate their efforts."" Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Perhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate actionin the 2020s. If the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical. While China has been reluctant to take action to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action. So the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms. The agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date and what science says is necessary for a safer world. Closing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow. The optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost. ""Now, with this announcement we've arrived at a new step,"" Mr Kerry continues, calling this moment a ""roadmap"" for the future. This statement makes it ""an imperative to co-operate,"" he says, referring to the deal that the US and China have just agreed. The US climate envoy adds that both sides have agreed to ""work together to limit methane emissions"". He said that China's pledge to create ""a comprehensive and ambitious national action plan on methane"" will have a ""significant effect"" on the climate crisis. ""The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done."" He appeals to all countries to work together, as the two largest emitters are doing today, and adds ""that he looks forward to stepping up our work with China"".  John Kerry, the US climate envoy, is speaking in more detail about the US-China climate deal. He says it sets out how together the nations will take action at COP26 as well as in the years to come. He says US President Biden and China's President Xi had a conversation a few weeks ago and they agreed to work together to raise climate ambition. He says the US and Chinese teams have worked together for months and have met 30 times both virtually and in person. They've agreed to a basic framework and shared desire for success on mitigation, adaptation, support and all of the key issues. The deal is a roadmap for our present and future collaboration on this issue, he says. ""We need to do it far faster in this decisive decade - not because China or the US say that we must - but because science says we must,"" he says. The text of the US-China climate deal has just been released. The bilateral statement says both sides ""recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"" and will work to address the issue together. The document says that both sides will ""recall their firm commitment to work together"" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. They also call for ""stepped-up efforts"" to close the ""significant gap"" that remains to achieve that goal. Both sides pledge to co-operate on regulatory standards, the transition to clean energy, de-carbonisation and ""green design and renewable resource utilisation"". They also pledge to tackle methane emissions. China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The deal was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a ""national plan"" to address methane. The document says that both also pledge to form a working group that will meet regularly to discuss climate solutions. We're hearing more from China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua on details of the new US-China declaration. It appears to be quite thin on specific details and concrete targets. Calling climate change an ""existential"" crisis for humanity, Xie says the declaration will address clean energy, clean coal, methane reduction and banning deforestation. China will ""develop a national plan"" on methane, he says, and encourage ""joint research"" on the greenhouse gas. The two sides are also committing to ""strengthen goals"" on deforestation, he adds. ""In areas of climate change there is more agreement between China and US than divergence,"" Xie says.  The US and China have released a rare joint declaration pledging action on climate change. The document, called ""enhancing climate action in the 2020s"", commits the countries to develop long-term strategies to reach net-zero. Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate negotiator, is explaining what's in the statement at a press conference in Glasgow. He says the declaration - agreed this afternoon - commits the two countries to ""concrete measures"" to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming below 2C and ""pursuing efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C by the end of the century. ""We committed to adopt enhanced climate actions  in order to achieve the Paris agreement goal and strengthen its implementation,"" he adds. Some unexpected news this evening. We are now expecting a joint declaration on climate action from China and the US shortly. These two countries are the world's largest emitters of carbon dioxide. A spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation said China's top envoy would speak at 18:00 GMT. It's unclear what will be announced and it looks like even though it's a ""joint declaration"" that the delegations will hold separate press briefings, with the US following at 18:30. We'll bring you the latest as we get it. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent Boris Johnson
called on world leaders to give their negotiating teams in Glasgow more leeway
to reach a deal. He didnât name
any countries as blockers but he seemed to pin the blame for any hold-ups on
richer countries who had ""patted themselves on the back"" after the Paris
climate change agreement was negotiated in 2015 but had ""defaulted"" on their
promises to developing countries since then. He then
clarified that progress basically came down to one thing: money. But he must be
worried about what the current saga around MPs' second jobs is doing to the
host countryâs international reputation, asserting that the UK wasnât corrupt
in response to a journalist who hadnât asked if it was. And he raised
the prospect of what happens at every COP conference happening here  â
negotiations overrunning. He said talks might have to go into âextra timeâ
despite the COP Presidencyâs insistence that they will finish on Friday at 6pm. Here's a quick recap of the main points Boris Johnson made. He admits whether we can keep to the 1.5C temperature rise target is ""in the balance"". During his speech, and in answers to journalists, he also says:  The PM says it is frustrating ""to see countries that have spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back"" for signing that agreement now ""quietly edging towards default"". But Johnson adds that, as seen in Glasgow, the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change. ""It is now within reach,"" he says. He concludes by saying: ""So my question to my fellow world leaders as we enter the last hours of COP26 is: will you help us do that? Will you help us grasp the opportunity or will you stand in the way?"" This video can not be played WATCH: Johnson warns of 'immense' backlash if negotiations fail After his statement pushing for further climate action and taking a handful of questions from journalists, the PM ends his press conference. ""I'm very sorry to tell you I have to go and catch a climate-friendly means of transport back to London,"" he says, giving a thumbs up and leaving the stage. Johnson, who went to Glasgow today by train, faced criticism last week for flying back from the summit. Jitendra Joshi from AFP asks the PM what tangible difference his presence at the summit has made and if positive at all why doesn't he stay until the end of get the ball over the line. And he asks if the PM is confident that his own actions as an MP and minister would pass any standards investigation. The PM says all his declarations conform to the rules and are there to be studied. He says what he's tried to do at COP26 today is to listen to what the NGOs have to say and speak to ministerial negotiating teams and encourage them to make progress. They've been working unbelievably hard but progress will depend on finance, he says. The Telegraph newspaper asks Mr Johnson what his message would be to voters about headlines saying Tory sleaze has
returned. On COP, the newspaper asks if he has any messages for specific countries about their responsibilities and actions at the conference. ""I genuinely
believe the UK is not remotely a corrupt country, nor do I believe our institutions
are corrupt,"" Johnson says. ""We have a very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media - and I think everyone can see that."" Johnson then adds he doesn't want to single out any country for ""chivvying and hectoring"". But he does call on leaders to call up their negotiators and urge them ""to make progress"". Boris Johnson is asked by ITV's Robert Peston about what can be done in the remaining days of the conference to keep the ambition of capping the global temperature rise at 1.5C alive. The prime minister says ""we're now finding things tough"" after an initial surge of progress  in the first few days of the conference. ""But that doesn't mean it's impossible,"" he says of the temperature goal, again urging world leaders to call their negotiators with more leverage power. ""I still think we can achieve it but I'm not going to pretend to you - by any means - that it is a done deal,"" he adds. Sky's political editor Beth Rigby asks if the PM accepts that the summit could end up as the start of many months of negotiations. Johnson says the summit is ""not going to fix it in one go, we are not going to arrest climate change right here, right now"". But if things go well in the remaining hours, there is the possibility that we will come away from this with the first genuine roadmap to tackle climate change, he says.

COP26 draft deal calls for stronger carbon targetsThe document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming.,"Countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit. The document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming. It also says countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of next year. Critics have said the draft pact does not go far enough but others welcomed its focus on the 1.5C target. The document, which has been published by the UK COP26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. COP26 president Alok Sharma said he expected ""near final texts"" to be published overnight, adding that the agreement that comes out of the conference would ""set the future for our children and grandchildren"". The horse trading begins as first COP26 text is released World headed for 2.4C warming despite COP - report Rich countries 'push back' on climate loss payment Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century. With the world off track to meet the goal, the draft document urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C or 1.5C by the end of 2022. Loss and damage - an issue of key importance to the developing world - has been included in the draft, calling for more support from developed countries and other organisations to address the damage caused by extreme weather and rising seas in vulnerable nations. It also recognises that more finance is needed for developing countries beyond the long-promised $100bn a year by 2020, which will not be delivered until at least 2022. But campaigners say these parts of the text are weak and essentially a ""box ticking exercise"". The document also calls on countries to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue. It also asks UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to convene world leaders in 2023 to consider how efforts to reach targets for 2030 are shaping up. Some 200 countries are meeting at COP to try to keep the lid on rising temperatures. Today, a document that forms the basis of what they could sign up to in Glasgow has been released by the hosts of the conference, the UK presidency. It sums up everything that has been discussed so far, but is very much a draft. There are bits missing and a number of contentious issues, which could get strengthened or watered down over the next few days. The reference to phasing out fossil fuels will undoubtedly be opposed by some nations. And countries vulnerable to the most destructive effects of climate change will want assurances that more money is coming their way to help protect their people against rising sea levels, drought and storms. At COP26 nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and getting a consensus among so many countries is never easy. COP veterans expect ""one hell of a fight"" ahead - with all to play for in the next few days. The World Wide Fund for Nature said the call for enhanced 2030 targets and references to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, among other proposals, ""must stick"". Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF Global Lead Climate & Energy said it was essential ministers worked to include ""a clear plan to close the 2030 ambition gap and the timeframe to do this"", adding that the draft text ""must be a floor not a ceiling"". But there have been warnings that there would be opposition to the idea of coming back with new plans next year. David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute, said: ""The Saudis and Russians have been quite clear on that, others have been less blunt."" He added many of the other countries pushing back were vulnerable and either did not produce a large percentage of global emissions or had ""very limited resources to develop nationally-determined contributions and then to implement them"". The Alliance of Small Island States, whose members are among the nations least responsible for climate change, said the text needed to be strengthened in ""key areas"" to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable countries, particularly on finance. And Jennifer Morgan, from Greenpeace International, said the draft deal was ""not a plan to solve the climate crisis"" but an agreement that ""we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to COP26 on Wednesday Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to ""take charge of a summit that is not on track to deliver"". ""We are miles off where we need to be in the halving of emissions required by 2030,"" he said. ""It's time the government faced this truth, stopped the greenwash, and put maximum pressure on all parties to step up and agree a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive."" Ina video made on the train up to Glasgow,externalas the UK prime minister returned to COP26, Boris Johnson said all countries had made ""significant progress"" in the last few days but there was ""still a long way to go"". No 10 said that Mr Johnson spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia earlier on Wednesday about the country's climate pledges and the need to make ""progress in negotiations"" taking place in Glasgow. Saudi Arabia was among a number of countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels,according to leaked documents. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of COP26, including on finalising the outstanding elements of the Paris rulebook. ""The prime minister said all countries needed to come to the table with increased ambition if we are to keep the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive."" Research published at the summit on Tuesday indicated the short-term plans put in place by countries would see a rise of 2.4C. While about 140 nations have pledged to reach net zero emissions by around the middle of the century, scientists have said their short-term plans for 2030 are not strong enough to limit the rise in temperatures.

Afghan army 'rife with ghost soldiers' before fallÂ,"Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in August Afghanistan's ex-finance minister has blamed the government's fall on corrupt officials who invented ""ghost soldiers"" and took payments from the Taliban. Khalid Payenda told the BBC that most of the 300,000 troops and police on the government's books did not exist. He said phantom personnel were added to official lists so that generals could pocket their wages. The Taliban rapidly seized control of Afghanistan in August, as US forces withdrew after 20 years in the country. Mr Payenda, who resigned and left Afghanistan as the Islamist group advanced, said records showing that security forces greatly outnumbered the Taliban were incorrect. ""The way the accountability was done, you would ask the chief in that province how many people you have and based on that you could calculate salaries and ration expenses and they would always be inflated,""he told Ed Butler, presenter of the BBC's Business Daily programme. The former minister said the numbers may have been inflated by more than six times, and included ""desertions [and] martyrs who were never accounted for because some of the commanders would keep their bank cards"" and withdraw their salaries, he alleged. Afghans facing 'hell on earth' as winter looms Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly There have long been questions over Afghan troop numbers. A 2016 report by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) claimed that ""neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities"". In a more recent report, Sigar expressed ""serious concerns about the corrosive effects of corruption... and the questionable accuracy of data on the actual strength of the force"". Mr Payenda said that troops who did exist were often not paid on time, while there were leaders of government-backed militias who were ""double-dipping"" - taking their government wage, and then also accepting payments from the Taliban to give up without a fight. EXPLAINER:Ten days that shook Afghanistan ON THE GROUND:What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years VOICES:How the Taliban takeover changed my life ""The whole feeling was, we cannot change this. This is how the parliament works, this is how the governors work. Everybody would say the stream is murky from the very top, meaning the very top is involved in this,"" he said. He said he did not think former President Ashraf Ghani was ""financially corrupt"". Responding to accusations of corruption within the finance ministry, Mr Payenda said: ""I agree with that to a certain extent but in these issues, absolutely not."" He added that the West was ""part of"" some of the failures in Afghanistan, and described the US and Nato's involvement in the country as ""a great opportunity lost"".

The Barras banter on COP26 and climate change,"The archway that leads to Glasgow's famous Barras market It would be hard to find a place more ""Glasgow"" than The Barras. The area, east of Glasgow city centre, houses the popular weekend market and the iconic music venue the Barrowland ballroom. It has survived war, fire and redevelopment. Time will tell if the area, and the city will survive the threat on everyone's minds - climate change. It is less than three miles from the high-level talks of COP26, and the people in the cafes, stores and event spaces are all talking about it. Alan Duff from Bill's Tool Store would love to buy more British products to reduce the carbon footprint of importing stock from abroad Bill's Tool Store is a landmark at The Barras. It has been in Alan's family for three generations and celebrates its 75th anniversary next year. He wants to see promises kept from COP26. He said: ""I think what they are trying to do is great... if they carry it through. If this is the 26th one, what has happened at the other 25 that hasn't worked? ""I think the penny's dropped for us at home, looking at all the plastics we use has certainly made my family realise we have to do more."" He says he would like to cut the carbon footprint of the business, but it is tricky. ""The problem we have is that more than 90% of what people buy from us is made in China or India and until these countries do something, we are stuck,"" he said. ""We don't manufacture enough in this country now so we have no control over it. We try to buy local and British whenever we can but there are very few suppliers."" Keith Pittaway can't see musicians being able to tour in an electric bus Parked up in his tour bus outside the Barrowland ballroom music venue is driver Keith Pittaway. He knew COP26 was going on in Glasgow when he drove the band Easy Life into town for their gig. Keith says a lot of the acts he transports are worried about the climate and the consequences for touring. But he can't see a solution yet. ""Don't forget you are sitting on a 26-ton bus that's using a gallon per ten miles, but you don't mind that because you've got to get from A to B. He adds: ""These things are never going to run at 700km a day on electric. It is just not going to happen."" Michael Woods from Saint Luke's thinks the people of Glasgow could have been more involved in the conference Saint Luke's is a newer music venue and bar around the corner from the Barrowland. It has quickly cemented itself in the hearts of Glaswegian music lovers. It had hoped to enjoy a COP26 boost but people have been avoiding the city. Owner Michael thinks it has been a missed opportunity. ""Messaging has told people to stay away from the city but I think that's a mistake. I think they should have been embracing the event and the visitors. People make Glasgow but nobody is in Glasgow to make it."" He thinks a lot of Glaswegians have felt a bit detached from what is going on at the COP26 conference. ""We had a fringe festival called Beyond The Green over the weekend to do with sustainability and building products. But we put everything on ourselves. I think they have missed a trick in not getting everybody else in the city involved."" Sheran Lang from Reeta Fashions sees suppliers looking for sustainable fabrics Reeta Fashions is another Barras institution, outfitting the brides of Glasgow for the past 70 years. Owner Sheran is proud her city has been hosting COP26 and took her 10-year-old daughter to the climate rally last weekend. ""She knows all about climate change, they have been learning about it at school and I think it's important for her to understand. I think it's really positive for the city. ""Although the big motorcades were a bit uncomfortable to see, because that doesn't really represent climate change."" Sheran is aware of the damage the fashion industry does to the environment and is happy to see her industry changing. ""A lot of our suppliers are changing the way the fabrics are being made, to make them more environmentally friendly, which is great to see."" Denise from Dengy's Deli thinks those with more could do more Denise dishes out ""rolls and sausage and banter"" in the east end of the city. The only thing she has noticed about COP26 being in town is that the city and even the Barras has been quiet, even at the weekend when it's usually the busiest time. ""For my kids and their kids I worry about climate change,"" she says. ""It upsets me to see billionaires going into space when there's so much more that can be done to make things better on this planet. ""I know this is down to all of us so I am a big recycler. I buy all the different recycling bags from the council to make sure we recycle properly."" Georgia Elliot-Smith from She Changes Climate wanted to bring female activists from around the world to a different Glasgow Unbeknown to the locals, some COP26 activity is merely metres away from them. Around the corner from Dengy's, in the Pipe Factory venue,  a session is exploring how to get more women into the COP negotiations. Georgia Elliot-Smith is a former UNESCO special junior envoy for youth and the environment. She is part of a a group called She Changes Climate that is trying to see at least 50% representation of women at the top table of climate negotiations - 90% at the moment are male. She said: ""We've had 25 previous COPs and yet carbon emissions are still increasing - we feel we need a different mentality, a different perspective, some diversity to come up with different solutions because what we have been doing isn't working. ""We wanted to be real and part of the community and to bring people into a different Glasgow - to bring women from all over the world together to see what we can do.""

M&S sales surge amid warning of rising supply costs,"Marks and Spencer reported a surge in profits as its food division helped it bounce back after Covid restrictions. Boss Steve Rowe said growth was boosted by pent-up demand after lockdown, but the retailer was also seeing the benefit of its long restructuring. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October were Â£187m - 17.9% up on the period two years ago before Covid hit. But M&S said it was planning for ""significant"" increases in supply chain costs because of worker shortages. The retailer also forecast costs will rise during the rest of the financial year and be ""steeper again"" in 2022-23. During the six months, food sales increased by 10.4%, while overall sales in clothing and home fell by 1%, but full-price sales rose 17.3%. Mr Rowe said that ""for the first time we can see that the hard yards of driving long-term change are beginning to be borne out in our performance"". Despite the strong results, Mr Rowe said that ""given the history of M&S"", the company wouldn't ""overclaim our progress"". On the back of the firm's half-year results, M&S shares were up 20% on Wednesday morning, despite the warnings over driver and warehouse worker shortages. Like many other companies, M&S said lorry driver shortages were posing challenges, but added it had deployed several recruitment projects and incentives to attract new drivers and that it believed its food business was ""comparatively well placed"" to deal with the shortages. The department store added it hoped to drive ""long-term growth and loyalty"" by offering a better service and quality through its food delivery deal with Ocado. M&S owns a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which switched to delivering M&S food in September 2020. Commenting on the latest results, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said M&S's move to raise its full-year profit forecast to about Â£500m showed ""how lucrative the food arm of the business has become"". ""Marks and Spencer may have been late to the grocery e-commerce party, but arriving with Ocado in arm, it's muscled into a prime spot on the dance floor, and is enjoying the hits"", she said. ""It looks like this long suffering high street stalwart has turned a sharp corner, proof that management's transformation strategy is paying off. Rather than a department store which sells food as an extra, Marks is metamorphosing into a grocery powerhouse which sells clothes and homewear as add-ons."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, agreed M&S's food business continued to be the company's ""cash cow"", but warned the company would need to hold on to its transformed brand and soften the impact of supply chain issues to if it ""hopes to avoid disappointing investors this festive period"". Meanwhile, Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said Marks & Spencer ""was one of many companies where the pandemic forced accelerated change and the results are beginning to bear fruit"". ""Perhaps most noticeable is that the slumbering giant which was the clothing and home business is showing signs of renewed life,"" he said. ""Previously seen as tired and dowdy, the general offering has been reinvigorated and the signs to date are promising."" ""It's quite nice to be making some money again,"" quipped Archie Norman, the chairman of M&S, on its glossy results presentation video. This retailer has been through umpteen turnaround plans, but is this latest one, started four years ago, finally starting to yield results? These figures certainly show encouraging signs, with a bounce back in sales from the worst of the pandemic last year. The business has also emerged in better shape. Food is driving sales and profits, but full-price clothing sales are also up 17%, delivering higher profits in this division, too. And online sales have increased by 60% compared with two years ago. M&S now needs to deliver Christmas amid all the operational challenges this crucial trading period will bring. There are plenty of supply chain issues and cost pressures bearing down on all retailers.  But after years of false dawns, this is a business that now feels confident that it is on the right track. Elsewhere, Halfords said sales rose by 19.2% compared with two years ago, ""despite the known supply chain disruption"". Graham Stapleton, chief executive, said demand for bicycles remained ""good"", adding the company was ""pleased"" with the current availability of children's bicycles and electric bikes in the run-up to Christmas. However, Mr Stapleton said ""moving anything"" around the world in the past six months had been ""particularly challenging"", with freight costs sometimes as high as 10 times the normal rate. ""Even if goods are manufactured and a container is found to ship them to the UK, the recent HGV driver shortage has meant that this final leg of the supply chain has been more costly and unreliable,"" he said.

Supreme Court blocks mass claim against GoogleThe claim sought damages for millions of iPhone users who were tracked by Google.Technology,"The Supreme Court made the final judgement on whether the case against Google can proceed The UK's Supreme Court has rejected a claim that sought billions of pounds in damages from Google over alleged illegal tracking of millions of iPhones. The judge said the claimant had failed to prove damage had been caused to individuals by the data collection. But he did not rule out the possibility of future mass-action lawsuits if damages could be calculated. The case will have implications for similar mass-action lawsuits. In his judgement, Lord Leggatt said a key issue was that ""the claim has been framed in order to try to bring it as a representative action"" for many people. ""The claimant seeks damages... for each individual member of the represented class without attempting to show that any wrongful use was made by Google of personal data relating to that individual or that the individual suffered any material damage or distress as a result of a breach,"" it read. ""Without proof of these matters, a claim for damages cannot succeed."" But he added that the case had a ""real chance of success"" if pursued by the claimant as an individual, instead of as a mass action. Google said: ""This claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time. ""People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we've focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people's privacy."" Richard Lloyd was seeking compensation for millions of UK iPhone users The Google case - brought by Richard Lloyd, former director of consumer rights group Which? - alleged that between 2011 and 2012, Google cookies collected data on health, race, ethnicity, sexuality and finance through Apple's Safari web browser, even when users had chosen a ""do not track"" privacy setting. He sought compensation for 4.4 million affected users. While each individual iPhone owner would have received a small payout, the fine for Google could have run into billions. Mr Lloyd said: ""We are bitterly disappointed that the Supreme Court has failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other big tech firms who break the law. ""Although the court once gain recognised that our action is the only practical way that millions of British people can get access to fair redress, they've slammed the door shut on this case by ruling that everyone affected must go to court individually"". He called on the government to step in to make it easier for groups of consumers to take action over data breaches. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, agreed: ""There must be a way for people to seek redress against massive data breaches."" Currently, the legal fees would mean that it would be ""completely unreasonable"" for individuals to take on the tech giants, he added.

And Facebook is involved in a lawsuit alleging that users' data was improperly handled. Emily Cox, head of media disputes at law firm Stewarts, told the BBC: ""This decision ensures the floodgates remain firmly closed to data privacy class actions in England and Wales, much to the relief of big tech, but it also leaves consumers without a viable route to compensation for breaches of their privacy rights.""

Meghan letter weighed up calling father 'daddy',"The Duchess of Sussex won a previous court case that publishing the letter was a breach of her privacy The Duchess of Sussex questioned whether she should call her father ""daddy"" in a letter and whether it would ""pull at the heartstrings"" if leaked, the Court of Appeal has heard. The letter is at the centre of a legal battle over privacy between the duchess and publishers of the Mail on Sunday. The paper claimed it was written with an awareness it could be made public. The duchess won a previous court case that found publishing the letter was a misuse of her private information. Associated Newspapers' legal team are seeking to overturn this judgement. They are disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the ""possibility of public consumption"" in mind. The court heard lawyers for the duchess reiterate that this was a ""highly personal"" family letter touching on her private feelings, and that its publication was against the rights to a private life, family life and the protection of private correspondence. In the second day of the appeal hearing, lawyers for the publisher challenged the extent to which it was really a ""private"" letter, sent by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to her estranged father Thomas Markle. The newspaper's lawyers highlighted a witness statement from Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to Meghan and Prince Harry. Mail on Sunday questions 'private' letter Privacy damage 'run deeps', says Meghan Newspaper must publish statement on Meghan case The court heard of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf about the drafting of the letter, sent in August 2018. This included whether it should begin by addressing Mr Markle as ""daddy"". The court heard that the duchess had written: ""Given I've only ever called him 'daddy' it may make sense to open as such, despite him being less than paternal, and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstrings."" Andrew Caldecott, representing the news organisation, quoted Meghan in a further exchange, saying the letter was ""real, honest and factual, and if he leaks it, then that's on his conscience, and at least the world will know the truth. Words I could never voice publicly"". And the court heard, quoted from the exchange, that: ""Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice."" Justin Rushbrooke, representing the Duchess of Sussex, said this was a more straightforward case than might appear from the challenges against it. Extensive parts of a private, family letter had been shared without the consent of the sender, he said. And he told the court that if it had become public, that was because it had been published by the news organisation. In a statement sent to the Press Association, the duchess said she had never expected the letter to be leaked and that it was ""absurd"" to see the recognition that a letter could be leaked as being the same as expecting that to happen. The duchess said that Mr Markle's involvement in media coverage was putting pressure on Prince Harry and the letter was a way of addressing that. ""I felt that, even if my attempt to stop my father talking to the media failed, at least my husband would be able to say to his family that I had done everything I could to stop it,"" said the statement from the duchess. The letter had been sent to Mr Markle a few months after the duchess had married Prince Harry and it challenged her father's dealings with the media. Mr Markle, who was said to be unhappy at other media accounts of his relationship with his daughter, had given the letter to the Mail on Sunday. Lawyers for the newspaper suggested he wanted to challenge a ""false narrative"" of the run-up to his daughter's wedding and that revealing the letter was a form of right of reply. The duchess's legal team is seeking to uphold the finding of the earlier court. Welcoming the earlier ruling, Meghan had said it was a victory against ""dehumanising"" media behaviour. ""The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep,"" she said. The Mail on Sunday faced a requirement to publish a front-page statement on the Duchess of Sussex's case, which has been put on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. The hearing is due to end on Thursday.

"Afghan army 'rife with ghost soldiers' before fallÂThousands of troops who were supposed to fight the Taliban did not exist, a former minister says.Asia","Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in August Afghanistan's ex-finance minister has blamed the government's fall on corrupt officials who invented ""ghost soldiers"" and took payments from the Taliban. Khalid Payenda told the BBC that most of the 300,000 troops and police on the government's books did not exist. He said phantom personnel were added to official lists so that generals could pocket their wages. The Taliban rapidly seized control of Afghanistan in August, as US forces withdrew after 20 years in the country. Mr Payenda, who resigned and left Afghanistan as the Islamist group advanced, said records showing that security forces greatly outnumbered the Taliban were incorrect. ""The way the accountability was done, you would ask the chief in that province how many people you have and based on that you could calculate salaries and ration expenses and they would always be inflated,""he told Ed Butler, presenter of the BBC's Business Daily programme. The former minister said the numbers may have been inflated by more than six times, and included ""desertions [and] martyrs who were never accounted for because some of the commanders would keep their bank cards"" and withdraw their salaries, he alleged. Afghans facing 'hell on earth' as winter looms Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly There have long been questions over Afghan troop numbers. A 2016 report by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) claimed that ""neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities"". In a more recent report, Sigar expressed ""serious concerns about the corrosive effects of corruption... and the questionable accuracy of data on the actual strength of the force"". Mr Payenda said that troops who did exist were often not paid on time, while there were leaders of government-backed militias who were ""double-dipping"" - taking their government wage, and then also accepting payments from the Taliban to give up without a fight. EXPLAINER:Ten days that shook Afghanistan ON THE GROUND:What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years VOICES:How the Taliban takeover changed my life ""The whole feeling was, we cannot change this. This is how the parliament works, this is how the governors work. Everybody would say the stream is murky from the very top, meaning the very top is involved in this,"" he said. He said he did not think former President Ashraf Ghani was ""financially corrupt"". Responding to accusations of corruption within the finance ministry, Mr Payenda said: ""I agree with that to a certain extent but in these issues, absolutely not."" He added that the West was ""part of"" some of the failures in Afghanistan, and described the US and Nato's involvement in the country as ""a great opportunity lost"".

"Carer shortage leaves woman 'stuck in hospital'Brenda Devine, from Greysteel, has not been able to go home for months due to a shortage of carers.","Terence Devine said he thought wife Brenda would have been allowed home months ago A woman with Alzheimer's has been left stranded in hospital because of a lack of carers to help look after her at home, her husband says. Brenda Devine, 57, from Greysteel, County Londonderry, was admitted to the Waterside Hospital seven months ago. Her family said she had been told she was ready to go home, but could not leave due to a shortage of carers. Her husband Terence said it felt like his wife was ""in a prison and I can't get her out"". ""She has been released but I can't get her home,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. A Department of Health (DoH) spokeswoman said demand for home-based care currently ""outstrips supply"". ""There is immediate work to be done given the crisis that we find ourselves in, but there is clearly also a need to address issues in the long term,"" she said. A number of measures are in place or planned to help address the current shortage, she added. That includes asking health trusts to waive the usual care home fees where domiciliary care packages are not available but a care home placement is. The Western Health and Social Care Trust said it did not comment on individual cases. Mr Devine said his wife was first admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital on 16 April after suffering severe abdominal pain at home. She was transferred to the Waterside Hospital, where social workers carried out a care package assessment. Mr Devine says not being able to get his wife home is heartbreaking for the whole family Care packages are required by elderly, disabled or vulnerable people who need help with washing, dressing or cooking, or who need adaptations to their home. The assessment determined Brenda could leave hospital and be cared for at home with the help of professional carers, Mr Devine said. But that has not happened. ""This is going on and on,"" Mr Devine said. ""I am up against a brick wall with nowhere to turn. I thought Brenda would have been home months ago, every week is precious to me and to the family. ""The social workers have said there are no carers. The social workers, the hospital and the nurses have been doing a fantastic job, but there is no communication (with the trust)."" Many vulnerable people need regular visits from carers in order to be able to live in their own homes He said it was a ""guessing game"" as to when his wife might return home. Due to Covid-19 visiting restrictions, visiting has been limited too. Mrs Devine has not seen her son, granddaughter or wider family since she was first admitted to hospital. Mr Devine said the situation was ""soul-destroying... heartbreaking for the whole family"". ""When Brenda was here, my mind was full. I enjoyed helping her, if it was the other way around she would do anything for me,"" he said. ""The hospital at the minute is not the place for her, and we have a home for her."" In August, figures from each of Northern Ireland's health trusts showedalmost 2,000 people were waiting for care packages, mainly so they could be supported to live in their own homes. The latest figures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657. That includes: 410 people - Belfast Health Trust 402 people - Northern Health Trust 280 people - Southern Health Trust 424 people - Southern Eastern Health Trust 141 people - Western Health Trust BBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher. Bernadine McCrory, operations director of the Alzheimer's Society, said Brenda's situation was not an isolated case. ""We have had reports [of shortage of carers] from all of the trusts so this is across all of Northern Ireland,"" Ms McCrory told BBC Radio Foyle. She said cases like Mrs Devine's should be addressed urgently. ""While she may be in a hospital ward, she is socially isolated from her family as she can only see her husband and her daughter,"" she said. ""We really have got to start thinking of the value of the family carers because they are saving our health service thousands a week, but we aren't getting investment in the system to allow family carers to continue to do this."" The Department of Health said a range of measures had been taken to try and address the shortage of carers in Northern Ireland. That includes ongoing recruitment drives and the establishment of a social care forum. A publicity campaign promoting social care as a career is also planned. ""Whilst these have been successful in recruiting new workers, this has not been in the numbers required to address the increasing demand,"" the spokeswoman said. How care at home will be provided in the longer term, the spokeswoman said, will be shaped by the work of theReform of Adult Social Care,external.

They are disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the ""possibility of public consumption"" in mind. The court heard lawyers for the duchess reiterate that this was a ""highly personal"" family letter touching on her private feelings, and that its publication was against the rights to a private life, family life and the protection of private correspondence. In the second day of the appeal hearing, lawyers for the publisher challenged the extent to which it was really a ""private"" letter, sent by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to her estranged father Thomas Markle. The newspaper's lawyers highlighted a witness statement from Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to Meghan and Prince Harry. Mail on Sunday questions 'private' letter Privacy damage 'run deeps', says Meghan Newspaper must publish statement on Meghan case The court heard of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf about the drafting of the letter, sent in August 2018. This included whether it should begin by addressing Mr Markle as ""daddy"". The court heard that the duchess had written: ""Given I've only ever called him 'daddy' it may make sense to open as such, despite him being less than paternal, and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstrings."" Andrew Caldecott, representing the news organisation, quoted Meghan in a further exchange, saying the letter was ""real, honest and factual, and if he leaks it, then that's on his conscience, and at least the world will know the truth. Words I could never voice publicly"". And the court heard, quoted from the exchange, that: ""Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice."" Justin Rushbrooke, representing the Duchess of Sussex, said this was a more straightforward case than might appear from the challenges against it. Extensive parts of a private, family letter had been shared without the consent of the sender, he said. And he told the court that if it had become public, that was because it had been published by the news organisation. In a statement sent to the Press Association, the duchess said she had never expected the letter to be leaked and that it was ""absurd"" to see the recognition that a letter could be leaked as being the same as expecting that to happen. The duchess said that Mr Markle's involvement in media coverage was putting pressure on Prince Harry and the letter was a way of addressing that. ""I felt that, even if my attempt to stop my father talking to the media failed, at least my husband would be able to say to his family that I had done everything I could to stop it,"" said the statement from the duchess. The letter had been sent to Mr Markle a few months after the duchess had married Prince Harry and it challenged her father's dealings with the media. Mr Markle, who was said to be unhappy at other media accounts of his relationship with his daughter, had given the letter to the Mail on Sunday. Lawyers for the newspaper suggested he wanted to challenge a ""false narrative"" of the run-up to his daughter's wedding and that revealing the letter was a form of right of reply. The duchess's legal team is seeking to uphold the finding of the earlier court. Welcoming the earlier ruling, Meghan had said it was a victory against ""dehumanising"" media behaviour. ""The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep,"" she said. The Mail on Sunday faced a requirement to publish a front-page statement on the Duchess of Sussex's case, which has been put on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. The hearing is due to end on Thursday.

"Cocktail sales up but ales out, says WetherspoonsIt said that younger customers were driving sales of cocktails, vodka and rum in the last 15 weeks.BusinessComments","Cocktail sales have soared in comparison with traditional ales as more young people venture out post-lockdown, says Wetherspoons.

Supreme Court blocks mass claim against Google,"The Supreme Court made the final judgement on whether the case against Google can proceed The UK's Supreme Court has rejected a claim that sought billions of pounds in damages from Google over alleged illegal tracking of millions of iPhones. The judge said the claimant had failed to prove damage had been caused to individuals by the data collection. But he did not rule out the possibility of future mass-action lawsuits if damages could be calculated. The case will have implications for similar mass-action lawsuits. In his judgement, Lord Leggatt said a key issue was that ""the claim has been framed in order to try to bring it as a representative action"" for many people. ""The claimant seeks damages... for each individual member of the represented class without attempting to show that any wrongful use was made by Google of personal data relating to that individual or that the individual suffered any material damage or distress as a result of a breach,"" it read. ""Without proof of these matters, a claim for damages cannot succeed."" But he added that the case had a ""real chance of success"" if pursued by the claimant as an individual, instead of as a mass action. Google said: ""This claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time. ""People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we've focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people's privacy."" Richard Lloyd was seeking compensation for millions of UK iPhone users The Google case - brought by Richard Lloyd, former director of consumer rights group Which? - alleged that between 2011 and 2012, Google cookies collected data on health, race, ethnicity, sexuality and finance through Apple's Safari web browser, even when users had chosen a ""do not track"" privacy setting. He sought compensation for 4.4 million affected users. While each individual iPhone owner would have received a small payout, the fine for Google could have run into billions. Mr Lloyd said: ""We are bitterly disappointed that the Supreme Court has failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other big tech firms who break the law. ""Although the court once gain recognised that our action is the only practical way that millions of British people can get access to fair redress, they've slammed the door shut on this case by ruling that everyone affected must go to court individually"". He called on the government to step in to make it easier for groups of consumers to take action over data breaches. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, agreed: ""There must be a way for people to seek redress against massive data breaches."" Currently, the legal fees would mean that it would be ""completely unreasonable"" for individuals to take on the tech giants, he added. Facebook users are being asked to take part in legal action against the company over their data use The long-running case began in 2017, and had been through the High Court and the Court of Appeal before being escalated to the UK's Supreme Court. If it had succeeded, it could have opened the floodgates to many more mass actions against tech firms for data breaches. Such actions currently need people to opt-in, which can be a lengthy process. The Lloyd v Google case attempted to set a precedent for opt-out cases, meaning one representative could bring action on behalf of millions. BA settles claim by thousands hit by data breach Facebook faces mass legal action over data leak TikTok is facing a similar case, brought by former Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield, which alleges that the video-sharing app used children's data without informed consent. And Facebook is involved in a lawsuit alleging that users' data was improperly handled. Emily Cox, head of media disputes at law firm Stewarts, told the BBC: ""This decision ensures the floodgates remain firmly closed to data privacy class actions in England and Wales, much to the relief of big tech, but it also leaves consumers without a viable route to compensation for breaches of their privacy rights."" Nick McAleenan, a partner at JMW Solicitors, said that future cases would need to balance ""the legal rights and interests of ordinary consumers, and those of the large organisations which process all of our personal data"". And techUK, the UK's trade association for technology firms, said that if the judgement had gone the other way, it would ""have opened the door for speculative and vexatious claims to be made against data controllers"". ""We believe it is right that any action must first seek to establish whether damage has been caused,"" it added. Google has lost a separate appeal over a â¬2.4bn fine imposed in 2017 for distorting competition among price comparison websites. The EU's General Court in Luxembourg dismissed Google's legal challenge, and upheld the fine. Shivaun Raff, chief executive of Foundem, the lead complainant in that case, welcomed the judgement but added: ""It does not undo the considerable consumer and anti-competitive harm caused by more than a decade of Google's insidious search manipulation practices.""

Carer shortage leaves woman 'stuck in hospital',"Terence Devine said he thought wife Brenda would have been allowed home months ago A woman with Alzheimer's has been left stranded in hospital because of a lack of carers to help look after her at home, her husband says. Brenda Devine, 57, from Greysteel, County Londonderry, was admitted to the Waterside Hospital seven months ago. Her family said she had been told she was ready to go home, but could not leave due to a shortage of carers. Her husband Terence said it felt like his wife was ""in a prison and I can't get her out"". ""She has been released but I can't get her home,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. A Department of Health (DoH) spokeswoman said demand for home-based care currently ""outstrips supply"". ""There is immediate work to be done given the crisis that we find ourselves in, but there is clearly also a need to address issues in the long term,"" she said. A number of measures are in place or planned to help address the current shortage, she added. That includes asking health trusts to waive the usual care home fees where domiciliary care packages are not available but a care home placement is. The Western Health and Social Care Trust said it did not comment on individual cases. Mr Devine said his wife was first admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital on 16 April after suffering severe abdominal pain at home. She was transferred to the Waterside Hospital, where social workers carried out a care package assessment. Mr Devine says not being able to get his wife home is heartbreaking for the whole family Care packages are required by elderly, disabled or vulnerable people who need help with washing, dressing or cooking, or who need adaptations to their home. The assessment determined Brenda could leave hospital and be cared for at home with the help of professional carers, Mr Devine said. But that has not happened. ""This is going on and on,"" Mr Devine said. ""I am up against a brick wall with nowhere to turn. I thought Brenda would have been home months ago, every week is precious to me and to the family. ""The social workers have said there are no carers. The social workers, the hospital and the nurses have been doing a fantastic job, but there is no communication (with the trust)."" Many vulnerable people need regular visits from carers in order to be able to live in their own homes He said it was a ""guessing game"" as to when his wife might return home. Due to Covid-19 visiting restrictions, visiting has been limited too. Mrs Devine has not seen her son, granddaughter or wider family since she was first admitted to hospital. Mr Devine said the situation was ""soul-destroying... heartbreaking for the whole family"". ""When Brenda was here, my mind was full. I enjoyed helping her, if it was the other way around she would do anything for me,"" he said. ""The hospital at the minute is not the place for her, and we have a home for her."" In August, figures from each of Northern Ireland's health trusts showedalmost 2,000 people were waiting for care packages, mainly so they could be supported to live in their own homes. The latest figures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657. That includes: 410 people - Belfast Health Trust 402 people - Northern Health Trust 280 people - Southern Health Trust 424 people - Southern Eastern Health Trust 141 people - Western Health Trust BBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher. Bernadine McCrory, operations director of the Alzheimer's Society, said Brenda's situation was not an isolated case. ""We have had reports [of shortage of carers] from all of the trusts so this is across all of Northern Ireland,"" Ms McCrory told BBC Radio Foyle. She said cases like Mrs Devine's should be addressed urgently. ""While she may be in a hospital ward, she is socially isolated from her family as she can only see her husband and her daughter,"" she said. ""We really have got to start thinking of the value of the family carers because they are saving our health service thousands a week, but we aren't getting investment in the system to allow family carers to continue to do this."" The Department of Health said a range of measures had been taken to try and address the shortage of carers in Northern Ireland. That includes ongoing recruitment drives and the establishment of a social care forum. A publicity campaign promoting social care as a career is also planned. ""Whilst these have been successful in recruiting new workers, this has not been in the numbers required to address the increasing demand,"" the spokeswoman said. How care at home will be provided in the longer term, the spokeswoman said, will be shaped by the work of theReform of Adult Social Care,external.

M&S sales surge as food helps Covid bounce back,"Marks and Spencer reported a surge in profits as its food division helped it bounce back after Covid restrictions. Boss Steve Rowe said growth was boosted by pent-up demand after lockdown, but the retailer was also seeing the benefit of its long restructuring. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October were Â£187m - 17.9% up on the period two years ago before Covid hit. But M&S said it was planning for ""significant"" increases in supply chain costs because of worker shortages. The retailer also forecast costs will rise during the rest of the financial year and be ""steeper again"" in 2022-23. During the six months, food sales increased by 10.4%, while overall sales in clothing and home fell by 1%, but full-price sales rose 17.3%. Mr Rowe said that ""for the first time we can see that the hard yards of driving long-term change are beginning to be borne out in our performance"". Despite the strong results, Mr Rowe said that ""given the history of M&S"", the company wouldn't ""overclaim our progress"". On the back of the firm's half-year results, M&S shares were up 20% on Wednesday morning, despite the warnings over driver and warehouse worker shortages. Like many other companies, M&S said lorry driver shortages were posing challenges, but added it had deployed several recruitment projects and incentives to attract new drivers and that it believed its food business was ""comparatively well placed"" to deal with the shortages. The department store added it hoped to drive ""long-term growth and loyalty"" by offering a better service and quality through its food delivery deal with Ocado. M&S owns a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which switched to delivering M&S food in September 2020. Commenting on the latest results, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said M&S's move to raise its full-year profit forecast to about Â£500m showed ""how lucrative the food arm of the business has become"". ""Marks and Spencer may have been late to the grocery e-commerce party, but arriving with Ocado in arm, it's muscled into a prime spot on the dance floor, and is enjoying the hits"", she said. ""It looks like this long suffering high street stalwart has turned a sharp corner, proof that management's transformation strategy is paying off. Rather than a department store which sells food as an extra, Marks is metamorphosing into a grocery powerhouse which sells clothes and homewear as add-ons."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, agreed M&S's food business continued to be the company's ""cash cow"", but warned the company would need to hold on to its transformed brand and soften the impact of supply chain issues to if it ""hopes to avoid disappointing investors this festive period"". Meanwhile, Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said Marks & Spencer ""was one of many companies where the pandemic forced accelerated change and the results are beginning to bear fruit"". ""Perhaps most noticeable is that the slumbering giant which was the clothing and home business is showing signs of renewed life,"" he said. ""Previously seen as tired and dowdy, the general offering has been reinvigorated and the signs to date are promising."" ""It's quite nice to be making some money again,"" quipped Archie Norman, the chairman of M&S, on its glossy results presentation video. This retailer has been through umpteen turnaround plans, but is this latest one, started four years ago, finally starting to yield results? These figures certainly show encouraging signs, with a bounce back in sales from the worst of the pandemic last year. The business has also emerged in better shape. Food is driving sales and profits, but full-price clothing sales are also up 17%, delivering higher profits in this division, too. And online sales have increased by 60% compared with two years ago. M&S now needs to deliver Christmas amid all the operational challenges this crucial trading period will bring. There are plenty of supply chain issues and cost pressures bearing down on all retailers.  But after years of false dawns, this is a business that now feels confident that it is on the right track. Elsewhere, Halfords said sales rose by 19.2% compared with two years ago, ""despite the known supply chain disruption"". Graham Stapleton, chief executive, said demand for bicycles remained ""good"", adding the company was ""pleased"" with the current availability of children's bicycles and electric bikes in the run-up to Christmas. However, Mr Stapleton said ""moving anything"" around the world in the past six months had been ""particularly challenging"", with freight costs sometimes as high as 10 times the normal rate. ""Even if goods are manufactured and a container is found to ship them to the UK, the recent HGV driver shortage has meant that this final leg of the supply chain has been more costly and unreliable,"" he said.

Cox under fire over office use for Caribbean work,"Video of a remote inquiry hearing shows Sir Geoffrey in what appears to be his Commons office Labour has called for a standards investigation into a possible rule breach by Sir Geoffrey Cox - after a clip appeared to show him using his MP's office to carry out private work for the British Virgin Islands inquiry. The Conservative MP has earned more than Â£700,000 for advising the inquiry. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said he appeared to be in ""brazen breach of the rules"". The BBC has contacted Sir Geoffrey, a former attorney general, for comment. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said MPs should not use ""anything that is funded by the taxpayer"", including their parliamentary offices, for outside work.

PM says MPs must be visible in constituencies Which MPs have second jobs? Constituents split over MP's second job Last month, Conservative Owen Patersonwas found to have broken rulesby lobbying the government on behalf of companies who were paying him - and for using his Commons office for business meetings, which is prohibited. His case has raised questions about the extra work some MPs do on top of their parliamentary jobs. The Commons is in recess this week, meaning Boris Johnson will not be facing questions in Parliament at Prime Minister's Questions later. MPs are allowed to do extra jobs - for example, some work as doctors or lawyers, while others write books or give speeches - but they must declare their additional income along with gifts and donations. Sir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, has continued to practise as a barrister - earning almost Â£900,000 for this in the past year. His work includes advisingthe British Virgin Islands government inquiry into alleged corruption.

His absence occurred at about the same time as MPs, including Sir Geoffrey, were voting on the government's health and social care funding reforms. At a later point, he excuses himself for the rest of the hearing, saying: ""Would you forgive me for not being present this afternoon? I'm afraid I have compelling other commitments... ""Forgive my absence during some of the morning. I'm afraid the bell went off."" This appears to be a reference to the division bell, which rings when MPs are summoned to the Commons to vote. Labour has suggested that, in apparently using his Commons office for outside work, Sir Geoffrey breachedthe parliamentary code of conduct,,externalwhich states that MPs should ensure facilities paid for by the public purse ""always support their parliamentary duties"". It adds that the use of public resources should not ""confer any undue personal or financial benefit on themselves"". Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast: ""For any MP, if they do have external interests, they should of course be open and transparent about that. They should be following all the rules all the time, including no lobbying."" ""If you have an external interest, I can't see why you would be using anything that is funded by the taxpayer... I think that would include your office space,"" he added. Last month, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone found that Mr Paterson had breached these rules by holding meetings in his parliamentary office with companies who were paying him. Labour has now asked Ms Stone to carry out an investigation into Sir Geoffrey. Ms Rayner said: ""A Conservative MP using a taxpayer funded office in Parliament to work for a tax haven facing allegations of corruption is a slap in the face and an insult to British taxpayers. ""The prime minister needs to explain why he has an MP in his parliamentary party that treats Parliament like a co-working space allowing him to get on with all of his other jobs instead of representing his constituents."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has earned more than Â£100,000 from legal work since he became an MP in 2015. Asked on BBC Radio Leicester whether MPs should have a second job, and whether he had had one himself, Sir Keir said there were ""different types of second jobs"". He added: ""There's a million miles between what Owen Paterson was doing and Rosena Allin-Khan, one of our MPs in Tooting (south London). ""She is a qualified health professional. She's been working on the front line during Covid in A&E in her local hospital. So I think we need to have a clear distinction between those two types of cases.""

Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala ties the knot,"Malala Yousafzai tweeted that it was ""a precious day"" in her life Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has ""tied the knot"" with her partner during an Islamic ceremony in Birmingham. She and Asser Malik took part in a nikkah ceremony, where bride and groom consent to be married. The 24-year-old activist said it was ""a precious day"" in her life. The Pakistani women's rights activist found refuge in the West Midlands after being shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012. ""Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life,"" she tweeted on Tuesday, sharing how they had taken part in a ""small nikkah ceremony with family"". ""We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead,"" she added. She posted several photos from the ceremony On Wednesday afternoon, her new husband tweeted a picture of the couple and said in Malala he had found a ""beautiful and kind partner"" and he was ""so excited to spend the rest of our life together"".

Malala, now 24, was 15 when she was targeted by the Taliban in Pakistan for speaking up for the right of girls to be educated. She survived the assault, in which a militant boarded her school bus in north-western Swat valley and opened fire, wounding two of her school friends as well as Malala. After recovering from her near-fatal injuries, she and her family relocated to Birmingham,which she later called ""a second home"". Aged 17, she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She went on to study at Oxford University, and has become a leading human rights campaigner. Since graduating, Malala has called forbetter support for Afghan refugees,signed a contract with Apple TV+to produce documentaries and appearedon the cover of British Vogue, all while continuing her work to improve girls' access to education. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Asser Malik is closely associated with cricket and is the High Performance General Manager of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). A graduate of Lahore's renowned Aitchison College and then Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), he was also associated with the Pakistan Super League franchise Multan Sultans before joining the PCB, for which he prepared the player development program. While it is not clear how long the couple have known each other, there are pictures of them cheering on Pakistan at Birmingham's Edgbaston Cricket Ground posted on Mr Malik's Instagram account in June 2019. The news of the ceremony was liked tens of thousands of times on social media On its own, a nikkah is not legally recognised under English law and it is unclear whether the couple had a separate civil ceremony. Malala has previously voiced her misgivings around marriage. In an interview with Vogue in July, she said: ""I still don't understand why people have to get married."" ""If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can't it just be a partnership?"" she continued. ""My mum is likeâ¦ 'Don't you dare say anything like that! You have to get married, marriage is beautiful'."" The news of the ceremony was liked tens of thousands of times by fans online, with thousands wishing the couple well. Among those to offer their congratulations on Twitter were Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Jemima Goldsmith and MP Sajid Javid.

M&S warns of supply chain costs as profits surge,"Marks and Spencer reported a surge in profits as its food division helped it bounce back after Covid restrictions. Boss Steve Rowe said growth was boosted by pent-up demand after lockdown, but the retailer was also seeing the benefit of its long restructuring. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October were Â£187m - 17.9% up on the period two years ago before Covid hit. But M&S said it was planning for ""significant"" increases in supply chain costs because of worker shortages. The retailer also forecast costs will rise during the rest of the financial year and be ""steeper again"" in 2022-23. During the six months, food sales increased by 10.4%, while overall sales in clothing and home fell by 1%, but full-price sales rose 17.3%. Mr Rowe said that ""for the first time we can see that the hard yards of driving long-term change are beginning to be borne out in our performance"". Despite the strong results, Mr Rowe said that ""given the history of M&S"", the company wouldn't ""overclaim our progress"". On the back of the firm's half-year results, M&S shares were up 20% on Wednesday morning, despite the warnings over driver and warehouse worker shortages. Like many other companies, M&S said lorry driver shortages were posing challenges, but added it had deployed several recruitment projects and incentives to attract new drivers and that it believed its food business was ""comparatively well placed"" to deal with the shortages. The department store added it hoped to drive ""long-term growth and loyalty"" by offering a better service and quality through its food delivery deal with Ocado. M&S owns a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which switched to delivering M&S food in September 2020. Commenting on the latest results, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said M&S's move to raise its full-year profit forecast to about Â£500m showed ""how lucrative the food arm of the business has become"". ""Marks and Spencer may have been late to the grocery e-commerce party, but arriving with Ocado in arm, it's muscled into a prime spot on the dance floor, and is enjoying the hits"", she said. ""It looks like this long suffering high street stalwart has turned a sharp corner, proof that management's transformation strategy is paying off. Rather than a department store which sells food as an extra, Marks is metamorphosing into a grocery powerhouse which sells clothes and homewear as add-ons."" Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, agreed M&S's food business continued to be the company's ""cash cow"", but warned the company would need to hold on to its transformed brand and soften the impact of supply chain issues to if it ""hopes to avoid disappointing investors this festive period"".

Poots tasks officials to do Article 16 prep work,"Goods can flow freely across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic Northern Ireland's agriculture minister has tasked his officials with preparing for the triggering of Article 16. Edwin Poots said there is a ""significant chance"" Article 16 of the NI Protocol will be triggered soon. On Tuesday, TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar saidthe Republic of Ireland is making ""contingency plans"" in the event of the UK government triggering Article 16. There is speculation the UK will act due to a stalemate with the EU. EU Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic is expected to brief EU ambassadors later about hismeeting with UK Brexit Minister Lord Frostas well as ongoing talks. The triggering of Article 16 would result in some parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol being suspended. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Edwin Poots called for the EU to be ""respectful"" of Northern Irelands place within the UK Mr Poots said Article 16 needed to be triggered in order for negotiations with the EU to continue. ""It is for the EU to choose whether they want a trade battle or whether they want to treat Northern Ireland with respect,"" the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""Thus far they haven't treated Northern Ireland with respect and they have forced our businesses, and indeed our consumers, to be deprived of goods that would normally be available in their own country by creating a false premise about the single market. ""We can quite easily ensure the integrity of a single market by taking the appropriate steps in Northern Ireland to ensure that goods don't enter the European Union that don't meet their standards."" Ireland making plans for UK move on Article 16 What is Article 16 and why does it matter? EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 The minister called for the EU to be ""respectful"" of Northern Ireland's position within the UK and to ""work with Northern Ireland and the UK in ensuring that the goods entering the EU are goods that are manufactured to their standards"". Mr Poots said his party has been pressing the UK government to trigger Article 16 ""for some time"". ""I have my officials looking at the operational command paper to see how we would respond if Article 16 was introduced, and therefore it's something I believe that has a significant chance of happening."" His comments come after Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill called on the UK government to ""remove the threat to trigger Article 16"" on Tuesday. ""What we need to find is solutions and stability, certainly not another period of instability,"" said Ms O'Neill. Last week, the European Commission vice-presidentwarned of ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggered Article 16. Mr Sefcovic said the move would be ""serious for Northern Ireland as it would lead to instability and unpredictability"". His comments followed a meeting with the UK's Brexit minister in Brussels over the protocol dispute. Ireland making plans for UK move on Article 16 What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

The Commons is in recess this week, meaning Boris Johnson will not be facing questions in Parliament at Prime Minister's Questions later. MPs are allowed to do extra jobs - for example, some work as doctors or lawyers, while others write books or give speeches - but they must declare their additional income along with gifts and donations. Sir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, has continued to practise as a barrister - earning almost Â£900,000 for this in the past year. His work includes advisingthe British Virgin Islands government inquiry into alleged corruption. Sir Geoffrey is the MP for Torridge and West Devon Video footage from Septemberis available online,externalof Sir Geoffrey participating in a virtual hearing for the inquiry from what appears to be his Commons office. At one point he gets up from his chair, returning to it around half an hour later. His absence occurred at about the same time as MPs, including Sir Geoffrey, were voting on the government's health and social care funding reforms. At a later point, he excuses himself for the rest of the hearing, saying: ""Would you forgive me for not being present this afternoon? I'm afraid I have compelling other commitments... ""Forgive my absence during some of the morning. I'm afraid the bell went off."" This appears to be a reference to the division bell, which rings when MPs are summoned to the Commons to vote. Labour has suggested that, in apparently using his Commons office for outside work, Sir Geoffrey breachedthe parliamentary code of conduct,,externalwhich states that MPs should ensure facilities paid for by the public purse ""always support their parliamentary duties"". It adds that the use of public resources should not ""confer any undue personal or financial benefit on themselves"". Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast: ""For any MP, if they do have external interests, they should of course be open and transparent about that. They should be following all the rules all the time, including no lobbying."" ""If you have an external interest, I can't see why you would be using anything that is funded by the taxpayer... I think that would include your office space,"" he added. Last month, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone found that Mr Paterson had breached these rules by holding meetings in his parliamentary office with companies who were paying him. Labour has now asked Ms Stone to carry out an investigation into Sir Geoffrey. Ms Rayner said: ""A Conservative MP using a taxpayer funded office in Parliament to work for a tax haven facing allegations of corruption is a slap in the face and an insult to British taxpayers. ""The prime minister needs to explain why he has an MP in his parliamentary party that treats Parliament like a co-working space allowing him to get on with all of his other jobs instead of representing his constituents."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has earned more than Â£100,000 from legal work since he became an MP in 2015. Asked on BBC Radio Leicester whether MPs should have a second job, and whether he had had one himself, Sir Keir said there were ""different types of second jobs"". He added: ""There's a million miles between what Owen Paterson was doing and Rosena Allin-Khan, one of our MPs in Tooting (south London). ""She is a qualified health professional. She's been working on the front line during Covid in A&E in her local hospital. So I think we need to have a clear distinction between those two types of cases."" The Liberal Democrats' chief whip Wendy Chamberlain urged Sir Geoffrey to ""save everyone the time and trouble of an investigation"" and ""come clean now"".

Scammers target 40% of people in last three years,"Despite the perception that older people are the main victims of scams the age group most affected is 20 to 49 Forty percent of people have been targeted by a scam in the past three years, the Consumer Council has said. Chief executive Noyona Chundur said scammers were finding new ways to target people. The PSNI said despite the perception that older people are the main victims of scams, the age group most affected is 20 to 49 year olds. They said there had been a increase in scams targeting people through social media and online shopping. On the fifth anniversary of the Scamwise NI Partnership, Supt Gerard Pollock said there had been a ""significant rise in the number of reported scams"" since 2016. In the 2015/16 financial year, the PSNI said 2,230 fraud offences were reported. In the 2020/21 year, that figure had risen to 5,825. ""Whilst there has been a rise in general around the UK and further afield, we are pleased that through our commitment to raising awareness, more and more people are spotting and therefore reporting scams,"" he added. ""Fraudsters are continually coming up with more sophisticated and convincing ways of duping people out of money and possessions so partnerships like ScamwiseNI are vital in ensuring they do not succeed."" Scamwise NI was started by a number of organisations including the PSNI, Department of Justice, The Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing Board, in response to the growing number of scams circulating in Northern Ireland. Romance scam suspects defrauded 100 women - FBI Six people arrested after elderly targeted in fraud scam More than 300 targeted in bogus police phone scam Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people for Northern Ireland, said the scheme had had a positive impact. ""We are living in a society where scammers will go out of their way to dupe people out of their money in lots of different ways,"" he added. ""Anyone can become a victim of a scam which is why I... will continue to work with and promote the partnership's efforts to ensure our older citizens are well informed."" Ms Chundur said the Consumer Council's research showed how important initiatives to combat scamming were. ""As we become more reliant on the internet, scammers are finding new ways to target people, meaning our work in protecting consumers has never been more important,"" she added.

Toddlers may be getting hooked on sugar in snacks,"Some snacks sold as weaning or infant foods contain alarming amounts of sugar which could encourage a sweet tooth from an early age, according to health campaigners. Action on Sugar,externalanalysed 73 baby and toddler products on sale in UK shops. Heinz Farley's Mini Rusks Original, for example, contain the equivalent of two teaspoons of sugar per serving. Organix Banana Soft Oaty Bars, which are sweetened with apple juice concentrate, contain similar. Kiddylicious Banana Crispy Tiddlers contain more than 50% sugar - 59g for every 100g of the product. Overall, 27 of the products tested would qualify for a ""red"" or ""high"" sugar on the front-of-pack traffic light food labelling system. Only six met the criteria for a ""green"" or ""low"" label for sugars. And 36 of the products claimed - on the packet - that their sweet snacks were suitable for babies under the age of 12 months, even though sugar-sweetened food and drink should be avoided in this age group. Even if the sugar comes from added fruit juice, it is not good for babies and toddlers, says Action on Sugar. This group includes sugar added to food or drinks - at home, or by a chef or other food manufacturer It also includes sugars that naturally occur in foods such as honey, syrups (maple, agave and golden), nectars (blossom), and unsweetened fruit juices, vegetable juices and smoothies Sugar found naturally in milk, fruit and vegetables, does not count as free sugars but is included in the ""total"" sugar figure on food labels Dr Kawther Hashem, Campaign Lead at Action on Sugar, and Research Fellow at Queen Mary University of London, said it was ""ludicrous"" that certain food companies were being allowed to promote high-sugar sweet snacks to parents with very young children, despite them being aware that babies and toddlers shouldn't be having any free sugars. She said: ""Babies can have a preference for sweet foods, due to milk being ever so slightly sweet, but liking sugary foods is something they only learn by eating sugary foods. ""Some companies choose to encourage this preference further by providing lots of very sweet products from an early age. What we need is companies to make products with minimal amount of sugars, so young children can grow up enjoying less sweet foods."" Regularly consuming too much sugar at any age can cause health problems, including tooth decay and weight gain. Bridget Benelam from the British Nutrition Foundation said offering less sweet vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach, early on in weaning may help children learn to accept these flavours. Foods to avoid giving babies and young children,external How to start your baby on solid foods,external Concern too many babies overfed Adults should have no more than 30g of free sugars a day (seven sugar cubes) Children aged seven to ten should have no more than 24g (six sugar cubes) Children aged four to six should have no more than 19g (five sugar cubes) There's no guideline limit for children under the age of four, but it's recommended they avoid sugar-sweetened drinks and food with sugar added to it Nutritionist Holly Gabriel, from Action on Sugar, called for government regulation: ""The Government must release their long-awaited commercial baby food and drink guidelines, and make them mandatory to hold all companies to the same standard. ""The Government must also investigate the best way of labelling foods for babies and toddlers to provide better and more honest packaging for parents."" Heinz said: ""Sugar reduction is a key focus for Heinz for Baby and we are looking into ways to improve the products we make. Alongside the original rusks, Farley's offer a range of reduced-sugar rusks with 30% less sugar. ""The level of added sugars in these recipes is kept to a minimum consistent with the need to provide a texture which dissolves easily to avoid the risk of choking. Farley's Rusks are very different from typical biscuits, containing very little fat and no added salt."" Organix said: ""The majority of the sugar content within Organix Soft Oaty Bars comes from dried fruit which contains naturally occurring sugars, rather than the fruit juice concentrate which is used to hold all the ingredients together and to give a suitable texture for a child. ""Organix believes in using natural ingredients such as dried fruit which has the nutritional benefits of fibre, vitamins and minerals rather than using artificial sweeteners or table sugar. Fruit juice concentrate can also be used to provide flavour, and we clearly label the front of our packs to be transparent to parents.  This is part of our No Junk Promise.

Labour demands probe into Cox's Caribbean work,"Video of a remote inquiry hearing shows Sir Geoffrey in what appears to be his Commons office Labour has called for a standards investigation into a possible rule breach by Sir Geoffrey Cox - after a clip appeared to show him using his MP's office to carry out private work for the British Virgin Islands inquiry. The Conservative MP has earned more than Â£700,000 for advising the inquiry. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said he appeared to be in ""brazen breach of the rules"". The BBC has contacted Sir Geoffrey, a former attorney general, for comment.

LiveLiveDraft COP deal calls for tougher climate targets8 minutes ago,"China and the US pledge to work together on climate action, saying they recognise ""the urgency of the climate crisis"" The two countries are the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and US climate envoy John Kerry says it marks a ""new step"" The BBC's environment correspondent says regardless of the agreement's contents, it hands COP26 a boost Negotiations are going into overdrive in Glasgow to try and secure an ambitious agreement before COP26 ends on Friday UK PM Boris Johnson earlier urged delegates to ""bridge the gap"" between long-term goals and immediate action to ""keep 1.5 alive"" A draft agreement calls on governments to strengthen their climate targets by the end of 2022, putting pressure on big emitters Saudi Arabia denies it is obstructing progress towards a strong deal, calling such allegations ""a cheat and a lie"" Edited by Marie Jackson We are ending our live coverage of COP26 for the day - but will be back again tomorrow. Wednesday's live page was edited by Lauren Turner and Marie Jackson. Our writers today were Alex Kleiderman, Paul McLaren, Toby Luckhurst, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Max Mazta. It's been a busy day at COP26. Here's what's been happening: The final question is about the US's ability to deliver on its own climate promises under the Paris Agreement. Kerry says: ""The answer is yes we will."" He says the ""aggressive"" $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill just passed will have many of the things the US needs to do to help climate change such as electric charging stations across the country. He says 50% of all the cars sold in the US in 2030 will be electric and by 2035 hopefully all of them. US climate envoy John Kerry cracks a slight joke while commenting on when both countries expect Chinese greenhouse gas emissions to peak. ""President Xi has set a time frame for when he sees a peak. We have had lots of discussions about peaking. ""We peaked out on peaking."" ""We embraced, I think, what we know to be the science,"" he continues, adding that there is a chance that the data is wrong about when emissions will peak. China has said that they expect emissions to peak by 2030, if not before. The next question is from Reuters news agency which asks how the US addressed the issue of China's use of forced labour for building solar panels? He says: ""We are honest about the differences...but that's not my lane here. My job is to be the climate guy and stay focused on trying to move the climate agenda forward."" He says the presidents made it clear when they talked in February that while they have differences, it was important to focus on global crises. Now to questions at the US press conference. The first is whether the deal includes anything on the use of coal in China. John Kerry says China has laid out its current timetable and the things its going to do to reduce emissions. But what this agreement does is underscores that there is a plan in place, he says. He reads what he calls some ""important paragraphs"" about the intention of the two sides to continue concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions - but does not specifically mention coal. He says: ""But the whole point of this is that the steps we are taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us and others to be able to accelerate their efforts."" Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Perhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate actionin the 2020s. If the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical. While China has been reluctant to take action to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action. So the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms. The agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date and what science says is necessary for a safer world. Closing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow. The optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost. ""Now, with this announcement we've arrived at a new step,"" Mr Kerry continues, calling this moment a ""roadmap"" for the future. This statement makes it ""an imperative to co-operate,"" he says, referring to the deal that the US and China have just agreed. The US climate envoy adds that both sides have agreed to ""work together to limit methane emissions"". He said that China's pledge to create ""a comprehensive and ambitious national action plan on methane"" will have a ""significant effect"" on the climate crisis. ""The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done."" He appeals to all countries to work together, as the two largest emitters are doing today, and adds ""that he looks forward to stepping up our work with China"".  John Kerry, the US climate envoy, is speaking in more detail about the US-China climate deal. He says it sets out how together the nations will take action at COP26 as well as in the years to come. He says US President Biden and China's President Xi had a conversation a few weeks ago and they agreed to work together to raise climate ambition. He says the US and Chinese teams have worked together for months and have met 30 times both virtually and in person. They've agreed to a basic framework and shared desire for success on mitigation, adaptation, support and all of the key issues. The deal is a roadmap for our present and future collaboration on this issue, he says. ""We need to do it far faster in this decisive decade - not because China or the US say that we must - but because science says we must,"" he says. The text of the US-China climate deal has just been released. The bilateral statement says both sides ""recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"" and will work to address the issue together. The document says that both sides will ""recall their firm commitment to work together"" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. They also call for ""stepped-up efforts"" to close the ""significant gap"" that remains to achieve that goal. Both sides pledge to co-operate on regulatory standards, the transition to clean energy, de-carbonisation and ""green design and renewable resource utilisation"". They also pledge to tackle methane emissions. China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The deal was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a ""national plan"" to address methane. The document says that both also pledge to form a working group that will meet regularly to discuss climate solutions. We're hearing more from China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua on details of the new US-China declaration. It appears to be quite thin on specific details and concrete targets. Calling climate change an ""existential"" crisis for humanity, Xie says the declaration will address clean energy, clean coal, methane reduction and banning deforestation. China will ""develop a national plan"" on methane, he says, and encourage ""joint research"" on the greenhouse gas. The two sides are also committing to ""strengthen goals"" on deforestation, he adds. ""In areas of climate change there is more agreement between China and US than divergence,"" Xie says.  The US and China have released a rare joint declaration pledging action on climate change. The document, called ""enhancing climate action in the 2020s"", commits the countries to develop long-term strategies to reach net-zero. Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate negotiator, is explaining what's in the statement at a press conference in Glasgow. He says the declaration - agreed this afternoon - commits the two countries to ""concrete measures"" to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming below 2C and ""pursuing efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C by the end of the century. ""We committed to adopt enhanced climate actions  in order to achieve the Paris agreement goal and strengthen its implementation,"" he adds. Some unexpected news this evening. We are now expecting a joint declaration on climate action from China and the US shortly. These two countries are the world's largest emitters of carbon dioxide. A spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation said China's top envoy would speak at 18:00 GMT. It's unclear what will be announced and it looks like even though it's a ""joint declaration"" that the delegations will hold separate press briefings, with the US following at 18:30. We'll bring you the latest as we get it. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent Boris Johnson
called on world leaders to give their negotiating teams in Glasgow more leeway
to reach a deal. He didnât name
any countries as blockers but he seemed to pin the blame for any hold-ups on
richer countries who had ""patted themselves on the back"" after the Paris
climate change agreement was negotiated in 2015 but had ""defaulted"" on their
promises to developing countries since then. He then
clarified that progress basically came down to one thing: money. But he must be
worried about what the current saga around MPs' second jobs is doing to the
host countryâs international reputation, asserting that the UK wasnât corrupt
in response to a journalist who hadnât asked if it was. And he raised
the prospect of what happens at every COP conference happening here  â
negotiations overrunning. He said talks might have to go into âextra timeâ
despite the COP Presidencyâs insistence that they will finish on Friday at 6pm. Here's a quick recap of the main points Boris Johnson made. He admits whether we can keep to the 1.5C temperature rise target is ""in the balance"". During his speech, and in answers to journalists, he also says:  The PM says it is frustrating ""to see countries that have spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back"" for signing that agreement now ""quietly edging towards default"". But Johnson adds that, as seen in Glasgow, the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change. ""It is now within reach,"" he says. He concludes by saying: ""So my question to my fellow world leaders as we enter the last hours of COP26 is: will you help us do that? Will you help us grasp the opportunity or will you stand in the way?"" This video can not be played WATCH: Johnson warns of 'immense' backlash if negotiations fail After his statement pushing for further climate action and taking a handful of questions from journalists, the PM ends his press conference. ""I'm very sorry to tell you I have to go and catch a climate-friendly means of transport back to London,"" he says, giving a thumbs up and leaving the stage. Johnson, who went to Glasgow today by train, faced criticism last week for flying back from the summit. Jitendra Joshi from AFP asks the PM what tangible difference his presence at the summit has made and if positive at all why doesn't he stay until the end of get the ball over the line. And he asks if the PM is confident that his own actions as an MP and minister would pass any standards investigation. The PM says all his declarations conform to the rules and are there to be studied. He says what he's tried to do at COP26 today is to listen to what the NGOs have to say and speak to ministerial negotiating teams and encourage them to make progress. They've been working unbelievably hard but progress will depend on finance, he says. The Telegraph newspaper asks Mr Johnson what his message would be to voters about headlines saying Tory sleaze has
returned. On COP, the newspaper asks if he has any messages for specific countries about their responsibilities and actions at the conference. ""I genuinely
believe the UK is not remotely a corrupt country, nor do I believe our institutions
are corrupt,"" Johnson says. ""We have a very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media - and I think everyone can see that."" Johnson then adds he doesn't want to single out any country for ""chivvying and hectoring"". But he does call on leaders to call up their negotiators and urge them ""to make progress"". Boris Johnson is asked by ITV's Robert Peston about what can be done in the remaining days of the conference to keep the ambition of capping the global temperature rise at 1.5C alive. The prime minister says ""we're now finding things tough"" after an initial surge of progress  in the first few days of the conference. ""But that doesn't mean it's impossible,"" he says of the temperature goal, again urging world leaders to call their negotiators with more leverage power. ""I still think we can achieve it but I'm not going to pretend to you - by any means - that it is a done deal,"" he adds. Sky's political editor Beth Rigby asks if the PM accepts that the summit could end up as the start of many months of negotiations. Johnson says the summit is ""not going to fix it in one go, we are not going to arrest climate change right here, right now"". But if things go well in the remaining hours, there is the possibility that we will come away from this with the first genuine roadmap to tackle climate change, he says. Rigby also asks if Johnson believes MPs have been putting their political roles first. He says he will not comment on individual cases but, those who do break the rules and do not put constituents first, should face appropriate sanctions and punishment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"PM urges climate action as draft decision publishedAs a draft decision on COP26's outcome is revealed, Boris Johnson says states must unite to stop warming.","Prime Minister Boris Johnson is returning to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - urging nations to ""pull out all the stops"" to limit warming. The first draft of an agreement setting out how countries will cut emissions to avoid temperature rises of above 1.5C has been published. The agreement - or ""cover decision"" - sets out what negotiators hope will be the outcome of the COP26 talks. It encourages richer countries to scale up support for poorer nations. World headed for 2.4C warming despite COP - report Rich countries 'push back' on climate loss payment The seven-page draft agreement focuses on adaptation - helping countries deal with the effects of climate change - and finance, a controversial issue because poorer countries blame richer countries for not contributing enough. The document says meeting the goal to limit global warming to 1.5C - which countries pledged to try to pursue under the Paris climate accord - needs meaningful and effective action in ""this critical decade"". The agreement, which was published by the UK Cop26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century. The document may be just seven pages long but it attempts to steer COP26 towards a series of significant steps that will prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century. Perhaps the most important part of that is getting countries to improve their carbon cutting plans. To that end this draft decision urges parties to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally-determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022"". It will be interesting to see how countries such as China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia respond to this request to put new plans on the table by the end of next year. There is some comfort for developing countries to see that their financial needs are recognised as countries are asked to mobilise climate finance ""beyond $100bn a year"" and the draft welcomes steps to put in place a much larger, though as yet unspecified, figure for support from 2025. Loss and damage, an issue of key importance to the developing world, is included in the draft with encouragement to richer countries to scale up their action and support including finance for poorer nations. The document also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue. Campaigners will welcome the inclusion and will hope it survives into the final text. Despite the promises made at the summit so far,the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warmingabove pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker. A global average temperature rise of just 2C could mean a billion people are affected by fatal heat and humidity, the Met Office has warned. Ahead of his return to the summit, Mr Johnson said: ""Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change. There's still much to do."" The prime minister said he would be meeting ministers and negotiators to hear about the progress made and where gaps must be bridged. ""This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people,"" he said. ""We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5C within our grasp."" A coalition of nations which are vulnerable to climate change, along with the US and European nations, is pressing for countries to submit action plans in the next year in line with limiting warming to 1.5C, and by 2023 to produce their long-term plans to meet the target. The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week: More than 100 world leaders promised toend and reverse deforestationby 2030, including Brazil, home to the Amazon rainforest The US and the EU announced a global partnership tocut emissions of the greenhouse gas methaneby 2030 - reducing methane in the atmosphere seen as one of the best ways to quickly reduce global warming More than 40 countries committedto move away from coal- but the world's biggest users like China and the US did not sign up Some new pots of money were announced to help developing countries adapt to climate change and deal with the damage and loss it brings - butmany say it's not enough With Wednesday named as transport day at COP26, the UK announced that new heavy goods vehicles sold from 2040 will need to have zero emissions. Thirty countries have agreed to work together to increase the use of zero emissions vehicles, while plans for ""green shipping corridors"" to help a shift towards zero-emissions vessels are also due to be unveiled. Another 14 states which are responsible for more than 40% of global aviation emissions have committed to a new decarbonisation target. But the UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said travel, including flying, should be ""guilt-free"" and said the government did not see aviation as ""the ultimate evil"". He told the Daily Telegraph,externalthat changes to how we live our lives should not mean ""the inability to go and visit you friends and family and do business"".

COP26 draft deal calls for stronger carbon targetsThe document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming.World,"Countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit. The document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming. It also says countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of next year. Critics have said the draft pact does not go far enough but others welcomed its focus on the 1.5C target. The document, which has been published by the UK COP26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. COP26 president Alok Sharma said he expected ""near final texts"" to be published overnight, adding that the agreement that comes out of the conference would ""set the future for our children and grandchildren"". The horse trading begins as first COP26 text is released World headed for 2.4C warming despite COP - report Rich countries 'push back' on climate loss payment Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century. With the world off track to meet the goal, the draft document urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C or 1.5C by the end of 2022. Loss and damage - an issue of key importance to the developing world - has been included in the draft, calling for more support from developed countries and other organisations to address the damage caused by extreme weather and rising seas in vulnerable nations. It also recognises that more finance is needed for developing countries beyond the long-promised $100bn a year by 2020, which will not be delivered until at least 2022. But campaigners say these parts of the text are weak and essentially a ""box ticking exercise"". The document also calls on countries to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue. It also asks UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to convene world leaders in 2023 to consider how efforts to reach targets for 2030 are shaping up. Some 200 countries are meeting at COP to try to keep the lid on rising temperatures. Today, a document that forms the basis of what they could sign up to in Glasgow has been released by the hosts of the conference, the UK presidency. It sums up everything that has been discussed so far, but is very much a draft. There are bits missing and a number of contentious issues, which could get strengthened or watered down over the next few days. The reference to phasing out fossil fuels will undoubtedly be opposed by some nations. And countries vulnerable to the most destructive effects of climate change will want assurances that more money is coming their way to help protect their people against rising sea levels, drought and storms. At COP26 nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and getting a consensus among so many countries is never easy. COP veterans expect ""one hell of a fight"" ahead - with all to play for in the next few days. The World Wide Fund for Nature said the call for enhanced 2030 targets and references to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, among other proposals, ""must stick"". Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF Global Lead Climate & Energy said it was essential ministers worked to include ""a clear plan to close the 2030 ambition gap and the timeframe to do this"", adding that the draft text ""must be a floor not a ceiling"". But there have been warnings that there would be opposition to the idea of coming back with new plans next year. David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute, said: ""The Saudis and Russians have been quite clear on that, others have been less blunt."" He added many of the other countries pushing back were vulnerable and either did not produce a large percentage of global emissions or had ""very limited resources to develop nationally-determined contributions and then to implement them"". The Alliance of Small Island States, whose members are among the nations least responsible for climate change, said the text needed to be strengthened in ""key areas"" to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable countries, particularly on finance. And Jennifer Morgan, from Greenpeace International, said the draft deal was ""not a plan to solve the climate crisis"" but an agreement that ""we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to COP26 on Wednesday Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to ""take charge of a summit that is not on track to deliver"". ""We are miles off where we need to be in the halving of emissions required by 2030,"" he said. ""It's time the government faced this truth, stopped the greenwash, and put maximum pressure on all parties to step up and agree a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive."" Ina video made on the train up to Glasgow,externalas the UK prime minister returned to COP26, Boris Johnson said all countries had made ""significant progress"" in the last few days but there was ""still a long way to go"". No 10 said that Mr Johnson spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia earlier on Wednesday about the country's climate pledges and the need to make ""progress in negotiations"" taking place in Glasgow. Saudi Arabia was among a number of countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels,according to leaked documents. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of COP26, including on finalising the outstanding elements of the Paris rulebook. ""The prime minister said all countries needed to come to the table with increased ambition if we are to keep the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive."" Research published at the summit on Tuesday indicated the short-term plans put in place by countries would see a rise of 2.4C. While about 140 nations have pledged to reach net zero emissions by around the middle of the century, scientists have said their short-term plans for 2030 are not strong enough to limit the rise in temperatures.

Harry says he warned Twitter ahead of Capitol riot,"This video can not be played Watch Prince Harry say that he warned Twitter it was allowing a coup, during WIRED's RE:WIRED Conference The Duke of Sussex has said he warned Twitter boss Jack Dorsey about political unrest in the US - just a day before the deadly 6 January riots. ""I warned him his platform was allowing a coup to be staged,"" Prince Harry said at the RE:WIRED tech forum in the US. ""That email was sent the day before. And then it happened and I haven't heard from him since,"" the duke said. He was speaking at a session discussing whether social media was contributing to misinformation and online hatred. Harry promises to share 'highs and lows' in memoir Harry: Heavy drinking masked pain of mumâs death Mr Dorsey, who is Twitter's chief executive officer, has so far made no public comments on the issue. Prince Harry, who now lives with his wife the Duchess of Sussex in California, appeared at Tuesday's session via video chat as a guest speaker. He was introduced as the co-founder of the Archewell organisation. The duke used his personal experience with online hatred and the press to reflect that social media companies were not doing enough to stop the spread of misinformation. He said the internet was ""being defined by hate, division and lies"", adding: ""That can't be right."" His appearance via video chat comes two weeks after a data analytics company alleged that 70% of the hate directed towards the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on Twitter was generated by just 55 accounts.

Meanwhile, investigations into what happened on 6 January, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol building in Washington DC and disrupted the official certification of Joe Biden's victory in the White House race, are continuing. More than 670 people have been charged with taking part. On Tuesday,a congressional committee investigating the riots summoned more of Mr Trump's closest aides to give evidence. Among the latest batch is a former White House press secretary, a senior policy adviser and personal assistants. The inquiry is trying to find out if Mr Trump had foreknowledge of the attack.

Autistic man goes home after 15 years in hospital,"The 32-year-old ""first went into hospital when he was 17 because he tried to self-harm"", says Mrs Clarke A man with autism who has spent nearly half his life detained in a mental health hospital has been released after a long campaign by his mother. Ryan Clarke, 32, had been in hospital since 2006. His mother, Sharon, from Doncaster said he was ""over the moon"" to return home after 15 years. In July the National Autistic Society (NAS) said the number of autistic people confined to mental health units in England was a ""national scandal"". Mr Clarke was admitted to hospital over concerns he would self-harm. He was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia, but received a revised diagnosis of autism when he was 28. Until Monday he had spent the past five years in a forensic psychiatry unit, which also cared for patients with criminal convictions. Mrs Clarke said her son was ""ecstatic"" to have been discharged and would now live independently in his own accommodation with carers. ""He was over the moon, he loved it,"" she said. Sharon Clarke and her husband, Peter, said Ryan was ""excited"" to be home after spending 15 years detained in a hospital Autism is a lifelong developmental disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world. It is a spectrum condition and affects people in different ways. Patients can be admitted to hospital due to the lack of a care package, the need for family or carers to have some respite or because an autistic individual has mental health problems. Mrs Clarke, who is originally from Hull but lives in Doncaster, said she had fought ""tooth and nail"" for her son over the past 15 years. ""He's autistic and he has repetitive phrases but I just think that was his coping mechanism whilst he was in hospital. Now I think that will stop. It will fade until it's no more. ""He will have bad days but they'll get fewer and fewer."" Her husband, Peter, said his step-son was ""so happy"" to live a ""normal life"". ""We thought he'd be overwhelmed but actually he took it really well, in his stride, and he just got so excited he wanted to do everything at once and see everything at once,"" he said. ""But he was just laughing and dancing and really happy."" NHS figures show the number of autistic patients detained in hospital rose from 1,105 to 1,215 between 2015 and 2021. Speaking at the time, the Department of Health and Social Care said it was investing Â£62m in community services and supporting discharges from hospitals.

LiveLiveUK seeks an end to petrol-powered cars10 minutes ago,"China and the US pledge to work together on climate action, saying they recognise ""the urgency of the climate crisis"" The two countries are the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and US climate envoy John Kerry says it marks a ""new step"" The BBC's environment correspondent says regardless of the agreement's contents, it hands COP26 a boost Negotiations are going into overdrive in Glasgow to try and secure an ambitious agreement before COP26 ends on Friday UK PM Boris Johnson earlier urged delegates to ""bridge the gap"" between long-term goals and immediate action to ""keep 1.5 alive"" A draft agreement calls on governments to strengthen their climate targets by the end of 2022, putting pressure on big emitters Saudi Arabia denies it is obstructing progress towards a strong deal, calling such allegations ""a cheat and a lie"" Edited by Marie Jackson We are ending our live coverage of COP26 for the day - but will be back again tomorrow. Wednesday's live page was edited by Lauren Turner and Marie Jackson. Our writers today were Alex Kleiderman, Paul McLaren, Toby Luckhurst, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Max Mazta. It's been a busy day at COP26. Here's what's been happening: The final question is about the US's ability to deliver on its own climate promises under the Paris Agreement. Kerry says: ""The answer is yes we will."" He says the ""aggressive"" $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill just passed will have many of the things the US needs to do to help climate change such as electric charging stations across the country. He says 50% of all the cars sold in the US in 2030 will be electric and by 2035 hopefully all of them. US climate envoy John Kerry cracks a slight joke while commenting on when both countries expect Chinese greenhouse gas emissions to peak. ""President Xi has set a time frame for when he sees a peak. We have had lots of discussions about peaking. ""We peaked out on peaking."" ""We embraced, I think, what we know to be the science,"" he continues, adding that there is a chance that the data is wrong about when emissions will peak. China has said that they expect emissions to peak by 2030, if not before. The next question is from Reuters news agency which asks how the US addressed the issue of China's use of forced labour for building solar panels? He says: ""We are honest about the differences...but that's not my lane here. My job is to be the climate guy and stay focused on trying to move the climate agenda forward."" He says the presidents made it clear when they talked in February that while they have differences, it was important to focus on global crises. Now to questions at the US press conference. The first is whether the deal includes anything on the use of coal in China. John Kerry says China has laid out its current timetable and the things its going to do to reduce emissions. But what this agreement does is underscores that there is a plan in place, he says. He reads what he calls some ""important paragraphs"" about the intention of the two sides to continue concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions - but does not specifically mention coal. He says: ""But the whole point of this is that the steps we are taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us and others to be able to accelerate their efforts."" Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Perhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate actionin the 2020s. If the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical. While China has been reluctant to take action to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action. So the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms. The agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date and what science says is necessary for a safer world. Closing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow. The optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost. ""Now, with this announcement we've arrived at a new step,"" Mr Kerry continues, calling this moment a ""roadmap"" for the future. This statement makes it ""an imperative to co-operate,"" he says, referring to the deal that the US and China have just agreed. The US climate envoy adds that both sides have agreed to ""work together to limit methane emissions"". He said that China's pledge to create ""a comprehensive and ambitious national action plan on methane"" will have a ""significant effect"" on the climate crisis. ""The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done."" He appeals to all countries to work together, as the two largest emitters are doing today, and adds ""that he looks forward to stepping up our work with China"".  John Kerry, the US climate envoy, is speaking in more detail about the US-China climate deal. He says it sets out how together the nations will take action at COP26 as well as in the years to come. He says US President Biden and China's President Xi had a conversation a few weeks ago and they agreed to work together to raise climate ambition. He says the US and Chinese teams have worked together for months and have met 30 times both virtually and in person. They've agreed to a basic framework and shared desire for success on mitigation, adaptation, support and all of the key issues. The deal is a roadmap for our present and future collaboration on this issue, he says. ""We need to do it far faster in this decisive decade - not because China or the US say that we must - but because science says we must,"" he says. The text of the US-China climate deal has just been released. The bilateral statement says both sides ""recognise the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"" and will work to address the issue together. The document says that both sides will ""recall their firm commitment to work together"" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. They also call for ""stepped-up efforts"" to close the ""significant gap"" that remains to achieve that goal. Both sides pledge to co-operate on regulatory standards, the transition to clean energy, de-carbonisation and ""green design and renewable resource utilisation"". They also pledge to tackle methane emissions. China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The deal was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a ""national plan"" to address methane. The document says that both also pledge to form a working group that will meet regularly to discuss climate solutions. We're hearing more from China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua on details of the new US-China declaration. It appears to be quite thin on specific details and concrete targets. Calling climate change an ""existential"" crisis for humanity, Xie says the declaration will address clean energy, clean coal, methane reduction and banning deforestation. China will ""develop a national plan"" on methane, he says, and encourage ""joint research"" on the greenhouse gas. The two sides are also committing to ""strengthen goals"" on deforestation, he adds. ""In areas of climate change there is more agreement between China and US than divergence,"" Xie says.  The US and China have released a rare joint declaration pledging action on climate change. The document, called ""enhancing climate action in the 2020s"", commits the countries to develop long-term strategies to reach net-zero. Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate negotiator, is explaining what's in the statement at a press conference in Glasgow. He says the declaration - agreed this afternoon - commits the two countries to ""concrete measures"" to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming below 2C and ""pursuing efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C by the end of the century. ""We committed to adopt enhanced climate actions  in order to achieve the Paris agreement goal and strengthen its implementation,"" he adds. Some unexpected news this evening. We are now expecting a joint declaration on climate action from China and the US shortly. These two countries are the world's largest emitters of carbon dioxide. A spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation said China's top envoy would speak at 18:00 GMT. It's unclear what will be announced and it looks like even though it's a ""joint declaration"" that the delegations will hold separate press briefings, with the US following at 18:30. We'll bring you the latest as we get it. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent Boris Johnson
called on world leaders to give their negotiating teams in Glasgow more leeway
to reach a deal. He didnât name
any countries as blockers but he seemed to pin the blame for any hold-ups on
richer countries who had ""patted themselves on the back"" after the Paris
climate change agreement was negotiated in 2015 but had ""defaulted"" on their
promises to developing countries since then. He then
clarified that progress basically came down to one thing: money. But he must be
worried about what the current saga around MPs' second jobs is doing to the
host countryâs international reputation, asserting that the UK wasnât corrupt
in response to a journalist who hadnât asked if it was. And he raised
the prospect of what happens at every COP conference happening here  â
negotiations overrunning. He said talks might have to go into âextra timeâ
despite the COP Presidencyâs insistence that they will finish on Friday at 6pm. Here's a quick recap of the main points Boris Johnson made. He admits whether we can keep to the 1.5C temperature rise target is ""in the balance"". During his speech, and in answers to journalists, he also says:  The PM says it is frustrating ""to see countries that have spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back"" for signing that agreement now ""quietly edging towards default"". But Johnson adds that, as seen in Glasgow, the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change. ""It is now within reach,"" he says. He concludes by saying: ""So my question to my fellow world leaders as we enter the last hours of COP26 is: will you help us do that? Will you help us grasp the opportunity or will you stand in the way?"" This video can not be played WATCH: Johnson warns of 'immense' backlash if negotiations fail After his statement pushing for further climate action and taking a handful of questions from journalists, the PM ends his press conference. ""I'm very sorry to tell you I have to go and catch a climate-friendly means of transport back to London,"" he says, giving a thumbs up and leaving the stage. Johnson, who went to Glasgow today by train, faced criticism last week for flying back from the summit. Jitendra Joshi from AFP asks the PM what tangible difference his presence at the summit has made and if positive at all why doesn't he stay until the end of get the ball over the line. And he asks if the PM is confident that his own actions as an MP and minister would pass any standards investigation. The PM says all his declarations conform to the rules and are there to be studied. He says what he's tried to do at COP26 today is to listen to what the NGOs have to say and speak to ministerial negotiating teams and encourage them to make progress. They've been working unbelievably hard but progress will depend on finance, he says. The Telegraph newspaper asks Mr Johnson what his message would be to voters about headlines saying Tory sleaze has
returned. On COP, the newspaper asks if he has any messages for specific countries about their responsibilities and actions at the conference. ""I genuinely
believe the UK is not remotely a corrupt country, nor do I believe our institutions
are corrupt,"" Johnson says. ""We have a very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media - and I think everyone can see that."" Johnson then adds he doesn't want to single out any country for ""chivvying and hectoring"". But he does call on leaders to call up their negotiators and urge them ""to make progress"". Boris Johnson is asked by ITV's Robert Peston about what can be done in the remaining days of the conference to keep the ambition of capping the global temperature rise at 1.5C alive. The prime minister says ""we're now finding things tough"" after an initial surge of progress  in the first few days of the conference. ""But that doesn't mean it's impossible,"" he says of the temperature goal, again urging world leaders to call their negotiators with more leverage power. ""I still think we can achieve it but I'm not going to pretend to you - by any means - that it is a done deal,"" he adds. Sky's political editor Beth Rigby asks if the PM accepts that the summit could end up as the start of many months of negotiations. Johnson says the summit is ""not going to fix it in one go, we are not going to arrest climate change right here, right now"". But if things go well in the remaining hours, there is the possibility that we will come away from this with the first genuine roadmap to tackle climate change, he says. Rigby also asks if Johnson believes MPs have been putting their political roles first. He says he will not comment on individual cases but, those who do break the rules and do not put constituents first, should face appropriate sanctions and punishment. Â© 2025 BBC.

Wednesday's live page was edited by Lauren Turner and Marie Jackson. Our writers today were Alex Kleiderman, Paul McLaren, Toby Luckhurst, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Jen Meierhans, Jack Hunter and Max Mazta. It's been a busy day at COP26. Here's what's been happening: The final question is about the US's ability to deliver on its own climate promises under the Paris Agreement. Kerry says: ""The answer is yes we will."" He says the ""aggressive"" $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill just passed will have many of the things the US needs to do to help climate change such as electric charging stations across the country. He says 50% of all the cars sold in the US in 2030 will be electric and by 2035 hopefully all of them. US climate envoy John Kerry cracks a slight joke while commenting on when both countries expect Chinese greenhouse gas emissions to peak. ""President Xi has set a time frame for when he sees a peak. We have had lots of discussions about peaking. ""We peaked out on peaking."" ""We embraced, I think, what we know to be the science,"" he continues, adding that there is a chance that the data is wrong about when emissions will peak. China has said that they expect emissions to peak by 2030, if not before. The next question is from Reuters news agency which asks how the US addressed the issue of China's use of forced labour for building solar panels? He says: ""We are honest about the differences...but that's not my lane here. My job is to be the climate guy and stay focused on trying to move the climate agenda forward."" He says the presidents made it clear when they talked in February that while they have differences, it was important to focus on global crises. Now to questions at the US press conference. The first is whether the deal includes anything on the use of coal in China. John Kerry says China has laid out its current timetable and the things its going to do to reduce emissions. But what this agreement does is underscores that there is a plan in place, he says. He reads what he calls some ""important paragraphs"" about the intention of the two sides to continue concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions - but does not specifically mention coal. He says: ""But the whole point of this is that the steps we are taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us and others to be able to accelerate their efforts."" Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Perhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate actionin the 2020s. If the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical. While China has been reluctant to take action to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action. So the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms. The agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date and what science says is necessary for a safer world. Closing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow. The optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost. ""Now, with this announcement we've arrived at a new step,"" Mr Kerry continues, calling this moment a ""roadmap"" for the future.

He says what he's tried to do at COP26 today is to listen to what the NGOs have to say and speak to ministerial negotiating teams and encourage them to make progress. They've been working unbelievably hard but progress will depend on finance, he says. The Telegraph newspaper asks Mr Johnson what his message would be to voters about headlines saying Tory sleaze has
returned. On COP, the newspaper asks if he has any messages for specific countries about their responsibilities and actions at the conference. ""I genuinely
believe the UK is not remotely a corrupt country, nor do I believe our institutions
are corrupt,"" Johnson says. ""We have a very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media - and I think everyone can see that."" Johnson then adds he doesn't want to single out any country for ""chivvying and hectoring"". But he does call on leaders to call up their negotiators and urge them ""to make progress"". Boris Johnson is asked by ITV's Robert Peston about what can be done in the remaining days of the conference to keep the ambition of capping the global temperature rise at 1.5C alive. The prime minister says ""we're now finding things tough"" after an initial surge of progress  in the first few days of the conference. ""But that doesn't mean it's impossible,"" he says of the temperature goal, again urging world leaders to call their negotiators with more leverage power. ""I still think we can achieve it but I'm not going to pretend to you - by any means - that it is a done deal,"" he adds. Sky's political editor Beth Rigby asks if the PM accepts that the summit could end up as the start of many months of negotiations. Johnson says the summit is ""not going to fix it in one go, we are not going to arrest climate change right here, right now"". But if things go well in the remaining hours, there is the possibility that we will come away from this with the first genuine roadmap to tackle climate change, he says. Rigby also asks if Johnson believes MPs have been putting their political roles first. He says he will not comment on individual cases but, those who do break the rules and do not put constituents first, should face appropriate sanctions and punishment. Â© 2025 BBC.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala ties the knotThe activist and her partner Asser Malik celebrate a nikkah ceremony with family in Birmingham.Birmingham & Black Country,"Malala Yousafzai tweeted that it was ""a precious day"" in her life Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has ""tied the knot"" with her partner during an Islamic ceremony in Birmingham. She and Asser Malik took part in a nikkah ceremony, where bride and groom consent to be married. The 24-year-old activist said it was ""a precious day"" in her life. The Pakistani women's rights activist found refuge in the West Midlands after being shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012. ""Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life,"" she tweeted on Tuesday, sharing how they had taken part in a ""small nikkah ceremony with family"". ""We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead,"" she added. She posted several photos from the ceremony On Wednesday afternoon, her new husband tweeted a picture of the couple and said in Malala he had found a ""beautiful and kind partner"" and he was ""so excited to spend the rest of our life together"".

Malala, now 24, was 15 when she was targeted by the Taliban in Pakistan for speaking up for the right of girls to be educated. She survived the assault, in which a militant boarded her school bus in north-western Swat valley and opened fire, wounding two of her school friends as well as Malala. After recovering from her near-fatal injuries, she and her family relocated to Birmingham,which she later called ""a second home"". Aged 17, she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She went on to study at Oxford University, and has become a leading human rights campaigner. Since graduating, Malala has called forbetter support for Afghan refugees,signed a contract with Apple TV+to produce documentaries and appearedon the cover of British Vogue, all while continuing her work to improve girls' access to education. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Asser Malik is closely associated with cricket and is the High Performance General Manager of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). A graduate of Lahore's renowned Aitchison College and then Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), he was also associated with the Pakistan Super League franchise Multan Sultans before joining the PCB, for which he prepared the player development program. While it is not clear how long the couple have known each other, there are pictures of them cheering on Pakistan at Birmingham's Edgbaston Cricket Ground posted on Mr Malik's Instagram account in June 2019. The news of the ceremony was liked tens of thousands of times on social media On its own, a nikkah is not legally recognised under English law and it is unclear whether the couple had a separate civil ceremony. Malala has previously voiced her misgivings around marriage. In an interview with Vogue in July, she said: ""I still don't understand why people have to get married."" ""If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can't it just be a partnership?"" she continued. ""My mum is likeâ¦ 'Don't you dare say anything like that! You have to get married, marriage is beautiful'."" The news of the ceremony was liked tens of thousands of times by fans online, with thousands wishing the couple well. Among those to offer their congratulations on Twitter were Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Jemima Goldsmith and MP Sajid Javid.

"Apple's original computer fetches $400,000","The sold Apple-1 computer has only had two owners An original Apple computer built by firm co-founders Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1976 has fetched $400,000 (Â£294,990) at auction in the US. The rare Hawaiian koa wood-cased Apple-1 - still functioning - is one of only 200 made and sold in kit form. The computer has only had two owners, a college professor and his student to whom he sold the machine for $650, said John Moran Auctioneers in California. The sale included user manuals and Apple software on two cassette tapes. 'First Apple computer' reaches $815,000 Apple's market value hits $1 trillion ""This is kind of the holy grail for vintage electronics and computer tech collectors,"" Apple-1 expert Corey Cohen told the Los Angeles Times ahead of Tuesday's auction in the city of Monrovia, near Los Angeles. ""That really makes it exciting for a lot of people."" The koa wood case of the auctioned model was added by a pioneering early computer retailer, ByteShop, in California, which took delivery of around 50 of the Apple-1 machines. Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded Apple on 1 April 1976 in a garage in California. To help finance the Apple 1 production, Jobs sold his VW Microbus, while Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500. In 1976, the machines were sold for $666.66, reportedly because Wozniak liked repeating numbers. It is believed there are around 20 such computers in the world still capable of functioning. The auctioned machine is not the highest-grossing Apple-1 computer - that distinction belongs to a working version that sold for $905,000 at a Bonhams auction in New York in 2014.

"Pull out the stops, urges PM as he returns to COP","Prime Minister Boris Johnson is returning to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - urging nations to ""pull out all the stops"" to limit warming. The first draft of an agreement setting out how countries will cut emissions to avoid temperature rises of above 1.5C has been published. The agreement - or ""cover decision"" - sets out what negotiators hope will be the outcome of the COP26 talks. It encourages richer countries to scale up support for poorer nations. World headed for 2.4C warming despite COP - report Rich countries 'push back' on climate loss payment The seven-page draft agreement focuses on adaptation - helping countries deal with the effects of climate change - and finance, a controversial issue because poorer countries blame richer countries for not contributing enough. The document says meeting the goal to limit global warming to 1.5C - which countries pledged to try to pursue under the Paris climate accord - needs meaningful and effective action in ""this critical decade"". The agreement, which was published by the UK Cop26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century. The document may be just seven pages long but it attempts to steer COP26 towards a series of significant steps that will prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century. Perhaps the most important part of that is getting countries to improve their carbon cutting plans. To that end this draft decision urges parties to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally-determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022"". It will be interesting to see how countries such as China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia respond to this request to put new plans on the table by the end of next year. There is some comfort for developing countries to see that their financial needs are recognised as countries are asked to mobilise climate finance ""beyond $100bn a year"" and the draft welcomes steps to put in place a much larger, though as yet unspecified, figure for support from 2025. Loss and damage, an issue of key importance to the developing world, is included in the draft with encouragement to richer countries to scale up their action and support including finance for poorer nations. The document also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue. Campaigners will welcome the inclusion and will hope it survives into the final text. Despite the promises made at the summit so far,the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warmingabove pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker. A global average temperature rise of just 2C could mean a billion people are affected by fatal heat and humidity, the Met Office has warned. Ahead of his return to the summit, Mr Johnson said: ""Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change. There's still much to do."" The prime minister said he would be meeting ministers and negotiators to hear about the progress made and where gaps must be bridged. ""This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people,"" he said. ""We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5C within our grasp."" A coalition of nations which are vulnerable to climate change, along with the US and European nations, is pressing for countries to submit action plans in the next year in line with limiting warming to 1.5C, and by 2023 to produce their long-term plans to meet the target. The summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week: More than 100 world leaders promised toend and reverse deforestationby 2030, including Brazil, home to the Amazon rainforest The US and the EU announced a global partnership tocut emissions of the greenhouse gas methaneby 2030 - reducing methane in the atmosphere seen as one of the best ways to quickly reduce global warming More than 40 countries committedto move away from coal- but the world's biggest users like China and the US did not sign up Some new pots of money were announced to help developing countries adapt to climate change and deal with the damage and loss it brings - butmany say it's not enough With Wednesday named as transport day at COP26, the UK announced that new heavy goods vehicles sold from 2040 will need to have zero emissions. Thirty countries have agreed to work together to increase the use of zero emissions vehicles, while plans for ""green shipping corridors"" to help a shift towards zero-emissions vessels are also due to be unveiled. Another 14 states which are responsible for more than 40% of global aviation emissions have committed to a new decarbonisation target. But the UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said travel, including flying, should be ""guilt-free"" and said the government did not see aviation as ""the ultimate evil"". He told the Daily Telegraph,externalthat changes to how we live our lives should not mean ""the inability to go and visit you friends and family and do business"".

"Toddlers may be getting hooked on sugar in snacksSome weaning snacks encourage a sweet tooth from an early age, say health campaigners.Health","Some snacks sold as weaning or infant foods contain alarming amounts of sugar which could encourage a sweet tooth from an early age, according to health campaigners. Action on Sugar,externalanalysed 73 baby and toddler products on sale in UK shops. Heinz Farley's Mini Rusks Original, for example, contain the equivalent of two teaspoons of sugar per serving. Organix Banana Soft Oaty Bars, which are sweetened with apple juice concentrate, contain similar. Kiddylicious Banana Crispy Tiddlers contain more than 50% sugar - 59g for every 100g of the product. Overall, 27 of the products tested would qualify for a ""red"" or ""high"" sugar on the front-of-pack traffic light food labelling system. Only six met the criteria for a ""green"" or ""low"" label for sugars. And 36 of the products claimed - on the packet - that their sweet snacks were suitable for babies under the age of 12 months, even though sugar-sweetened food and drink should be avoided in this age group. Even if the sugar comes from added fruit juice, it is not good for babies and toddlers, says Action on Sugar. This group includes sugar added to food or drinks - at home, or by a chef or other food manufacturer It also includes sugars that naturally occur in foods such as honey, syrups (maple, agave and golden), nectars (blossom), and unsweetened fruit juices, vegetable juices and smoothies Sugar found naturally in milk, fruit and vegetables, does not count as free sugars but is included in the ""total"" sugar figure on food labels Dr Kawther Hashem, Campaign Lead at Action on Sugar, and Research Fellow at Queen Mary University of London, said it was ""ludicrous"" that certain food companies were being allowed to promote high-sugar sweet snacks to parents with very young children, despite them being aware that babies and toddlers shouldn't be having any free sugars. She said: ""Babies can have a preference for sweet foods, due to milk being ever so slightly sweet, but liking sugary foods is something they only learn by eating sugary foods. ""Some companies choose to encourage this preference further by providing lots of very sweet products from an early age. What we need is companies to make products with minimal amount of sugars, so young children can grow up enjoying less sweet foods."" Regularly consuming too much sugar at any age can cause health problems, including tooth decay and weight gain. Bridget Benelam from the British Nutrition Foundation said offering less sweet vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach, early on in weaning may help children learn to accept these flavours. Foods to avoid giving babies and young children,external How to start your baby on solid foods,external Concern too many babies overfed Adults should have no more than 30g of free sugars a day (seven sugar cubes) Children aged seven to ten should have no more than 24g (six sugar cubes) Children aged four to six should have no more than 19g (five sugar cubes) There's no guideline limit for children under the age of four, but it's recommended they avoid sugar-sweetened drinks and food with sugar added to it Nutritionist Holly Gabriel, from Action on Sugar, called for government regulation: ""The Government must release their long-awaited commercial baby food and drink guidelines, and make them mandatory to hold all companies to the same standard. ""The Government must also investigate the best way of labelling foods for babies and toddlers to provide better and more honest packaging for parents."" Heinz said: ""Sugar reduction is a key focus for Heinz for Baby and we are looking into ways to improve the products we make. Alongside the original rusks, Farley's offer a range of reduced-sugar rusks with 30% less sugar. ""The level of added sugars in these recipes is kept to a minimum consistent with the need to provide a texture which dissolves easily to avoid the risk of choking. Farley's Rusks are very different from typical biscuits, containing very little fat and no added salt."" Organix said: ""The majority of the sugar content within Organix Soft Oaty Bars comes from dried fruit which contains naturally occurring sugars, rather than the fruit juice concentrate which is used to hold all the ingredients together and to give a suitable texture for a child. ""Organix believes in using natural ingredients such as dried fruit which has the nutritional benefits of fibre, vitamins and minerals rather than using artificial sweeteners or table sugar. Fruit juice concentrate can also be used to provide flavour, and we clearly label the front of our packs to be transparent to parents.  This is part of our No Junk Promise.
