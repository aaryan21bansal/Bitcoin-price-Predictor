Trump: Virus task force to focus on reopening US,"President Trump said the White House task force would focus on ""opening up our country"" US President Donald Trump has said the coronavirus task force will shift its focus to reopening the economy, a day after suggesting it would be disbanded. Mr Trump said the group would ""continue on indefinitely"" and ""focus on safety [and] opening up our country"". It is not clear how exactly the task force will change but Mr Trump said ""we may add or subtract people to it"". New confirmed infections per day in the US currently top 20,000, and daily deaths exceed 1,000. US health officials have warned that the virus may spread as businesses begin to reopen. The US currently has 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 71,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University which is tracking the pandemic. In a series of tweets on Wednesday,external, Mr Trump said the task force had ""done a fantastic job of bringing together vast [and] highly complex resources"". He praised Vice-President Mike Pence, who heads the group, and said it had ""set a high standard for others to follow"". ""Because of this success, the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on safety & opening up our country again,"" Mr Trump said. This video can not be played Trump: 'Mike Pence and the taskforce have done a great job' His comments came a day after he suggested the task force, which is made up of medical professionals and other experts, might be disbanded. ""We're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening,"" Mr Trump told journalists on Tuesday. ""And we'll have a different group probably set up for that."" Mr Pence also told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday that the task force could soon be wound down. He said the Trump administration was ""starting to look at the Memorial Day [late May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage... our national response."" But - when asked about the apparent change in approach on Wednesday - Mr Trump said:  ""I had no idea how popular the task force is until... yesterday when I started talking about winding [it] down."" Is a task force with different people and a different focus still the same task force? This sounds like a philosophical question but it is one that has very real implications for the direction of US coronavirus policy. On Tuesday, Vice-President Mike Pence confirmed the White House was considering winding down its coronavirus task force, perhaps as early as the end of May, shifting public health responsibilities to subsidiary agencies. Mr Trump walked that back a bit on Wednesday morning but the bottom line is the same. The group's members may change, and its priorities will shift. However the president wants to dress it up, it's clear that even while the virus continues to spread throughout the nation, the White House urgently wants to prioritise addressing the economic fallout of the pandemic. The state of the economy, after all, frequently determines the fate of a president seeking re-election. And if Trump can't pull the nation out of its fiscal nosedive soon, his November general election outlook appears grim. The public health wisdom of the White House's move may be debatable, but the political calculus is clear. The task force was set up on 29 January. It reports to the president and co-ordinates with medical institutes, political staff and state governors. The group also consults medical experts to formulate national guidelines on social distancing. Its members include more than 20 experts and leading administration officials. The White House said the task force's duty was to ""lead the administration's efforts to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus"" and provide the public with information. Mr Trump's once-daily task force briefings have become increasingly scarce since he was widely condemned by the medical community for pondering at the podium last monthwhether injecting bleach might kill the virus. Dr Deborah Birx is the task force's response co-ordinator. The president was asked on Tuesday whether she and another high-profile member, Dr Anthony Fauci, would still be involved in efforts to address the coronavirus. ""They will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field,"" the president said.  He later added that new members of the task force would be announced by Monday. Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak Why is there a US backlash to masks? 'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' Critics have accused Mr Trump of sacrificing Americans' public health in his eagerness to reopen the US economy ahead of his re-election battle in November. In Arizona on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that Democrats were hoping his coronavirus policy would fail ""so they can win the election"". However, it will be up to individual states to determine how they reopen. Some Democratic governors in badly hit states have been cautious, calling for more testing and other safeguards before easing lockdowns. Other states, many led by Republicans in the south and mid-west, have already begun lifting restrictions. Not yet. Besides New York, which is still the US epicentre despite an ongoing drop in new cases, the level of infection continues to climb across much of the country. Many states that have allowed some business to resume - including Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana -Â are seeing more new cases reported daily. While some cities such as New York, New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement, others like Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago are seeing the caseload rise every day. This video can not be played Coronavirus: When might Hollywood reopen for business? According to a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), more than 3,000 people may be killed by the virus each day by next month. The White House has dismissed the report as inaccurate, with Mr Trump saying it describes a scenario in which Americans make no effort to mitigate the spread of the infection. On Sunday, the president increased his forecast for the number of US pandemic deaths to 100,000, after saying two weeks earlier that it would be fewer than 60,000. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, a public forecast model that has been frequently cited by the White House, now estimates that Covid-19 will account for 135,000 American deaths by 4 August. This more than doubles its 17 April forecast. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continued to criticise China over its handling of the outbreak. ""China could have prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""China could have spared the world a descent into global economic malaise. They had a choice but instead [they] covered up the outbreak."" He did not provide evidence for his claim, which was the latest example of the US condemning Beijing's approach to the pandemic. Mr Pompeo earlier said - without going into specifics - that there was ""enormous evidence"" the coronavirus emanated from a laboratory in the city of Wuhan.Chinese state media later accused him of lying.

Ministers launch hardship fund for dairy farmers,"Dairy farmers in England can apply for up to Â£10,000 in cash payments under a scheme to support the industry during the coronavirus pandemic. Demand for dairy products in the hospitality sector has dropped with the closure of many cafes and restaurants. Producers will be eligible for aid to cover 70% of income they have lost during April and May. Ministers have already relaxed competition laws in a bid to help the industry. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said there would not be a cap on the number of farmers who can receive the payments. But farmers would have to demonstrate they had lost more than a quarter of their income in April and May to access the funding, the department added. Hardship payment for dairy farmers considered Dairy farmers told to cut milk supplies Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Some dairy farmers are having to throw away thousands of litres of fresh milk due to disruption to the supply chain caused by the virus. Whilst some have managed to redirect supplies towards supermarkets, falling demand has seen excess milk and therefore falling prices. The government has already relaxed competition rules to allow farmers to share staff and facilities with retailers in a bid to reroute produce. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Environment Secretary George Eustice says ministers were doing ""all we can"" to make sure dairy farmers are ""properly supported"" during the current crisis. ""We've already relaxed competition laws so dairy farmers can work together through the toughest months, but recognise there is more to be done,"" he added. Joe Stanley, vice-chair of the Leicestershire National Farmers Union, said the new funding was welcome but additional support ""shouldn't have taken this long"". Speaking to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) president said many farmers were in ""absolute crisis"". Minette Batters told MPs: ""We have got a lot of them on a relatively stabilised price of 15p per litre (of milk). That is about 10p and more below the cost of production. It is not a sustainable place to be."" Tom Hind, chief strategy officer for the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, also told the committee that dairy farmers had lost Â£7.4m collectively in April through milk price cuts alone - a figure that could rise to Â£14m in May. The move comes as a Â£1m advertising campaign is launched to try and persuade people to drink more milk at home. Joint funded by industry groups and the government, it will feature adverts on television and posted on social media. The NFU said the campaign would promote tea and coffee drinking as a ""centre point of most human connections"". The union's dairy board chairman Michael Oakes said the advertising drive would be a ""much-needed and timely boost for the dairy sector"".

Debenhams to close five more stores when lockdown ends,"Debenhams has confirmed that another five stores will not be re-opening after lockdown restrictions are lifted. The department store chain has struck deals with landlords to keep most of its 142 stores open, after it fell into administration for the second time. But five more stores will not reopen when the government lifts coronavirus restrictions on non-essential shops. It's understood the retailer has been unable to agree new terms with shopping centre owner Hammerson. The Debenhams stores affected are in the Bullring in Birmingham, The Oracle in Reading, Centrale in Croydon, Highcross in Leicester, and Silverburn in Glasgow. The BBC understands that around 1,000 jobs will be affected, including concession staff. Debenhams said in a statement: ""We can confirm that despite our best efforts, we have been unable to agree terms with Hammerson on our five stores in its shopping centres, and so they will not be reopening. ""We continue to engage in constructive talks with our landlords and have agreed terms on the vast majority of our stores, which we look forward to reopening when government restrictions allow"". Debenhams strikes deals to rescue most stores Coronavirus: Debenhams set to appoint administrators When Debenhams first collapsed in April last year, it agreed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with its landlords to cut costs in order to save the business. Under the agreement, the retailer would close 22 stores in 2020 and 28 stores in 2021. Last month, Debenhams still had 142 stores butit was forced to appoint administrators againto protect the business from its creditors as coronavirus forced it to temporarily shut its stores. It then accelerated negotiations with landlords to agree new terms and conditions, including a five month rent and service charge holiday. Debenhams has managed to strike deals on 120 stores. But over the course of the last few weeks, it's emerged a number of stores would close permanently once the government lifts restrictions on non-essential shops. A total of 15 stores are now set for closure, including the five outlets in Hammerson shopping centres. The BBC has approached Hammerson for comment. The retailer's Warrington store had been earmarked to shut but this has now been given a last minute reprieve. However, the future of five major Debenhams stores in Wales is still in doubt, unless the Welsh government reverses a decision on business rates relief. Debenhams is still in discussions with the remaining seven stores in its estate. The retailer is still trading online ""normally"" while its shops are closed. Like many other non essential retailers, it has furloughed the majority of its staff who are being paid under the government's coronavirus job retention scheme which pays 80% of a worker's salary up to Â£2,500 a month.

"Trumps says virus worse 'attack' than Pearl Harbor""There's never been an attack like this,"" says the president, blaming China for failing to stop it.","This video can not be played WATCH: Trump: 'This is worse than Pearl Harbor' US President Donald Trump has described the coronavirus pandemic as the ""worst attack"" ever on the United States, pointing the finger at China. Mr Trump said the outbreak had hit the US harder than the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in World War Two, or the 9/11 attacks two decades ago. His administration is weighing punitive actions against China over its early handling of the global emergency. Beijing says the US wants to distract from its own response to the pandemic. Since emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, the coronavirus is confirmed to have infected 1.2 million Americans, killing more than 73,000. Will we ever shake hands again? Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump said: ""We went through the worst attack we've ever had on our country, this is worst attack we've ever had. ""This is worse than Pearl Harbor, this is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack like this. ""And it should have never happened. Could've been stopped at the source. Could've been stopped in China. It should've been stopped right at the source. And it wasn't."" This video can not be played Life for asylum seekers in lockdown on the US-Mexico border Asked later by a reporter if he saw the pandemic as an actual act of war, Mr Trump indicated the outbreak was America's foe, rather than China. ""I view the invisible enemy [coronavirus] as a war,"" he said. ""I don't like how it got here, because it could have been stopped, but no, I view the invisible enemy like a war."" This video can not be played US shopping centres re-open: 'This is the best day ever' The deepening rift between Washington and Beijing was further underscored on Wednesday as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewed his rhetoric against China, accusing it of covering up the outbreak. He stuck by his so far unsubstantiated charge that there is ""enormous evidence"" the coronavirus hatched in a Chinese laboratory, even while acknowledging there is still uncertainty about its origins. ""Those statements are both true,"" America's top diplomat told the BBC. ""We don't have certainty and there is significant evidence that it came from a lab."" Chinese state mediaaccused him of lying. One of the most trusted US public health experts has said the best evidence indicates the virus was not made in a lab. Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of Mr Trump's coronavirus task force, said on Monday the illness appeared to have ""evolved in nature and then jumped species"". President Trump faces a tough re-election campaign in November, but the once humming US economy - which had been his main selling point - is currently in a coronavirus-induced coma. A Pew opinion survey last month found thattwo-thirds of Americans, a historic high,external, view China unfavourably. Butroughly the same margin of poll respondents,externalsaid they believed Mr Trump acted too slowly to contain the pandemic. As Mr Trump found his management of the crisis under scrutiny, he began labelling the outbreak ""the China virus"", but dropped that term last month days before speaking by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both Mr Trump and his likely Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, appear to be fastening on to China's unpopularity as an election issue, with each accusing the other of being a patsy for America's primary economic competitor. As the coronavirus began spreading in the US back in January, Mr Trump signed phase one of a trade deal with China that called a truce in their tariff war. The US president's hopes of sealing a more comprehensive phase two deal are now in limbo because of the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had prepared detailed guidance on how the nation's public places could reopen, but the White House decided against sharing it, US media report. The 17-page document,first reported by the Associated Press,external, has step-by-step guidelines on resuming operations at schools, restaurants, camps, day cares, churches, mass transport, and workplaces. Trump administration officials reportedly asked for changes to the guidelines, saying they were too specific as the virus is affecting regions differently. The White House's previously released guidance is much more vague than the CDC's. The president has repeatedly said state governors are in charge of their reopening process - though some leaders have faced criticism for easing restrictions even as case numbers rise.

"Uber axes 3,700 staff as trips drop in lockdowns","This video can not be played 'My income vanished overnight with no safety net' Uber has announced plans to cut 3,700 full-time staff - about 14% of its workforce - as business plunges following pandemic shutdowns. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also waive his base salary - set at $1m (Â£809,690) in 2019 - through to the year end. The announcements come a day ahead of the firm's quarterly results. Even before the pandemic, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn in 2019. Uber said the reductions will come from its customer support and recruiting teams, and would result in $20m in severance pay and other costs. Executives in March warned the firm had seen demand for its taxi services fall by more than 60% in coronavirus hotspots, though they said ordering via its Uber Eats food delivery service had increased. ""Since we don't know how long a recovery will take, we are taking steps to bring our costs in line with the size of our business today,"" the firm said in a statement on Wednesday. The Uber Eats food delivery service has seen increased demand Uber's business is heavily reliant on big cities, including some that have been most affected by the pandemic. Last year, four metro areas in the US, including New York and San Francisco, and London accounted for 23% of the money spent on the platform. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called the job cuts ""painful but necessary"", noting that both Uber and smaller rival Lyft face long-term difficulties as more people work from home and avoid taxis for fear of infection. ""Uber and Lyft face Herculean-like challenges looking ahead as the new reality will likely change the business models of these companies [and competitors] for the foreseeable future,"" he wrote in a note. On Wednesday, Lyft said it had seen a decline of more than 70% in trips on its platform as the US started to implement shutdown orders. It said it was taking aggressive cost-cutting steps to help the business survive. The firm last week announced plans to axe about 17% of its workforce or almost 1,000 employees, furlough another 300 people and reduce executive pay. ""We face a new reality,"" said co-founder Logan Green. ""We expect that rider demand for our platform will be down for the foreseeable future."" The reductions are a sign that the impact from the shutdowns is continuing to ripple out into the US economy, with economists now bracing for a prolonged slowdown rather than a quick rebound. On Wednesday, payrolls processor ADP reported that private employers in the US cut a record 20.2 million jobs last month - more than double the jobs lost in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. ""Job losses of this scale are unprecedented,"" said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

The Hopi Indian Reservation is in Arizona, US - the community need clean water, food and health supplies If you help someone during this pandemic, one day the favour might be returned. That's what two Native American communities in the US have learned. The Choctaw Nation sent $170 (around $5,000 in today's money) to Ireland in the 1840s when one million Irish people died during the potato famine. Their genorosity was sparked partly by the deaths of many Native Americans on the Trail of Tears, the forced displacement of 60,000 people. Now the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Reservation are badly affected by the coronavirus, partly due to a lack of clean water, and Irish people are recognising the old kindness by donating $100,000 to a fundraiser. One message, from Pat Hayes, read: âFrom Ireland, 170 years later, the favour is returned! To our Native American brothers and sisters in your moment of hardship.â The organisers of the fundraising,externalwrote to praise the âacts of kindness from indigenous ancestors passed being reciprocated nearly 200 years later through blood memory and interconnectedness.â  At a briefing on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the US had conducted 7.5m Covid-19 tests thus far. When asked why not every American was able to get a test yet, she said it was a ""myth"" that everyone needed testing. ""If we tested every single American in this country at this moment, weâd have to retest them an hour later and an hour after that, because at any moment you could theoretically contract this virus,"" McEnany said. ""The notion that everyone needs to be tested is simply nonsensical. The people who need to be tested are vulnerable populations."" The press secretary also repeated Trump's stance on masks, saying it's ""the choice of the individual"". Other key points: More on the situation in the US: Iceland has carried out extensive testing of its population of around 328,000 And now for some more positive news. Iceland says it has almost entirely eliminated its outbreak of coronavirus. Only two new cases have been confirmed in the past week and 97% of all infected patients have recovered. ""We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fastdeceleration of the pandemic in Iceland,"" said the country's chief epidemiologist, Thorolfur Gudnason. But he added it was very important to remain vigilant to minimise risks of further outbreaks. Iceland carried out very extensive testing of its population, so much so that anyone who wanted a test received one. Randomised tests showed that half of people showed no symptoms at all. Listen here to understand moreabout the country's approach.  Englandâs dairy farmers will be able to access up to Â£10,000 ($12,000) each to help them overcome the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the government has announced. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Our dairy industry plays a crucial role in feeding our nation and we're doing all we can to ensure they are properly supported during this time. ""Weâve already relaxed competition laws so dairy farmers can work together through the toughest months, but recognise there's more to be done. That's why we have kick-started a new campaign to boost milk consumption and announced a further package of funding.

We will continue to stand alongside our dairy farmers through this difficult period."" Last month, the BBC revealed that some dairy farmers werehaving to throw away thousands of litres of fresh milkbecause of the disruption to the supply chain caused by coronavirus.  This video can not be played Worst song possible plays as Trump tours mask plant As President Donald Trump touted plans to reopen the US economy while visiting a mask factory in Phoenix, Arizona, the song Live And Let Die from Guns 'N' Roses blared out over a loudspeaker, causing some bemusement. It was not clear if the choice of song was a coincidence. The US has the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths of any country in the world with more than 1.2 million cases and more than 72,600 fatalities. Characters in one of the UK's biggest soap operas, Coronation Street, will be seen dealing with life during the coronavirus pandemic when filming resumes,its producer has said. Filming has been suspended because of the pandemic But the crisis will not ""dominate every single story"", Iain MacLeod promised. The ITV soap has suspended filming and is making plans to return when real-life restrictions start to be lifted. MacLeod said he decided the virus ""has to exist in our world"", but that the issue would be ""handled with a light touch"". He did not say whether any characters would catch the virus, but its impact will be seen through things like hand-washing protocols and food outlets switching to takeaways. An inmate in Chicago, Illinois, was wrongfully released from jail over the weekend after he swapped identities with another inmate who was due to be released - with the help of a mask. Quintin Henderson, 28, gave his identity to 21-year-old Jahquez Scott, who allegedly promised him $1,000 (Â£810) for the swap, the Cook County Sheriff's office said,according to CBS Chicago,external. While wearing a face mask, given to inmates to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Scott allegedly gave Henderson's name and personal details and was released. Staff realised what had happened after the real Henderson later came to finish paperwork for his release, officials said. An investigation is under way and the authorities are searching for Scott. His record includes aggravated battery, possession of a controlled substance and criminal trespass. Daryll Pitcher was one of those who said they did not want to be ""guinea pigs"" The UK government has chosen the Isle of Wight to test itscoronavirus tracing app, but what do the islanders make of it? Some like parish councillor Daryll Pitcher say they do not want to be ""guinea pigs"". ""I am greatly concerned that this trial has been imposed on the Isle of Wight and I believe that the final say should have been local,"" he said. Pitcher, who is the Covid-19 response co-ordinator for the island's Wootton village, said he had concerns regarding his civil liberties and data security, because the app traces anyone who has recently been in contact with someone with the virus. He also said he felt the island was ""not a suitable testing area"" due to its demographics and geography, both of which vary from the UK's national average. Read more reaction from the island. In today's UK Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the number of coronavirus deaths in the UK should not be compared with those in other European countries - and quoted a newspaper article from Professor David Spiegelhalter as part of his argument. However, Spiegelhalter has sincegone on to Twitter to say:,external""Polite request to PM and others: please stop using my Guardian article to claim we cannot make any international comparisons yet.

Canada's most populous province is taking its first baby steps towards reopening the economy. Hardware stores and nurseries in Ontario, where about 40% of Canadians live, will be able to open fully to the public on Friday. Customers will still be asked to maintain social distancing. All retail stores with street access (such as small shoe and clothing stores) will be able to offer curbside pickup starting Monday. The province is also extending the hours at liquor stores and cutting 
the mandatory minimum pricing for booze in restaurants and bars. Coronavirus cases are still on the rise there, albeit at a slower pace. There were 412 news cases Tuesday, up from 387 on Monday. On 25 April, Ontario hit a high of 640 cases in a single day. Other provinces have also started to reopen, including Quebec, which has had the most cases in the country. Bayern Munich (pictured training on Tuesday) are four points ahead of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the German Bundesliga with nine matches remaining Earlier today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country's top football league, the Bundesliga, could resume this month and we now have the date: 15 May. The last Bundesliga match was played on 11 March, before football across most of Europe was halted because of the coronavirus pandemic. All remaining matches in Germany will be played behind closed doors. Top-flight leagues in England, Spain and Italy are trying to find a way to complete their campaigns, although France's Ligue 1 will not resume and Paris St-Germain have been declared champions, while the Netherlands' Eredivisie season has been abandoned, with no champions, relegation or promotion. Demand for Uber's taxi services have fallen by more than 60% in coronavirus hotspots Uber has announced it will cut 3,700 full-time staff - or around 14% of its workforce. Business has plunged for the companysince the pandemic began. But even before, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn (Â£6.8bn) in 2019. The staff cuts will come mainly in its customer support and retail teams, the company says. The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will also waive his base salary - set at $1m in 2019 - for the rest of the year.  A police officer gets a swab test Here are some updates from across the US today:  Siavash Mehdi-ArdalanBBC Persian Iranâs Central Registrar Office
has confirmed that it has been ordered not to publish the overall death rates
in the country over the past three months, increasing scepticism over the official coronavirus statistics. Iran's official tally is 6,418 dead and more than 100,000 cases since the first coronavirus case
was confirmed on 19 February. The real figures are thought to be much
higher and authorities on Tehran's city council have disputed the official
numbers. A parliamentary report published last month also estimated that the
real numbers of cases and fatalities were 10 times higher. The government
of President Hassan Rouhani has boasted that its management of the pandemic has helped to contain the spread and to keep the numbers of fatalities down. Medical workers stand outside a New York hospital as people applaud At least 90,000 healthcare workers are thought to have contracted coronavirus, although the number could be as much as twice that, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) said. More than 260 nurses have lost their lives to Covid-19, it said. The estimate is based on data collected from 30 countries. The ICN urged governments to maintain accurate records to assist in stopping the virus spreading among staff and patients. ""The figure for health care workers infections has risen from 23,000 to we think more than 90,000, but that is still an under-estimation because it isn't [covering] every country in the world,"" Howard Catton, ICN's chief executive officer, told Reuters. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte spoke at a news conference in The Hague on Wednesday The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has been outlining how the Netherlands plans to slowly unlock the partial lockdown. From 11 May schools and day cares will reopen (this had been previously announced) and hairdressers, beauticians and other contact professions can start operating again next week, along with libraries opening. People should try to keep their distance but Rutte has acknowledged this will not always be possible but face masks wonât be required. From 1 June everyone on public transport must wear a face mask, although Rutte, speaking during a press conference this evening, urged people to make their own masks, saying âmedical masks are for medical staffâ. Rutte has recommended face masks in situations where itâs not possible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres - not because they stop you contracting but to stop people infecting others. Also from 1 June Dutch bars can reopen their terraces - reservations and limited numbers with 1.5 metre spacing. Restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres and museums can start operating again, under strict conditions: only with reservations, but again people must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres. As of 1 July, camp sites and churches can open doors again. Dr Tedros said cases were increasing in regions like Africa We have been watching the World Health Organization's regular news conference. Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that while the number of cases in Western Europe is declining, they are increasing in Eastern Europe, Africa, South-East Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas. He also warned governments that unless the lifting of lockdown restrictions is managed carefully, ""the risk of the virus returning remains very real"". He described six criteria to meet before lockdowns are lifted: The price of Tecate has gone up by 12% since the second week of March, a survey suggests Mexico is days away from running out of beer, the country's brewers' association is warning. Brewing is not among the industries which the government declared essential and therefore had to halt production at the end of March. ""There's no production, there's no distribution, we're not producing a single beer,"" said Karla Siqueiros, president of Brewers of Mexico. Siqueiros said she did not have an estimate of how many beers were left in supermarkets and shops, but that she had already received reports of prices shooting up as speculators took advantage of shortages. She reassured beer lovers that brewers were poised to restart production as soon as they were allowed to by the government  - but cautioned that she had not been given any hint as to when that could be. On 25 April, Luther addressed an ""Open Texas"" rally outside City Hall in Frisco A hair salon owner in Texas has been jailed for a week for staying open despite coronavirus restrictions that have shut all non-essential businesses. Shelley Luther, owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, appeared in court on Tuesday after defying a cease-and-desist letter and a restraining order. The judge said she could avoid prison if she apologised for being selfish, shut the salon and paid a fine.

"Uber axes 3,700 staff as trips drop in lockdownsThe pandemic has added to financial challenges facing the taxi-hailing app firm.","This video can not be played 'My income vanished overnight with no safety net' Uber has announced plans to cut 3,700 full-time staff - about 14% of its workforce - as business plunges following pandemic shutdowns. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also waive his base salary - set at $1m (Â£809,690) in 2019 - through to the year end. The announcements come a day ahead of the firm's quarterly results. Even before the pandemic, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn in 2019. Uber said the reductions will come from its customer support and recruiting teams, and would result in $20m in severance pay and other costs. Executives in March warned the firm had seen demand for its taxi services fall by more than 60% in coronavirus hotspots, though they said ordering via its Uber Eats food delivery service had increased. ""Since we don't know how long a recovery will take, we are taking steps to bring our costs in line with the size of our business today,"" the firm said in a statement on Wednesday. The Uber Eats food delivery service has seen increased demand Uber's business is heavily reliant on big cities, including some that have been most affected by the pandemic. Last year, four metro areas in the US, including New York and San Francisco, and London accounted for 23% of the money spent on the platform. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called the job cuts ""painful but necessary"", noting that both Uber and smaller rival Lyft face long-term difficulties as more people work from home and avoid taxis for fear of infection. ""Uber and Lyft face Herculean-like challenges looking ahead as the new reality will likely change the business models of these companies [and competitors] for the foreseeable future,"" he wrote in a note. On Wednesday, Lyft said it had seen a decline of more than 70% in trips on its platform as the US started to implement shutdown orders. It said it was taking aggressive cost-cutting steps to help the business survive. The firm last week announced plans to axe about 17% of its workforce or almost 1,000 employees, furlough another 300 people and reduce executive pay. ""We face a new reality,"" said co-founder Logan Green. ""We expect that rider demand for our platform will be down for the foreseeable future."" The reductions are a sign that the impact from the shutdowns is continuing to ripple out into the US economy, with economists now bracing for a prolonged slowdown rather than a quick rebound. On Wednesday, payrolls processor ADP reported that private employers in the US cut a record 20.2 million jobs last month - more than double the jobs lost in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. ""Job losses of this scale are unprecedented,"" said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Trump: Virus task force to focus on reopening USThe president says it will focus on reopening the economy, a day after indicating it may be disbanded.","President Trump said the White House task force would focus on ""opening up our country"" US President Donald Trump has said the coronavirus task force will shift its focus to reopening the economy, a day after suggesting it would be disbanded. Mr Trump said the group would ""continue on indefinitely"" and ""focus on safety [and] opening up our country"". It is not clear how exactly the task force will change but Mr Trump said ""we may add or subtract people to it"". New confirmed infections per day in the US currently top 20,000, and daily deaths exceed 1,000. US health officials have warned that the virus may spread as businesses begin to reopen. The US currently has 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 71,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University which is tracking the pandemic. In a series of tweets on Wednesday,external, Mr Trump said the task force had ""done a fantastic job of bringing together vast [and] highly complex resources"". He praised Vice-President Mike Pence, who heads the group, and said it had ""set a high standard for others to follow"". ""Because of this success, the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on safety & opening up our country again,"" Mr Trump said. This video can not be played Trump: 'Mike Pence and the taskforce have done a great job' His comments came a day after he suggested the task force, which is made up of medical professionals and other experts, might be disbanded. ""We're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening,"" Mr Trump told journalists on Tuesday. ""And we'll have a different group probably set up for that."" Mr Pence also told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday that the task force could soon be wound down. He said the Trump administration was ""starting to look at the Memorial Day [late May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage... our national response."" But - when asked about the apparent change in approach on Wednesday - Mr Trump said:  ""I had no idea how popular the task force is until... yesterday when I started talking about winding [it] down."" Is a task force with different people and a different focus still the same task force? This sounds like a philosophical question but it is one that has very real implications for the direction of US coronavirus policy. On Tuesday, Vice-President Mike Pence confirmed the White House was considering winding down its coronavirus task force, perhaps as early as the end of May, shifting public health responsibilities to subsidiary agencies. Mr Trump walked that back a bit on Wednesday morning but the bottom line is the same. The group's members may change, and its priorities will shift. However the president wants to dress it up, it's clear that even while the virus continues to spread throughout the nation, the White House urgently wants to prioritise addressing the economic fallout of the pandemic. The state of the economy, after all, frequently determines the fate of a president seeking re-election. And if Trump can't pull the nation out of its fiscal nosedive soon, his November general election outlook appears grim. The public health wisdom of the White House's move may be debatable, but the political calculus is clear. The task force was set up on 29 January. It reports to the president and co-ordinates with medical institutes, political staff and state governors. The group also consults medical experts to formulate national guidelines on social distancing. Its members include more than 20 experts and leading administration officials. The White House said the task force's duty was to ""lead the administration's efforts to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus"" and provide the public with information. Mr Trump's once-daily task force briefings have become increasingly scarce since he was widely condemned by the medical community for pondering at the podium last monthwhether injecting bleach might kill the virus. Dr Deborah Birx is the task force's response co-ordinator. The president was asked on Tuesday whether she and another high-profile member, Dr Anthony Fauci, would still be involved in efforts to address the coronavirus. ""They will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field,"" the president said.  He later added that new members of the task force would be announced by Monday. Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak Why is there a US backlash to masks? 'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' Critics have accused Mr Trump of sacrificing Americans' public health in his eagerness to reopen the US economy ahead of his re-election battle in November. In Arizona on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that Democrats were hoping his coronavirus policy would fail ""so they can win the election"". However, it will be up to individual states to determine how they reopen. Some Democratic governors in badly hit states have been cautious, calling for more testing and other safeguards before easing lockdowns. Other states, many led by Republicans in the south and mid-west, have already begun lifting restrictions. Not yet. Besides New York, which is still the US epicentre despite an ongoing drop in new cases, the level of infection continues to climb across much of the country. Many states that have allowed some business to resume - including Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana -Â are seeing more new cases reported daily. While some cities such as New York, New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement, others like Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago are seeing the caseload rise every day. This video can not be played Coronavirus: When might Hollywood reopen for business? According to a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), more than 3,000 people may be killed by the virus each day by next month. The White House has dismissed the report as inaccurate, with Mr Trump saying it describes a scenario in which Americans make no effort to mitigate the spread of the infection. On Sunday, the president increased his forecast for the number of US pandemic deaths to 100,000, after saying two weeks earlier that it would be fewer than 60,000. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, a public forecast model that has been frequently cited by the White House, now estimates that Covid-19 will account for 135,000 American deaths by 4 August. This more than doubles its 17 April forecast. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continued to criticise China over its handling of the outbreak. ""China could have prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""China could have spared the world a descent into global economic malaise. They had a choice but instead [they] covered up the outbreak."" He did not provide evidence for his claim, which was the latest example of the US condemning Beijing's approach to the pandemic. Mr Pompeo earlier said - without going into specifics - that there was ""enormous evidence"" the coronavirus emanated from a laboratory in the city of Wuhan.Chinese state media later accused him of lying.

Most Africans 'will run out of food in lockdown'A survey finds that there is a risk of unrest and violence if coronavirus restrictions are too harsh.Africa,"Cities like Lagos in Nigeria are easing their lockdown restrictions More than two-thirds of people surveyed in 20 African countries said they would run out of food and water if they had to stay at home for 14 days. Just over half of the respondents said they would run out of money. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention research was conducted to help governments map out future policies on how to tackle coronavirus. It warns that if measures are not adapted to local needs, there is a risk of unrest and violence. BBC Africa Live: Updates from the continent Why are some African states easing lockdowns? Why lockdowns may not be the answer in Africa The report,Using Data to Find a Balance,external, shows the difficulties of maintaining strict lockdown policies on the continent. The research was conducted between late March and mid-April in 28 cities in 20 countries to assess the impact of the crisis and people's attitudes to restrictions that had already been imposed in some areas. Several African countries which had responded swiftly to the coronavirus threat are now easing restrictions. ""The proliferation of peaceful protests demanding government relief is evidence of the strain some people are already under, and highlights gaps in current responses,"" the report says. But it found that there was currently general support for restrictions that had been put in place. Opposition was highest to measures such as closing workplaces and shutting down markets.

The researchers have recommended that governments need to communicate more effectively with their citizens and properly inform them about the reasons behind the measures that are being taken.

Governments in Africa have been facing a dilemma when deciding how best to respond to the pandemic. Millions need to leave their homes every day to go and work to feed their families. ""Countries now must find a balance between reducing transmission while preventing social and economic disruption,"" the report says. So far Africa has recorded nearly 50,000 cases of Covid-19, the respiratory infection caused by coronavirus, with just under 2,000 deaths.

""Countries now must find a balance between reducing transmission while preventing social and economic disruption,"" the report says. So far Africa has recorded nearly 50,000 cases of Covid-19, the respiratory infection caused by coronavirus, with just under 2,000 deaths. The report recommends that while caseloads remain low, countries on the continent need to ""build public health capacity to test, trace, isolate, and treat cases"" as the necessary foundation for reopening societies.

UK warned over coronavirus climate trap,"The government faces a post-lockdown choice between green growth or propping up polluting industries The UK must avoid lurching from the coronavirus crisis into a deeper climate crisis, the governmentâs advisers have warned. They recommend that ministers ensure funds earmarked for a post-Covid-19 economic recovery go to firms that will reduce carbon emissions. They say the public should work from home if possible; and to walk or cycle. And investment should prioritise broadband over road-building, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says. People should also be encouraged to save emissions by continuing to consult GPs online. The government will reply later, although the Energy Secretary Alok Sharma has already spoken in favour of a green recovery to the recession. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) Covid recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red' In a letter to the Prime Minister, the committee says jobless people should be re-trained for work in geographically-spread labour-intensive âgreenâ industries such as home insulation; tree-planting; and peatland restoration. Road building should have a lower priority than broadband, the report says It makes a veiled reference to the current discussions over a potential government bailout to save jobs in aviation, which is struggling in the crisis. The letter says: âMany sectors of the UK economy do not currently bear the full costs of emitting greenhouse gases. Revenue could be raised by setting or raising carbon prices for these sectors.â Green groups say any bailout should include a condition that the industry shrinks until it finds a technological solution to its carbon emissions. The letter also tackles broader social themes of fairness and risk. It says the Covid-19 crisis has highlighted inequalities, with poorer people more in danger. The committee notes: âThe response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people - who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change. âThe benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely, and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes. âIt is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new, resilient economy.â What is climate change? Climate-related words and phrases explained How much warmer is your city? What is your diet's carbon footprint? Where we are in seven charts The committee says the government must produce policies that allow the UK to reduce emissions to Net Zero in an orderly way â unlike the chaos of the Covid-19 crisis. The CCC Chairman, Lord Deben, said: âThe Covid-19 crisis has shown the importance of planning well for the risks the country faces. âRecovery means investing in new jobs, cleaner air and improved health. The actions needed to tackle climate change are central to rebuilding our economy. âThe government must prioritise actions that reduce climate risks and avoid measures that lock-in higher emissions.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The message is not uncontested. Some politicians have argued that jobs must be protected at all cost in the recovery from the Covid-19 recession. The UK will chair a vital global climate conference next year. Lord Deben said the UK should set a global example by planning a climate-friendly recovery from Covid-19. The committee has copied the letter to the leaders of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. It will expand on its advice in June. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says the government should harness the lessons from the Covid-19 crisis tocreate a better society overall.,external She says ministers should force firms to show how they will meet CO2 cuts, and give people a right to locally-produced food; affordable clean energy; and access to green space. The environment consultancy EPR says ministers should change the balance of the planning process to ensure that green space is a top priority rather than a nice-to-have.

"'More normal' shopping habits are back, says Ocado","Ocado says ""more normal"" shopping habits are back after a huge jump in demand amid the coronavirus lockdown. Its customers are now purchasing fewer items than at the peak of demand, with the balance between fresh and long-life food returning to normal. The online grocer has made changes to increase the delivery slots available, including suspending the delivery of mineral water. Its revenues in April were up more than 40% from a year earlier. ""At the beginning of the outbreak demand increased significantly, almost overnight,"" the retailer said. It limited the number of items on sale initially in order to stop customers from panic buying. Ocado said these limits have since been rolled back as the number of items shoppers are putting in their baskets ""appears to have passed its peak but remains high"". Tim Steiner, chief executive of the Ocado group, said: ""We are facing quite a different challenge to many, as we scale up Ocado.com to play its part in feeding the nation."" The supermarket has drawn criticism on social media as customers faced being one of thousands in a virtual queue to place a food order. It was previously forced to suspend its entire service briefly, and temporarily took down its app due to the spike in orders. Currently, new customers are not able to place orders with the retailer due to a lack of available delivery slots. On its website, the firm says it is focusing,externalon delivering food to vulnerable, as well as its longest-standing customers. Mr Steiner added: ""Ocado remains in a strong position and we should be grateful that our current challenges are around growth, expansion and increased demand."" However, the company suspended its revenue forecasts due to the uncertainty over how shoppers will react in the long run. ""Although we expect the long-term shift towards online grocery to accelerate post-crisis, there remain many uncertainties about the length of the crisis, customer reaction immediately post and its long-term impact on customers' disposable incomes."" What will be the 'new normal'? John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said that Ocado has had a very different experience of the coronavirus lockdown to most businesses. ""While the wider market has dropped, its shares have surged more than 50% in the year to date in anticipation of the business being well placed in the lockdown,"" he said. ""Ocado was becoming the UK's stock market's most prominent and, arguably, important technology company before the crisis - that status has only accelerated over the past couple of months."" Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown also suggested that the business is in a good position as shoppers shift to online. M&S announced last yearthat it would go into partnership with Ocado from September this year, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose. Under the deal, M&S is buying a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. Ocado will also continue to supply its own-label products and big-name branded goods. ""For now, the indicators suggest more deals could be on the cards in the near future,"" Ms Lund-Yates said. Ahead of the firm's annual general meeting, one investor said that it would vote against Ocado's pay policies, despite its recent performance. Group chief executive Tim Steiner received Â£58.7m in total pay in 2019. He got the windfall after an incentive scheme tied to the firm's share price paid out. Royal London, which has a small stake in Ocado, said it would oppose Mr Steiner's payout, calling it ""excessive"". Several other firms posted trading updates on Wednesday which detailed how they had been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. ITVreported a 42% slide in advertising revenues in April as firms cut back on marketing Cycle and car repair firmHalfordssaid sales were 23% below last year in the four weeks to 1 May, although that was better performance than expected Insurer Direct Linesaid that motor insurance claims fell by 70% last month, as people stayed indoors under lockdown.

Rory Stewart quits Mayor of London race,"London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart has dropped out of the race after the coronavirus crisis forced a year's delay. The former Tory cabinet minister said it was impossible to ask unpaid campaign volunteers to work for another 12 months. The independent candidate said it had been an ""agonising decision"" for him to make. The announcement comes on the eve of what would have been polling day. Allow Twitter content?

In a statement Mr Stewart said: ""I firmly believe London is the greatest city on earth - and its courageous response to Covid-19 proves that more than ever. ""It would have been the honour of my life to serve the city as mayor, but while the considerable challenges of running as an independent were manageable for a normal race they are forbidding for an extended and delayed election."" In Marchthe government announcedthat the mayoral election would be delayed until May next year as the country prepared to go into lockdown. The former International Development Secretary quit as an MP in October to run to be Mayor of London After serving as International Development Secretary under Theresa May, Mr Stewart campaigned to succeed her in the Conservative leadership election last summer. But after Boris Johnson became prime minister, Mr Stewart was one of 21 Conservative MPsexpelled from the party for rebelling over Brexit. The former MP for Penrith and The Borderleft parliament in October 2019to run as an independent candidate. Mr Stewart took part in daily walks across London as part of his campaign to become Mayor of London Mr Stewart, 47, gained national attention through a series of campaigns that offered face-to-face debates with Londoners. A cornerstone of his election effort were his daily walks across London were he would film interviews and discussions with Londoners he met. His Come Kip With Me initiative, asking to stay a night in Londoner's homes to understand their problems, attracted national publicity. In an interview with the Evening Standard Mr Stewart said he planned to write a book about politics and hoped to stay in public life. He said would not re-join the Tory party and declined to endorse any other candidate for mayor. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, said he wished Mr Stewart"" and his family all the best going forward"" Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he ""wished Rory Stewart the best of luck whatever he chooses to do"". He added: ""It's quite clear he loves London and I'm sure we've not seen the last of him."" Shaun Bailey, the Conservative candidate, said: ""Like me, he believes London needs new leadership. ""Rory brought some interesting ideas to the table and his unique campaigning style was a real breath of fresh air. ""I wish him all the best for the next chapter."" Liberal Democrat candidate Siobhan Benita said: ""âªI wish Rory Stewart all the best with his future plans. ""As a former independent candidate myself, I know how tough it is to sustain a campaign alone.  âª ""Rory and I didn't always agree on policy but we do share many frustrations and ideas about our wonderful city.""

Firms 'ready to restart within three weeks',"Are employees prepared for the return to work? Most firms believe they could be ready to restart business with just three weeks' notice. That's according to the latest British Chambers of Commerce Coronavirus weekly survey of firms. BBC News talked to companies in five different sectors to find out how prepared they are to return work and their new ways of doing business. Some are rotating staff. Others have introduced remote services or plan to shut the office altogether. ""Businesses' ability to restart quickly varies by company size and by sector,"" said BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall. The survey suggests that businesses that offer services to other business are the most ready, with two-thirds saying they would need less than one week or no notice at all to restart operations. Fewer than half of firms serving consumers said they were confident of being ready that quickly. ""It will be crucial for the government to maintain and evolve support for businesses, to give as many firms as possible the chance to navigate a phased return to work,"" said Dr Marshall. Here, we talk to five different types of firms - office, construction, restaurant, factory and shop - to see what changes they're making. ""We're not going to return to office working. We will close it as soon as the lease runs out,"" says Shai Aharony, chief executive of Reboot Digital Marketing. ""It will save us around 10% of our turnover and means we'll cut down on fuel, pollution and all the other surrounding costs associated with having an office."" The Hertfordshire-based business, which employs 20 people, has found that working from home suits its workers. ""It's a major change for us. But I don't think that things are going to go back to normal. A lot of companies are going to have to evolve rapidly if they want to survive."" However, they'll still need to get together regularly, says Mr Aharony. ""We have a brainstorming session every two weeks that is key to our business. ""In future, we'll do it at a local hotel. We'll brainstorm and do all the other tasks that are more efficiently done face-to-face and then go out as a company."" ""All our site workers will have to do their health and safety inductions at home,"" says Andrew Brooks, boss of housebuilder Bewley Homes. Inductions are normally done on site in groups, which is not possible right now. ""Importantly, it makes sure they know everything to follow the new regulations. The old way of inducting 10 people in a small room has long gone."" Signing into a site has also had to go digital. ""Sharing a pen, punching into a tablet or fingerprint scans are no longer options,"" Mr Brooks says. The builder is adopting digital sign-ins. Nearly every aspect of construction site life has changed, if not forever, then certainly for the next few months, he says. ""There's a huge logistical challenge to get 400 workers back on site at once and it needs methodical planning,"" he says. ""It's not just getting subcontractors to respect the two-metre rule plot-by-plot and to navigate around the entire site, there are also all the new on-site safety measures to put in place."" ""I've had to develop new dishes that travel,"" says Dev Biswal, owner of the Ambrette, three fine dining Indian restaurants in Canterbury and Margate. ""I've never offered takeaways, because my style of cooking and presentation could never survive transportation."" But like many other businesses, he's had to adapt to survive. He's now planning to open a ""dark kitchen"", which will offer multi-cuisine, takeaway gourmet dishes, such as slow goat stroganoff or coconut and saffron cheesecake, through Deliveroo. He's also moving his cookery classes online and set up an ingredient delivery service. He says the crisis has forced him to accelerate plans to introduce deliveries. ""I've read industry reports which all predict significant growth for the delivery market, so it's something I'd been giving serious thought to for some time,"" says Mr Biswal. ""The crash in footfall surrounding the media panic around Covid-19 means I've had to bring those plans forward."" ""We've moved our on-site laboratories to operate in completely separated shifts,"" says Lee Sheppard, director at Wiltshire-based caterer Apetito. The company - which supplies food to the health and social care sector - has introduced a number of social distancing measures to ensure the safety of workers at its Trowbridge factory. These include glass partitions in its production kitchen and individual tables, placed two metres apart in its team canteen, while the numbers of those that can enter have been reduced. Its offices remain closed, with team members now working from home, but the company is considering a rotation scheme which would limit numbers of people in the office at one time. ""We already had a flexible policy with working from home, but we're exploring the idea of staff working one week in the office and one week from home."" Meanwhile, its delivery teams are following a default no-contact delivery policy. ""We've been exploring remote alternatives to our traditional in-person appointments,"" says Giles Edmonds, clinical services director at Specsavers. ""Our stores are currently only able to offer urgent and essential care to a limited number of customers."" The new way of doing business is to allow customers to get advice and care from optometrists and audiologists via video and telephone link. ""It removes a number of barriers, especially with health services already under immense pressure,"" says Mr Edmonds. They also have an Ask The Expert service on Facebook, while in branches, ""frontline"" teams provide urgentâ¯ andâ¯ essential eye care to other key workers and people whoâ¯ could come to harm. ""However, we have modified our processes to minimise the time that optometrists or audiologists and their patients are in proximity to each other."" That's on top of a range of social distancing measures and the provision of hand sanitisers, which all retailers have adopted.

European leaders hint at easing rules for holidays,"30,076 people have now died in the UK with coronavirus, the government says For the fourth consecutive day the government misses its 100,000 per day testing target UK PM Boris Johnson vowed earlier to reach 200,000 lab tests a day by the end of May In Germany, football will resume behind closed doors and small shops can open President Trump says the White House coronavirus taskforce will continue its work ""indefinitely"" Italy's prime minister is the latest European leader to talk hopefully of his citizens getting a summer holiday Airbnb reports a jump in bookings from Europeans hoping to get a holiday after lockdown is eased We're pausing our live coverage for the time being. Our colleagues in Asia will be picking it back up shortly. In the meantime, here's a reminder of the main developments on Wednesday:  Our live page is written and edited by our journalists in Singapore, London and Washington. Wednesday's coverage was brought to you by: Ritu Prasad, Georgina Rannard, Deirdre Finnerty, Michael Emons, Claire Heald, Robin Levinson-King, Emlyn Begley, Hugo Bachega, Toby Lockhurst, Simon Fraser, Kate Whannel, George Wright, Thomas Spender, Alex Bysouth, Sarah Collerton, Doug Faulkner, Krutika Pathi, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Andreas Illmer, Anna Jones, and Saira Asher. The Hopi Indian Reservation is in Arizona, US - the community need clean water, food and health supplies If you help someone during this pandemic, one day the favour might be returned. That's what two Native American communities in the US have learned. The Choctaw Nation sent $170 (around $5,000 in today's money) to Ireland in the 1840s when one million Irish people died during the potato famine. Their genorosity was sparked partly by the deaths of many Native Americans on the Trail of Tears, the forced displacement of 60,000 people. Now the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Reservation are badly affected by the coronavirus, partly due to a lack of clean water, and Irish people are recognising the old kindness by donating $100,000 to a fundraiser. One message, from Pat Hayes, read: âFrom Ireland, 170 years later, the favour is returned! To our Native American brothers and sisters in your moment of hardship.â The organisers of the fundraising,externalwrote to praise the âacts of kindness from indigenous ancestors passed being reciprocated nearly 200 years later through blood memory and interconnectedness.â  At a briefing on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the US had conducted 7.5m Covid-19 tests thus far. When asked why not every American was able to get a test yet, she said it was a ""myth"" that everyone needed testing. ""If we tested every single American in this country at this moment, weâd have to retest them an hour later and an hour after that, because at any moment you could theoretically contract this virus,"" McEnany said. ""The notion that everyone needs to be tested is simply nonsensical. The people who need to be tested are vulnerable populations."" The press secretary also repeated Trump's stance on masks, saying it's ""the choice of the individual"". Other key points: More on the situation in the US: Iceland has carried out extensive testing of its population of around 328,000 And now for some more positive news. Iceland says it has almost entirely eliminated its outbreak of coronavirus. Only two new cases have been confirmed in the past week and 97% of all infected patients have recovered. ""We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fastdeceleration of the pandemic in Iceland,"" said the country's chief epidemiologist, Thorolfur Gudnason. But he added it was very important to remain vigilant to minimise risks of further outbreaks. Iceland carried out very extensive testing of its population, so much so that anyone who wanted a test received one. Randomised tests showed that half of people showed no symptoms at all. Listen here to understand moreabout the country's approach.  Englandâs dairy farmers will be able to access up to Â£10,000 ($12,000) each to help them overcome the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the government has announced. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Our dairy industry plays a crucial role in feeding our nation and we're doing all we can to ensure they are properly supported during this time. ""Weâve already relaxed competition laws so dairy farmers can work together through the toughest months, but recognise there's more to be done. That's why we have kick-started a new campaign to boost milk consumption and announced a further package of funding.

We will continue to stand alongside our dairy farmers through this difficult period."" Last month, the BBC revealed that some dairy farmers werehaving to throw away thousands of litres of fresh milkbecause of the disruption to the supply chain caused by coronavirus.  This video can not be played Worst song possible plays as Trump tours mask plant As President Donald Trump touted plans to reopen the US economy while visiting a mask factory in Phoenix, Arizona, the song Live And Let Die from Guns 'N' Roses blared out over a loudspeaker, causing some bemusement. It was not clear if the choice of song was a coincidence. The US has the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths of any country in the world with more than 1.2 million cases and more than 72,600 fatalities. Characters in one of the UK's biggest soap operas, Coronation Street, will be seen dealing with life during the coronavirus pandemic when filming resumes,its producer has said. Filming has been suspended because of the pandemic But the crisis will not ""dominate every single story"", Iain MacLeod promised. The ITV soap has suspended filming and is making plans to return when real-life restrictions start to be lifted. MacLeod said he decided the virus ""has to exist in our world"", but that the issue would be ""handled with a light touch"". He did not say whether any characters would catch the virus, but its impact will be seen through things like hand-washing protocols and food outlets switching to takeaways. An inmate in Chicago, Illinois, was wrongfully released from jail over the weekend after he swapped identities with another inmate who was due to be released - with the help of a mask. Quintin Henderson, 28, gave his identity to 21-year-old Jahquez Scott, who allegedly promised him $1,000 (Â£810) for the swap, the Cook County Sheriff's office said,according to CBS Chicago,external. While wearing a face mask, given to inmates to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Scott allegedly gave Henderson's name and personal details and was released. Staff realised what had happened after the real Henderson later came to finish paperwork for his release, officials said. An investigation is under way and the authorities are searching for Scott. His record includes aggravated battery, possession of a controlled substance and criminal trespass. Daryll Pitcher was one of those who said they did not want to be ""guinea pigs"" The UK government has chosen the Isle of Wight to test itscoronavirus tracing app, but what do the islanders make of it? Some like parish councillor Daryll Pitcher say they do not want to be ""guinea pigs"". ""I am greatly concerned that this trial has been imposed on the Isle of Wight and I believe that the final say should have been local,"" he said. Pitcher, who is the Covid-19 response co-ordinator for the island's Wootton village, said he had concerns regarding his civil liberties and data security, because the app traces anyone who has recently been in contact with someone with the virus. He also said he felt the island was ""not a suitable testing area"" due to its demographics and geography, both of which vary from the UK's national average. Read more reaction from the island. In today's UK Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the number of coronavirus deaths in the UK should not be compared with those in other European countries - and quoted a newspaper article from Professor David Spiegelhalter as part of his argument. However, Spiegelhalter has sincegone on to Twitter to say:,external""Polite request to PM and others: please stop using my Guardian article to claim we cannot make any international comparisons yet. ""I refer only to detailed league tables - of course we should now use other countries to try and learn why our numbers are high."" Watch the clip below to see the exchange between Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer earlier today, when Spiegelhalter was mentioned. Allow Twitter content?

Canada's most populous province is taking its first baby steps towards reopening the economy. Hardware stores and nurseries in Ontario, where about 40% of Canadians live, will be able to open fully to the public on Friday. Customers will still be asked to maintain social distancing. All retail stores with street access (such as small shoe and clothing stores) will be able to offer curbside pickup starting Monday. The province is also extending the hours at liquor stores and cutting 
the mandatory minimum pricing for booze in restaurants and bars. Coronavirus cases are still on the rise there, albeit at a slower pace. There were 412 news cases Tuesday, up from 387 on Monday. On 25 April, Ontario hit a high of 640 cases in a single day. Other provinces have also started to reopen, including Quebec, which has had the most cases in the country. Bayern Munich (pictured training on Tuesday) are four points ahead of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the German Bundesliga with nine matches remaining Earlier today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country's top football league, the Bundesliga, could resume this month and we now have the date: 15 May. The last Bundesliga match was played on 11 March, before football across most of Europe was halted because of the coronavirus pandemic. All remaining matches in Germany will be played behind closed doors. Top-flight leagues in England, Spain and Italy are trying to find a way to complete their campaigns, although France's Ligue 1 will not resume and Paris St-Germain have been declared champions, while the Netherlands' Eredivisie season has been abandoned, with no champions, relegation or promotion. Demand for Uber's taxi services have fallen by more than 60% in coronavirus hotspots Uber has announced it will cut 3,700 full-time staff - or around 14% of its workforce. Business has plunged for the companysince the pandemic began. But even before, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn (Â£6.8bn) in 2019. The staff cuts will come mainly in its customer support and retail teams, the company says. The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will also waive his base salary - set at $1m in 2019 - for the rest of the year.  A police officer gets a swab test Here are some updates from across the US today:  Siavash Mehdi-ArdalanBBC Persian Iranâs Central Registrar Office
has confirmed that it has been ordered not to publish the overall death rates
in the country over the past three months, increasing scepticism over the official coronavirus statistics. Iran's official tally is 6,418 dead and more than 100,000 cases since the first coronavirus case
was confirmed on 19 February. The real figures are thought to be much
higher and authorities on Tehran's city council have disputed the official
numbers. A parliamentary report published last month also estimated that the
real numbers of cases and fatalities were 10 times higher. The government
of President Hassan Rouhani has boasted that its management of the pandemic has helped to contain the spread and to keep the numbers of fatalities down. Medical workers stand outside a New York hospital as people applaud At least 90,000 healthcare workers are thought to have contracted coronavirus, although the number could be as much as twice that, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) said. More than 260 nurses have lost their lives to Covid-19, it said. The estimate is based on data collected from 30 countries. The ICN urged governments to maintain accurate records to assist in stopping the virus spreading among staff and patients. ""The figure for health care workers infections has risen from 23,000 to we think more than 90,000, but that is still an under-estimation because it isn't [covering] every country in the world,"" Howard Catton, ICN's chief executive officer, told Reuters. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte spoke at a news conference in The Hague on Wednesday The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has been outlining how the Netherlands plans to slowly unlock the partial lockdown. From 11 May schools and day cares will reopen (this had been previously announced) and hairdressers, beauticians and other contact professions can start operating again next week, along with libraries opening. People should try to keep their distance but Rutte has acknowledged this will not always be possible but face masks wonât be required. From 1 June everyone on public transport must wear a face mask, although Rutte, speaking during a press conference this evening, urged people to make their own masks, saying âmedical masks are for medical staffâ. Rutte has recommended face masks in situations where itâs not possible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres - not because they stop you contracting but to stop people infecting others. Also from 1 June Dutch bars can reopen their terraces - reservations and limited numbers with 1.5 metre spacing. Restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres and museums can start operating again, under strict conditions: only with reservations, but again people must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres. As of 1 July, camp sites and churches can open doors again. Dr Tedros said cases were increasing in regions like Africa We have been watching the World Health Organization's regular news conference. Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that while the number of cases in Western Europe is declining, they are increasing in Eastern Europe, Africa, South-East Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas. He also warned governments that unless the lifting of lockdown restrictions is managed carefully, ""the risk of the virus returning remains very real"". He described six criteria to meet before lockdowns are lifted: The price of Tecate has gone up by 12% since the second week of March, a survey suggests Mexico is days away from running out of beer, the country's brewers' association is warning. Brewing is not among the industries which the government declared essential and therefore had to halt production at the end of March. ""There's no production, there's no distribution, we're not producing a single beer,"" said Karla Siqueiros, president of Brewers of Mexico. Siqueiros said she did not have an estimate of how many beers were left in supermarkets and shops, but that she had already received reports of prices shooting up as speculators took advantage of shortages. She reassured beer lovers that brewers were poised to restart production as soon as they were allowed to by the government  - but cautioned that she had not been given any hint as to when that could be. On 25 April, Luther addressed an ""Open Texas"" rally outside City Hall in Frisco A hair salon owner in Texas has been jailed for a week for staying open despite coronavirus restrictions that have shut all non-essential businesses. Shelley Luther, owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, appeared in court on Tuesday after defying a cease-and-desist letter and a restraining order. The judge said she could avoid prison if she apologised for being selfish, shut the salon and paid a fine.
But Luther refused, saying ""feeding my kids is not selfish"". Read the full story. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

PMQs has now come to an end, but what did we learn from the exchanges? House of CommonsParliament Prime Minister's Questions has come to an end. The Commons has now moved onto an urgent question from Labour's shadow secretary for employment rights, Andy McDonald, on guidelines for workplace equality after lockdown measures are lifted in the UK House of CommonsParliament Labour's Lillian Greenwood says her local council faces a funding gap of up to Â£55m ""as a result of lost income"" from coronavirus. ""Our communities bore the brunt of austerity - they cannot bear the burden of coronavirus,"" she says and asks for ""a cast-iron guarantee they will not be asked to do so"". The PM says that ""Nottingham, her own city, has had an extra Â£19m to help deal with the pressure of coronavirus."" ""That is by no means the last of the support,"" he adds. House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Rob Butler says the UK is going through ""very dark and difficult days"", but wants to praise the ""amazing work of volunteers across the country"" who are helping others. He says there are many in his own constituency of Aylesbury, but wants to highlight one in particular that he thinks the PM may like. Mr Butler says ""Bernie the Bus"" travels through the area collecting and delivering for the local food bank, but plays music out the back to bring the residents a dose of entertainment. Boris Johnson says: ""As a great believer in buses and apart-time manufacturer, can I agree with his [praise] for all who support Bernie the Bus and travel therein."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's Justin Madders says the furlough scheme ""prevented mass unemployment"" but expresses concern over reports that the scheme will be wound down. Before the PM replies Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle tells MPs that they should not have political slogans visible when appearing by video link. Mr Madders had a Labour poster behind him. Replying to the question, the PM says: ""The furlough scheme has been one of the outstanding provisions the government has been able to put in."" ""Obviously what we want is that people continue to feel secure. ""But at the same time what we also want is to enable people to go safely and securely back to work."" Allow Twitter content?

House of CommonsParliament Labour's Mike Amesbury says the local councils in his constituency are providing essential services to vulnerable people. He says the government promised to compensate these councils fully ""yet both are millions of pounds short"". ""How will the government fulfil that promise and not return to austerity,"" he asks. The government has no intention to return to the A word,"" replies Boris Johnson. He adds that the government has ""put an additional Â£3.2 bn into supporting local authorities"". Reality Check On the subject of testing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We are running at about 100,000 a day, but the ambition clearly is to get up to 200,000 a day by the end of this month and then to go even higher."" But the government is currently struggling to hit even 100,000 a day. At the beginning of April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock set an ambitious target - for the UK to be doing 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month. On 1 May the government said it had managed over 122,000 tests on the final day of April. But there was criticism over home testing kits and those for some test centres being included on the day they were posted out rather than when a swab was returned and processed. Not all home kits will be returned. On 2 May the government also said more than 100,000 tests had been achieved. But on the three subsequent days the totals were well below 100,000.  House of CommonsParliament The SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, also welcomes Mr Johnson back to the Commons. Highlighting the death toll, which now stands close to 30,000 across the UK, he says he agrees with the prime minister that ""the worst thing we could do is ease up lockdown too soon and allow a second peak"". He asks the PM to join with him in reminding people that non-essential travel is not permitted. Mr Blackford adds that now is ""not the time for politics of posturing"". Mr Johnson says the governments of all four nations have ""come together"" during the crisis and it was ""absolute common sense"" to reiterate his point. The SNP MP says some of Mr Johnson's own team weren't following his advice, and accuses the secretary of state for Scotland of ""politicking"" over the issue of independence - something the SNP supports for Scotland. He moves on to say that any changes to lockdown measures - expected to be announced by the PM on Sunday - should be agreed by all devolved governments. Mr Johnson says: ""We will do our level best to make sure... this attracts the widest possible consensus."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer says parents need ""reassurance"" if the schools are going to reopen and says they need to know what the government's plan is for the next stage. He also asks if the PM will make a statement to the House of Commons to present his plan. Boris Johnson says that he will make an announcement on Sunday, about the next phase in tackling the virus. Mr Johnson explains he will do it then because ""we have to be sure the data is going to support our ability to do this"". ""Hopefully in the future it will be to the House first,"" adds Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Reality Check Labour leader Keir Starmer referred to the UK having the highest number of coronavirus deaths in Europe, after overtaking Italy yesterday. The figures announced yesterday by both countries at their daily briefings showed the UK on a total of 29,427 deaths and Italy on 29,315 deaths. But there are challenges around making a straightforward comparison between the two countries. Both countriesâ figures are for deaths by people who had tested positive for the virus - so they are underestimates of the numbers who have died either directly or indirectly from Covid-19. The UK's stats included more than 4,600 care home deaths but it's not clear how many Italy has counted in its figures. Also, these figures are dependent on the number of tests carried out. Italy has carried out more than 2.2 million tests, while the UK has done over 1.3 million. It will be a long time before we have reliable figures for how many deaths are actually linked to coronavirus in either the UK or Italy. You can read more about it here.  House of CommonsParliament Turning to personal protective equipment, Sir Keir quotes a BMA report, saying 48% of doctors had to buy their own kit or rely on donations. He says this is ""clearly unacceptable"" and will become ""more acute"" if and when gov ask people to come to work. He asks if the PM can reassure the public they won't be asked to go back to work until a ""robust national plan"" is in place. The PM says: ""Yes I certainly can."" Mr Johnson says he ""shares his frustration about PPE"" and says it has been ""enraging to see the difficulties"". But he says there is a ""massive plan"", with more details to be announced on Sunday, and the government is ""able in the long term to satisfy the domestic needs of the country"". House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer notes that contact tracing was abandoned in mid-March. ""We were told at the time this was because it was not an appropriate mechanism."" ""But yesterday the chief medical officer said it was due to capacity,"" he adds. ""Why was it abandoned in mid-March and why was it not restarted sooner,"" he asks."" Boris Johnson says ""the difficulty in mid-March"" was that contact tracing was no longer useful since ""the transmissions exceeded our capacity"". He says tracking and tracing is ""easier to do now that we have built up the team"". House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer moves onto testing, and the government's ""claimed success"" on meeting its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. He says that since 30 April, the numbers have ""fallen back"", with only 84,000 taking place and 24,000 not used according to the last figures. ""What does the prime minister think was so special about 30 April that meant testing that day was so high,"" he asks. Mr Johnson says his opposite number was right that capacity currently exceeds demand, adding: ""We are working on that."" But he announces a new ""ambition"" to get to 200,000 tests a day by end of this month and to ""go even higher"". House of CommonsParliament Keir Starmer He is absolutely right to say that there is an epidemic going on in care homes, which is something I bitterly regret. Boris Johnson Keir Starmer points out that the government has been producing slides showing international comparisons. He says ""the answer is the UK was slow into lockdown, slow into testing, slow on tracing and slow on the supply of PPE."" He adds that ""deaths in care homes continue to go up"" and asks: ""Why hasn't the government got to grips with this?"" Boris Johnson replies that ""the epidemic in care homes is something I bitterly regret."" He adds that a ""huge amount of effort"" has gone into providing PPE to care homes. He also says ""in the last few days there has been a palpable improvement"" in care homes figures. House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer Sir Keir Starmer takes to the despatch box for the third Prime Minister's Questions of his tenure as Labour leader - but first time opposite Boris Johnson. He welcomes the PM ""back to his place"" and congratulates him on the birth of his son. Sir Keir quotes Mr Johnson on his return to work two weeks ago, when he talked of the ""apparent success of the government"" dealing with coronavirus. But he says, with the death toll becoming the highest in Europe, ""that is not success or apparent success"". He asks the PM: ""How on earth did it come to this?"" Mr Johnson says: ""Every death is a tragedy and he is right to draw attention to the appalling statistics, not just in this country but around the world."" But he says the data is not yet there to ""draw conclusions"". The PM adds: ""What I can tell him is at every stage as we took the decisions we did, we were governed by one overriding principle - save lives and protect NHS."" Â© 2025 BBC.

It was not clear if the choice of song was a coincidence. The US has the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths of any country in the world with more than 1.2 million cases and more than 72,600 fatalities. Characters in one of the UK's biggest soap operas, Coronation Street, will be seen dealing with life during the coronavirus pandemic when filming resumes,its producer has said. Filming has been suspended because of the pandemic But the crisis will not ""dominate every single story"", Iain MacLeod promised. The ITV soap has suspended filming and is making plans to return when real-life restrictions start to be lifted. MacLeod said he decided the virus ""has to exist in our world"", but that the issue would be ""handled with a light touch"". He did not say whether any characters would catch the virus, but its impact will be seen through things like hand-washing protocols and food outlets switching to takeaways. An inmate in Chicago, Illinois, was wrongfully released from jail over the weekend after he swapped identities with another inmate who was due to be released - with the help of a mask. Quintin Henderson, 28, gave his identity to 21-year-old Jahquez Scott, who allegedly promised him $1,000 (Â£810) for the swap, the Cook County Sheriff's office said,according to CBS Chicago,external. While wearing a face mask, given to inmates to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Scott allegedly gave Henderson's name and personal details and was released. Staff realised what had happened after the real Henderson later came to finish paperwork for his release, officials said. An investigation is under way and the authorities are searching for Scott. His record includes aggravated battery, possession of a controlled substance and criminal trespass. Daryll Pitcher was one of those who said they did not want to be ""guinea pigs"" The UK government has chosen the Isle of Wight to test itscoronavirus tracing app, but what do the islanders make of it? Some like parish councillor Daryll Pitcher say they do not want to be ""guinea pigs"". ""I am greatly concerned that this trial has been imposed on the Isle of Wight and I believe that the final say should have been local,"" he said. Pitcher, who is the Covid-19 response co-ordinator for the island's Wootton village, said he had concerns regarding his civil liberties and data security, because the app traces anyone who has recently been in contact with someone with the virus. He also said he felt the island was ""not a suitable testing area"" due to its demographics and geography, both of which vary from the UK's national average. Read more reaction from the island. In today's UK Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the number of coronavirus deaths in the UK should not be compared with those in other European countries - and quoted a newspaper article from Professor David Spiegelhalter as part of his argument. However, Spiegelhalter has sincegone on to Twitter to say:,external""Polite request to PM and others: please stop using my Guardian article to claim we cannot make any international comparisons yet. ""I refer only to detailed league tables - of course we should now use other countries to try and learn why our numbers are high.""

Canada's most populous province is taking its first baby steps towards reopening the economy. Hardware stores and nurseries in Ontario, where about 40% of Canadians live, will be able to open fully to the public on Friday. Customers will still be asked to maintain social distancing. All retail stores with street access (such as small shoe and clothing stores) will be able to offer curbside pickup starting Monday. The province is also extending the hours at liquor stores and cutting 
the mandatory minimum pricing for booze in restaurants and bars. Coronavirus cases are still on the rise there, albeit at a slower pace. There were 412 news cases Tuesday, up from 387 on Monday. On 25 April, Ontario hit a high of 640 cases in a single day. Other provinces have also started to reopen, including Quebec, which has had the most cases in the country. Bayern Munich (pictured training on Tuesday) are four points ahead of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the German Bundesliga with nine matches remaining Earlier today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country's top football league, the Bundesliga, could resume this month and we now have the date: 15 May. The last Bundesliga match was played on 11 March, before football across most of Europe was halted because of the coronavirus pandemic. All remaining matches in Germany will be played behind closed doors. Top-flight leagues in England, Spain and Italy are trying to find a way to complete their campaigns, although France's Ligue 1 will not resume and Paris St-Germain have been declared champions, while the Netherlands' Eredivisie season has been abandoned, with no champions, relegation or promotion. Demand for Uber's taxi services have fallen by more than 60% in coronavirus hotspots Uber has announced it will cut 3,700 full-time staff - or around 14% of its workforce. Business has plunged for the companysince the pandemic began. But even before, Uber was struggling to balance its books, making a loss of $8.5bn (Â£6.8bn) in 2019. The staff cuts will come mainly in its customer support and retail teams, the company says. The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will also waive his base salary - set at $1m in 2019 - for the rest of the year.  A police officer gets a swab test Here are some updates from across the US today:  Siavash Mehdi-ArdalanBBC Persian Iranâs Central Registrar Office
has confirmed that it has been ordered not to publish the overall death rates
in the country over the past three months, increasing scepticism over the official coronavirus statistics. Iran's official tally is 6,418 dead and more than 100,000 cases since the first coronavirus case
was confirmed on 19 February. The real figures are thought to be much
higher and authorities on Tehran's city council have disputed the official
numbers. A parliamentary report published last month also estimated that the
real numbers of cases and fatalities were 10 times higher. The government
of President Hassan Rouhani has boasted that its management of the pandemic has helped to contain the spread and to keep the numbers of fatalities down. Medical workers stand outside a New York hospital as people applaud At least 90,000 healthcare workers are thought to have contracted coronavirus, although the number could be as much as twice that, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) said. More than 260 nurses have lost their lives to Covid-19, it said. The estimate is based on data collected from 30 countries. The ICN urged governments to maintain accurate records to assist in stopping the virus spreading among staff and patients. ""The figure for health care workers infections has risen from 23,000 to we think more than 90,000, but that is still an under-estimation because it isn't [covering] every country in the world,"" Howard Catton, ICN's chief executive officer, told Reuters. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte spoke at a news conference in The Hague on Wednesday The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has been outlining how the Netherlands plans to slowly unlock the partial lockdown. From 11 May schools and day cares will reopen (this had been previously announced) and hairdressers, beauticians and other contact professions can start operating again next week, along with libraries opening. People should try to keep their distance but Rutte has acknowledged this will not always be possible but face masks wonât be required. From 1 June everyone on public transport must wear a face mask, although Rutte, speaking during a press conference this evening, urged people to make their own masks, saying âmedical masks are for medical staffâ. Rutte has recommended face masks in situations where itâs not possible to keep a distance of 1.5 metres - not because they stop you contracting but to stop people infecting others. Also from 1 June Dutch bars can reopen their terraces - reservations and limited numbers with 1.5 metre spacing. Restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres and museums can start operating again, under strict conditions: only with reservations, but again people must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres. As of 1 July, camp sites and churches can open doors again. Dr Tedros said cases were increasing in regions like Africa We have been watching the World Health Organization's regular news conference. Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that while the number of cases in Western Europe is declining, they are increasing in Eastern Europe, Africa, South-East Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas. He also warned governments that unless the lifting of lockdown restrictions is managed carefully, ""the risk of the virus returning remains very real"". He described six criteria to meet before lockdowns are lifted: The price of Tecate has gone up by 12% since the second week of March, a survey suggests Mexico is days away from running out of beer, the country's brewers' association is warning. Brewing is not among the industries which the government declared essential and therefore had to halt production at the end of March. ""There's no production, there's no distribution, we're not producing a single beer,"" said Karla Siqueiros, president of Brewers of Mexico. Siqueiros said she did not have an estimate of how many beers were left in supermarkets and shops, but that she had already received reports of prices shooting up as speculators took advantage of shortages. She reassured beer lovers that brewers were poised to restart production as soon as they were allowed to by the government  - but cautioned that she had not been given any hint as to when that could be. On 25 April, Luther addressed an ""Open Texas"" rally outside City Hall in Frisco A hair salon owner in Texas has been jailed for a week for staying open despite coronavirus restrictions that have shut all non-essential businesses.

"'More normal' shopping habits are back, says OcadoThe online retailer has seen a huge increase in demand as shoppers stay at home during lockdown.","Ocado says ""more normal"" shopping habits are back after a huge jump in demand amid the coronavirus lockdown. Its customers are now purchasing fewer items than at the peak of demand, with the balance between fresh and long-life food returning to normal. The online grocer has made changes to increase the delivery slots available, including suspending the delivery of mineral water. Its revenues in April were up more than 40% from a year earlier. ""At the beginning of the outbreak demand increased significantly, almost overnight,"" the retailer said.

Ocado said these limits have since been rolled back as the number of items shoppers are putting in their baskets ""appears to have passed its peak but remains high"". Tim Steiner, chief executive of the Ocado group, said: ""We are facing quite a different challenge to many, as we scale up Ocado.com to play its part in feeding the nation."" The supermarket has drawn criticism on social media as customers faced being one of thousands in a virtual queue to place a food order. It was previously forced to suspend its entire service briefly, and temporarily took down its app due to the spike in orders. Currently, new customers are not able to place orders with the retailer due to a lack of available delivery slots.

""Ocado was becoming the UK's stock market's most prominent and, arguably, important technology company before the crisis - that status has only accelerated over the past couple of months.""

White House plans to disband virus task forceThe vice-president says the task force may wind down by the end of May or early June.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump: 'Mike Pence and the taskforce have done a great job' US President Donald Trump has confirmed the White House coronavirus task force will be winding down, with Vice-President Mike Pence suggesting it could be disbanded within weeks. ""We are bringing our country back,"" Mr Trump said during a visit to a mask-manufacturing factory in Arizona.Â New confirmed infections per day in the US currently top 20,000, and daily deaths exceed 1,000. US health officials warn the virus may spread as businesses begin to reopen. The US currently has 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 70,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which is tracking the pandemic. During a visit to the plant in Phoenix after weeks holed up at the White House, Mr Trump told journalists: ""Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we'll have a different group probably set up for that."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: How long does it take to recover? The president - who wore safety goggles but no face mask during his tour of the facility - was asked if it was ""mission accomplished"", and he said: ""No, not at all. The mission accomplished is when it's over."" Critics have accused the president of sacrificing Americans' public health in his eagerness to reopen the US economy ahead of his re-election battle in November. In Arizona on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that Democrats were hoping his coronavirus policy would fail ""so they can win the election"". Acknowledging a human cost to the plans, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I'm not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon."" Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak Why is there a US backlash to masks? 'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' However, it will be up to individual states to determine how they reopen. Some Democratic governors in badly hit states have been cautious, calling for more testing and other safeguards before easing lockdowns. Other states, many led by Republicans in the south and mid-west, have already begun lifting restrictions. The task force was set up on 29 January. Mr Pence became its chairman four weeks later and its members include more than 20 experts and leading administration officials. The White House said the task force's duty was to ""lead the administration's efforts to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus"" and provide the public with information. Mr Trump's once-daily task force briefings became increasingly scarce after he was widely condemned by the medical community for pondering at the podium last month whetherinjecting bleach into people might kill the virus. Dr Deborah Birx has been the task force's response co-ordinator. The president was asked on Tuesday whether she and another high-profile member, Dr Anthony Fauci, would still be involved in efforts to address the coronavirus. ""They will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field,"" the president said. Mr Pence earlier on Tuesday told reporters in a briefing that the task force could soon be disbanded. He said the Trump administration was ""starting to look at the Memorial Day [late May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage, begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner"". He said it was ""a reflection of the tremendous progress we've made as a country"". US allies tread lightly around Trump virus lab claims Coronavirus: Your pictures of lockdown at home Mr Pence has led the task force, which reports to the president and co-ordinates with medical institutes, political staff and state governors. The group also consulted medical experts to formulate national guidelines on social distancing. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later tweeted that the president ""will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: When might Hollywood reopen for business? The White House's shift in focus from the public health aspect of the coronavirus pandemic to its economic impact continues. For more than a month, the task force had been the public face of the administration's response to the crisis, even though President Trump sometimes veered far from the topic at hand during its press briefings. When the president wasn't talking, however, government public health officials led the conversation. Now, it appears, the officials setting the agenda will be ones more concerned with jobs, businesses and the fiscal health of the nation - even though the number of cases of the virus throughout the US continues to increase. There is growing frustration among the president's core supporters, however, with government shelter-in-place orders. Several states, encouraged by the president, have already begun to ease restrictions, even though they have not met White House guidelines for when to do so. Those recommendations were set by the current coronavirus task force, of course. And the ""different group"" in a ""different form"" that replaces it, as the president describes, may have other ideas. On, off, on again... are Trump daily briefings over? Not yet. Besides New York, which is still the US epicentre despite an ongoing drop in new cases, the level of infection continues to climb across much of the country. Many states that have allowed some business to resume - including Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana -Â are seeing more new cases reported daily. While some cities such as New York, New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement, others like Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago are seeing the caseload rise every day. According to a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), more than 3,000 people may be killed by the virus each day by next month. The White House has dismissed the report as inaccurate, with Mr Trump saying it describes a scenario in which Americans make no effort to mitigate the spread of the infection. On Sunday, the president increased his forecast for the number of US pandemic deaths to 100,000, after saying two weeks earlier that it would be fewer than 60,000. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, a public forecast model that has been frequently cited by the White House, now estimates that Covid-19 will account for 135,000 American deaths by 4 August. This more than doubles its 17 April forecast. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Theresa May criticises global virus response,"Former Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised world leaders for failing ""to forge a coherent international response"" to the coronavirus pandemic. Writing inthe Times,external, she said states had ""gone their own way"" and treated the virus as a ""national issue"". Lack of international collaboration could lead to the world becoming more dangerous, she warned. A No 10 source said there had been ""extensive co-operation"", with the PM talking regularly to other G7 leaders. Mrs May's intervention comes as Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer face each other at Prime Minister's Questions for the first time later. They are also due to hold talks on the coronavirus crisis after the UK's death toll became the highest in Europe. A total of 29,427 people have died in the UK - passing Italy's death toll of 29,315. But experts have said it could be months before full global comparisons can be made. Live: Latest from around the world UK coronavirus death toll higher than Italy's Can you compare the UK with Italy? In the Times, Mrs May wrote: ""The global impact of Covid-19, and our inability to forge a coherent international response to it, have raised new questions about the effectiveness of a system of cooperation through shared institutions."" She called on the government to ""embrace its wider international role beyond the day to day of the pandemic"" and not shy away from our ""responsibilities on the world stage"". She said the virus had been ""treated as a national issue for countries to deal with alone"" and while researchers and scientists may work together, there was ""little evidence of politicians doing so"". ""Governments are faced with an enormous challenge, and it is no surprise that they see as their first job the immediate protection of their own citizens,"" she said. ""But there remains no collective international view as to what works best in dealing with the virus - nor does there seem to have been any attempt to form one. Instead, states have each gone their own way."" World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fight Johnson speaks to Trump as recovery continues Mrs May said this ""risks exacerbating the shift towards nationalism and absolutism in global politics"". ""A world in which a few 'strong men' square up to each other and expect everyone else to choose between them would be a dangerous one,"" she said. She said the international community still had to work with China, despite concerns within her party that Beijing has suppressed information and tried to exploit the pandemic - which began in Wuhan - to further its interests. While China should face questions over its response, she said scrutiny should not become a fault line in international relations. The former prime minister warned about nationalism and absolutism in global politics The UK's international efforts have been focused on the mission to find a coronavirus vaccine, Boris Johnson describing it as ""the most urgent endeavour of our lives"". Earlier this week, the PM co-hosted an international conference to try and raise more than Â£6bn towards the global response, although the US, Russia and India declined to take part. The UK has pledged to give Â£388m in aid funding for research into tests, treatments and vaccines - part of a Â£744m commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. The prime minister is expected to reveal a ""road map"" out of the UK's lockdown on Sunday. Social distancing measures have been in place in the UK since 23 March in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. Meanwhile, Tory MP Ranil Jayawardena has been appointed international trade minister, after Conor Burnsresigned from the role this week.

"Theresa May criticises global virus responseCountries have ""gone their own way"" rather than working together, the ex-prime minister says.UK PoliticsComments","Former Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised world leaders for failing ""to forge a coherent international response"" to the coronavirus pandemic. Writing inthe Times,external, she said states had ""gone their own way"" and treated the virus as a ""national issue"". Lack of international collaboration could lead to the world becoming more dangerous, she warned. A No 10 source said there had been ""extensive co-operation"", with the PM talking regularly to other G7 leaders. Mrs May's intervention comes as Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer face each other at Prime Minister's Questions for the first time later. They are also due to hold talks on the coronavirus crisis after the UK's death toll became the highest in Europe. A total of 29,427 people have died in the UK - passing Italy's death toll of 29,315. But experts have said it could be months before full global comparisons can be made. Live: Latest from around the world UK coronavirus death toll higher than Italy's Can you compare the UK with Italy? In the Times, Mrs May wrote: ""The global impact of Covid-19, and our inability to forge a coherent international response to it, have raised new questions about the effectiveness of a system of cooperation through shared institutions."" She called on the government to ""embrace its wider international role beyond the day to day of the pandemic"" and not shy away from our ""responsibilities on the world stage"". She said the virus had been ""treated as a national issue for countries to deal with alone"" and while researchers and scientists may work together, there was ""little evidence of politicians doing so"". ""Governments are faced with an enormous challenge, and it is no surprise that they see as their first job the immediate protection of their own citizens,"" she said. ""But there remains no collective international view as to what works best in dealing with the virus - nor does there seem to have been any attempt to form one. Instead, states have each gone their own way."" World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fight Johnson speaks to Trump as recovery continues Mrs May said this ""risks exacerbating the shift towards nationalism and absolutism in global politics"". ""A world in which a few 'strong men' square up to each other and expect everyone else to choose between them would be a dangerous one,"" she said. She said the international community still had to work with China, despite concerns within her party that Beijing has suppressed information and tried to exploit the pandemic - which began in Wuhan - to further its interests. While China should face questions over its response, she said scrutiny should not become a fault line in international relations. The former prime minister warned about nationalism and absolutism in global politics The UK's international efforts have been focused on the mission to find a coronavirus vaccine, Boris Johnson describing it as ""the most urgent endeavour of our lives"". Earlier this week, the PM co-hosted an international conference to try and raise more than Â£6bn towards the global response, although the US, Russia and India declined to take part. The UK has pledged to give Â£388m in aid funding for research into tests, treatments and vaccines - part of a Â£744m commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. The prime minister is expected to reveal a ""road map"" out of the UK's lockdown on Sunday. Social distancing measures have been in place in the UK since 23 March in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. Meanwhile, Tory MP Ranil Jayawardena has been appointed international trade minister, after Conor Burnsresigned from the role this week.

Lord Sugar's tweet banned by advertising watchdog,"Lord Alan Sugar has been told to remove a tweet promoting a teeth whitening kit after he did not make it clear it was an advert. The Apprentice host tweeted in December that a product from the brand Stylsmile would make a ""perfect Xmas gift"". He owns a 50% share in the business, which is run by a former winner of the reality show. The advertising watchdog said the tweet breached guidelines and must not appear again. ""If you know someone who's longing for whiter teeth, this is the perfect Xmas gift for them,"" said Lord Sugar, 73, in the tweet, along with a link to the product's website. A complaint was raised about the post, questioning whether it was obvious it was an advert. Lord Sugar and Stylsmile - run by inventor Tom Pellereau, who won the series in 2011 -  argued that it was a well-known fact that Lord Sugar was a partner in the company, because it was made public on The Apprentice in front of millions of viewers. They said Lord Sugar was known to post about his businesses on social media regularly, and the tweet was not a covert promotion. However, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the tweet broke the advertising code. According to the rules, all advertising communications must be clearly marked, for example with the phrase ""#ad"" on social media posts. The Apprentice aired its 15th series last year The ASA said the tweet ""was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication"". And although Lord Sugar was a well-known investor, it was also not immediately clear to people that Lord Sugar had a commercial interest in that business, the ASA said. ""We told Stylideas Ltd t/a Stylsmile UK and Lord Sugar to ensure that they made clear the commercial intent of their posts in future, for example by including a clear and prominent identifier on their social media posts such as #ad,"" the watchdog added. Should rules on Instagram ads be tougher? Social-media influencers' incomes soar The ASA has also upheld complaints against TV personality Stacey Solomon, who posted two paid-for posts on her Instagram account promoting the brand Card Factory. Her two Instagram stories, in November last year, contained the word ""ad"" but it was in white lettering on a white background. The ASA said because the word was obscured, ""the story posts were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications"". Solomon is the latest among a string of celebrities and influencers to have had complaints upheld against them over social media posts that had not been marked clearly as adverts.

Firms ready to restart within three weeks,"Are employees prepared for the return to work? Most firms believe they could be ready to restart business with just three weeks' notice. That's according to the latest British Chambers of Commerce Coronavirus weekly survey of firms. BBC News talked to companies in five different sectors to find out how prepared they are to return work and their new ways of doing business. Some are rotating staff. Others have introduced remote services or plan to shut the office altogether. ""Businesses' ability to restart quickly varies by company size and by sector,"" said BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall. The survey suggests that businesses that offer services to other business are the most ready, with two-thirds saying they would need less than one week or no notice at all to restart operations. Fewer than half of firms serving consumers said they were confident of being ready that quickly. ""It will be crucial for the government to maintain and evolve support for businesses, to give as many firms as possible the chance to navigate a phased return to work,"" said Dr Marshall. Here, we talk to five different types of firms - office, construction, restaurant, factory and shop - to see what changes they're making. ""We're not going to return to office working. We will close it as soon as the lease runs out,"" says Shai Aharony, chief executive of Reboot Digital Marketing. ""It will save us around 10% of our turnover and means we'll cut down on fuel, pollution and all the other surrounding costs associated with having an office."" The Hertfordshire-based business, which employs 20 people, has found that working from home suits its workers. ""It's a major change for us. But I don't think that things are going to go back to normal. A lot of companies are going to have to evolve rapidly if they want to survive."" However, they'll still need to get together regularly, says Mr Aharony. ""We have a brainstorming session every two weeks that is key to our business. ""In future, we'll do it at a local hotel. We'll brainstorm and do all the other tasks that are more efficiently done face-to-face and then go out as a company."" ""All our site workers will have to do their health and safety inductions at home,"" says Andrew Brooks, boss of housebuilder Bewley Homes. Inductions are normally done on site in groups, which is not possible right now. ""Importantly, it makes sure they know everything to follow the new regulations. The old way of inducting 10 people in a small room has long gone."" Signing into a site has also had to go digital. ""Sharing a pen, punching into a tablet or fingerprint scans are no longer options,"" Mr Brooks says. The builder is adopting digital sign-ins. Nearly every aspect of construction site life has changed, if not forever, then certainly for the next few months, he says. ""There's a huge logistical challenge to get 400 workers back on site at once and it needs methodical planning,"" he says. ""It's not just getting subcontractors to respect the two-metre rule plot-by-plot and to navigate around the entire site, there are also all the new on-site safety measures to put in place."" ""I've had to develop new dishes that travel,"" says Dev Biswal, owner of the Ambrette, three fine dining Indian restaurants in Canterbury and Margate. ""I've never offered takeaways, because my style of cooking and presentation could never survive transportation."" But like many other businesses, he's had to adapt to survive. He's now planning to open a ""dark kitchen"", which will offer multi-cuisine, takeaway gourmet dishes, such as slow goat stroganoff or coconut and saffron cheesecake, through Deliveroo. He's also moving his cookery classes online and set up an ingredient delivery service. He says the crisis has forced him to accelerate plans to introduce deliveries. ""I've read industry reports which all predict significant growth for the delivery market, so it's something I'd been giving serious thought to for some time,"" says Mr Biswal. ""The crash in footfall surrounding the media panic around Covid-19 means I've had to bring those plans forward."" ""We've moved our on-site laboratories to operate in completely separated shifts,"" says Lee Sheppard, director at Wiltshire-based caterer Apetito. The company - which supplies food to the health and social care sector - has introduced a number of social distancing measures to ensure the safety of workers at its Trowbridge factory. These include glass partitions in its production kitchen and individual tables, placed two metres apart in its team canteen, while the numbers of those that can enter have been reduced. Its offices remain closed, with team members now working from home, but the company is considering a rotation scheme which would limit numbers of people in the office at one time. ""We already had a flexible policy with working from home, but we're exploring the idea of staff working one week in the office and one week from home."" Meanwhile, its delivery teams are following a default no-contact delivery policy. ""We've been exploring remote alternatives to our traditional in-person appointments,"" says Giles Edmonds, clinical services director at Specsavers. ""Our stores are currently only able to offer urgent and essential care to a limited number of customers."" The new way of doing business is to allow customers to get advice and care from optometrists and audiologists via video and telephone link. ""It removes a number of barriers, especially with health services already under immense pressure,"" says Mr Edmonds. They also have an Ask The Expert service on Facebook, while in branches, ""frontline"" teams provide urgentâ¯ andâ¯ essential eye care to other key workers and people whoâ¯ could come to harm. ""However, we have modified our processes to minimise the time that optometrists or audiologists and their patients are in proximity to each other."" That's on top of a range of social distancing measures and the provision of hand sanitisers, which all retailers have adopted.

UK warned over coronavirus climate trapUK government advisors say post-pandemic recovery funds should go to firms reducing carbon emissions.Science & Environment,"The government faces a post-lockdown choice between green growth or propping up polluting industries The UK must avoid lurching from the coronavirus crisis into a deeper climate crisis, the governmentâs advisers have warned. They recommend that ministers ensure funds earmarked for a post-Covid-19 economic recovery go to firms that will reduce carbon emissions. They say the public should work from home if possible; and to walk or cycle. And investment should prioritise broadband over road-building, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says. People should also be encouraged to save emissions by continuing to consult GPs online. The government will reply later, although the Energy Secretary Alok Sharma has already spoken in favour of a green recovery to the recession. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) Covid recovery plan 'must tackle climate change' Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red' In a letter to the Prime Minister, the committee says jobless people should be re-trained for work in geographically-spread labour-intensive âgreenâ industries such as home insulation; tree-planting; and peatland restoration. Road building should have a lower priority than broadband, the report says It makes a veiled reference to the current discussions over a potential government bailout to save jobs in aviation, which is struggling in the crisis. The letter says: âMany sectors of the UK economy do not currently bear the full costs of emitting greenhouse gases. Revenue could be raised by setting or raising carbon prices for these sectors.â Green groups say any bailout should include a condition that the industry shrinks until it finds a technological solution to its carbon emissions. The letter also tackles broader social themes of fairness and risk. It says the Covid-19 crisis has highlighted inequalities, with poorer people more in danger. The committee notes: âThe response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people - who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change. âThe benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely, and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes. âIt is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new, resilient economy.â What is climate change? Climate-related words and phrases explained How much warmer is your city? What is your diet's carbon footprint? Where we are in seven charts The committee says the government must produce policies that allow the UK to reduce emissions to Net Zero in an orderly way â unlike the chaos of the Covid-19 crisis. The CCC Chairman, Lord Deben, said: âThe Covid-19 crisis has shown the importance of planning well for the risks the country faces. âRecovery means investing in new jobs, cleaner air and improved health. The actions needed to tackle climate change are central to rebuilding our economy. âThe government must prioritise actions that reduce climate risks and avoid measures that lock-in higher emissions.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The message is not uncontested. Some politicians have argued that jobs must be protected at all cost in the recovery from the Covid-19 recession. The UK will chair a vital global climate conference next year. Lord Deben said the UK should set a global example by planning a climate-friendly recovery from Covid-19. The committee has copied the letter to the leaders of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. It will expand on its advice in June. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says the government should harness the lessons from the Covid-19 crisis tocreate a better society overall.,external She says ministers should force firms to show how they will meet CO2 cuts, and give people a right to locally-produced food; affordable clean energy; and access to green space. The environment consultancy EPR says ministers should change the balance of the planning process to ensure that green space is a top priority rather than a nice-to-have.

As we bring things to a close for the day, these have been some of the main stories:  Join us from first thing in the morning for all the latest updates from across Wales. The little terns return each April from Africa to nest in the dunes, feeding on sand eels Electric fences have been installed to protect Wales' only breeding colony of Little Terns from the threat of quad bikes, Denbighshire council has said. Council staff have completed the work at at Gronant Dunes, which acts a home to the colony of small, rare seabirds. It came amid fears the Little Terns had faced recent threats from quad bikes driving over ""vital"" shingle nesting habitat. The colony will continue to be monitored with a staff presence throughout the season, which runs from May to late July. Police have previously suggestedillegal off-road bikers have beenworse in some parts of Wales during lockdown, due to them being able to access sites more empty than usual. Councillor Tony Thomas said: âIf left unprotected there is a real danger the Little Terns could be disturbed to an extent where they do not return and this iconic species is lost from Wales forever.â Last year, 206 fledglings and 166 breeding pairs of Little Terns nested in Gronant, Mr Thomas said. Wales could and would ease
coronavirus restrictions at different times to England ""if it's the
difference between saving thousands of the lives of Welsh citizens"",
the health minister says. There are concerns the large number of people living near the border and many in Wales
consuming London-based media would make it practically
difficult for Wales to go its own way on lockdown. But Vaughan Gething said: ""You can
guarantee that we will make the right choice for Wales, including moving at a
different time out of lockdown if it is the right thing to do but our
preference is to have a joint four-nations conversation and a decision that
works for each four countries within the UK."" In Prime Minister's Questions
earlier Boris Johnson confirmed he would be setting out plans to begin
lifting England's lockdown on Sunday, adding that he hoped to ""get going
on some of these measures on Monday"". High-tech surveillance techniques are being deployed to tackle ""unscrupulous waste operators"" taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has said. The environmental body said social-distancing guidelines meant officers were unable to use their usual investigation methods. So they have turned to sophisticated drone technology and satellite cameras to help track of waste criminals. The new approach includes:  Adrian Evans of NRW said: âSocial-distancing is impacting on how companies supplying goods and services operate and waste criminals are taking advantage of this. âWe have had to modify our ways of working by developing technological solutions to support our work and ensure that waste operators comply with environmental regulations."" Testing is being
extended to staff and residents without Covid-19 symptoms at care homes of more
than 50 beds, the Welsh Government has confirmed. Testing in care homes in Wales
remains more restrictive than in England, where all residents and staff are
being tested regardless of symptoms. Following complaints that Wales was not following England on the
measure the Welsh Government extended the policy - from
testing just staff and residents with symptoms, to all those in a home where
someone has tested positive. First Minister Mark Drakeford
told the Senedd evidence did not exist to show everyone in the sector
should be tested. He said larger care homes have a
larger number of people going in and out of them. But Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price
claimed the policy unfairly discriminated against smaller care homes in rural
and valleys communities. Buying a
bouncy castle, picking up a puppy or going for a spin are not valid reasons
for being out and about during the coronavirus crisis, police have warned. Dyfed-Powys Police inspector
Andy Williams said the vast majority of people had made âextraordinary effortsâ
to comply with the new rules over the last seven weeks. But he added some individuals continue to flout the rules â with their reasons for doing so ranging
from misguided to bizarre. These have
included people driving from London, Luton,
Bristol and beyond to buy or look at dogs, with one Manchester
man telling officers his potential pet âwouldnât be a puppy anymoreâ if he
waited. A Bath couple were caught trying to walk Pen y Fan, while two men stopped in Brecon had driven from Derby to pick up a remote-controlled car. Meanwhile a couple
were left deflated after officers told them a 100-mile round trip to
Pembrokeshire to collect a bouncy castle was not considered essential travel. And another couple stopped with a boot-full of fishing gear told officers
they were going to collect some rice from a friend â despite their sat nav being programmed to Saundersfoot. Stunning aerial images of a quiet Cardiff during lockdown have been posted by flying police.

Six weeks after leaving hospital, Wales' first Covid-19 patientsays his breathing is slowly improvingbut he still struggles with fatigue. Mark Hosking, 53, of Mumbles, Swansea, spent four days on a ventilator in an induced coma at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He fell ill on returning from a skiing holiday to Italy in February. Speaking of his recovery upon returning home, he said: ""I was told take your time, don't expect to get back to full fitness quickly. ""When I came out of the coma with the ventilator I felt extremely fragile, very weak, and even leaving the hospital was a strange thing. ""To leave the security of the hospital was a big thing. ""There's a lot of mental issues you've got to think about, to bring yourself back into the world. But the world had changed a lot from when I went in to when I came out."" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has told today's UK government daily virus update that the daily number of tests dropped to 69,436, as the total remained below its 100,000 target. After reaching the target by 30 April and again on 1 May the number has been below the mark, despite a capacity of 108,000 currently. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at PMQs earlier that he had an ambition to reach a 200,000 capacity by the end of May. In Wales, the current testing capacity is 2,100 with no target in place. Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, told today's UK government briefing that authorities were ""controlling"" the transmission of the epidemic. Unveiling the slide above, she noted that the number of deaths across the UK offered ""less good"" news than on hospitalisations. But she said the ""trend is good"", and is ""slowly coming down"". Drivers continue to flout speed limits on roads which are quieter than usual due to the lockdown, police have said. North Wales Police tweeted an image of a speed gun showing a 104 mph reading on the display. ""Yet another driver caught doing silly speeds on the theA55,externalnearLlangefni,external,"" its road policing teamtweeted,external. ""Speeding is an offence and known to be one of the main causes of fatal and serious injury collisions. Help reduce demand on emergency services by driving safely."" Police forces have previously warned of drivers travelling at very high speeds, saying a crash could put a""huge strain"" on emergency services.  Wales seems to have ""passed the peak"" in coronavirus cases, according to Public Health Wales. But health officials - and politicians - have urged people not to be tempted to break social distancing restrictions over the coming bank holiday weekend. Read more about what the figures show where you live. There have been a further 649 coronavirus deaths recorded in the UK, taking the total to 30,076, UK Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said at the Downing Street briefing. Wayne Rees says he is grateful for the proning technique which allowed him to avoid going into intensive care. Mr Rees, 56, was admitted to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend after struggling to breathe. But instead of being ventilated in an intensive care unit (ICU), he was given ventilatory support via a fitted mask and rolled onto his front for prolonged periods - known as proning. He is the hospital's second patient to have avoided ICU after proning. âI was very grateful that they gave me that chance as I did not fancy going under anaesthetic and having a tube put down my throat,"" said Mr Rees, who is recovering at home after 20 days in hospital. âI was well looked after by the staff who were constantly monitoring me and Iâm very grateful to them.""

Local Democracy Reporting Service A race is speeding up in laboratories around the world to create a coronavirus vaccine to prevent deaths and kick-start the economy. Virology expert Rich Stanton, of Cardiff University, said he was âcautiously hopefulâ. But he said the process from beginning to end normally takes 10 to 20 years. This could potentially be compressed into 18 months, he said, if everything fell into place. âIf any one of those things doesnât happen, then the timescale gets pushed back,â said Dr Stanton. âUnfortunately, the only way to know if itâll work is to try it and see.â A team at Oxford University â now backed by UK government funding â has started a human trial, and said it hoped a million doses could be ready by September. Dr Stanton said around 70 potential coronavirus vaccines were being trialled around the world. âThere is a huge amount of pressure to get this work done effectively and quickly,â he said. âScience is quite competitive â in a lot of areas there is only a prize for first place.â Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent The Welsh Government supports calls from trade unions for a flexible approach to the furlough scheme by the UK chancellor. What unions want to see is the avoidance of a ""cliff edge"" for the scheme, which sees the UK government pay 80% of the wages of workers who are not needed by their employer during the coronavirus outbreak. At the Welsh Government's daily press briefing, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said it was important furloughing was ""tapered"" and did not come to an ""abrupt end"".  Retail, leisure and aviation have been particularly badly hit by coronavirus. Unions want some staff to be able to return to work on a part-time basis with, for example, the employer paying 50% of wages and the UK government paying the other 50%. CBI Wales also wants flexibility with some sectors being allowed to furlough staff for longer. The Welsh Government says it is ""unthinkable"" UK ministers would end furlough ""abruptly"". It added, however, that if they did, the Welsh Government would not be able to finance it for Wales due to the cost.

risk creating conditions in which coronavirus ""takes off again"", the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford told the Senedd
his administration would take the ""most careful and cautious steps
forward"" that will have the ""best impact for the minimum amount of
risk"". ""Any step beyond lockdown
is a risk"", Mr Drakeford said, but he was not prepared to sign up to ""any sense
of a cavalier approach to risk in which we put people knowingly in harm's
way"". Answering a question from
UKIP's Neil Hamilton, Mr Drakeford agreed that the economy needed to be opened
up again but added: ""We are not going to create conditions in which coronavirus
simply takes off again and spreads like wildfire to the whole population,
creating huge spikes again in hospital admissions, overwhelming critical care
capacity and so on."" Mr Hamilton had suggested to
the first minister that ""we have to take the risk that the infection rate
of coronavirus will continue as it is, so long as we can protect the
vulnerable"" in order to ""get the economy back on its feet"". The exchange came after Boris
Johnson confirmed in Prime Minister's Questions that he would be setting out
plans to begin lifting England's lockdown measures on Sunday, adding that he
hoped to ""get going on some of these measures on Monday"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Switch to making hand sanitiser lifts spirits firm,"After sales of its specialist booze started slipping, a Cotswolds spirits company turned to making hand sanitisers to keep the money coming in. The British Honey Company has made Â£500,000 from sales of its alcohol sanitiser since its end-of-March launch. The cash ""more than offset the decline in revenues from the company's core product"", it said. ""Sales... have been exceptional,"" said chief executive Michael Williams. The company makes a range of honey and fruit-infused spirits, such as Keepr's Gin. They are sold through specialist online retailers and hotel chains, but sales have fallen since lockdown as customers remain indoors or buy booze through supermarkets. It spotted the trend early in the coronavirus crisis and applied for permission from HMRC to use excess capacity at its Buckinghamshire distillery to produce the alcohol sanitiser, made with 70% alcohol and extracts of British honey and green tea. ""Very early on during the Covid-19 outbreak we identified a clear opportunity for the company to move into the production of alcohol-based sanitisers, to meet exceptional demand and supply shortages, given the basic ingredient is the same as for our infused spirit brands,"" said Michael Williams. He said sales had ""exceeded expectations"". The firm - which listed as a public company in March - will focus current production capacity on its Drip+Drop sanitiser in the short to medium term while demand remains high. Mr Williams warned that problems in the alcohol supply chain were starting to emerge. The company has responded by ""ring-fencing"" enough alcohol in its bonded warehouse to meet anticipated demand for its alcohol sanitiser and infused spirits products until at least the end of the calendar year, including the Christmas period, the peak time for spirit sales. A number of drinks firms have switched to producing hand sanitiser during the coronavirus crisis. William Grant & Sons, better known for its whisky, has shifted production at three of its distilleries to make sanitiser. Diageo has pledged to help create eight million bottles of sanitiser during the crisis by donating up to two million litres of grain-neutral spirit to hand sanitiser producers. ""This is the quickest and most effective way for us to meet the surging demand for hand sanitiser around the world,"" said Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo. Bacardi has turned its rum distillery in CataÃ±o, Puerto Rico, into a hand sanitiser production site. Scottish brewer Brewdog is producing about 4,000 litres a week of its Punk Sanitiser for the NHS and local Aberdeenshire charities. Where has all the hand sanitiser gone?

LiveLiveCoronavirus in Scotland - FM's Covid-19 strategy faces scrutiny6 minutes ago6 minutes ago Good morningGood morningLive Coronavirus in Scotland - FM's Covid-19 strategy faces scrutiny  6 minutes ago,"The first minister says that a fall in the rate of deaths linked to coronavirus in Scotland last week gives ""some hope"" But Nicola Sturgeon says the progress is ""still too fragile to immediately ease restrictions in any meaningful way"" National Records of Scotland data says there were 523 deaths between 27 April and 3 May, down 135 on the previous week A total of 2,795 people have now died with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus in Scotland The Scottish government's strategy for tackling coronavirus came under scrutiny at First Minister's Questions BBC Scotland News Here are some of the day's main developments:  We'll be back early tomorrow for more live coverage including the Scottish government's latest assessment of whether it's too early to start easing the lockdown. Goodnight In response to Sarah's question about worried parents, Mr Swinney says the government has got to build up their confidence. He said there are hubs across the country for vulnerable children and children of essential workers but only 1% of the school population are using them. The education secretary said that tells him that families want to keep their kids close to home because they're worried about the situation. ""We've got to build confidence, we've got to see levels of infectiousness falling within our country, and we've got to make sure that schools are viewed as the safe places that they always have been for children and young people,"" he added. ""But we've got to make them safe from Covid in the period going forward."" On the subject of whether or not nurseries will be treated the same as schools, Mr Swinney said they are ""in the same situation"". He highlighted that some advice suggests the very youngest children are ""less susceptible"" to Covid-19 and ""less likely to transmit it"", although he acknowledged there is a great deal of debate around this issue. Mr Swinney said that for the youngest children, social distancing will be a ""real challenge"" to understand. He said: ""We've got to build confidence and safety around early learning centres to make sure children and staff are safe."" When asked to be clear about whether schools will open before the summer holidays, Mr Swinney replied it was ""almost inconceivable"" that every pupil would return to school by June. He reiterated the possibility that some students may go back if Scotland reduces its infection levels further. Mr Swinney said discussions had taken place today between local authority partners, teaching unions, professional advisers on teaching and parents to ""develop the models"" for getting children back to school. When pressed on the matter in light of parents who may not be able to return to work, he said ""we are working our way through some of these challenges"" and would share information with the public when there was a ""clear plan"". He said: ""We've got very active work under way to design an approach that maximises education at this time. There is nobody that wants to have formal schooling established more than me but we can't do that at the expense of the health of children and staff working in our communities."" Jessica is a teacher and says some of her vulnerable pupils aren't engaging in any sense with ""school"" right now - what could this mean for the attainment gap? Mr Swinney says he is looking at ways to engage some of the young people who live in poverty but it is too early to be definitive about any of the plans. ""I'm looking very actively at how we can take steps to reach those children and young people and make sure they can get formal engagement with education to make sure we can overcome the negative impacts of poverty on their educational opportunity,"" he said. ""Education is going to be passport out of poverty"". Jenny says her daughter's primary school is heavily over-subscribed and the building is outdated. How will they be able to socially-distance? Mr Swinney says it's a problem for all schools - even the modern ones. He says they are looking at making maximum use of space and for children to go back to school part-time - either day-about, or week-about. ""What I can't promise is an early resumption to education in the formal sense... anytime soon because we are going to have to observe social distancing for a significant period of time to come,"" he adds. Education Secretary John Swinney took viewers' questions on Coronavirus: Scotlandâs Response, on BBC One Scotland. Rafe asked what support will be available to pupils to enable digital learning. Mr Swinney said that there was a ""lot of work"" being done to deliver support to all pupils including the provision of devices to pupils from local authorities and the Pupil Equity Fund - which is money given to schools for children who do not have access to devices. He added the government was looking into more resources for children living in poverty. Mr Swinney said: ""We've got to make sure young people have access to that digital connectivity."" Care home staff have paid tribute to a ""kind-hearted, selfless"" nurse who died after contracting Covid-19. Johanna Daniels, 67, who was originally from South Africa, worked at Pitkerro Care Centre in Dundee She died on April 13, having fallen ill at the beginning of the month. Prisca Katsande, Pitkerro Care Centre's home manager, said everyone at the centre had been left ""heartbroken"" by her death. ""We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to work alongside Johanna and we cannot thank her enough for her deep commitment to our residents and her fellow staff,"" she said. Coronavirus: Scotland's responseBBC Scotland Rebecca Curran and Martin Geissler Rebecca Curran and Martin Geissler present Coronavirus: Scotlandâs Response on BBC1 Scotland from 8.30pm. Here's what to expect in tonight's programme:  You can watch it on this page of theBBC iPlayer. A care home nurse has died with coronavirus just days after the birth of her granddaughter. Karen Hutton, 58, was a staff nurse at the dementia unit at Lochleven Care Home in Broughty Ferry, Dundee. Her only daughter, Lauren, gave birth to a baby girl just two weeks ago, according to care home operators Thistle Healthcare. Care home manager Andrew Chalmers-Gall said: ""Karen was a tenacious advocate for her residents and she always put their needs first."" She died at home in Carnoustie, Angus, on 28 April after testing positive for Covid-19. Will GompertzBBC Arts Editor A new Banksy artwork has appeared at Southampton General Hospital. The largely monochrome painting, which is one square metre, was hung in collaboration with the hospital's managers in a foyer near the emergency department. It shows a young boy kneeling by a wastepaper basket dressed in dungarees and a T-shirt. He has discarded his Spiderman and Batman model figures in favour of a new favourite action hero - an NHS nurse. Read more here. This graph using National Records of Scotland data shows how the number of daily deaths has risen sharply and then fallen slightly over time. The statistics suggest the peak number of deaths took place on 9 April. We have more graphs and analysishere A large number of people were photographed in the city's Botanic Gardens apparently flouting the rules during a gloriously sunny day. Families and groups of sunbathers were pictured observing the two-metre distancing rules. But they were breaking restrictions on leaving their homes, which have been in place for more than six weeks. Pictures on social media later showed police speaking to some people. Read more Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent Debenhamâs department
store in Glasgowâs Silverburn shopping centre is not going to re-open after
lockdown ends. Administrators for the
retail chain have failed to reach an agreement on lowered rent with the
commercial landlord, Hammerson. It is
understood there has been a similar breakdown in talks about four Debenhamâs
stores in England. A total of 1,000 people work across these five shops. Most of its
142 outlets are expected to re-open, but the south Glasgow store is now one of
15 that definitely will not. The number of people dying with coronavirus in Scotland has fallen for the first time, according to new statistics. Data from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) showed that the virus was mentioned in 523 death certificates in the week to 3 May. This was lower than the 656 deaths that were recorded the previous week. NRS said it was the first weekly reduction in the number of deaths since reporting began on 16 March. The latest figures bring the total number of people who have died with a confirmed or suspected case of the virus to 2,795. Read more here.  Allow Twitter content?

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Prof June Andrews, an expert in elderly care and dementia, highlights coronavirus symptoms are somewhat different for very old people. Some care homes have reported seeing an increase in falls just before a positive test result for example. Prof Andrews also suggests Covid-19 may have been in care homes from as early as December. The average stay in a care home is 18-19 months, explains the expert, so without testing it is ""impossible"" to say whether people are dying because of coronavirus. She says whether Covid-19 is listed as relevant on a death certificate, due to a known outbreak in the care home, is ""a matter of choice rather than of science."" Prof Andrews said: ""It's really not fair to vilify them [care homes] and say that they are somehow or other failing in their job."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deputy First Minister John Swinney has told BBC  Radio Scotland's Drivetime he cannot see any changes to the current coronavirus lockdown being made tomorrow. Both the Scottish and UK government have a legal duty to review the measures, every three weeks. It comes as Boris Johnson has suggested he is considering easing the restrictions as early as Monday. The prime minister is due to make an announcement on the matter this weekend. Meanwhile theUK has become the first country in Europe to pass 30,000 coronavirus deaths, according to the latest government figures. A total of 30,076 people have now died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for the virus, up by 649 from Tuesday. An investigation by BBC News Arabic has found how one Iranian airline contributed to the spread of coronavirus around the Middle East. Â© 2025 BBC.

Disney suffers $1.4bn hit due to coronavirus,"Disney's Florida theme park has been shut since mid-March Walt Disney Co suffered a $1.4bn (Â£1.1bn) hit to profits in the first three months of the year, as it closed its parks, cancelled movie releases and reduced advertising sales. Every part of its business was affected by coronavirus, nearly wiping out profits for the quarter. Disney chairman Bob Iger said the firm was facing ""unprecedented"" challenges but he was confident of recovery. The firm is already planning to open its Shanghai park on 11 May. Chief executive Bob Chapek said the company would take a ""phased approach"", requiring advance reservations to limit attendance. It said it would require health measures, such as masks and temperature checks. ""We are seeing encouraging signs of gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China,"" he said. ""While it's too early to predict when we'll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks."" The parks and cruise division has been a reliable profit driver for Disney in recent years, as the firm's giant media business tries to adapt to online competition and declines in paid-TV subscriptions and movie theatre attendance. But the parks business was hammered by the closings, accounting for $1bn of the $1.4bn hit to operating income, as the firm shut its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong in January, in Tokyo in February and in the US and France in March. Its cruise lines have also suspended operations. Mr Chapek said he thought there was enough pent-up demand that people would come once the firm does re-open in a limited way. But outside of Shanghai, executives warned that the timing of re-opening remains unclear. The firm's advertising business - which supports its television output - is also seeing significant declines, as companies slash marketing budgets and a lack of live sports reduces viewers on Disney's ESPN sports channel. Disney last year launched a new streaming service, Disney+, which had attracted 54.5 million subscribers as of 4 May - up from about 50 million on 8 April. But it remains loss-making. The direct-to-consumer and international unit, which includes Disney+, posted a loss of $812m in the quarter. ""It's difficult to think of a company which better illustrates the ups and downs of the coronavirus outbreak and its effect on companies,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""While we think the business ... has one of the best asset bases of any listed company ... the damage the current crisis will do remains unclear."" Disney said it was taking numerous steps to shore up its finances, including reducing capital investment plans by $900m and suspending a planned dividend payment. Last month, it stopped paying nearly half of its workforce, furloughing more than 100,000 employees, many of them park and hotel workers. Quarterly revenues were up 21% year-on-year at $18bn - beating analyst expectations. But profits fell to $460m from $5.4bn in the prior year, a 91% drop. ""I have no doubt that we will get through this but it will take some time,"" Disney chairman Bob Iger said.

Theresa May criticises global virus responseHer criticism comes ahead of the first PMQs clash between Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer.UK Politics,"Former Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised world leaders for failing ""to forge a coherent international response"" to the coronavirus pandemic. Writing inthe Times,external, she said states had ""gone their own way"" and treated the virus as a ""national issue"". Lack of international collaboration could lead to the world becoming more dangerous, she warned. A No 10 source said there had been ""extensive co-operation"", with the PM talking regularly to other G7 leaders. Mrs May's intervention comes as Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer face each other at Prime Minister's Questions for the first time later. They are also due to hold talks on the coronavirus crisis after the UK's death toll became the highest in Europe. A total of 29,427 people have died in the UK - passing Italy's death toll of 29,315. But experts have said it could be months before full global comparisons can be made. Live: Latest from around the world UK coronavirus death toll higher than Italy's Can you compare the UK with Italy? In the Times, Mrs May wrote: ""The global impact of Covid-19, and our inability to forge a coherent international response to it, have raised new questions about the effectiveness of a system of cooperation through shared institutions."" She called on the government to ""embrace its wider international role beyond the day to day of the pandemic"" and not shy away from our ""responsibilities on the world stage"". She said the virus had been ""treated as a national issue for countries to deal with alone"" and while researchers and scientists may work together, there was ""little evidence of politicians doing so"". ""Governments are faced with an enormous challenge, and it is no surprise that they see as their first job the immediate protection of their own citizens,"" she said. ""But there remains no collective international view as to what works best in dealing with the virus - nor does there seem to have been any attempt to form one. Instead, states have each gone their own way."" World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fight Johnson speaks to Trump as recovery continues Mrs May said this ""risks exacerbating the shift towards nationalism and absolutism in global politics"". ""A world in which a few 'strong men' square up to each other and expect everyone else to choose between them would be a dangerous one,"" she said. She said the international community still had to work with China, despite concerns within her party that Beijing has suppressed information and tried to exploit the pandemic - which began in Wuhan - to further its interests. While China should face questions over its response, she said scrutiny should not become a fault line in international relations. The former prime minister warned about nationalism and absolutism in global politics The UK's international efforts have been focused on the mission to find a coronavirus vaccine, Boris Johnson describing it as ""the most urgent endeavour of our lives"". Earlier this week, the PM co-hosted an international conference to try and raise more than Â£6bn towards the global response, although the US, Russia and India declined to take part. The UK has pledged to give Â£388m in aid funding for research into tests, treatments and vaccines - part of a Â£744m commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. The prime minister is expected to reveal a ""road map"" out of the UK's lockdown on Sunday. Social distancing measures have been in place in the UK since 23 March in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. Meanwhile, Tory MP Ranil Jayawardena has been appointed international trade minister, after Conor Burnsresigned from the role this week. Health minister Nadine Dorries has been promoted, to become a minister of state.
