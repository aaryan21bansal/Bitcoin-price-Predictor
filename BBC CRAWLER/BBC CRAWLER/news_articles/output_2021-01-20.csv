"Kamala Harris becomes first female, first black VP","This video can not be played Kamala Harris was sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Kamala Harris has made history as the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice-president. She was sworn in just before Joe Biden took the oath of office to become the 46th US president. Ms Harris, who is of Indian-Jamaican heritage, initially ran for the Democratic nomination. But Mr Biden won the race and chose Ms Harris as his running mate, describing her as ""a fearless fighter for the little guy"". Prior to taking the oath at the US Capitol, Ms Harris paid tribute to the women who she says came before her. ""I stand on their shoulders,"" she said in a video. Allow Twitter content?

Eugene Goodman,the Capitol police officer who was hailed as a herofor steering a pro-Trump mob away from Senate chambers during the 6 January riot, escorted Ms Harris at the inauguration. Ms Harris, 56, was born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents: an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father. Kamala, left, as child with her mother and younger sister Maya She went on to attend Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities. She has described her time there as among the most formative experiences of her life. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as ""an American"". Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Kamala Harris and a 1986 snapshot of that Howard generation After four years at Howard, Ms Harris went on to earn her law degree at the University of California, Hastings, and began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. She became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, the first black woman and the first Asian American woman to hold the office. In 2010 she won election as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Ms Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. She was only the second black woman ever elected to the US senate. She launched her candidacy for president to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland at the beginning of 2019. But Ms Harris failed to articulate a clear rationale for her campaign, and gave muddled answers to questions in key policy areas like healthcare. She was also unable to capitalise on the clear high point of her candidacy: debate performances that showed off her prosecutorial skills, often placing Mr Biden in the line of attack, most notably criticising his praise for the ""civil"" working relationship he had with former senators who favoured racial segregation. She dropped out of the presidential race in December 2019. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? But Mr Biden chose her as his number two in August, calling her ""one of the country's finest public servants"". After Mr Biden was announced as the next president in November, Ms Harris tweeted a video of her congratulating her running mate. ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" she beamed. Who is Kamala Harris? Video, 00:03:48Who is Kamala Harris?

Biden gets to work on reversing Trump policies,"President Biden quickly signed executive actions on coronavirus, climate change and racial inequality US President Joe Biden has begun to undo some of Donald Trump's key policies, hours after being sworn in. In his initial acts as the 46th US president, he signed 15 executive orders - the first to boost the federal response to the coronavirus crisis. Other orders reversed the Trump administration's stance on climate change and immigration. President Biden set to work at the Oval Office having been sworn in earlier on Wednesday at the US Capitol. Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency What will Joe Biden do first? Kamala Harris becomes first female, first black VP Climate change: Biden's first act sets tone for ambitious approach World leaders hope for 'new beginning' under Biden The inauguration was unlike any other due to coronavirus restrictions, with few present to witness the oaths and ceremonies. Donald Trump - who has still not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden - snubbed the event in a departure from longstanding precedent. This video can not be played President Biden: ""Democracy is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed"" ""There is no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face,"" President Bidentweeted as he headed,externalto the White House following his inauguration. President Biden ""will take action - not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration - but also to start moving our country forward,"" a statement detailing his executive orders said. Oncoronavirus, a series of measures will be enacted to tackle the pandemic which has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the US. There will be a mandate to wear masks and practise social distancing on all federal government property. A new office will be set up to co-ordinate the response to the pandemic and the US will halt the process - begun by the Trump administration - of withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO). Mr Biden wants to inoculate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office The move tore-engage with the WHOwas welcomed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said it was ""absolutely critical"" for a more co-ordinated global response, his spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric said. Mr Biden has also pledged to make thefight against climate changea top priority of his administration. He signed an executive order beginning the process of rejoining the 2015 Paris climate agreement, from which Mr Trump formally withdrew the US last year. Why is the US rejoining the Paris climate agreement? Mr Biden's climate envoy, former US Secretary of State John Kerry, tweeted that the commitment set ""a floor, not a ceiling"" for America's climate leadership and urged international co-operation ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) in Glasgow in November.

Mr Biden has also revoked the presidential permit granted to thecontroversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which environmentalists and Native American groups have fought for more than a decade. The move will be discussed when Mr Biden makes his first phone call to a foreign leader - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The Keystone XL Pipeline project has led to years of protests The privately financed pipeline - estimated to cost about $8bn (Â£5.8bn) - would carry about 830,000 barrels of heavy crude a day from the oil sands of Alberta, in Canada, to Nebraska. Barack Obama vetoed a bill approving construction of the pipeline in 2015 but the decision was overturned by President Trump. Why is the Keystone XL pipeline so disputed? OnimmigrationMr Biden has revoked the Trump administration's emergency declaration that helped fund the building of a wall along the Mexican border and also ended a travel ban on some majority-Muslim countries. Other orders coverraceandgender equality. Joe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office. Donald Trump had used his executive authority broadly, to advance large swaths of his political agenda, so how - and when - Biden would begin undoing those actions would have particular importance. It didn't take long for the newly inaugurated president to show his hand. He targeted, in particular, some of the most controversial portions of Trump's agenda. The Biden administration also will freeze all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review. Executive action is the (relatively) easy part, however. For Biden to make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress to pass legislation on issues like pandemic relief, citizenship for undocumented migrants, healthcare reform and voting-rights protections. He also declined, for now, to take other executive actions, like cancelling student loan debt, lifting Mr Trump's trade restrictions or enacting new criminal justice measures. With Democrats in control in the House of Representatives and Senate, Biden has a window for accomplishments, although it will require surmounting Republican procedural obstacles and keeping his party in line. The president's decades of experience as a legislator could come in useful. Biden calls for unity - it won't be easy At the first news conference of the Biden presidency, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked if her priority was to promote the interests of President Biden, or provide ""the unvarnished truth"". She said she had ""deep respect for the role of a free independent press"" and that she would join the president in bringing ""transparency and truth back to government"". President Trump - and his press secretaries - often had a combative relationship with the media. The White House has a new press secretary - Jen Psaki ""Democracy has prevailed,"" President Biden said after taking the oath of office with Chief Justice John Roberts on stage in front of the US Capitol. Delivering a message of unity after the turbulent Trump years, he promised to be a president ""for all Americans"" - including those who voted against him. Full transcript of Biden inauguration speech Three of his predecessors attended the ceremony: Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served for eight years as vice-president - Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Mr Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence. Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice-president ahead of Mr Biden. She is the first woman - and the first black and Asian-American person - to serve in the role. This video can not be played Kamala Harris was sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor There was extra-tight security for the ceremony after the US Capitol was stormed by violent pro-Trump protesters on 6 January.

A 90-minute televised evening concert entitled ""Celebrating America"" was staged at the Lincoln Memorial in the city. Hosted by Tom Hanks, it featured Bruce Springsteen, John Legend, Jon Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, and Demi Lovato and culminated in a spectacular fireworks display. Mr Trump was the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since 1869. He left the White House early on Wednesday, and flew to the nearby Andrews Air Force base. This video can not be played Trump leaves the White House for the last time as US president In his farewell address at the base, he highlighted what he regarded as the successes of his presidency. ""What we've done has been amazing by any standard,"" Mr Trump said. The 74-year-old then left for his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, where he arrived later in the morning.

Biden inauguration a step forward - Johnson,"This video can not be played Johnson: ""It's a big moment for us - we have things we want to do together."" The inauguration of President Joe Biden is a ""step forward"" for the United States, which has ""been through a bumpy period"", Boris Johnson has said. Congratulating Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the UK PM said it was a ""big moment"" for the UK and the US and their ""joint common agenda"". Mr Johnson said he looked forward to working with the US on tackling climate change and the coronavirus pandemic. Making his inaugural address, Mr Biden said ""democracy has prevailed"". He promised to be a president ""for all Americans"" and said his ""whole soul is in putting America back together again"". Joe Biden replaces Trump as US president Biden inauguration in pictures How will Joe Biden change US trade relations? Outgoing President Donald Trump, who has not formally conceded to Mr Biden, did not attend the ceremony. President Biden began work straight away onreversing a number of his predecessor's policies, including rejoining the Paris climate change agreement - gaining the praise of Mr Johnson. The PM tweeted it was ""hugely positive news"", adding: ""I look forward to working with our US partners to do all we can to safeguard our planet."" Earlier this week the former head of the civil service Lord Sedwill suggestedMr Johnson would be glad Mr Trump had not been re-elected for a second term as US president. Writing in the Daily Mail, Lord Sedwill said those who believed Boris Johnson would have preferred Mr Trump to win again were ""mistaken"". The former cabinet secretary - who stepped down in September - said a second term for Mr Trump ""would not have been to the benefit of British or European security, to transatlantic trade, let alone the environmental agenda to which the prime minister is so committed"". Boris Johnson with Donald Trump at the G7 summit in 2019 Mr Johnson's public stance toward the former president has varied over the years. In 2015, when he was Mayor of London, Mr Johnson accused Mr Trump of ""stupefying ignorance"" over his comments about violence in the city. But as foreign secretary, following Mr Trump's election as president, he said there was a ""lot to be positive about"", and in 2019, praised his ""many good qualities"". For his part, Mr Trump has appeared largely supportive of Mr Johnson, backing his flagship Brexit policy and at one point saying of the British PM: ""They call him Britain Trump."" And echoing his predecessor, in 2019 Mr Biden described the UK prime minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Mr Trump. After winning the presidential election Mr Biden phoned Mr Johnson ahead of other European leaders and expressed his desire to strengthen the historic ""special relationship"" between the two countries. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said it was the job of all UK prime ministers to have a ""good, close working relationship"" with US presidents but, right now, there were many things the two countries ""wanted to do together"". ""When you look at the issues which unite me and Joe Biden, the UK and the US right now, there is a fantastic joint common agenda,"" he said. ""For us and America, it is a big moment."" He said he hoped the UK could help the US commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in the run up to the climate change conference COP 26, to be held in Glasgow this year. UK prime ministers like to consider American presidents as their best diplomatic friend. That relationship, particularly when it comes to security and defence, is unusually close. When, as with Donald Trump, that friend has been unpredictable and unconventional, that has made for some very awkward political moments. So for the government, this a really important and positive turning of the page. The terribly over-used phrase the 'special relationship', which provokes neurotic behaviour on this side of the Atlantic, has meant the most when there has been a genuine personal chemistry between the two leaders - whether Thatcher and Reagan, or Bush and Blair. There is nothing automatic about Mr Biden and Mr Johnson developing that kind of political friendship. But in the words of one former senior minister, for the UK Biden means ""we will lose exclusivity but gain predictability: easier to work with, less cringeworthy and more dependable, but we may not be the only girlfriend on speed dial"". Read Laura's blog. Speaking to the Guardian,,externalshadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy described Mr Biden as ""a woke guy"". Asked if he agreed, Mr Johnson said: ""I can't comment on that. What I know is that he's a firm believer in the transatlantic alliance and that's a great thing."" He added that there was ""nothing wrong with being woke - I put myself in the category of people who believe that it's important to stick up for your history, your traditions and your values, the things you believe in."" Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer also sent his congratulations to the new president and vice-president. ""The US begins a new chapter in its history, one of hope, decency, compassion and strength,"" the Labour leader said, adding ""together, our two nations can build a better, more optimistic future for our world."" And First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Warm congratulations and best wishes to President Biden and Vice President Harris. ""Scotland and the USA share long-standing bonds of friendship and co-operation. We look forward to building on these in the years ahead."" Mr Johnson watching the inauguration Writing in the Daily Mail, former UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Mr Biden's election presented the UK with a ""golden opportunity"" for Western democracies to reverse the trend towards ""absolutism"" - and a ""few strongmen facing off against each other"" - in global affairs. The Queen sent a private message to Mr Biden before his inauguration, Buckingham Palace has said.

Trump vows 'we will be back' as he leaves office,"This video can not be played Trump: ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success"" Donald Trump has vowed he will be ""back in some form"" after departing the White House for the final time as president. He told supporters as he prepared to fly to Florida that it had been ""a great honour to be your president"". He is the first president to snub his successor's inauguration since 1869 but did say: ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success."" Joe Biden will take the oath of office by noon (17:00 GMT) in Washington amid heavy security. Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency What happens at the inauguration? Some 25,000 troops will guard the inauguration ceremony following a deadly riot by pro-Trump supporters at the Capitol earlier this month. Mr Trump delivered his final speech as president at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, after flying there from the White House with First Lady Melania Trump. Donald and Melania Trump head towards the Marine One helicopter on the White House's South Lawn In a typically unscripted speech, he highlighted his ""amazing"" achievements, citing job creation, the establishment of a ""Space Force"", policies for veterans and on taxation, as well as the speedy development of Covid vaccines. He urged people to be ""very, very careful"" about the ""horrible"" pandemic and paid respects to those who had suffered. Trump's farewell video fact-checked Trump pardons Bannon in final acts of clemency How will history remember Trump? He added: ""It's been a great honour and privilege to be your president... I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening. ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they will have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular."" But, as with his farewell video address on Tuesday, he did not mention Mr Biden by name. Mr Trump added: ""Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form. Have a good life. We will see you soon."" He also paid tribute to his Vice-President Mike Pence, who was not at Andrews, having chosen instead to attend the inauguration ceremony. Mr Trump will be the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since Andrew Johnson snubbed Ulysses S Grant in 1869. He flew off to begin post-presidential life at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Palm Beach. In his last hours,Mr Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people,external, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who was facing fraud charges. This video can not be played Trump gives his farewell address In a farewell video message on Tuesday, Mr Trump called on Americans to pray for the incoming administration. He said he was proud of what he had achieved over the past four years. Mr Trump has been relatively quiet since his supporters attacked Congress on 6 January, and his Twitter account was suspended. He has never congratulated Joe Biden on victory and had always disputed the result of the presidential election, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. But White House spokesman Judd Deere told AFP that Mr Trump had left a traditional letter for Mr Biden.

Deadly blast rocks centre of Madrid,"This video can not be played Video footage showed the aftermath of the deadly explosion At least three people have died following an explosion that caused a building to partially collapse in centre of the Spanish capital, Madrid. A fourth person was missing and several others were hurt, officials said. City officials said the blast, which destroyed four floors of the building, had been caused by a gas leak. Mayor JosÃ© Luis MartÃ­nez Almeida told reporters after the blast that a fire was raging inside the building, which belongs to the Catholic Church. The blast happened shortly before 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT) as gas workers were repairing a boiler at the back of the building in the central Puerta de Toledo area of Madrid. An 85-year-old woman passer-by and two men were killed while a third man who had been working on the boiler was missing, Spanish media reported. One of the injured was in a serious condition and taken to hospital, according to officials. Spanish reports said the upper floors affected were being used to house local priests. Rescue workers evacuated more than 50 people from a care home next-door to the building in Caille de Toledo, but a school on the other side was closed at the time of the blast. Four floors of the building were destroyed in the explosion, which could be heard in many areas of Madrid. Images shared on social media showed billowing smoke and debris strewn along the street. Emergency services said nine fire crews and 11 ambulances were at the scene and some of those caught up in the blast were treated on the street. Four floors of the building were destroyed in the explosion Police officers cleared the area, closing it to all traffic and pedestrians, and appealed to local residents not to come near. ""The noise was very loud, very loud, really,"" Lorenzo Fomento, who was working from home at a nearby apartment, told AFP news agency. ""I never heard anything so loud before,"" he added. The director of the nursing home, Antonio Berlanga, said all the elderly residents were fine and places were being found for them to spend the night.

Royal aides 'won't take sides over Meghan letter',"Four royal aides say they do not wish to ""take sides"" over a letter from the Duchess of Sussex to her father, the High Court has been told. In a letter lawyers for the four said they believed their clients could ""shed some light"" on the letter's drafting but the four were ""strictly neutral"". Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online publisher over articles that reproduced parts of the letter. She claims her privacy and copyright were breached by the newspaper group. Her lawyers are asking for summary judgement - a dismissal of Associated Newspapers' (ANL) defence instead of a trial. The five articles, published in February 2019, were a ""triple-barrelled invasion"" of the duchess's privacy, correspondence and family, the lawyers claim. She is seeking damages from the newspaper group for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over the articles. ANL claims Meghan wrote her letter ""with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point"" in order to ""defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter"", which she denies. Meghan's privacy invaded over letter, court told On the second day of the hearing on Wednesday, ANL's barrister Antony White QC told the court that a letter from the so-called ""palace four"" showed that ""further oral evidence and documentary evidence is likely to be available at trial which would shed light on certain key factual issues in this case"". He said it was ""likely"" there was also further evidence about whether Meghan ""directly or indirectly provided private information"" to the authors of an unauthorised biography of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Finding Freedom. The four aides are: Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Christian Jones, their former deputy communications secretary, Samantha Cohen, formerly the Sussexes' private secretary, and Sara Latham, their ex-director of communications. ""None of our clients welcomes his or her potential involvement in this litigation, which has arisen purely as a result of the performance of his or her duties in their respective jobs at the material time,"" their lawyers said in a letter sent on their behalf. ""Nor does any of our clients wish to take sides in the dispute between your respective clients. Our clients are all strictly neutral. ""They have no interest in assisting either party to the proceedings. Their only interest is in ensuring a level playing field, insofar as any evidence they may be able to give is concerned."" Their letter said that their lawyers' ""preliminary view is that one or more of our clients would be in a position to shed some light"" on ""the creation of the letter and the electronic draft"". It also said they may be able to shed light on ""whether or not the claimant anticipated that the letter might come into in the public domain"" and whether or not the duchess ""directly or indirectly provided private information, generally and in relation to the letter specifically, to the authors of Finding Freedom"". But Justin Rushbrooke QC, representing the duchess, said the letter from the four ""contains no information at all that supports the defendant's case on alleged co-authorship (of Meghan's letter), and no indication that evidence will be forthcoming that will support the defendant's case should the matter proceed to trial"". Meghan, 39, sent a handwritten letter to her father in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie. The full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court this month, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021. At the conclusion of the hearing on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Justice Warby reserved his judgement, which he said he would deliver ""as soon as possible"".

Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film,"The report claims the vast property features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard A video investigation by Russia's leading opposition figure that claims President Vladimir Putin spent illicit funds on an extravagant Black Sea palace has reached more than 20 million people within a day of publication. Alexei Navalny's team released it after he was jailed on his return to Moscow. The investigation alleges the property cost Â£1bn ($1.37bn) and was paid for ""with the largest bribe in history"". The Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president. Claims that federal officials were guarding a vast palace complex on the Black Sea coast were ""pure nonsense"", spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Navalny investigation describes the property as 39 times the size of Monaco. The report was released on Tuesday, two days after Mr Navalny flew back from Germany and was arrested at the airport. He was placed in pre-trial detention for 30 days on Monday on a charge of violating probation terms for a suspended sentence for embezzlement that he maintains is politically motivated. A separate case against him was due to start on Wednesday but was postponed. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life The 44-year-old was almost killed in a nerve agent attack last August, which he blamed personally on Mr Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations of security service involvement have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. The report claims the property in the resort town of Gelendzhik was constructed using illicit funds provided by members of Mr Putin's inner circle, including oil chiefs and billionaires. ""[They] built a palace for their boss with this money,"" Mr Navalny says in the video. It alleges that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) owns some 27 sq miles (70 sq km) of land surrounding the private residence. The video was viewed more than 20 million times within a day of its release The report describes various details of the property, and claims it features a casino, an underground ice hockey complex and a vineyard. ""It has impregnable fences, its own port, its own security, a church, its own permit system, a no-fly zone, and even its own border checkpoint,"" Mr Navalny says in the video. ""It is a separate state within Russia,"" he adds. ""And in this state there is a single, irreplaceable tsar. Putin."" Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 Mr Peskov told state news agency RIA Novosti on Tuesday that claims made in the report were ""untrue"" and that the president ""doesn't own palaces"". He went further on Wednesday, insisting that the president declared all his property annually. ""These are all absolutely unfounded claims,"" he said. ""This is pure nonsense and... there's nothing else in it."" The video report was released on Tuesday,externaland, within little over 24 hours, it had already been viewed more than 22 million times. It ends with a plea for people to take to the streets. ""If 10% of those who are disaffected take to the streets, the government will not dare falsify elections,"" Mr Navalny says. Alexei Navalny had already raised the stakes by returning to Russia. It was a direct challenge to President Putin: the man he accuses of ordering his poisoning. So it came as no surprise when he was detained at the airport and remanded in custody for 30 days. But it seems that from his cell, Russia's most high-profile opposition figure still has the power to embarrass the Kremlin. Within hours his investigation into ""Putin's Palace"" had notched up millions of views. Mr Navalny's supporters have called for protests this weekend to demand his release. Will images of an opulent palace and new accusations of corruption bring more people onto the streets? That's unclear. One thing, however, is certain: Mr Navalny has achieved something that seemed impossible just a day ago. In his confrontation with the authorities, he's raised the stakes even higher. On 2 February, a court will consider whether a suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years that Mr Navalny received in 2014 on fraud charges should be converted into a jail term. Three days later, he will face another court appearance, on a charge of libelling a World War Two veteran. He is being held at the Matrosskaya Tishina prison in Moscow, after a judge ordered his detention until 15 February for violating the terms of his suspended fraud sentence. Instead of reporting regularly to the prison service, he was recuperating in Germany from the nerve agent attack. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. He travelled to Russia from Germany - where he had been receiving medical treatment since August - despite warnings he would be arrested on arrival. Mr Navalny said his legal treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described Monday's hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". His lawyers have said they are planning to appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. There are also questions over whether his detention contravenesa 2018 decision by Europe's top human rights court, which found the fraud charges against Mr Navalny were ""arbitrary"".

Low-deposit mortgages return after Covid slump,"Low-deposit mortgages have made a return as the market emerges from a Covid-related slowdown. Mortgage products for homeowners with a deposit of 10% of their property's value have risen more than fourfold compared with last summer's low. The increase, based on figures from financial information service Moneyfacts, could offer some relief to first-time buyers. But the cost of mortgages will remain an issue for many. In early September last year, there were only 44 mortgage products available for those able to offer a 10% deposit. At the same time, first-time buyers putting money aside for a deposit were faced with pressures of poor savings rates and rising house prices. That choice has now risen to 197 products, according to the Moneyfacts figures, with some big lenders returning in recent weeks. Mortgage products for those able to offer a 15% deposit have also risen sharply, although the choice was already much greater. ""First-time buyers who may have been concerned that with record low savings rates and increasing house prices, their homeownership dreams may have had to be shelved, may have been pleased to note that we are now seeing some providers return products for those with 10% deposits,"" said Eleanor Williams, from Moneyfacts. âIâm trapped by my mortgage â let me escapeâ Car loan lenders can seize vehicles from February Lenders had been grappling with the practical effects that the coronavirus pandemic brought to their business. While some new businesses targeted first-time buyers on social media, many traditional lenders withdrew products from the market. Staff shortages, and employees working from home, meant they were unable to process applications as fast as they had before the pandemic. There were also concerns among lenders that, despite strong activity in the housing market, riskier - and younger - first-time buyers could find it difficult to make mortgage repayments during an economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. Research has shown that younger workers are more at risk of redundancy. Aaron Strutt, from mortgage broker Trinity Financial, said lenders were now working more efficiently despite staff still being at home. He said that some of the biggest mortgage lenders had returned to the market. Some of the mortgage rates they were offering were not as attractive as they had been, but competition would help push down costs. ""If you are planning to purchase a property and have a 10% deposit the mortgage rates are not as cheap as they used to be, but they are getting better,"" he said. Many thousands of existing mortgage-holders who had struggled to make their repayments during the pandemic had taken payment ""holidays"", which are deferrals on payments. The latest figures from UK Finance, which represents lenders, show that 130,000 mortgage payment holidays were in place at the end of December 2020, down from a peak of 1.8 million in June last year.

Pogba fires Man Utd back to the top,"Edinson Cavani's fourth league goal for Manchester United set them on course for victory at Fulham Paul Pogba scored a superb winner as Manchester United reclaimed top spot in the Premier League by coming from behind for a club-record equalling away win at Fulham. In what is becoming a familiar pattern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side outside Manchester this season, they fell behind early in the game, with Ademola Lookman beating the offside trap before firing in an angled drive. But for the seventh time away from Old Trafford in 2020-21, United found a winning response - taking their run to 17 games unbeaten away in the Premier League - courtesy of a gift from their opponents and a bit of magic from their French midfielder. Goalkeeper Alphonse Areola has been a good addition for the Cottagers but in dropping Bruno Fernandes' cross at the feet of Edinson Cavani, he gifted his former Paris St-Germain team-mate the simplest of equalisers. And on the hour mark, Pogba stepped up to decide the contest, firing a superb angled drive across the diving Areola and into the far corner from 20 yards. The France international has come in for criticism at times this season but received nothing but praise from his manager after his winner. ""I am very happy with his performances,"" said Solskjaer. ""I know what he can do. He does everything. Now he is putting all the elements together in his performances and it is great to see. ""It was about getting him fit. He is enjoying his football, he is happy and physically in a good shape."" The win takes United to 40 points, two more than both Leicester and Manchester City, who had briefly taken top spot from the Foxes with a2-0 win over Aston Villa on Wednesday. Solskjaer, though, was reluctant to get drawn into discussing his side's title credentials with so much of the campaign to go. ""It is always going to be talked about that when you are halfway through and top of the league, but we are not thinking about this, we just have to go one game at a time,"" he added. ""It is such an unpredictable season."" Fulham remain in the bottom three, four points behind 17th-placed Burnley. Live text commentary of Fulham v Man Utd, plus Man City v Aston Villa Man Utd or Man City to end day top? Cassia bassist Lou Cotterill takes on Lawro Solskjaer felt his side missed a big opportunity to fully assert their title credentials in failing to make the most of their chances in Sunday's 0-0 draw at champions Liverpool. United were clearly in no mood to repeat such a mistake at a wet and windy Craven Cottage on Wednesday against a less daunting and defining opposition, but one that is far more robust now than they were in the season's first month. The visitors fell behind, but this is par for the course for this side, who once again did not panic, wrestled control of the game away from their opponents and took the win. This video can not be played Solskjaer praises 'committed' Pogba in Fulham win It is a handy trick for a title-challenging side to have in their locker, although one they would rather not have to repeatedly pull. In truth, they should have won more handsomely. They had the far greater share of possession and territory and were well ahead of their opponents on shots taken until a frantic finale in which the Cottagers threw in all they had in pursuit of a point. Fred felt he should have had a penalty in the first half courtesy of being caught in the box by a loose challenge from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but both on-field and VAR officials disagreed. Harry Maguire twice headed wide from corners, the first from a far less forgivable, unmarked position than the second. This video can not be played Parker 'disappointed but proud' after defeat Equally, though, it is a game that could have seen them drop points, especially in light of Fulham's late barrage, which saw David de Gea save superbly with his legs to deny Loftus-Cheek, and the ball pinballing around the United box on more than one occasion. The Cottagers demonstrated that they are no pushover, but they are making of habit of being on the rough end of fine margins. Five straight draws followed by two defeats by a single goal suggests their battle against the drop will go right down to the wire. ""I'm really pleased but I'm disappointed at the same time, which shows how far we've come,"" said Cottagers boss Scott Parker. ""I saw a team today that looked threatening and tried their hardest to get back into the game, but we go again. The next challenge is to maintain where we are and don't let defeat sink us. ""No doubt we can win and operate in this division and we just need to push on and keep improving."" No side has conceded more goals in the opening five minutes of Premier League games this season than Manchester United (4). Manchester United have won seven Premier League games having gone behind this season - only Newcastle in 2001-02 (10) and Man Utd themselves in 2012-13 (9) have done so more in a single campaign. Manchester United are unbeaten in their last 17 Premier League away games (W13 D4), equalling their longest ever unbeaten run on the road in top-flight history (17 between December 1998 and September 1999). This was the 41st different game in which Fulham had led in all competitions under Scott Parker, but the first time they had lost such a game (W34 D6). Edinson Cavani became the first Man Utd player whose first four Premier League goals for the club were all scored away from home. Since his return to the club in 2016, no Man Utd player has scored more league goals from outside the box than Paul Pogba (6). Ademola Lookman has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Fulham player this season (6 - 3 goals, 3 assists). Bruno Fernandes has gone three Premier League games without a goal or assist for the first time since his Manchester United debut in February 2020. Fulham's next game is in the FA Cup, against Burnley on Sunday (14:30 GMT). Their next league fixture, an away game on Wednesday, 27 January, is a big one. Opponents Brighton are two places and five points above them in the table. Manchester United host Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday at 17:00, live on the BBC. They are also in league action the following Wednesday hosting the league's bottom club Sheffield United in a 20:15 kick-off.

Saga cruises says all customers must be vaccinated,"Anyone going on a Saga holiday or cruise in 2021 must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the tour operator has said. Saga, which specialises in holidays for the over-50s, said it wanted to protect customers' health and safety. The firm said it would delay restarting its travel packages until May to give customers enough time to get jabs. People over 50 in the UK have been rushing to book holidays as vaccinations boost confidence. ""The health and safety of our customers has always been our number one priority at Saga, so we have taken the decision to require everyone travelling with us to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19,"" Saga said in a statement. ""Our customers want the reassurance of the vaccine and to know others travelling with them will be vaccinated too."" When will I get a Covid vaccine? Over-50s rush to book holidays due to vaccine Plumbing firm to make workers get vaccinations The firm's holidays were due to restart in March and its cruises in April after a long hiatus, but they will now both be delayed. Saga said that meant all trips before May would no longer go ahead as planned, acknowledging it would be ""a huge disappointment"" to customers. ""We will be contacting all guests affected to discuss their options,""it said,external. This video can not be played Singapore's 'cruises to nowhere' set back by Covid scare The firm said its vaccination policy added to stronger safety processes already planned for when its holidays resume. These include requiring cruise passengers to have a Covid-19 test before their trip, as well as a full medical screening. Capacity on its ships will also be kept to a maximum of 800 people. There were some severe covid outbreaks on cruise ships early on the pandemic, before coronavirus restrictions were imposed. British-registered ship the Diamond Princess, owned by the company Carnival, was quarantined for nearly a month in February in the Port of Yokohama in Japan. More than 700 of its 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, and 14 died. The UK has embarked on a mass vaccination programme as Covid-19 cases surge. People in England are beingvaccinated at a rate of 140 jabs per minute, NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens said this week.

Police warn flood tourists as evacuations begin,"This video can not be played A Didsbury couple tell BBC News they had to evacuate with their children People have been evacuated from a ""large number"" of homes in South Wales, as Storm Christoph brought widespread flooding across England and Wales. About 2,000 homes in theDidsbury and Northenden areas of Manchester,Ruthin and Bangor-on-Dee, North Wales, and Maghull, Merseyside, were also affected overnight. Severe flood warnings remain in place, and further rain is expected next week. People have been told Covid rules let them leave their homes in an emergency. One hundred homesare also being evacuated in Skewen, near Neath, in West Glamorgan, because of flooding related to mine works, authorities say. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Didsbury on Thursday morning to see the flood response there, as the severe flood warning was stood down and people evacuated earlier were allowed to return. Storm Christoph in pictures What's the best way to prevent flooding? How can you protect your home from floods? He said: ""There will be more to come, there will be further rain next week, so it is vital that people who are in potentially affected areas follow the advice."" He said flooding had a ""huge psychological, emotional and financialÂ cost"" for people and said the government was investing Â£5.2bn in flood defences over six years. Heavy rain led to multiple major incidents and flood alerts being declared across England and Wales. Many rivers are at ""dangerously high levels"", the Environment Agency said. Homes near Lymm in Cheshire were among those flooded Pumps and sandbags had to be brought in to protect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being held in a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales, which was threatened by floods. Homes have also been flooded in Cheshire following heavy rain and snow showers, with roads disrupted and residents warned river levels are still rising. About 40 residents were evacuated from the Weaver Court care home in Northwich, Cheshire, by fire crews with dinghies. Neighbourhood policing inspector for Northwich Jason Murray said residents were taken to a leisure centre before being moved on to alternative accommodation.

He added: ""We are trying to hold on as long as we can, and hopefully it will pass... If there is a continuation of the rain and the storm, that's going to be a problem."" Nelson Vasconcelos, 37, said he could not leave his home in Didsbury with his two small children because he had no family nearby. ""We spent all night moving things to the second floor and trying to keep the kids safe,"" he said. Lee Rawlinson, of the Environment Agency, said flood basins on the River Mersey at Didsbury had protected properties in the area overnight. ""The top of the river came within centimetres of the top of the river bank but our defences there have served their purpose and kept those properties dry.

Certainly nothing that would see emergency services declare a major incident and evacuate more than 2,000 homes in and around this area of south Manchester. But on Wednesday night the River Mersey rose and plunged thousands of residents into new depths of stress and confusion, coming just centimetres from breaching flood defences. And while the defences worked as they should - preventing homes from being deluged - the alert caused widespread bewilderment as residents now accustomed to stay-at-home messaging were suddenly ordered to leave. As the night wore on the driving rain turned to thick snow, coating the streets in white and adding an even more surreal backdrop to the drama.

Homes evacuated as Storm Christoph brings flooding,"This video can not be played Heavy rainfall continues to batter parts of England More than 2,000 homes in parts of Manchester are being evacuated due to flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued two severe flood warnings, which means danger to life, for the Didsbury and Northenden areas. Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey of Greater Manchester Police has warned some of those affected would ""be Covid-positive or isolating at home"". Earlier, Boris Johnson urged people to follow evacuation advice. He said the government was working to ensure it was ""totally prepared"" for floods ""in every part of the UK"". A major incident was earlier declared for the Greater Manchester areawhere up to 3,000 properties were feared to be at risk. Mr Johnson urged people not to stay in their homes if they were told to evacuate. ""If you are told to leave your home then you should do so. ""People may think this is a minor issue at the moment, still relevantly minor by standards of previous floods, but never underestimate the suffering, the misery, that floods can cause people."" Under government restrictions due to the current national lockdown people are allowed to leave their homes to escape harm. Flooding has affected roads and rail services In an alert to those affected, ACC Bailey said: ""A basin at Didsbury to take water from the Mersey is full. It will over-top in the next few hours. As a result we will be issuing a flood warning to homes. ""This will be through texted flood alerts to some people, and police officers, PCSOs, firefighters, and volunteers will be knocking on doors."" He said police will be supported by North West Ambulance, the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance. ""I think it's important to stress that if you are contacted and advised to evacuate then we would strongly urge you to do so,"" he added. Water levels in the area were expected to peak at about 23:00 GMT on Wednesday. A major incident has also been declared in Derbyshire, where authorities believe a small number of evacuations are ""likely"" on Thursday morning, when the River Derwent is expected to peak. County council leader Barry Lewis said it could rival levels seen in November 2019, depending on the weather overnight. This video can not be played The PM says the government is making sure it is âtotally prepared in every part of the UKâ for flooding after Storm Christoph. Speaking after a Cobra emergency meeting on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said work was under way to ensure transport and energy networks, and local council services, were prepared. He added that work was also taking place to ensure the necessary numbers of sandbags were available. ""We want to make sure that we are totally prepared in every part of the UK for flooding, because it is coming on top of the stress people are already under fighting Covid,"" he said. ""We looked at particularly Manchester, we've got a situation potentially developing there,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We are looking at a pattern of rainfall possibly not as bad at the end of this week, maybe worse next week."" Flood warnings as Storm Christoph approaches Homes flooded in Wales BBC Weather People in Greater Manchester have also been advised not to travel. Stephen Rhodes, from Transport from Greater Manchester, said there was disruption across the network. ""Let's work together and not put our emergency services and the NHS - who are already working extremely hard due to the Covid-19 pandemic - under any more pressure,"" he said. In Merseyside, the M57 has been closed in both directions between junction 6 and 7 due to flooding. Elsewhere in England: In Cheshire, 33 people were moved from their houseboats on Hayhurst Marina as water levels rose Flood warnings remain in place in both West and North Yorkshire North Yorkshire Police said anyone forced to leave home and stay with relatives would not face a fine for breaching Covid restrictions The Ouse in York is expected to peak at 4.4 (14.4ft) to 4.8m (15.7ft) on Thursday evening The Environment Agency has issued more than100 flood warnings,external, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, while there are also more than 200 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible. River levels have risen rapidly in parts of northern England The North West, Yorkshire and the Midlands have been preparing for widespread flooding following the Met Office's amber weather warning for heavy rain until midday Thursday. The Met Office said some isolated areas could see up to 200mm (7.8in). Sandbags have been distributed as Storm Christoph batters parts of England Labour's shadow floods minister Stephanie Peacock said urgent action was needed. ""Once again the government's response to inevitable flood events has been slow and uncoordinated,"" the Barnsley East MP said. ""We must ensure councils are supported to protect people, businesses, and local communities, and that all of the necessary precautions are also in place to protect those fighting the floods in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.""

The other women in Kamala Harris' college photo,"There is a photograph of Kamala Harris, taken in 1986, while she was a student at Howard University. She and two other friends, all shoulder pads and plaid, are smiling and laughing, a crowd behind them. It's a picture brimming with energy and hope. It's been used a lot in telling the extraordinary story of her rise to become the first black and Asian American woman to be vice-president and the first person who attended one of America's HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) to get to such a position. But this is the story of the other women in the photograph, her two best friends - Valarie Pippen and Karen Gibbs - as well as of others who might have been milling about in the background there. This was the 1980s, when the children of America's civil rights generation came of age. Being at Howard University, an HBCU at a time when solidarity with the global anti-apartheid movement was reaching fever pitch and at the height of Reaganism, was a formative experience for many of them. Now they are about to witness one of their own become vice-president. What have their journeys been like and what does this moment feel like? Historically Black Colleges, like Howard University, were founded in order to educate African Americans who were otherwise prohibited from attending college, after slavery. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Although that has now changed, a core part of the Howard message remains its focus on cultivating black leaders - it is not just about academic achievement, but social activism too. Kamala Harris has made clear the influence Howard University had on her career and life goals. Last week, on the anniversary of her sorority's founding date,she posted on Instagram,external, paying homage to her Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and referring to her days at Howard, attending anti-apartheid marches and being part of the debate team: ""Howard taught me that while you will often find that you're the only one in the room who looks like you, or who has had the experiences you've had, you must remember: you are never alone."" Like Ms Harris, I also went to Howard University and became a member of that same sorority decades later. I became intrigued by the stories of the other women and graduates who ventured out into the same world during the same time as Kamala. In that photograph, Valarie Pippen is on the right and smiling with confidence at the camera. Her parents attended historically black colleges after moving north with the great migration, which was the movement over decades of millions of African Americans to the North from the South, where economic uncertainty and segregation prevailed. They settled in the Chicago region and forged successful careers. The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris What happens to impeached presidents? At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters Who has the FBI arrested so far? She was led to Howard, specifically, after her older brother attended and brought home a yearbook that intrigued her. Howard had a festive celebratory atmosphere that the friends made the most of while they were there ""The culture was festive and lively yet focused on academic and cultural advancement of oppressed people,"" says Ms Pippen. ""We knew that our generation would make a difference with our success."" Ms Pippen says that at Howard University ""we all had more of a striving to do well, a striving to live with integrity and to make your mark on the world"". Coming from a high-achieving and proud black family with high expectations of their children, she was brought up knowing that her college experience was going to be important. She is now a healthcare consultant, and after graduating from Howard she attended medical school at Yale. She recalls the commitment to academic excellence, the need to prove your worth out there in the world and how that also translated into many nights studying with her good friend Kamala. ""There was one year at Howard, we both stayed for summer school. We worked during the day, did night classes and we studied together afterwards. We did that for the whole summer and we had fun. ""She was born for the job. Her dedication - like mine - was to academics, being an all around good person and to integrity."" In the 1990s, 52% of black pharmacy recipients, 30% of dentistry degree recipients, and 27% of theology degree recipients were all educated at HBCUs. Today, the two oldest HBCU medical schools - Meharry Medical College and Howard University - are responsible for more than 80% of black doctors and dentists practising in the US. HBCUs have educated three-quarters of all black people holding a doctorate; three-quarters of all black officers in the armed forces; and four-fifths of all black federal judges, according to the US Department of Education. The culture they fostered was hugely important for many ambitious and successful middle- and upper-class class black families going out into a world to become leaders in their field, within one generation of getting the right to vote. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden celebrate their election victory Karen Gibbs, pictured on the left in that photo, remains best friends with the vice-president elect and Valarie Pippen. She is now an attorney and speaks of her time at Howard in the same way Kamala Harris has in the past. There was ""a lot of black pride and a lot of black love"" in the Howard community, says Ms Gibbs. ""We had black professors who loved us. That was the beauty of going to Howard. They nurtured us, they groomed us. They were realistic to tell us what we would confront when we left Howard - but they equipped us to realise and achieve our dreams."" That environment was especially important as an escape from the realities of society. ""I was raised in a rural area in Delaware, and the people there were really racist. I had been called bad names by a lot of people, despite having a black family and smaller community filled with educators and proud of their roots,"" says Ms Gibbs. That is one of the reasons that she wanted to attend Howard University, to become a civil rights lawyer. She made the move so that she could be surrounded by ""love"" and ""support"". ""It was never a matter if I would go to an HBCU,"" it was just a matter of which she would go to. Ms Gibbs and Ms Pippen's experience at Howard University strikes a chord with others who were also there in the 1980s. They speak of the open fostering of social awareness and political activism in movements happening off campus. Being in the nation's capital, Howard in particular had a front-row seat to some memorable episodes in politics. The debate team in 1981 at Howard University. Kamala Harris was one of the few women to join the club. Dexter Cole, a Howard alumnus and now top executive at TV One, told the BBC that ""our parents actively participated in the civil rights movements and were at the forefront, and we came to Howard with a sense of commitment to not only improve the lives of ourselves, but others as well"". Across the nation, HBCUs were training a generation who would have a large impact on the world, and the progression of the broader African-American community. ""We understood that we were agents of change."" Mr Cole explained that ""social unrest was very prevalent, but as a student body we knew that we had a seat at the table because of those we saw who went before us"". ""I remember marching on Capitol Hill on the National Mall. There was a group of students going to protest to make Martin Luther King Jr's birthday a national holiday, and now I look there is a memorial just where I marched. ""We knew what our rights were and we were determined to invoke our right. That's why there were so many of us active in the anti-apartheid movement - we saw it play out in the US,"" says Ms Gibbs. ""It was a time when a lot of people from the era transcended into important places in different parts of society,"" says Lita Rosario-Richardson. Lita Rosario-Richardson recruited Kamala Harris into debate club Ms Rosario-Richardson is currently an entertainment lawyer. On campus, she recruited Ms Harris on to the debate team. ""The election of Kamala Harris has really made crystal clear that Howard prepares you for anything,"" she adds. Although it is no surprise to those who knew Kamala Harris that she is now the vice-president of the United States, it feels like a vindication for their own personal journeys and the philosophy they took forward with them into the wider world. ""It was instilled that with your education comes a responsibility to improve the world - specifically our own people. And, we see that that has benefited everyone in America. ""Kamala is a child of desegregation, like myself. Her nomination seemed historically fit, and she's the right person for it,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson adds. Dexter Cole is now a top executive at TV One ""Alumni like Thurgood Marshall - the first black Supreme Court Justice - who attended Howard laid the framework."" Even during their time as students, these alumni felt that they were connected to greatness and expected to make big strides in the world. It was not a feeling confined to Kamala Harris. The stories of these women show many have become movers and shakers in their own fields. ""All this has come full circle,"" says Andrea Holmes, a graduate who is now a marketing executive. ""The vice-presidency is where she belongs. She is the role model of the world and to all women and little girls."" The original photograph of Kamala, Valarie and Karen was taken in 1986 at Howard University's famous Homecoming. At most schools in the US, homecoming is an annual tradition marked by an American football game and partying. At Howard University, homecoming is marked by a football game as well as a week of events where all generations come back to meet and celebrate. Notable graduates as well as celebrities and artists come to perform, join discussions, and be part of the week. As a graduate, I know Homecoming remains a highly anticipated annual event, an experience like no other. That picture captures the energy, friendship and ambition of a group of women, at Howard in an electric era, who felt capable of anything. Valarie Pippen remembers the moment: ""The weekend was truly exhilarating, and you can see from the looks and smiles on our faces we were having the time of our lives."" Who is Kamala Harris?

Bernie's mittens and other inauguration moments,"Joe and Jill Biden catch the fireworks from the White House balcony Joe Biden is officially president, Kamala Harris is the country's first Madam Vice-President and Donald Trump flew off to play golf - all of that we expected. But here's a look at those inauguration day moments you might have missed, some solemn, some emotional, but also the podium wipe guy. It was hard to find any downbeat comments after the white-clad Katy fired off her epic anthem to close out the day in front of the Washington Monument - as the Bidens stood watching from their balcony. Although Firework as a song has drawn many interpretations, from sex to firework safety to LGBT rights, it seemed a pretty good fit here. The exploding background didn't do any harm, but the lyrics weren't too off track either. ""Do you ever feel like a plastic bag/Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?"" Well-known Twitch streamer hasanabi tweeted ""katy perry is right, trump DID make me feel like plastic bag!"" Oh, and the song swept back into the US iTunes chart of course. That's how it all ended but let's go back to the start... Before Joe took over, Donald first had to leave. Perhaps not all of the Trump administration could be called carefully choreographed, but the strains of Frank Sinatra's My Way ringing out as Air Force One swept Mr Trump out of the presidency and off to Florida is hard to fault.

We can't say for sure he planned it himself and the other tunes banging out at Andrews base - like Elton John's Funeral for a Friend - were hard to parse for some. Mr Trump's a big fan of Sinatra apparently. Though it's not reciprocated - Sinatra's daughter, Nancy, said her father loathed the then real estate mogul. The other Trumpism drawing attention was Melania's outfit change. It was quickly pointed out that Mrs Trump had used her flight from Andrews to Florida to quickly update her wardrobe to suit her new, post-first lady life. Melania looked somewhat funereal as she left the White House... ... but landed in Florida with a colourful, chic and pricey Gucci dress Some noted her relaxed smile after touching down in Florida - an apparent contrast to her demeanour at her husband's inauguration four years ago. And on to the inauguration ceremony... The first sensation came from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with his sensible choices for Washington's near-freezing weather - an outdoorsy jacket with woollen mittens accoutred with a brown manila envelope. Channelling a grumpy uncle at a February wedding or a man in an unheated waiting room, he brought new glory to the timeworn philosophy of bringing yourself and nothing else to an occasion.

The colour purple - well hues of it at least - hit the small screen in a big way. Inauguration fashion: Purple, pearls, and mittens Kamala Harris in purple, Hillary Clinton in amethyst, Michelle Obama in a plum-coloured turtleneck and trouser design. Laura Bush (C) breaks the purple trend at the inauguration Why purple? Well it has a long history with the suffragette movement, and has been promoted by some as an intertwining of Republican red and Democrat blue. It's a unity thing. Lady Gaga appeared with a gold Schiaparelli gilded dove of peace brooch so large it threatened to fly her off the stage as she sang the national anthem. Suffice it to say she was on less controversial ground with an ancient symbol of love and peace than a dress made of meat (like the one she wore back in 2010). One - in fact two - of the sweetest outfits were worn by Amara and Leela Ajagu, the four- and two-year-old great nieces of Kamala Harris. They wore their faux leopard fur coats because they wanted to be like her. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He's the partner of Kamala's niece, Meena, and was also the subject of a social media trawl after an eagle-eyed screen-shotter spied a pair of jaunty Dior Air Jordan 1 sneakers on the stairs during  Senator Amy Klobuchar's speech. He did get some stick, with tongue-in-cheek praise for ""making black history"" and ""daring to drip"" at a presidential inauguration. The shoes are limited edition and could get $10,000 on resale.

Kamala Harris also had a special security escort: Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman. Mr Goodman has been hailed as a hero after his actions during the storming of Capitol Hill earlier this month. Footage from inside the deadly insurrection shows the officer singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chamber, while the lawmakers hid inside. The 'hero' Capitol police officer Mr Goodman accompanied Ms Harris in his new role as deputy Senate sergeant-at-arms. She took her oath with her trademark smile about to burst through the historic moment, and as President Biden took his the emotion was also evident on his wife Jill's face. And as the podium was handed from one storied speaker to another - from senators to longtime advisers of President Biden - one man made sure to jostle them to the side before they took the microphone, for their own protection of course. Podium wipe guy, as he became known, disinfected the stand between each speaker and was lauded (online) as one of the unsung heroes of the day. It's never been seen before at an inauguration, it's a ritual that may well be here to stay. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PM warns of tough weeks ahead as Covid deaths rise,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned there will be ""tough weeks to come"" as the UK reported another all-time high of daily coronavirus deaths. A further 1,820 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test,according to government figures,external. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now 93,290. Mr Johnson said there was now a ""race against time"" to vaccinate the vulnerable but he hoped there would be a ""real difference"" by spring. In an interview with broadcasters, he said the high number of deaths was ""appalling"" and a reflection of the peak infection rates seen a couple of weeks ago. He said: ""I must warn people there will be tough weeks to come, but as the vaccine goes in and that programme accelerates, there will be, I think, a real difference by spring."" 'How do you prepare for people dying and dying?' How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Patel: UK should have closed borders in March 2020 Just under half of the newly reported deaths occurred on Tuesday, while a further quarter took place on Monday or Sunday with the remainder last week or even earlier. The previous highest number of daily deaths was the1,610 reported on Tuesday. Some 4,609,740 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine - a rise of 343,163 from yesterday. There were also a further 38,905 cases, with 3,887 more patients admitted into hospital. It is the second consecutive day deaths have hit a new high. That, sadly, was to be expected as it is a reflection of the surge in cases seen during December. It takes a week or two from the point of infection for someone to become seriously ill - and they can then spend some time in hospital. The high number is also a result of delays reporting deaths - a quarter happened last week or even before. But make no mistake the death toll is going up. If you look at the average over the course of a week, the numbers being reported at the moment are twice what they were just two weeks ago. However, we also know they should soon start coming down. Daily infections are falling, with signs lockdown is taking effect. For four days in a row new diagnoses have been below 40,000 - after averaging 60,000 at the start of year. It could be another week or so before we start to see the impact of that in the death figures. The hope then would be that within a few weeks we could start seeing a more rapid fall as the impact of the vaccination programme begins to bite. But before that happens the daily totals reported could, sadly, go even higher. New coronavirus cases are down by 21.5% over the last seven days. But the number of patients being admitted into hospital in the same period has not yet fallen (up by 0.5%). The prime minister said it looked as though infection rates across the country overall might now be peaking or flattening, but he cautioned that ""they're not flattening very fast"". Asked if daily deaths would continue to rise, he said it was ""difficult to predict"". He added: ""We must hope that by getting the numbers of daily infections down in the way that perhaps has been happening since the lockdown that will feed through into a reduction in deaths as well. ""But I must stress that we have tough weeks to come now as we roll out the vaccine. ""The light will only really begin to dawn as we get those vaccination numbers up."" Earlier, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told Sky News: ""This is very, very bad at the moment, with enormous pressure, and in some cases it looks like a war zone in terms of the things that people are having to deal with."" He said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of the vaccination programme. But he said vaccines were ""not going to do the heavy lifting for us at the moment, anywhere near it"". Military personnel are going to be deployed to a number of hospitals to help staff cope with high numbers of cases, including inNorthern IrelandandExeter.

In other developments, Home Secretary Priti Patel saidministers were working to ensure police and other frontline workers were moved up the priority list for the Covid vaccine. Mr Johnson said the government must rely on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, but wanted front-line workers to be immunised ""as soon as possible"".

Homes to be evacuated as storm brings flooding,"This video can not be played Heavy rainfall continues to batter parts of England More than 2,000 homes in parts of Manchester are being evacuated due to flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued two severe flood warnings, which means danger to life, for the Didsbury and Northenden areas. Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey of Greater Manchester Police has warned some of those affected would ""be Covid-positive or isolating at home"". Earlier, Boris Johnson urged people to follow evacuation advice. He said the government was working to ensure it was ""totally prepared"" for floods ""in every part of the UK"". A major incident was earlier declared for the Greater Manchester areawhere up to 3,000 properties were feared to be at risk. Mr Johnson urged people not to stay in their homes if they were told to evacuate. ""If you are told to leave your home then you should do so. ""People may think this is a minor issue at the moment, still relevantly minor by standards of previous floods, but never underestimate the suffering, the misery, that floods can cause people."" Under government restrictions due to the current national lockdown people are allowed to leave their homes to escape harm. Flooding has affected roads and rail services In an alert to those affected, ACC Bailey said: ""A basin at Didsbury to take water from the Mersey is full. It will over-top in the next few hours. As a result we will be issuing a flood warning to homes. ""This will be through texted flood alerts to some people, and police officers, PCSOs, firefighters, and volunteers will be knocking on doors."" He said police will be supported by North West Ambulance, the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance. ""I think it's important to stress that if you are contacted and advised to evacuate then we would strongly urge you to do so,"" he added. Water levels in the area were expected to peak at about 23:00 GMT on Wednesday. A major incident has also been declared in Derbyshire, where authorities believe a small number of evacuations are ""likely"" on Thursday morning, when the River Derwent is expected to peak. County council leader Barry Lewis said it could rival levels seen in November 2019, depending on the weather overnight. This video can not be played The PM says the government is making sure it is âtotally prepared in every part of the UKâ for flooding after Storm Christoph. Speaking after a Cobra emergency meeting on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said work was under way to ensure transport and energy networks, and local council services, were prepared. He added that work was also taking place to ensure the necessary numbers of sandbags were available. ""We want to make sure that we are totally prepared in every part of the UK for flooding, because it is coming on top of the stress people are already under fighting Covid,"" he said. ""We looked at particularly Manchester, we've got a situation potentially developing there,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We are looking at a pattern of rainfall possibly not as bad at the end of this week, maybe worse next week."" Flood warnings as Storm Christoph approaches Homes flooded in Wales BBC Weather People in Greater Manchester have also been advised not to travel.

"Patel: UK should have closed borders in March 2020The home secretary has been recorded telling supporters she was an ""advocate"" of closures last year.UK PoliticsComments","Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the government should have acted on border controls early last year Priti Patel says the UK should have closed its borders in March 2020 in light of the coronavirus pandemic. In a video callobtained by Guido Fawkes,external, the home secretary told Tory supporters she was an ""advocate"" of closing the borders 10 months ago. Between mid March and June, the UK did not impose a ban or quarantine restrictions on international travellers arriving in the UK. A Home Office spokesman said there were now ""strong measures"" at the border. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked Boris Johnson during Prime Minister's Questions why he ""overruled the home secretary"" on closing the borders last year. Mr Johnson responded that the UK had now ""instituted one of the toughest border regimes in the world"", accusing Sir Keir of ""looking backwards, playing politics and sniping from the side-lines"" amidst the pandemic. Asked for a further response, a No 10 spokesman said they would not ""get into the detail of private conversations"", and that the PM had full confidence in his home secretary. Allow Twitter content?

Throughout February 2020 and into March, the government had guidance in place international travellers from the Hubei province in China, parts of South Korea, Iran and Italy to self-isolate for 14 days after arriving in the UK. But on 13 March 2020, this rule was removed and replaced with guidance advising all people in the UK, including arrivals, to self-isolate if they developed symptoms. It was not until Junethat quarantine rules were introduced for all arrivals in the UK - including British citizens - and by July, so-called ""travel corridors"" were introduced, removing the need to self-isolate when coming to the UK from certain countries. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps made weekly announcements on which countries were included on the list - but on Monday,the government closed all travel corridorsto ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of coronavirus. UK 'made serious mistake' over virus border policy UK-bound travellers now need negative test for entry Covid: Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Why is the UK bringing in travel testing? The government was criticised for acting too late over border policy, with the Home Affairs Committee of MPspublishing a report in August, saying a lack of measures earlier in the pandemic was a ""serious mistake"" and the change in rules in March was ""inexplicable"". A Home Office spokeswoman responded to the criticism at the time saying all government decisions had been ""been guided by the science, with appropriate measures introduced at the right time to keep us all safe"". Now the home secretary has been recorded telling a Zoom call with the Conservative Friends of India group on Tuesday night: ""On 'should we have closed our borders earlier', the answer is yes, I was an advocate of closing them last March."" Only a short excerpt of Priti Patel's remarks has emerged, but there's been no denial or suggestion that the comments were taken out of context. Interestingly, back in April, the home secretary told MPs the scientific advice was ""clear"" that measures to screen arrivals would have had a ""negligible impact"" on virus rates. If that was the scientists' view, her remarks on Tuesday night suggest that, behind the scenes, she had in fact been arguing for tougher controls. Of course it's not unusual for ministers to debate a point in private. But once a policy is decided, they're expected to stick by it - the principle of ""collective responsibility"". The ministerial code specifically says that a ""united front"" must be maintained. So Priti Patel may face questions as to whether she has breached that code by revealing her hand, albeit on what we're told was a private call. However, No 10 has made clear the prime minister still has confidence in his home secretary. And, as far as Priti Patel's concerned, the idea she wanted a tougher approach may bolster her reputation with some party members. Ms Patel repeatedly refused to appear before the Home Affairs Committee between January and April last year,turning down four invitations and offering private briefings instead. When she did appear on 29 April last year, she was asked by Labour MP Stephen Doughty if she disagreed with the change in rules around self-isolating in March. She replied: ""We all follow the advice that is given from the government."" The committee's chair, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, told BBC News the ""partial admission"" that the government were wrong last year was an ""astonishing statement"" from the home secretary, who she had repeatedly questioned over the subject. Ms Cooper said the government's handling of border policy had been ""chaotic and badly managed at every stage"", and it had ""contributed to the scale and the pace of the pandemic and made the pandemic worse"". This video can not be played Quoting a recording of Priti Patel, the Labour leader asks about the timing of closing UK borders Asked about the home secretary's comments on BBC Two's Politics Live programme, Tory MP and Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said there were ""a lot of benefits of hindsight here"". He added: ""It is certainly true with hindsight we should have closed the borders last March. ""But I think the government has been making some very difficult decisions to try and keep an economy open that can pay for the healthcare that we all need at the same time as protecting as many people as possible and protecting lives."" However, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said it was a ""shocking admission"" from Ms Patel, and the government had ""left our doors open to the virus and worrying mutations"". He added: ""Ministers now need to - urgently - review and overhaul border policy, whilst taking responsibility for the huge damage their incompetence has done to our national safety and security."" Asked about Ms Patel's comments on the call, a Home Office spokesman said: ""We have strong measures at the border in place which are vital as we roll out the vaccine."" Detailed analysis of coronavirus sampleshas revealed how and when the virus got into the country. The UK's epidemic was largely started by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in early-to-mid-March and France in mid-to-late-March. China, where the pandemic started, had a negligible impact. Completely shutting the borders in March could have prevented some of those cases from Spain and France coming in and sparking more outbreaks. But it is clear the virus was here and spreading by that point. So the best case scenario is it could have bought a bit of time, which begs the question ""to do what?"". You have to view border control as only one part of the government's overall strategy. New Zealand, which has faced minimal disruption from Covid, used its closed borders alongside lockdown to go for a ""zero-Covid strategy"", which has never been on the cards in the UK.

"Follow order to evacuate flooded homes, PM urges","This video can not be played Heavy rainfall continues to batter parts of England More than 2,000 homes in parts of Manchester are being evacuated due to flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued two severe flood warnings, which means danger to life, for the Didsbury and Northenden areas. Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey of Greater Manchester Police has warned some of those affected would ""be Covid-positive or isolating at home"". Earlier, Boris Johnson urged people to follow evacuation advice. He said the government was working to ensure it was ""totally prepared"" for floods ""in every part of the UK"". A major incident was earlier declared for the Greater Manchester areawhere up to 3,000 properties were feared to be at risk. Mr Johnson urged people not to stay in their homes if they were told to evacuate. ""If you are told to leave your home then you should do so. ""People may think this is a minor issue at the moment, still relevantly minor by standards of previous floods, but never underestimate the suffering, the misery, that floods can cause people."" Under government restrictions due to the current national lockdown people are allowed to leave their homes to escape harm. Flooding has affected roads and rail services In an alert to those affected, ACC Bailey said: ""A basin at Didsbury to take water from the Mersey is full. It will over-top in the next few hours. As a result we will be issuing a flood warning to homes. ""This will be through texted flood alerts to some people, and police officers, PCSOs, firefighters, and volunteers will be knocking on doors."" He said police will be supported by North West Ambulance, the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance. ""I think it's important to stress that if you are contacted and advised to evacuate then we would strongly urge you to do so,"" he added. Water levels in the area were expected to peak at about 23:00 GMT on Wednesday. A major incident has also been declared in Derbyshire, where authorities believe a small number of evacuations are ""likely"" on Thursday morning, when the River Derwent is expected to peak. County council leader Barry Lewis said it could rival levels seen in November 2019, depending on the weather overnight. This video can not be played The PM says the government is making sure it is âtotally prepared in every part of the UKâ for flooding after Storm Christoph. Speaking after a Cobra emergency meeting on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said work was under way to ensure transport and energy networks, and local council services, were prepared. He added that work was also taking place to ensure the necessary numbers of sandbags were available. ""We want to make sure that we are totally prepared in every part of the UK for flooding, because it is coming on top of the stress people are already under fighting Covid,"" he said. ""We looked at particularly Manchester, we've got a situation potentially developing there,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We are looking at a pattern of rainfall possibly not as bad at the end of this week, maybe worse next week."" Flood warnings as Storm Christoph approaches Homes flooded in Wales BBC Weather People in Greater Manchester have also been advised not to travel.

Thousands of homes could be at risk of flooding,"This video can not be played Heavy rainfall continues to batter parts of England More than 2,000 homes in parts of Manchester are being evacuated due to flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued two severe flood warnings, which means danger to life, for the Didsbury and Northenden areas. Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey of Greater Manchester Police has warned some of those affected would ""be Covid-positive or isolating at home"". Earlier, Boris Johnson urged people to follow evacuation advice. He said the government was working to ensure it was ""totally prepared"" for floods ""in every part of the UK"". A major incident was earlier declared for the Greater Manchester areawhere up to 3,000 properties were feared to be at risk. Mr Johnson urged people not to stay in their homes if they were told to evacuate. ""If you are told to leave your home then you should do so. ""People may think this is a minor issue at the moment, still relevantly minor by standards of previous floods, but never underestimate the suffering, the misery, that floods can cause people."" Under government restrictions due to the current national lockdown people are allowed to leave their homes to escape harm. Flooding has affected roads and rail services In an alert to those affected, ACC Bailey said: ""A basin at Didsbury to take water from the Mersey is full. It will over-top in the next few hours. As a result we will be issuing a flood warning to homes. ""This will be through texted flood alerts to some people, and police officers, PCSOs, firefighters, and volunteers will be knocking on doors."" He said police will be supported by North West Ambulance, the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance. ""I think it's important to stress that if you are contacted and advised to evacuate then we would strongly urge you to do so,"" he added. Water levels in the area were expected to peak at about 23:00 GMT on Wednesday. A major incident has also been declared in Derbyshire, where authorities believe a small number of evacuations are ""likely"" on Thursday morning, when the River Derwent is expected to peak. County council leader Barry Lewis said it could rival levels seen in November 2019, depending on the weather overnight. This video can not be played The PM says the government is making sure it is âtotally prepared in every part of the UKâ for flooding after Storm Christoph. Speaking after a Cobra emergency meeting on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said work was under way to ensure transport and energy networks, and local council services, were prepared. He added that work was also taking place to ensure the necessary numbers of sandbags were available. ""We want to make sure that we are totally prepared in every part of the UK for flooding, because it is coming on top of the stress people are already under fighting Covid,"" he said. ""We looked at particularly Manchester, we've got a situation potentially developing there,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We are looking at a pattern of rainfall possibly not as bad at the end of this week, maybe worse next week.""

Biden calls for unity - it won't be easy,"At 12:01, in the midst of his inaugural address, Joe Biden officially became the 46th president of the United States. He was already well into outlining exactly how daunting a task he - and the nation - have ahead in what he called its ""winter of peril"". America is facing a devastating pandemic which has resulted in massive job losses and business closures, a threatened environment, urgent cries for racial justice and resurgence in ""political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism"". His speech was not a laundry list of proposals and solutions. Those were reserved for his first 17 executive actions as president - on immigration, climate change, transgender rights and public health, among others. The Biden administration has also frozen all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review. What will Biden do first? Transcript of the full speech Instead, Biden used his speech to offer hope - and to argue, at times forcefully, that the nation must be united in facing the challenges ahead; that it has to move past its current ""uncivil war"". ""Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury,"" he said. ""No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos."" ""This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge,"" he continued. ""And unity is the path forward"". At times, Biden's speech seemed a direct rebuttal to his predecessor's administration, although he did not mention Donald Trump by name. Where Trump frequently spoke of American greatness and glorified its founders, Biden noted that the nation's history has been a ""constant struggle"" between its ideals and sometimes harsh realities. Where Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway spoke of ""alternative facts"" almost four years ago, Biden said: ""There is truth and there are lies - lies told for power and for profit."" Americans divided over chances of unity Biden wrapped up his inaugural address by warning that America must not ""turn inward"" - both as individuals retreating into ""competing factions"" and as a nation on the world stage. ""We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again,"" he said. Rhetorically, Biden turned the page from Trump's days of ""America first"". This video can not be played WATCH: Key moments from President Biden's speech The first 100 days of any administration are always important to a new president. What are his priorities? What will he try to accomplish when his political capital is at its highest? Joe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office, but executive action is the (relatively) easy part. His speech reflected the reality that he enters office with his top priorities already determined for him. His government will be responsible for distributing the coronavirus vaccine in an efficient and equitable way. After that, he will have to focus on the societal and economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. The virus has exacerbated income inequality and pushed many households to the brink of economic ruin. It's devastated the travel and hospitality industries and placed incredible strain on the finances of state and local governments. His pledge to seek unity will be tested early, as he pushes a sharply divided Congress to pass another, massive round of pandemic stimulus aid. If he wants to enact it quickly, he will need Republican support in the Senate, and already there are signs that some on the right may be lining up in opposition to more spending. Then there's Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which will present yet another challenge to national unity. It will keep Trump's name in the news for weeks, as his defenders rally to his side and his detractors call for consequences for his actions. Did Trump's words at rally incite riot? A guide to Trump's second impeachment trial After that, Biden's potential political paths diverge. He has said he wants to improve healthcare in the US, address growing college debt, make new investments in infrastructure and tackle climate change. He's pledged to push immigration reform legislation that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants - a political lightning rod that helped fuel Trump's first presidential run. What he prioritises, and how successful his first efforts are, could determine the overall success of his administration. To make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress. The inauguration ceremony is over. But, as Biden noted in his speech, the American people face one of the most challenging times in their nation's history. ""We will be judged by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era,"" he said. Biden campaigned against Trump for the opportunity to face those crises. Now he has his chance.

"Who is Amanda Gorman, Biden's inauguration poet?","This video can not be played The Hill We Climb: Watch 22-year-old Amanda Gorman's poem reading at Joe Biden's inauguration Amanda Gorman has become the youngest poet ever to perform at a presidential inauguration, calling for ""unity and togetherness"" in her self-penned poem. The 22-year-old delivered her work The Hill We Climb to both the dignitaries present in Washington DC and a watching global audience. ""When day comes, we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade?"" her five-minute poem began. She went on to reference the storming of the Capitol earlier this month. ""We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy,"" she declared. ""And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated."" The poet was applauded by Vice President Kamala Harris In her poem, Gorman described herself as ""a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother [who] can dream of becoming president, only to find her self reciting for one"". America's first-ever National Youth Poet Laureate did her job, which was to find the right words at the right time. It was a beautifully paced, well-judged poem for a special occasion, but it will live long beyond the time and space of the moment. Amanda Gorman delivered her piece with grace, the words it contained will resonate with people the world over:  today, tomorrow, and far into the future. The writer and performer, who became the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017, followed in the footsteps of such famous names as Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. ""I really wanted to use my words to be a point of unity and collaboration and togetherness,""Gorman told the BBC World Service's Newshour programmebefore the ceremony. ""I think it's about a new chapter in the United States, about the future, and doing that through the elegance and beauty of words.""

Illinois poet laureate Angela Jackson said the recitation was ""so rich and just so filled with truth"". ""I was stunned that she was so young and so wise,"" Jackson told the Chicago Sun-Times. Gorman said she ""screamed and danced her head off"" when she found out she had been chosen to read at President Biden's swearing-in ceremony. She said she felt ""excitement, joy, honour and humility"" when she was asked to take part, ""and also at the same time terror"". And she added that she hoped her poem, completed on the day supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, would ""speak to the moment"" and ""do this time justice"". Gorman, pictured with actor Morgan Freeman in 2018, became LA's youth poet laureate at 16 Born in Los Angeles in 1998, Gorman had a speech impediment as a child - an affliction she shares with America's new president. ""It's made me the performer that I am and the storyteller that I strive to be,"" she said ina recent interview with the Los Angeles Times,external. ""When you have to teach yourself how to say sounds [and] be highly concerned about pronunciation, it gives you a certain awareness of sonics, of the auditory experience."" Gorman became LA's youth poet laureate at 16. Three years later, while studying sociology at Harvard, she became National Youth Poet Laureate. She published her first book, The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough, in 2015 and will publish a picture book, Change Sings, later this year.

"Saga cruises says all customers must be vaccinatedHolidaymakers in 2021 must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the travel firm says.Business","Anyone going on a Saga holiday or cruise in 2021 must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the tour operator has said. Saga, which specialises in holidays for the over-50s, said it wanted to protect customers' health and safety. The firm said it would delay restarting its travel packages until May to give customers enough time to get jabs. People over 50 in the UK have been rushing to book holidays as vaccinations boost confidence. ""The health and safety of our customers has always been our number one priority at Saga, so we have taken the decision to require everyone travelling with us to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19,"" Saga said in a statement.

Low-deposit mortgages return after Covid slumpThere has been a fourfold increase in mortgage products for those offering a 10% deposit.,"Low-deposit mortgages have made a return as the market emerges from a Covid-related slowdown. Mortgage products for homeowners with a deposit of 10% of their property's value have risen more than fourfold compared with last summer's low. The increase, based on figures from financial information service Moneyfacts, could offer some relief to first-time buyers. But the cost of mortgages will remain an issue for many. In early September last year, there were only 44 mortgage products available for those able to offer a 10% deposit. At the same time, first-time buyers putting money aside for a deposit were faced with pressures of poor savings rates and rising house prices. That choice has now risen to 197 products, according to the Moneyfacts figures, with some big lenders returning in recent weeks. Mortgage products for those able to offer a 15% deposit have also risen sharply, although the choice was already much greater. ""First-time buyers who may have been concerned that with record low savings rates and increasing house prices, their homeownership dreams may have had to be shelved, may have been pleased to note that we are now seeing some providers return products for those with 10% deposits,"" said Eleanor Williams, from Moneyfacts. âIâm trapped by my mortgage â let me escapeâ Car loan lenders can seize vehicles from February Lenders had been grappling with the practical effects that the coronavirus pandemic brought to their business. While some new businesses targeted first-time buyers on social media, many traditional lenders withdrew products from the market. Staff shortages, and employees working from home, meant they were unable to process applications as fast as they had before the pandemic. There were also concerns among lenders that, despite strong activity in the housing market, riskier - and younger - first-time buyers could find it difficult to make mortgage repayments during an economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. Research has shown that younger workers are more at risk of redundancy. Aaron Strutt, from mortgage broker Trinity Financial, said lenders were now working more efficiently despite staff still being at home. He said that some of the biggest mortgage lenders had returned to the market. Some of the mortgage rates they were offering were not as attractive as they had been, but competition would help push down costs. ""If you are planning to purchase a property and have a 10% deposit the mortgage rates are not as cheap as they used to be, but they are getting better,"" he said. Many thousands of existing mortgage-holders who had struggled to make their repayments during the pandemic had taken payment ""holidays"", which are deferrals on payments. The latest figures from UK Finance, which represents lenders, show that 130,000 mortgage payment holidays were in place at the end of December 2020, down from a peak of 1.8 million in June last year.

"Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' filmAlexei Navalny's report alleges a vast property was paid for ""with the largest bribe in history"".","The report claims the vast property features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard A video investigation by Russia's leading opposition figure that claims President Vladimir Putin spent illicit funds on an extravagant Black Sea palace has reached more than 20 million people within a day of publication. Alexei Navalny's team released it after he was jailed on his return to Moscow. The investigation alleges the property cost Â£1bn ($1.37bn) and was paid for ""with the largest bribe in history"". The Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president. Claims that federal officials were guarding a vast palace complex on the Black Sea coast were ""pure nonsense"", spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Navalny investigation describes the property as 39 times the size of Monaco. The report was released on Tuesday, two days after Mr Navalny flew back from Germany and was arrested at the airport. He was placed in pre-trial detention for 30 days on Monday on a charge of violating probation terms for a suspended sentence for embezzlement that he maintains is politically motivated. A separate case against him was due to start on Wednesday but was postponed. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life The 44-year-old was almost killed in a nerve agent attack last August, which he blamed personally on Mr Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations of security service involvement have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. The report claims the property in the resort town of Gelendzhik was constructed using illicit funds provided by members of Mr Putin's inner circle, including oil chiefs and billionaires. ""[They] built a palace for their boss with this money,"" Mr Navalny says in the video. It alleges that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) owns some 27 sq miles (70 sq km) of land surrounding the private residence. The video was viewed more than 20 million times within a day of its release The report describes various details of the property, and claims it features a casino, an underground ice hockey complex and a vineyard. ""It has impregnable fences, its own port, its own security, a church, its own permit system, a no-fly zone, and even its own border checkpoint,"" Mr Navalny says in the video. ""It is a separate state within Russia,"" he adds. ""And in this state there is a single, irreplaceable tsar. Putin."" Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 Mr Peskov told state news agency RIA Novosti on Tuesday that claims made in the report were ""untrue"" and that the president ""doesn't own palaces"". He went further on Wednesday, insisting that the president declared all his property annually. ""These are all absolutely unfounded claims,"" he said. ""This is pure nonsense and... there's nothing else in it."" The video report was released on Tuesday,externaland, within little over 24 hours, it had already been viewed more than 22 million times. It ends with a plea for people to take to the streets. ""If 10% of those who are disaffected take to the streets, the government will not dare falsify elections,"" Mr Navalny says. Alexei Navalny had already raised the stakes by returning to Russia. It was a direct challenge to President Putin: the man he accuses of ordering his poisoning. So it came as no surprise when he was detained at the airport and remanded in custody for 30 days. But it seems that from his cell, Russia's most high-profile opposition figure still has the power to embarrass the Kremlin. Within hours his investigation into ""Putin's Palace"" had notched up millions of views. Mr Navalny's supporters have called for protests this weekend to demand his release. Will images of an opulent palace and new accusations of corruption bring more people onto the streets? That's unclear. One thing, however, is certain: Mr Navalny has achieved something that seemed impossible just a day ago. In his confrontation with the authorities, he's raised the stakes even higher. On 2 February, a court will consider whether a suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years that Mr Navalny received in 2014 on fraud charges should be converted into a jail term. Three days later, he will face another court appearance, on a charge of libelling a World War Two veteran. He is being held at the Matrosskaya Tishina prison in Moscow, after a judge ordered his detention until 15 February for violating the terms of his suspended fraud sentence. Instead of reporting regularly to the prison service, he was recuperating in Germany from the nerve agent attack. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. He travelled to Russia from Germany - where he had been receiving medical treatment since August - despite warnings he would be arrested on arrival. Mr Navalny said his legal treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described Monday's hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". His lawyers have said they are planning to appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. There are also questions over whether his detention contravenesa 2018 decision by Europe's top human rights court, which found the fraud charges against Mr Navalny were ""arbitrary"".

Ex-aide Bannon in swathe of Trump pardons,"Steve Bannon is accused of fraud over a fundraising campaign. He denies any wrongdoing In the final hours of his presidency, Donald Trump has pardoned 73 people, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who is facing fraud charges. Another 70 people had sentences commuted, ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration at noon (17:00 GMT). Rapper Lil Wayne received a pardon and there were commutations for rapper Kodak Black and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. The president has not issued preemptive pardons for himself or family members. He can still issue more pardons on Wednesday morning, as he remains president until Mr Biden takes the oath of office outside the US Capitol. Could Trump pardon himself? Why has Trump granted clemency to two rappers? US historians on what Donald Trump's legacy will be The inauguration ceremony will be tight on security following the recent breach of the Capitol by violent pro-Trump protesters. It will also be stripped of crowds due to the coronavirus pandemic. Biden set to be sworn in as Trump leaves office A statement from the White House,externallisted the 73 individuals who had received pardons and the 70 who had their sentences commuted. Although many on the list are conventional examples of convicts whose cases have been championed by rights activists and supporters in the community, others maintain the president's trend of focusing on allies. Steve Bannonwas a key strategist and adviser to President Trump during his 2016 campaign.He was charged in August last year with fraudover a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, a key plank of Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors said Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which pledged to use donations to build segments of the barrier and raised $25m (Â£18m). It was alleged Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses. He denied the claims. As he was yet to stand trial his pardon is unusual, though certainly not unprecedented. The White House statement said Mr Bannon had been ""an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen"". It said prosecutors had ""pursued"" him with charges ""related to fraud stemming from his involvement in a political project"". This video can not be played Steve Bannon defends Trump from racism accusations A full pardon was also issued toElliott Broidy,a Republican fundraiser who admitted accepting funds to lobby Mr Trump for Chinese and Malaysian interests. The White House cited his ""philanthropic efforts"". Ken Kurson, a friend of Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner charged with cyberstalking during a divorce, was pardoned. Lil Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, pleaded guilty to a federal weapons charge last year and has been pardoned. He posted a photo of himself with Mr Trump during the election campaign praising the president's work on criminal reform. As the list of pardons became clear, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff said: ""Thank God we have only 12 more hours of this den of thieves."" Other key recipients were: Kodak Black,real name Bill K Kapri, who was also charged with firearms offences, had his sentence of three years and 10 months commuted. The White House statement praised his philanthropic work Michael 'Harry O' Harris- co-founder of Death Row Records, who served 32 years for attempted murder and cocaine trafficking and whose case was championed by rapper Snoop Dogg. He was pardoned Kwame Kilpatrickwas sentenced in 2013 to 28 years in prison on charges of racketeering, bribery and extortion in relation to his period as Detroit mayor from 2002 to 2008. His sentence was commuted - the White House said this was ""strongly supported by prominent members of the Detroit community"" Anthony Levandowskireceived a full pardon from an 18-month sentence. He is a former Google engineer who admitted stealing secret technology related to the company's self-driving cars. The pardon says he had ""paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good"" The White House said Anthony Levandowski's sentencing judge called him a ""brilliant engineer"" However, a number of people whose names had been promoted in the media for possible pardons - including Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, and Joe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger King - have not been included. It is common for outgoing presidents to issue pardons before they leave the White House. Alexander Hamilton proposed the system in 1787, arguing it could ""restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth"". It is carried in Article II of the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton proposed the system in 1787 The president can only act on federal, not state, crimes. A pardon cancels a criminal conviction, while a commutation shortens or ends a prison sentence. Pardons have been controversial since they started. In the early years of the US, some acts of treason, piracy and rebellion were forgiven. One man convicted of stealing mail refused a pardon in 1833 and he was executed after the Supreme Court ruled he could turn it down. In latter days, Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for all offences he may have committed, and Jimmy Carter pardoned most who had evaded the Vietnam War draft - both examples of preemptive pardons. Bill Clinton caused uproar when he pardoned scores of people on his last day in office, including his half-brother, Roger. Mr Trump has always projected himself as a ""law and order"" president. In terms of numbers, his pardons and commutations are low. Only George HW Bush issued fewer in modern times. Mr Trump has granted less than 1% of requests for clemency, the lowest on record. However, it is the nature of the pardons that has caused controversy. A number of those pardoned have been close associates and allies, such as former campaign manager Paul Manafort, long-time ally Roger Stone and his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles. Steve Bannon adds to that list. Opponents accuse him of using his constitutional powers unconventionally, to benefit his friends and close supporters. There had been speculation Mr Trump could try to pardon himself or his family members ahead of any possible charges. It is unclear whether he has the legal power to do so and there is no precedent of a US leader issuing such a pardon. He does face a possible Senate impeachment trial for ""incitement to insurrection"", although dates have yet to be set for that.

Murdered student 'may have been drugged',"Joy Morgan was a second year midwifery student at the University of Hertfordshire A student murdered by a fellow church member may have been given drugs without her knowing, an inquest heard. The body of Joy Morgan, 20, was found in Hertfordshire woodland in October 2019, two months after Shohfah-El Israel was convicted of her murder. Traces of MDMA were found in her body and the inquest was told there was no evidence that Ms Morgan would have taken the drug herself voluntarily. A coroner recorded a conclusion of ""unlawful killing"". Israel, of Fordwych Road, north-west London, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 17 years for Ms Morgan's murder in August 2019, despite the fact her body had not been found. During sentencing, Judge Michael Soole said Israel's ""cruel and cowardly"" refusal to reveal her whereabouts caused ""continuing distress and suffering"" to her family. Shohfah-El Israel was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court Two months later, the remains of Ms Morgan were found in woodland off Chadwell Road, Norton Green, near Stevenage. Part of the police evidence showed the killer had been in the area of the woods shortly after Ms Morgan's disappearance in December 2018. She was reported missing on 7 February 2019 after failing to return to her studies. Both Israel and Ms Morgan, who was in her second year at the University of Hertfordshire studying midwifery, were worshippers at the Israel United in Christ Church in Ilford. Man jailed for murdering fellow church member The murder of Joy Morgan An inquest at Hatfield Coroner's Court heard her body was found badly decomposed, and wrapped in black plastic bin liners and gaffer tape. The court heard toxicology tests showed MDMA in her body, and Det Insp Justine Jenkins said there was no evidence to indicate she would have voluntarily or knowingly taken illegal drugs. ""She was a church-goer, there is nothing to suggest [she took drugs] at all. ""We did, however, find MDMA in Israel's car, and it is likely that he was responsible for giving her these drugs."" Joy Morgan's remains were found in woodland at Norton Green Forensic pathologist Dr Charlotte Randall said there were three possible minor bruises on Ms Morgan's limbs. She added there was no evidence that Ms Morgan had been stabbed or shot, or restrained or suffered injuries consistent with a sexual assault. She found evidence of a possible fracture to her hyoid bone, but there was nothing to suggest she had suffered compression of the neck. Dr Randall said there was no evidence the student had suffered a head injury, but said she could have been rendered unconscious by a blow to the head that was ""non-fatal"". She could not rule out suffocation as a cause of death, potentially following milder blunt force trauma to the head. Coroner Geoffrey Sullivan said: ""[The MDMA] is not something that she would have taken and one can't exclude that she was given that, and it in some way rendered her incapable or unconscious."" He said the cause of Ms Morgan's death could not be ascertained. After the inquest, her mother Carol Morgan described her daughter as ""an amazing person"". ""She's been cremated, I haven't decided where to put her ashes so at the moment she's still at home with me,"" she said.

'Pimm's and Hymns' reaches Brazil audiences,"Father Lee Taylor said people have ""really missed communal singing"" Online ""Pimm's and Hymns"" singalong sessions at a north Wales church have attracted people from as far away as South Africa, Brazil and Canada. Father Lee Taylor, from St Collen's Church, Llangollen, set up the Facebook Live shows when his pews fell silent due to Covid restrictions. The former bartender said: ""People started to share it and the online audience just exploded."" It adds ""a real light in the darkness"" of lockdown and a ""few drinks"". The sessions, which have been running since last March, are a homage to the summer garden party known as 'Pimm's and Hymns' Mr Taylor, 43, hosts each year. ""I get phone calls, emails and letters from people all over the world, saying, 'You've lifted my spirits', and asking me to pray for their loved ones who are sick with the virus,"" he said. ""I started the sessions as I was trying to think of ways to bring comfort reassurance and cheer to people at home. ""While I can't hear people joining in, I feel them there with me in the room."" Father Lee Taylor hosted annual 'Pimm's and Hymns' garden parties before Covid restrictions came in last March Belting out everything from Abide With Me to Pack Up Your Troubles, the vicar, who lives with his partner of 14 years, Fabiano Duarte, is known for pouring a glass of wine or a cocktail before performing for his Facebook congregation.

Biden's inauguration a step forward - Johnson,"This video can not be played Johnson: ""It's a big moment for us - we have things we want to do together."" The inauguration of President Joe Biden is a ""step forward"" for the United States, which has ""been through a bumpy period"", Boris Johnson has said. Congratulating Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the UK PM said it was a ""big moment"" for the UK and the US and their ""joint common agenda"". Mr Johnson said he looked forward to working with the US on tackling climate change and the coronavirus pandemic. Making his inaugural address, Mr Biden said ""democracy has prevailed"". He promised to be a president ""for all Americans"" and said his ""whole soul is in putting America back together again"". Joe Biden replaces Trump as US president Biden inauguration in pictures How will Joe Biden change US trade relations? Outgoing President Donald Trump, who has not formally conceded to Mr Biden, did not attend the ceremony. President Biden began work straight away onreversing a number of his predecessor's policies, including rejoining the Paris climate change agreement - gaining the praise of Mr Johnson. The PM tweeted it was ""hugely positive news"", adding: ""I look forward to working with our US partners to do all we can to safeguard our planet."" Earlier this week the former head of the civil service Lord Sedwill suggestedMr Johnson would be glad Mr Trump had not been re-elected for a second term as US president. Writing in the Daily Mail, Lord Sedwill said those who believed Boris Johnson would have preferred Mr Trump to win again were ""mistaken"". The former cabinet secretary - who stepped down in September - said a second term for Mr Trump ""would not have been to the benefit of British or European security, to transatlantic trade, let alone the environmental agenda to which the prime minister is so committed"". Boris Johnson with Donald Trump at the G7 summit in 2019 Mr Johnson's public stance toward the former president has varied over the years. In 2015, when he was Mayor of London, Mr Johnson accused Mr Trump of ""stupefying ignorance"" over his comments about violence in the city. But as foreign secretary, following Mr Trump's election as president, he said there was a ""lot to be positive about"", and in 2019, praised his ""many good qualities"". For his part, Mr Trump has appeared largely supportive of Mr Johnson, backing his flagship Brexit policy and at one point saying of the British PM: ""They call him Britain Trump."" And echoing his predecessor, in 2019 Mr Biden described the UK prime minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Mr Trump. After winning the presidential election Mr Biden phoned Mr Johnson ahead of other European leaders and expressed his desire to strengthen the historic ""special relationship"" between the two countries. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said it was the job of all UK prime ministers to have a ""good, close working relationship"" with US presidents but, right now, there were many things the two countries ""wanted to do together"". ""When you look at the issues which unite me and Joe Biden, the UK and the US right now, there is a fantastic joint common agenda,"" he said. ""For us and America, it is a big moment."" He said he hoped the UK could help the US commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in the run up to the climate change conference COP 26, to be held in Glasgow this year. UK prime ministers like to consider American presidents as their best diplomatic friend. That relationship, particularly when it comes to security and defence, is unusually close. When, as with Donald Trump, that friend has been unpredictable and unconventional, that has made for some very awkward political moments. So for the government, this a really important and positive turning of the page. The terribly over-used phrase the 'special relationship', which provokes neurotic behaviour on this side of the Atlantic, has meant the most when there has been a genuine personal chemistry between the two leaders - whether Thatcher and Reagan, or Bush and Blair. There is nothing automatic about Mr Biden and Mr Johnson developing that kind of political friendship. But in the words of one former senior minister, for the UK Biden means ""we will lose exclusivity but gain predictability: easier to work with, less cringeworthy and more dependable, but we may not be the only girlfriend on speed dial"". Read Laura's blog. Speaking to the Guardian,,externalshadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy described Mr Biden as ""a woke guy"". Asked if he agreed, Mr Johnson said: ""I can't comment on that. What I know is that he's a firm believer in the transatlantic alliance and that's a great thing."" He added that there was ""nothing wrong with being woke - I put myself in the category of people who believe that it's important to stick up for your history, your traditions and your values, the things you believe in."" Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer also sent his congratulations to the new president and vice-president. ""The US begins a new chapter in its history, one of hope, decency, compassion and strength,"" the Labour leader said, adding ""together, our two nations can build a better, more optimistic future for our world."" And First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Warm congratulations and best wishes to President Biden and Vice President Harris. ""Scotland and the USA share long-standing bonds of friendship and co-operation. We look forward to building on these in the years ahead."" Mr Johnson watching the inauguration Writing in the Daily Mail, former UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Mr Biden's election presented the UK with a ""golden opportunity"" for Western democracies to reverse the trend towards ""absolutism"" - and a ""few strongmen facing off against each other"" - in global affairs. The Queen sent a private message to Mr Biden before his inauguration, Buckingham Palace has said.

Meanwhile HMRC is failing ""to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming"" support, the Public Accounts Committee says. The government said its ""top priority"" was helping those who are struggling. Since March, HM Revenue and Customs has provided more than Â£80bn in support to companies and individuals through government coronavirus support schemes, the committee says. They are also supporting the incomes of many of the self-employed. Despite this,a report from the MPs,externalsays ""quirks in the tax system"" have meant that workers who recently moved onto company payrolls or work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between - have been ineligible for furlough payments.

Indigenous communities in the Brazilian city of Manaus have started receiving vaccinations In recent days, we're been reporting stories of desperate oxygen shortages and over-run hospitals in Manaus in Brazil's Amazonas state. In the latest news from the city, some residents are queuing for up to 12 hours to buy their own oxygen tanks because of reports of high death rates in hospitals. ""Everyone here has a family member being treated at home. They prefer that to leaving them to die in the hospitals,"" one resident told AFP news agency. Brazil has been hit badly by Covid-19, with more than 211,000 deaths so far (the second highest in the world) and political discord over how to manage the crisis. But on Tuesday there was some good news for the county's badly-affected indigenous communities. Around 1,000 doses of the Chinese coronavirus vaccine are being flown deep into the Amazon rainforest along with military personnel to reach remote groups who are sometimes days away from medical clinics. Infections across the entire Americas region are currently extremely high, warns the World Health Organization's regional director. Carissa Ettiene said the rise in cases in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and the United States was a worrying sign that the region was failing to control the pandemic - last week the region registered more than half the world's new infections. Dr Ettiene suggested that new variants detected in Britain, South Africa and Brazil could be responsible.  Top-ranked Djokovic arrived in Australia last week ahead of the major We've been following the plight of 72 Australian Open tennis players confined to Melbourne hotel rooms after arriving on a plane that was also carrying covid infected passengers. World number one Novak Djokovic had made some demands for these players which were turned down by the government and today he insists he was not being ""selfish, difficult and ungrateful"". Djokovic is part of a group of top players enjoying better conditions while quarantining in Adelaide, but the 33-year-old said he had felt obliged to use his ""hard-earned"" privileges to make suggestions to tournament director Craig Tiley on how to improve conditions for players in Melbourne. In a long social media post, Djokovic wrote: ""I've earned my privileges the hard way and for that reason it is very difficult for me to be a mere onlooker knowing how much every help, gesture and good word mattered to me when I was small and insignificant in the world pecking order."" There have beencomplaints about miceat one quarantine hotel. A further 13,800 people have had their first vaccine in the past day in Wales, figures show There will be no ""significant easing"" of Wales' Covid restrictions when the guidelines are reviewed later this month, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has warned. He said in a Welsh Government briefing that while it was ""good news"" that case rates were falling, they still remain high. The NHS remains ""under pressure"", with critical care services operating at 150% of capacity, added Mr Gething. Mr Gething made the comments as he was outlining the current situation with Covid in Wales, but he said he did not want to prejudge a Welsh Government decision on the review. Wales has been in a level four lockdown since before Christmas, with a decision on a review of the current restrictions expected by 29 January. Read more here. Daily confirmed coronavirus cases are starting to fall overall - although they were higher today than on Tuesday. Today there were new 38,905 cases compared with more than 60,000 per day in early January. However daily deaths are increasing and the prime minister says there will be ""more to come"". The UK recorded a new daily high of 1,820 deaths. At the currrent rate of progress, the government would need to increase the rate of vaccination to meet the goal of 15m people by 15 February. Freelance TV and film sound editor Louise Burton isone of those who are unable to benefit from government pandemic support schemes, despite being out of work. Louise, 28, of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, has not had any financial assistance since her last job ended eight months ago. Louise fell foul of tax rules relating to self-employed people
and could not go on furlough, because the company that had employed her no
longer existed - with companies often created solely for the production of a film and then closed once it is completed. While she says she still has a roof over her head and can âjust
about put food on the tableâ, things are ânot easy"" and she fears for her
prospects in the next 12 months. According to MPs,external, whole
groups of people like Louise are falling through the cracks of Covid-19 support
schemes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned ""there will be more to come"", when asked about the record number of Covid-19 deaths recorded today. He said: ""These figures are appalling, and of course we think of the suffering that each one of those deaths represents to their families and to their friends. ""I've got to tell you... there will be more to come because what we're seeing is the result of the wave of the new variant that we saw just before Christmas on December 18, or thereabouts."" He said it had been ""a very big peak of infection"" which has ""spread very quickly"", not just where it started in London and the South East but now across the UK. Mr Johnson added: ""It's true that it looks as though the rates of infection in the country overall may now be peaking or flattening but they're not flattening very fast and it's clear that we must keep a grip on this. ""We must maintain discipline, formation, keep observing the lockdown."" John and Susan Docherty died within nine days of each other A woman whose parents died with Covid-19 within days of each other is urging people to take the virus seriously. Katie Tong's mum Susan Docherty 62, and her husband John, 65, died in November 2020. Mrs Docherty had suffered with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and retired taxi driver Mr Docherty had asthma. Both moved to Shrewsbury from Scotland 17 years ago. Mrs Tong was allowed to be in hospital with her mother for her final hours, but had to say goodbye to her father via a video call on 22 November. ""I am heartbroken because he died without his family and loved ones around him,"" she says. ""I have lost two people I loved dearly due to Covid-19. Covid-19 killed them. ""Please take this seriously. I've lost my mum and dad, but this could happen to anyone."" Read the full storyhere. In case you missed Prime Minister's Questions earlier here are some of the key moments. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the prime minister had not closed the borders to slow the spread of the virus in March, aftera recording emerged of Home Secretary Priti Patel saying she had been an ""advocate"" of such a move. This video can not be played And after being asked to commit to an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, Boris Johnson said the NHS was under ""unprecedented pressure"" and the idea that state resources should be used for an inquiry ""in the middle of the pandemic does not, I think, seem sensible to me"". This video can not be played You can catch up with everything that happened at PMQshere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Detailed
analysis of coronavirus samples has revealedhow and when the virus got into the country. The UKâs
epidemic was largely started by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in
early-to-mid-March and France in mid-to-late-March. China, where
the pandemic started, had a negligible impact. Completely
shutting the borders in March could have prevented some of those cases from
Spain and France coming in and sparking more outbreaks. But it is clear
the virus was here and spreading by that point. So the best
case scenario is it could have bought a bit of time, which begs the question: âTime to do what?â You have to
view border control as only one part of the governmentâs overall strategy. New Zealand,
which has faced minimal disruption from Covid, used its closed borders
alongside lockdown to go for a âzero-Covid strategyâ, which has never been on
the cards in the UK. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under half of the 1,820 deaths reported in the UK today happened yesterday. A further quarter occurred on Monday or Sunday. So there are some old deaths in here (about 8% happened more than a week ago), but the rise to 1,820 reflects a genuine rise in the number of people dying. Deaths that are reported today are likely to reflect infections that happened around Christmas time, so we are likely to see deaths continue to rise for some time yet, since cases continued to rise after Christmas. So when, roughly, did the deaths reported today happen?  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is the second consecutive daydeaths have hit a new high. That, unfortunately, was to be expected as it is a reflection of the surge in cases seen during December. It takes a week or two from the point of infection for someone to become seriously ill â and they can then spend some time fighting for their life. The high number is also a result of delays reporting deaths â a quarter of those reported today happened last week or even before. But make no mistake: the death toll is going up. If you look at the average over the course of a week, the numbers being reported at the moment are twice what they were just two weeks ago. However, we also know they should soon start coming down. The number of daily infections are falling, with signs lockdown is taking effect. For four days in a row new diagnoses have been below 40,000, after averaging 60,000 at the start of the year. It could be another week or so before we start to see the impact of that in the death figures. The hope then would be that, within a few weeks, we could start seeing a more rapid fall as the impact of the vaccination programme begins to bite. But before that happens, the daily totals reported could - sadly - go even higher. A former Royal Marine who fought in Afghanistan saidhome-schooling in the first lockdown last year pushed him to ""breaking point"". Mark Ormrod, from Plymouth, reminded parents it is ""normal"" to struggle. He described working for a veterans' charity while teaching two of his children as ""traumatic"", adding: ""I was going to bed each night drained and wiped out."" Mr Ormrod, who lost both legs and an arm when he stepped on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2007, said he was ""caught off guard"" when schools closed to most children. ""Sometimes I'd go three or four days without putting my legs on, and even getting out of my pyjamas didn't seem worth it because my workload was mounting up and I had to stick to the teaching schedule,"" he said. The father-of-three, who is classed as a key worker along with his partner, has been able to send their children back to school in the latest lockdown. Every time the coronavirus passes from person to person it picks up tiny changes to its genetic code, but scientists are starting to notice patterns in how the virus is mutating. Nearly a year after the global Covid-19 pandemic started, the issue of mutations looms large, with new variants capable of a faster spread emerging, leading to questions about whether they will make the newly-approved vaccines less effective. Virologists are trying to learn as much as possible about these variations, and how to neutralise them, with Michael Worobey, a viral evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, saying in the future the world could ""be in an arms race with this virus"". Our friends at BBC Future have told the full storyhere. Israel is currently in its third lockdown since the pandemic began there last year A nationwide lockdown in Israel is to be extended until the end of the month amid a spike in cases - despite an intense vaccination campaign, with more than two of the nine million population already having received their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It takes time for immunity to build
up, so its expected to take several weeks for vaccines to have an impact
on cases The man coordinating Israelâs pandemic
response, Nachman Ash, has warned that a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine in the country has been âless effective than we thoughtâ. According to Israeli Army Radio, Prof Ash told cabinet
members on Tuesday the data on the protective effect of a first dose against
the virus was âlower than Pfizer presentedâ. Pfizer saidits vaccine was roughly 52% effective two weeks after the first dose,externaland reaches
maximum efficacy of 95% after the second. Itâs not clear what data he is
referring to, but a not-yet published study from Israelâs largest healthcare
provider suggested a 33% fall in infections by day 14, at which point, full
immunity would not have been reached. Infections continued to fall in the
following days but the numbers were too small to put a percentage on it. Israel saw its highest daily case figure on Monday with 10,000 new infections The health ministry said on Tuesdaymore than 12,400 Israelis had tested positive for Covid-19 ten days after being vaccinated,externalâ 69 of these had already received a second dose. This was 6.6% of the 189,000 people who took Covid tests after being vaccinated, roughly tallying with the reported efficacy. Health experts say they are analysing the new Israeli data closely but warn it may be too early to draw any conclusions on the single dose efficacy of the vaccine based on the initial data gathered in Israel, which began vaccinating its population on 19 December. Members of the military are to be brought in to help medical staff in Northern Ireland in the fight against Covid-19. Some 100 medically-trained military staff are expected to be deployed in hospitals to ease the pressure on staff. It is thought the first military staff could be made available as early as next week, after Northern Irelandâs Health Minister Robin Swann made a request to the Ministry of Defence. While military help has already been used during the pandemic to transport equipment and patients, this is the first time military staff will be used in hospitals in Northern Ireland. Read more here. The Ministry of Justice could open courts in England and Wales for longer to help clear the backlog of cases built up during the pandemic, a justice minister said. Chris Philp told MPs that 20,000 remote hearings a week are now taking place and said ""we are adding more courtrooms, further increasing remote hearings and examining options for longer operating hours"". Labour shadow justice secretary David Lammy said victims were ""being denied the speedy justice that our society owes them"", with estimates showing the current backlog would ""take 10 years to clear at pre-pandemic rates"". He added the government's cuts to the justice system since 2010 have played a part in the current backlog. The comments come after criminal justice watchdogs warnedthe issues caused by the pandemic could damage the system for years. A further 1,820 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now 93,290. Yesterday's figure of 1,610 deaths was the previous highest daily total. Another 38,905 positive Covid cases have also been reported in the past 24 hours. Reality Check South Africa has had more than a third of all the Covid-19 cases in Africa and numbers are surging with the emergence of a new variant of the virus. But unlike some other badly hit countries in the world, South Africa, which has a population of 59.6 million, is yet to start its vaccination programme. President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa has so far secured twenty million doses, due to be delivered in the first half of 2021, but there's no detailed timeline for a programme. The country expects to acquire doses from several sources. There's been concern that many poorer countries are being left behind in the global competition to secure vaccine supplies - but as the continent's richest nation, critics suggest South Africa should not be in this position.

PM 'doesn't know' impact of police files deletion,"The government does not know how many cases might be affected by hundreds of thousands of police records being accidentally wiped, the PM has said. Boris Johnson told the House of Commons the police were working ""round the clock"" to rectify the error. Around 400,000 fingerprint, DNA and arrest records were deleted from the police database. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was not yet known whether any of the data had been permanently lost. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""The Home Office is actively working to assess the damage and... they believe that they will be able to rectify the results of this complex incident and they hope very much that they'll be able to restore the data in question."" Asked by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer how many convicted criminals had had their records wrongly deleted, Mr Johnson said: ""We don't know how many cases might be frustrated as a result of what has happened."" He added: ""Of course it is outrageous that any data should have been lost."" Patel: Work to restore lost police records ongoing Last week it was revealed that the information was wiped from the Police National Computer (PNC) - which stores and shares criminal records information across the UK - after being inadvertently flagged for deletion. The PNC is used in police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. An estimated 213,000 offence records, 175,000 arrest records and 15,000 records on people were potentially incorrectly deleted as a result of a defective code. Ms Patel, who has launched an internal investigation, told ITV's Good Morning Britain that criminals would not get away with serious crimes as a result of the error. ""It is not about serious criminals getting away with anything. Multiple records are held on the same individuals on the same crimes on other profiling systems as well."" She told the BBC that officials could be instructed to re-submit the entries manually. ""I'm also clear with Home Office engineers and technicians that if we have to do manual uploads from other systems, that is effectively what we will do and that will potentially take time, but that is another option for us right now. ""We will absolutely provide updates once we know what has happened in terms of retrieving data. This will take time because it is a coding error."" The Home Office previously said that the faulty script was introduced in November 2020, but it did not run until earlier this month when the error within it immediately became apparent.

In Greater Manchester up to 3,000 properties could be affected by flooding near the River Mersey where a peak is expected at 23:00 GMT. Downing Street said Covid-secure evacuation centres would be made available to those forced to leave their homes as a result of flooding. ""Preparations to create Covid-secure rest centres have been made by relevant agencies as a precautionary measure,"" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. ""The important message for the public now is to continue to monitor the information the Environment Agency are providing and sign-up for flood alerts if they haven't already."" The River Eden has flooded Rickerby Park in Carlisle More than 120mm (nearly 5in) of rain has already fallen in some parts of England, with 123.4mm at Honister Pass in Cumbria in the 24 hours up to 06:00 GMT on Wednesday.

"Work to minimise flood damage under way, PM says","This video can not be played Heavy rainfall continues to batter parts of England More than 2,000 homes in parts of Manchester are being evacuated due to flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency (EA) has issued two severe flood warnings, which means danger to life, for the Didsbury and Northenden areas. Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey of Greater Manchester Police has warned some of those affected would ""be Covid-positive or isolating at home"". Earlier, Boris Johnson urged people to follow evacuation advice. He said the government was working to ensure it was ""totally prepared"" for floods ""in every part of the UK"". A major incident was earlier declared for the Greater Manchester areawhere up to 3,000 properties were feared to be at risk. Mr Johnson urged people not to stay in their homes if they were told to evacuate. ""If you are told to leave your home then you should do so. ""People may think this is a minor issue at the moment, still relevantly minor by standards of previous floods, but never underestimate the suffering, the misery, that floods can cause people."" Under government restrictions due to the current national lockdown people are allowed to leave their homes to escape harm. Flooding has affected roads and rail services In an alert to those affected, ACC Bailey said: ""A basin at Didsbury to take water from the Mersey is full. It will over-top in the next few hours. As a result we will be issuing a flood warning to homes. ""This will be through texted flood alerts to some people, and police officers, PCSOs, firefighters, and volunteers will be knocking on doors."" He said police will be supported by North West Ambulance, the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance. ""I think it's important to stress that if you are contacted and advised to evacuate then we would strongly urge you to do so,"" he added. Water levels in the area were expected to peak at about 23:00 GMT on Wednesday. A major incident has also been declared in Derbyshire, where authorities believe a small number of evacuations are ""likely"" on Thursday morning, when the River Derwent is expected to peak. County council leader Barry Lewis said it could rival levels seen in November 2019, depending on the weather overnight. This video can not be played The PM says the government is making sure it is âtotally prepared in every part of the UKâ for flooding after Storm Christoph. Speaking after a Cobra emergency meeting on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said work was under way to ensure transport and energy networks, and local council services, were prepared. He added that work was also taking place to ensure the necessary numbers of sandbags were available. ""We want to make sure that we are totally prepared in every part of the UK for flooding, because it is coming on top of the stress people are already under fighting Covid,"" he said. ""We looked at particularly Manchester, we've got a situation potentially developing there,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We are looking at a pattern of rainfall possibly not as bad at the end of this week, maybe worse next week."" Flood warnings as Storm Christoph approaches Homes flooded in Wales BBC Weather People in Greater Manchester have also been advised not to travel. Stephen Rhodes, from Transport from Greater Manchester, said there was disruption across the network. ""Let's work together and not put our emergency services and the NHS - who are already working extremely hard due to the Covid-19 pandemic - under any more pressure,"" he said. In Merseyside, the M57 has been closed in both directions between junction 6 and 7 due to flooding. Elsewhere in England: In Cheshire, 33 people were moved from their houseboats on Hayhurst Marina as water levels rose Flood warnings remain in place in both West and North Yorkshire North Yorkshire Police said anyone forced to leave home and stay with relatives would not face a fine for breaching Covid restrictions The Ouse in York is expected to peak at 4.4 (14.4ft) to 4.8m (15.7ft) on Thursday evening The Environment Agency has issued more than100 flood warnings,external, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, while there are also more than 200 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible.

The Met Office said some isolated areas could see up to 200mm (7.8in). Sandbags have been distributed as Storm Christoph batters parts of England Labour's shadow floods minister Stephanie Peacock said urgent action was needed. ""Once again the government's response to inevitable flood events has been slow and uncoordinated,"" the Barnsley East MP said.

Full transcript of Biden inauguration speech,"This video can not be played Watch again: President Biden's inauguration speech in full Chief Justice Roberts, Vice-President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice-President Pence. My distinguished guests, my fellow Americans. This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause, a cause of democracy. The people - the will of the people - has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and, at this hour my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundations, we come together as one nation under God - indivisible - to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic, and set our sights on a nation we know we can be and must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the strength of our nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last night who cannot be with us today, but who we salute for his lifetime of service. I've just taken a sacred oath each of those patriots have taken. The oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On we the people who seek a more perfect union. This is a great nation, we are good people. And over the centuries through storm and strife in peace and in war we've come so far. But we still have far to go. We'll press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibility. Much to do, much to heal, much to restore, much to build and much to gain. Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. A once in a century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as in all of World War Two. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now. The rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism, that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy - unity. Unity. In another January on New Year's Day in 1863 Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper the president said, and I quote, 'if my name ever goes down in history, it'll be for this act, and my whole soul is in it'. My whole soul is in it today, on this January day. My whole soul is in this. Bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the foes we face - anger, resentment and hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, and hopelessness. With unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs, we can put people to work in good jobs, we can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus, we can rebuild work, we can rebuild the middle class and make work secure, we can secure racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal, that we are all created equal, and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism and fear have torn us apart. The battle is perennial and victory is never secure. Through civil war, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setback, our better angels have always prevailed. In each of our moments enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward and we can do that now. History, faith and reason show the way. The way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbours. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury, no progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge. And unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee we will not failed. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we've acted together. And so today at this time in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another again, hear one another, see one another. Show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. We have to be better than this and I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome. As mentioned earlier, completed in the shadow of the Civil War. When the union itself was literally hanging in the balance. We endure, we prevail. Here we stand, looking out on the great Mall, where Dr King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing in of the first woman elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change. Here we stand where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen, it will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign, I'm humbled by the faith you placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear us out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peacefully. And the guardrail of our democracy is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. If you hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you. I will be a President for all Americans, all Americans. And I promise you I will fight for those who did not support me as for those who did. Many centuries ago, St Augustine - the saint of my church - wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. Defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love, that define us as Americans? I think we know. Opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honour, and yes, the truth. Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens as Americans and especially as leaders. Leaders who are pledged to honour our Constitution to protect our nation. To defend the truth and defeat the lies. Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand like their dad they lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling thinking: 'Can I keep my healthcare? Can I pay my mortgage?' Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But the answer's not to turn inward. To retreat into competing factions. Distrusting those who don't look like you, or worship the way you do, who don't get their news from the same source as you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say. Just for a moment, stand in their shoes. Because here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days you need a hand. There are other days when we're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be, that's what we do for one another. And if we are that way our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree. My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the darkest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation, one nation. And I promise this, as the Bible says, 'Weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning'. We will get through this together. Together. Look folks, all my colleagues I serve with in the House and the Senate up here, we all understand the world is watching. Watching all of us today. So here's my message to those beyond our borders. America has been tested and we've come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances, and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday's challenges but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the example of our power but the power of our example. Fellow Americans, moms, dads, sons, daughters, friends, neighbours and co-workers. We will honour them by becoming the people and the nation we can and should be. So I ask you let's say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, those left behind and for our country. Amen. Folks, it's a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy, and on truth, a raging virus, a stinging inequity, systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with one of the greatest responsibilities we've had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up? It's time for boldness for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you. We will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. We will rise to the occasion. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children? I believe we must and I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will, and when we do, we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America. The American story. A story that might sound like a song that means a lot to me, it's called American Anthem. And there's one verse that stands out at least for me and it goes like this: 'The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day, which shall be our legacy, what will our children say? Let me know in my heart when my days are through, America, America, I gave my best to you.' Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us: 'They gave their best, they did their duty, they healed a broken land.' My fellow Americans I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you, I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution, I'll defend our democracy. I'll defend America and I will give all - all of you - keep everything I do in your service. Thinking not of power but of possibilities. Not of personal interest but of public good. And together we will write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity not division, of light not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us. And the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrive. That America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forbearers, one another, and generations to follow. So with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our time. Sustained by faith, driven by conviction and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and God protect our troops. LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Government pushing to get jabs to front-line roles,"The home secretary (centre) says ministers are working to get frontline workers vaccinated Ministers are working to ensure police and other front-line workers are moved up the priority list for the Covid vaccine, the home secretary has said. Priti Patel told the BBC there was ""a lot of work taking place in government right now"" on the issue. The committee advising the government on vaccines has also said it will consider factors like exposure risk and occupation in the rollout's next phase. The most vulnerable are being prioritised for the vaccine first. The government is aiming to offer everyone in the top four priority groups a first dose by mid-February. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the government was ""on track"" to meet the pledge, however, he said it was ""very hard"" because of constraints on supply. Asked whether groups whose work brings them into contact with others, such as police officers, emergency service workers and teachers, should be vaccinated next, the prime minister said the government must rely on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). However, he said the government wanted those groups to be vaccinated ""as soon as possible"". When will I get a Covid vaccine? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Patel: UK should have closed borders in March 2020 Vaccine rollout extended to over-70s in England Ms Patel, in response to being asked whether she wanted to see police officers ""bumped up the queue"" for the vaccine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's both police, fire and other front-line workers. And the health secretary and I are working to absolutely try and make that happen. ""This isn't just something we are thinking about. There is a lot of work taking place in government right now. ""If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says that is a possibility, we can make it happen. We have the supply, we have the logistical plans in place, we will absolutely work to make that happen."" Residents in care homes for older adults and their carers 80-year-olds and over and front-line health and social care workers 75-year-olds and over 70-year-olds and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals When will I get a vaccine? Ms Patel added that Health Secretary Matt Hancock was ""supporting all our efforts across government on this"" and she was talking to police partners, including the National Police Chiefs Council and the Met Police Commissioner, about getting officers ""ready to take the vaccine when that comes"". Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the JCVI, which advises the government, said phase two of the rollout would continue to work down the priority list through the over-50s. However, he told BBC Radio 5 live phase two would also concentrate on people who are potentially at risk of being exposed to the virus, such as teachers and police officers, as well as ""those that are important to keep the economy running"". ""There are a lot of factors in phase two which we'll be looking at in depth,"" he added. Questions about who will be next in the priority list for vaccination once the first phase is complete keep coming. If all goes well with rollout, by the end of April all the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions should have been offered a jab. But what happens after that has not been decided - and will not be until nearer the time. Ministers heed the advice of an expert committee, the JCVI, and they want to know more about the effectiveness of vaccine and to what extent it stops transmission - people who have been vaccinated passing on the virus even if they themselves do not fall sick. Knowing that is crucial. If it stops transmissions - known as sterilising immunity - the next phase could involve targeting the vaccine at people who are most likely to spread it. That could see younger age groups prioritised, for example. But if the vaccine does not do that the preference, as it is currently, would be to target the vaccine at those most at risk. Once you get down to the under-50s without health conditions the risk is small. Less than 1% of Covid deaths have been in these age groups. At such low levels of risk exposure becomes a more crucial factor, which is why there is a logic in targeting key workers like teachers, the police and transport workers. But phasing vaccination in this way is more complex than simply working through the age groups, and so, in the end, may mean vaccination rollout takes longer overall There is a fine balance to tread. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Asked when phase two would begin, Prof Harnden said: ""We haven't put a timescale on it, but we will be looking at this over the next few weeks."" ""One of the really difficult things about this vaccine is we don't know yet whether it prevents transmission,"" he said. ""If we can show through data that the vaccine does prevent transmission, it's a whole new ball game in terms of who we immunise because of course we may look at groups that actually transmit that virus to others."" It comes after Met Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said she was ""baffled"" about why front-line police officers were not closer to the front of the queue to receive the vaccine. The Fire Brigades Union said it was ""glad"" Ms Patel ""appears to be listening"" to its calls for firefighters to receive priority access to vaccinations. But it said ""vaccines alone will not secure the safety of firefighters and the public"" and called for safety measures in fire services to be properly implemented. The teachers' union NASUWT welcomed support from ministers to prioritise education staff for the vaccine and called for the government to ""make good"" on their comments. General secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: ""Alongside the need for tougher control measures in schools and colleges, providing education workers with access to vaccines will help to minimise further disruption to children's education and help ensure the safe and sustainable resumption of school and college-based education for all pupils as quickly as possible."" Last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid he wanted school staff to be a ""top priority"" for the vaccine in the next phase of the rollout. Ms Patel was also asked about why the rollout of the vaccine appeared to be slower this week than last week. She said Pfizer, which is producing one of the vaccines being used in the UK, was upgrading its factories and changing its supply chains, which would ""inevitably have an implication in terms of the actual supply of the vaccine"". More than 4.2 million people in the UK have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine so far, including more than half of over-80s and half of elderly care home residents.

Smear-test delays prompt calls for DIY screeningDelays to smear tests in lockdown prompt cervical cancer charities to call for home-testing kits.,"Sophie Davies, from Shropshire, recovering from cervical cancer, says delays to screening could be a matter of life and death Smear-test delays during lockdown have prompted calls for home-screening kits. Cervical cancer screening has restarted across the UK - but some women say they will not attend their appointments for fear of catching Covid. Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust is urging ""faster action"" on home tests for HPV, which causes 99% of cervical cancers. An NHS official said GP practices should continue screening throughout lockdown, and ""anyone invited for a cervical smear test should attend"". Cancer Research UK said it was not yet known how effective and accurate self-sampling could be in cervical screening. Screenings in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have restarted after being halted during the first lockdown. In England, the NHS told GPs and clinics not to halt smear tests - but,as the prime minister heard last week,some patients were experiencing cancellations and long waiting times. About 600,000 tests had failed to go ahead in the UK in April and May,Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said,in addition to a backlog of 1.5 million appointments missed annually. In March, Sophie Davies was told she needed a hysterectomy ""within the month"" but had to wait until December for surgery A survey by gynaecological cancer charity the Eve Appeal indicates nearly one in three missed smear tests are the result of people being ""put off"" by coronavirus. And a Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust survey during the pandemic suggests the same proportion would prefer to take their own human-papillomavirus (HPV) test rather than go to a GP. Acting chief executive Rebecca Shoosmith said coronavirus had added ""more barriers"" to going for a smear test. ""Sadly those who found it difficult before are likely to be no closer to getting tested,"" she said. ""Self-sampling would be a game-changer."" Both charities emphasise smear tests are for ""women and anyone with a cervix"" and transgender and non-binary people may have additional barriers to going. Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said DIY tests could also help people who had been sexually assaulted and those with disabilities or from backgrounds where smear tests were taboo. Samantha Renke felt anxious about catching coronavirus when she went for her smear test Samantha Renke had received an abnormal test result and needed to go for a follow-up test during the pandemic. The broadcaster and campaigner, who has brittle bones and uses a wheelchair, said a home-testing kit would have made things easier. ""I am at very high risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19,"" the 35-year-old, from Lancashire, said. ""So I was incredibly anxious sitting in the waiting room for my test. ""Women with a physical disability are so much more likely to find cervical screening difficult, to the point where it can sometimes be impossible just to get through the door. ""We shouldn't have to fight to get this life-saving test. ""Self-sampling would be so much easier for people like me. ""It would allow me to take my health into my own hands."" Ishita Ranjan said talk of smear tests was taboo in traditional South Asian families Ishita Ranjan finally went for her smear test in August, having put it off for a ""really long time"". ""In most traditional South Asian families, women's sexual health is not something you talk about openly,"" the 31-year-old, from London, said. ""Young women are left to figure this stuff out. ""Until you get married, older female relatives find it problematic to share that kind of information."" A fear of catching coronavirus could be also stopping people belonging to ethnic minorities attending appointments. ""We have seen high Covid infection and death rates and people are genuinely scared,"" Ms Ranjan said. ""But this is essential. ""And it's really important that you do still go and do it. ""I was in and out in five minutes, no sitting around waiting rooms."" Denmark and Australia already offer self-testing and there are pilots to see if it would be viable in the UK In January, a study launched in north and east London, offering 31,000 people overdue for their smear test ahome-testing kit,external Another pilot,externalis under way in Dumfries and Galloway Kits are sent in the post and contain a long cotton bud to take a swab without touching the cervix Anyone testing positive for HPV is asked to have a standard test by a clinician Helen Austin founded At your Cervix, a support network for people who find smear tests difficult After experiencing sexual violence, it took Helen Austin 10 years to work up the courage to go for her smear test. ""When my first invite arrived through the post, years ago, my body froze, and I then ripped it up,"" she said. Self-sampling would have given her time and privacy, the 35-year-old, from Lincolnshire, said. ""If my appointment had been during the pandemic and I could not have brought someone I trust with me to help me, I would never have gone,"" she said. ""Other trauma survivors I speak to find wearing a mask triggering and are putting off attending their test partly for this reason too."" Sophie Davies, 32, saw in the new year alone in hospital, after having a hysterectomy After developing a rare form of cervical cancer, Sophie Davies had a trachelectomy to remove her cervix, in April 2018, allowing doctors to save her ovaries and two-thirds of her womb. But in March 2020, she was told the risk of cancer coming back meant she needed a hysterectomy and the removal of both ovaries. ""I was advised the operation needed to be done 'the sooner the better' and 'within the month',"" the 32-year-old, from Shropshire, said. ""Then, Covid-19 happened."" And she had an ""agonising"" wait, until 30 December, for her surgery. ""I'm still awaiting my results, more than three weeks on, and praying I have not been left for the best part of a year with cancer growing inside me,"" Ms Davies said. ""These months of delay could be the difference in saving fertility or losing fertility. ""It could be the difference in needing chemotherapy or radiotherapy or not needing it, or could be the difference of life or death."" Cancer Research UK early diagnosis head Dr Jodie Moffat said research was under way to understand how effective and accurate self-sampling could be in cervical screening. But getting more people screened ""is not the only hurdle to overcome"". ""The NHS is under immense pressure and would need more staff and equipment to ensure patients receive their results and any follow-up treatment as quickly as possible,"" she said. An NHS official said: ""The NHS guidance that cervical screening should continue has not changed, which has been communicated to GP practices, which have adjusted the way they work to remain open and safe, while local NHS services across the country have put extra measures in place to protect people from coronavirus and so anyone invited for a cervical smear test should attend.""

Murdered student 'may have been drugged'The body of Joy Morgan was found two months after a man was convicted of her murder.,"Joy Morgan was a second year midwifery student at the University of Hertfordshire A student murdered by a fellow church member may have been given drugs without her knowing, an inquest heard. The body of Joy Morgan, 20, was found in Hertfordshire woodland in October 2019, two months after Shohfah-El Israel was convicted of her murder. Traces of MDMA were found in her body and the inquest was told there was no evidence that Ms Morgan would have taken the drug herself voluntarily. A coroner recorded a conclusion of ""unlawful killing"". Israel, of Fordwych Road, north-west London, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 17 years for Ms Morgan's murder in August 2019, despite the fact her body had not been found. During sentencing, Judge Michael Soole said Israel's ""cruel and cowardly"" refusal to reveal her whereabouts caused ""continuing distress and suffering"" to her family. Shohfah-El Israel was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court Two months later, the remains of Ms Morgan were found in woodland off Chadwell Road, Norton Green, near Stevenage. Part of the police evidence showed the killer had been in the area of the woods shortly after Ms Morgan's disappearance in December 2018. She was reported missing on 7 February 2019 after failing to return to her studies. Both Israel and Ms Morgan, who was in her second year at the University of Hertfordshire studying midwifery, were worshippers at the Israel United in Christ Church in Ilford. Man jailed for murdering fellow church member The murder of Joy Morgan An inquest at Hatfield Coroner's Court heard her body was found badly decomposed, and wrapped in black plastic bin liners and gaffer tape. The court heard toxicology tests showed MDMA in her body, and Det Insp Justine Jenkins said there was no evidence to indicate she would have voluntarily or knowingly taken illegal drugs. ""She was a church-goer, there is nothing to suggest [she took drugs] at all. ""We did, however, find MDMA in Israel's car, and it is likely that he was responsible for giving her these drugs."" Joy Morgan's remains were found in woodland at Norton Green Forensic pathologist Dr Charlotte Randall said there were three possible minor bruises on Ms Morgan's limbs. She added there was no evidence that Ms Morgan had been stabbed or shot, or restrained or suffered injuries consistent with a sexual assault. She found evidence of a possible fracture to her hyoid bone, but there was nothing to suggest she had suffered compression of the neck. Dr Randall said there was no evidence the student had suffered a head injury, but said she could have been rendered unconscious by a blow to the head that was ""non-fatal"". She could not rule out suffocation as a cause of death, potentially following milder blunt force trauma to the head. Coroner Geoffrey Sullivan said: ""[The MDMA] is not something that she would have taken and one can't exclude that she was given that, and it in some way rendered her incapable or unconscious."" He said the cause of Ms Morgan's death could not be ascertained. After the inquest, her mother Carol Morgan described her daughter as ""an amazing person"". ""She's been cremated, I haven't decided where to put her ashes so at the moment she's still at home with me,"" she said.

What time is Biden's inauguration?,"The inauguration of a new president is a day that usually follows decades of custom and precedent. A day that follows a routine set in stone. Well, you can forget all that this year. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will still take the oath, of course, to make them officially US president and vice-president, but this will be a much scaled back affair, due to Covid and the recent riots. Here's everything you need to know about the big day. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the start of a new presidency, and it takes place in Washington DC. The only required feature is that the president-elect recite the presidential oath of office. ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" What Joe Biden wants to do The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Does Biden's new team better reflect America? Once he utters these words, Mr Biden will then take his place as the 46th president and the inauguration will be complete (but that's not all - celebrations follow). Kamala Harris will become vice-president once she takes the oath of office, which usually happens just before the president. Opening remarks are usually scheduled for around 11:30 EST (16:30 GMT) and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in around midday. By law, inauguration day is always 20 January. Mr Biden will move into the White House later in the day - his home for the next four years. Presidential inaugurations typically involve detailed security plans, but even more so now, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. Officials have ramped up security and closed off large sections of the city. The Secret Service has taken command of the security plans, backed up by some 25,000 National Guard troops, in addition to thousands of police officers. This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration Washington DC is already under a state of emergency and will remain that way through inauguration. Agent Matt Miller, who is leading the security effort on behalf of the Secret Service, told reporters on Friday that planning for the event has been going on for over a year. How security threats have changed Bidenâs inauguration And while Mr Biden has insisted on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition, attendance to the event will be scaled back. It's become customary for the outgoing president to watch the next in line being sworn in, which can sometimes make things awkward. This year, it will be a different type of awkward - the outgoing president will be a no-show. ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,"" Mr Trump tweeted on 8 January. He is widely expected to be travelling to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. Some of his supporters say they are planning a virtual ""second inauguration"" for Mr Trump on the same day (and time) that Mr Biden takes office. More than 68,000 people said on Facebook they would attend an online event to show their support for Mr Trump.  Facebook said it removed this event the week before the inauguration, because it violated its policies. Barack Obama was there to see Donald Trump sworn in When Mr Trump was sworn in, Hillary Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the inauguration - just two months after her election defeat and a bitter campaign against Mr Trump. Only three presidents - John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson - have actively chosen to sit out their successor's inaugurations, and none in the last century. Vice-President Mike Pence, however, has said that he will attend. In normal circumstances, Washington DC would see hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city, swarming the National Mall and selling out hotels - an estimated two million came when President Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009. But this year, the celebration's size will be ""extremely limited"", the Biden team has said, and it has urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital, a call that has been repeated by DC authorities following the storming of Congress.  Viewing stands that had been constructed along the parade route have been taken down. One tradition that will be preserved is that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will still take their oaths in front of the US Capitol, overlooking the Mall (a tradition that started with President Ronald Reagan in 1981). About 200 people will sit, socially distanced, on the stage with them,the Washington Post reports,external. There will be masks and everybody on the platform will have to be tested within a couple of days of the event itself, it added. As for the moment of the swearing in itself, Mr Bidensaid back in June that he would not wear one to take the presidential oath,external. Inauguration rehearsals took place on Monday on the West Front at the Capitol In the past, up to 200,000 tickets were up for grabs to attend the official ceremony, but with infections still surging across the US, only around 1,000 tickets will be available. This year, there will still be a ""pass in review"" ceremony - a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, where the new commander in chief inspects the troops, but instead of the usual parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, organisers say they will host a ""virtual parade"" across the US. Chairs are arranged to allow for social distancing Mr Biden, Ms Harris and their spouses will then be escorted to the White House by members of the military, including a band and drum corps. Tickets are required for seated and standing areas near the stage and seats along the parade route in normal years, and traditionally, the rest of the National Mall remained open to the public. So if you want to watch the inaugural ceremonies from up close, you'll need to talk to your local representatives first. Inaugural balls and other related events around the city require separate tickets. Barack Obama's first inauguration reportedly drew some two million people to the celebrations Senators and members of Congress are the keepers of the keys. Each has an allotted number of free tickets that they can distribute. This year's pandemic-restricted number amounts to each lawmaker plus a guest. Commemorative tickets will be available for constituents after inauguration day. In recent years, incoming presidents have added some of the country's most beloved performers to the day's programme. Despite the pandemic, this year won't be any different. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga - an active supporter of the incoming president - who will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will sing during the ceremony's musical performance. After Mr Biden is sworn in, actor Tom Hanks will host 90-minutes of primetime television - a Covid-friendly replacement of celebrations typically held in-person. It will feature Garth Brooks, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake and will be broadcast across all major US networks and streaming platforms - with the exception of Fox News, a conservative network that has primarily supported Mr Trump during his presidency. Beyonce performed at both of Obama's inaugurations In 2009, Aretha Franklin sang at Barack Obama's inauguration, performing My Country 'Tis of Thee. BeyoncÃ© was also present, singing At Last to the first couple at Mr Obama's inaugural ball. At his second inauguration in 2013, President Obama called on Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to do the honours. BeyoncÃ© was back again, this time to sing the national anthem. Donald Trump reportedly had more trouble booking performers. Elton John declined Mr Trump's offer to perform, and reports circulated that Celine Dion, Kiss and Garth Brooks did the same. In the end, the Rockettes, country artist Lee Greenwood, and the band 3 Doors Down turned out for Mr Trump's day. Third time lucky: Biden's journey to White House.

Joe Biden replaces Trump as US president,"This video can not be played President Biden: ""Democracy is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed"" Joe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th US president, ending one of the most dramatic political transitions in American history. ""Democracy has prevailed,"" he said after taking the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts. Donald Trump - who has not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden - snubbed the inauguration ceremony, in a departure from longstanding precedent. The new president swiftly signed a raft of measuresreversing Trump policies. Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice-president ahead of Mr Biden. She is the first woman - and the first black and Asian-American person - to serve in the role, a heartbeat from the presidency. Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency What will Joe Biden do first? Kamala Harris becomes first female, first black VP Follow the latest updates The inauguration took place at the US Capitol. There is extra-tight security after the building was stormed by violent pro-Trump protesters in a deadly riot on 6 January. This video can not be played Kamala Harris was sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor Some 25,000 National Guards protected the ceremony, which missed the traditional hundreds of thousands of spectators because of the coronavirus pandemic. In hisinaugural address, Mr Biden said it was a day of ""history and hope"". ""My whole soul is in putting America back together again,"" he added. This video can not be played The new president took his oath of office with Chief Justice John G Roberts. Highlighting a message of unity after the turbulent Trump years, he promised to be a president ""for all Americans"" - including those who voted against him. Among those attending the ceremony were three of his predecessors: Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served for eight years as vice-president - Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Mr Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence. Full transcript of Biden inauguration speech Does Biden's new team better reflect America? A beginner's guide to being the vice-president The inauguration ceremony included musical performances by Lady Gaga - who sang the national anthem - as well as Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks. An evening concert at the Lincoln Memorial in the city will be hosted by Tom Hanks and will feature Bruce Springsteen, John Legend, JonÂ Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, and Demi Lovato. Lady Gaga gave her rendition of the Star Spangled Banner In the afternoon, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris visited Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia to pay their respects to US war dead. The new president's motorcade then left for the White House. He walked the last block with his family, and hugged his wife Jill before entering their new home. Mr Biden later told reporters that Mr Trump had written ""a very generous letter"" to him, adding: ""Because it was private, I won't talk about it until I talk to him."" Joe Biden knows he has a hard job ahead of him. In his inaugural address, he outlined the biggest challenges facing his presidency - a devastating pandemic, massive job losses, a threatened environment, urgent calls for racial justice and a resurgence of political extremism. Mr Biden didn't offer a laundry list of solutions. Those will come in policy addresses and announcements of executive action in the coming days or even hours. In his first address as president, he offered only an overarching prescription for the nation's ills. ""Unity is the path forward,"" he said. ""And we must meet this moment as the United States of America."" Standing on ground that was occupied two weeks ago by an angry mob supporting his predecessor, Mr Biden called for an end to what he termed an ""uncivil war"". Biden campaigned as a centrist capable of healing the nation's wounds. In the months since his victory, the breadth of the divisions in the US has only become more apparent. With his party in control of Congress, he will have an opportunity to enact an ambitious presidential agenda. Keeping the nation united while doing so would be a significant accomplishment. Read Anthony's full piece here Mr Trump was the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since 1869. He left the White House early on Wednesday, and flew to the nearby Andrews Air Force base. This video can not be played Trump leaves the White House for the last time as US president In his farewell address at the base, he highlighted what he regarded as the successes of his presidency. ""What we've done has been amazing by any standard,"" Mr Trump said. The 74-year-old then left for his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, where he arrived later in the morning. In his last hours as president,Mr Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people,external, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who had been facing fraud charges. Trump pardons Bannon in final acts of clemency How will history remember Trump? This video can not be played Trump: ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success"" The political drama surrounding Mr Trump is far from over. The US Senate is expected to put him on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives for allegedly inciting the Capitol riot. On Tuesday, the Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said the mob had been provoked by Mr Trump and fed lies. The new president set to work straight after the inauguration. He signed executive orders aiming to: Reverse Mr Trump's withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate accord Revoke the presidential permit granted tothe Keystone XL Pipeline, which is opposed by environmentalists and Native American groups Revoke Trump policies on immigration enforcement and the emergency declaration that helped fund the construction of a Mexican border wall Bring about a mask and distancing mandate for federal employees and in federal buildings, and a new White House office on coronavirus End a travel ban on visitors from some, mainly Muslim, nations Other orders cover race and gender equality. Vice-President Harris swore in three new Democratic senators on Wednesday, leaving the upper chamber of Congress evenly split between the two main parties. This will allow the vice-president to act as a tie-breaker in key votes. Mr Biden's legislative ambitions could be tempered by the slender majorities he holds in both the Senate and House of Representatives, however. Joe Biden takes the oath of office.

How will history remember Trump?,"At noon on Wednesday, President Donald Trump's term will end. It's been a whirlwind four years, so what might the legacy be of such a history-making president? There's a lot to consider, so we asked the experts to break it down for us. Responses have been edited for length and clarity. Matthew Continetti is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, focusing on the development of the Republican Party and the American conservative movement. What's Trump's key legacy? Donald Trump will be remembered as the first president to be impeached twice. He fed the myth that the election was stolen, summoned his supporters to Washington to protest the certification of the Electoral College vote, told them that only through strength could they take back their country, and stood by as they stormed the US Capitol and interfered in the operation of constitutional government. When historians write about his presidency, they will do so through the lens of the riot. They will focus on Trump's tortured relationship with the alt-right, his atrocious handling of the deadly Charlottesville protest in 2017, the rise in violent right-wing extremism during his tenure in office, and the viral spread of malevolent conspiracy theories that he encouraged. Trumpâs shock troops: Who are the âalt-rightâ? 'US far-right is furious at impeachment' What else stands out to you? If Donald Trump had followed the example of his predecessors and conceded power graciously and peacefully, he would have been remembered as a disruptive but consequential populist leader. A president who, before the pandemic, presided over an economic boom, re-oriented America's opinion of China, removed terrorist leaders from the battlefield, revamped the space program, secured an originalist (conservative) majority on the US Supreme Court, and authorised Operation Warp Speed to produce a Covid-19 vaccine in record time. Laura Belmonte is a history professor and dean of the Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. She is a foreign relations specialist and author of books on cultural diplomacy. What's Trump's key legacy? His attempt to surrender global leadership and replace it with a more inward-looking, fortress-like mentality. I don't think it succeeded, but the question is how profound has the damage to America's international reputation been - and that remains to be seen. The moment I found jaw-dropping was the press conference he had with Vladimir Putin in 2018 in Helsinki, where he took Putin's side over US intelligence in regard to Russian interference in the election. I can't think of another episode of a president siding full force with a non-democratic society adversary. It's also very emblematic of a larger assault on any number of multilateral institutions and treaties and frameworks that Trump has unleashed, like the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, the withdrawal of the Iranian nuclear framework. What else stands out to you? Trump's applauding Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, really turning himself inside out to align the US with regimes that are the antithesis of values that the US says it wants to promote. That is something that I think was really quite distinctive. Another aspect is extricating the US from any really assertive role in promoting human rights throughout the world, and changing the content of the annual human rights reports from the State Department and not including many topics, like LGBT equality, for instance. Melaniaâs jacket and nine other defining images Kathryn Brownell is a history professor at Purdue University, focusing on the relationships between media, politics, and popular culture, with an emphasis on the American presidency. What's Trump's key legacy? Broadly speaking: Donald Trump, and his enablers in the Republican Party and conservative media, have put American democracy to the test in an unprecedented way. As a historian who studies the intersection of media and the presidency, it is truly striking the ways in which he has convinced millions of people that his fabricated version of events is true. 'Three quarters of Trump voters believe he won' What happened on 6 January at the US Capitol is a culmination of over four years during which President Trump actively advanced misinformation. Just as Watergate and the impeachment inquiry dominated historical interpretations of Richard Nixon's legacy for decades, I do think that this particular post-election moment will be at the forefront of historical assessments of his presidency. What else stands out to you? Kellyanne Conway's first introduction of the notion of ""alternative facts"" just days into the Trump administration when disputing the size of the inaugural crowds between Trump and Barack Obama. Presidents across the 20th Century have increasingly used sophisticated measures to spin interpretation of policies and events in favourable ways and to control the media narrative of their administrations. But the assertion that the administration had a right to its own alternative facts went far beyond spin, ultimately foreshadowing the ways in which the Trump administration would govern by misinformation. Trump harnessed the power of social media and blurred the lines between entertainment and politics in ways that allowed him to bypass critics and connect directly to his supporters in an unfiltered way. Franklin Roosevelt, John F Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan also used new media and a celebrity style to connect directly to the people in this unfiltered way, ultimately transforming expectations and operations of the presidency that paved the path for Trump. Mary Frances Berry is a professor of American history and social thought at the University of Pennsylvania, focusing on legal history and social policy. From 1980 to 2004, she was a member of the US Commission on Civil Rights. What's Trump's key legacy? In what he did with judges, Trump has made a long lasting change over the next 20 years, 30 years in how policies will stand up to legal tests and how they're able to be implemented - no matter what any particular president or administration proposes. The courts are controlled by the Republican appointees. Sometimes judges surprise us, but for the most part, the historical evidence is that they pretty much do what their politics and their backgrounds say they will do. Trump applauds his newly sworn in Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett What else stands out to you? When he supported that package of measures that helped particular people in the black community,like First Step, pardoning people at the same time that he supported an amendment in the appropriations bill that gave a whole bunch of money to historically black colleges and universities for the first time. He put all of these things together, as well as having the first stimulus programme making sure that black businessman and entrepreneurs get some of those loans they've had trouble getting before. The effect of all of that, which we will see over time, was in the midterms, a lot more young black men voted for Trump than before. And if that's a trend, it may help the Republican party. Minority voters who changed their minds about Trump Trump also made egregious comments about black people and other people of colour, tried to have protests against police abuse disrupted and in other ways appealed to his white supremacist base. His lasting impact on race relations depends on what the Biden administration does on policy, and on healing and how long the pandemic and economic downturn lasts. Why are African Americans hit so hard by virus? Trump racism row: BBC audiences on being told to 'go home' Margaret O'Mara is history professor at the University of Washington, focusing on the political, economic, and metropolitan history of the modern US. What's Trump's key legacy? Contesting a very constitutionally and numerically clear election victory by Joe Biden. We've had plenty of really unpleasant transitions. Herbert Hoover was incredibly unpleasant about his loss, but he still rode in that car down Pennsylvania Avenue at inauguration. He didn't talk to Franklin Roosevelt the whole time, but there still was a peaceful transfer of power. Trump is a manifestation of political forces that have been in motion for a half century or more. A culmination of what was not only going on in the Republican party, but also the Democratic party and more broadly in American politics - a kind of disillusionment with government and institutions and expertise. What else stands out to you? Trump is exceptional in many ways, but one of the things that really makes him stand out is that he is one of the rare presidents who was elected without having held any elected office before. Trump may go away, but there is this great frustration with the establishment, broadly defined. When you feel powerless, you vote for someone who's promising to do everything differently and Trump indeed did that. A presidency is also made by the people that the president appoints, and a great deal of experienced Republican hands were not invited to join the administration the first go round. Over time, his administration has diminished to a band of loyalists who are really not very experienced and are ideologically uninterested in wise governance of the bureaucracy. What has happened within the bowels of the bureaucracy is going to be a slow slog to rebuild. Saikrishna Prakash is a University of Virginia Law School professor focusing on constitutional law, foreign relations law and presidential powers. What's Trump's key legacy? The last gasps of his administration are the most consequential, as he exerts a control over his most devoted followers and he's talking about running again. He forced people to consider what the presidency has become in a way that wasn't true I think either during the Bush or Obama administrations. Issues like the 25th Amendment and impeachment hasn't been thought of since Bill Clinton, really. It's possible that people now when they think of the presidency are perhaps going to adopt a different stance going forward, knowing that someone like Trump could come along. It's possible that Congress will delegate less to the president and take away some authority. What else stands out to you? The president has demonstrated that there's a constituency who's opposed to a lot of these trade deals and that there are people willing to vote for those who will either extricate us from these trade deals or ""make them fairer"". The president has also suggested that China has been taking advantage of the United States in ways that are deleterious to our economic and national security - and I think there's a consensus behind this view. No one wants to be accused of being soft on China, whereas no one cares if you're ""soft"" on Canada, right? I think people are going to fall all over themselves to be tougher or at least say they're tougher on China. Domestically the president had a populous tone to him. It wasn't ever fully realised in his policies, but we see more Republicans adopting populist ideas. The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy?

How the White House prepares for Trump's moving day,"The last vestiges of the Trump presidency will be swept away on Wednesday, as the Bidens move into the White House. Desks will have been cleared out, rooms scrubbed clean and the president's aides will be replaced by a new team of political appointees. It's part of the massive transformation that a new presidency brings to the heart of government. One evening last week, Stephen Miller, a policy adviser and central figure in the Trump White House, was lounging in the West Wing. Miller, who has crafted speeches and policies for the president since his early days in office, is also one of the few members of the president's initial team still with him at the end. Leaning against a wall and chatting with colleagues about a meeting scheduled for later that day, he seemed in no hurry to leave. The West Wing usually hums with activity but it seemed deserted. The phones were quiet. Desks in empty offices were cluttered with papers and unopened letters, as if people had left in a hurry and would not be coming back. Dozens of senior officials and aides quit in the wake of the Capitol riots on 6 January. A handful of loyalists, like Miller, remain. As the conversation began to wind down, he broke away from his colleagues. When I asked him where he was headed next, he smiled. ""Back to my office,"" he said and sauntered down the hall. On inauguration day, Miller's office will have been cleaned out, swept of signs that he and his colleagues had ever been there, ready for the Biden team to move in. The cleaning out of West Wing offices, and the transition between presidents, is part of a tradition that dates back centuries. It's a process that has not always been imbued with warmth. Another impeached president, Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, snubbed Republican Ulysses S Grant in 1869 and skipped the inauguration. Grant, who had backed Johnson's removal from office, was hardly surprised. Staff have started moving paperwork and pictures out of the White House This year, however, the transition stands out for its acrimony. The process usually starts straight after the election, but it started weeks late after Trump refused to accept the result. And the president has said he will not attend the inauguration. Most likely, he will instead travel to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Still, the handover is taking place, just as it has in the past. ""The system is holding,"" says Sean Wilentz, a professor of American history at Princeton University. ""It's very rocky, it's very bumpy, but nevertheless the transition is going to occur."" Even in the best of times, the logistics of a transition are daunting, involving the transfer of knowledge and employees on a massive scale. Stephen Miller is just one of 4,000 political appointees hired by the Trump administration who will lose their job and be replaced by individuals hired by Mr Biden. During an average transition, between 150,000-300,000 people apply for these jobs, according to the Center for Presidential Transition, a nonpartisan organisation based in Washington. About 1,100 of the positions also require Senate confirmation. Filling all of these positions takes months, even years. Four years of policy papers, briefing books and artefacts relating to the president's work will be carted off to the National Archives where they will be kept secret for 12 years, unless the president himself decides that portions may be released early. Will they wear masks? What you need to know about the inauguration Biden plans decree blitz to dump Trump policies On a weekday evening during Trump's last week in office, the door to the office of Kayleigh McEnany, the president's press secretary, was partly open. McEnany has been one of the president's most high-profile defenders. Impeccably groomed, she is a precise speaker who maintains her composure amidst chaos. Kayleigh McEnany has packed up her office in the White House Her office, too, was organised in a meticulous manner, even as she prepared to leave. A mirror stood on her desk, and several fireplace logs were wrapped in clear plastic and packed up. Generally, the last few days are ""controlled chaos,"" says Kate Andersen Brower, who has written a book about the White House, The Residence. Furniture in the White House, such as the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, most of the artwork, china and other objects, belong to the government and will remain on the premises. But other items, like photos of the president that hang in the hallway, will be taken down as the White House is transformed for its new occupants. Staffers are already moving some items out of the building. One White House staffer, a woman in sturdy heels, was lugging several images of First Lady Melania Trump out of the East Wing. The pictures are known as ""jumbos"" because of their extra-large size, she says, and they will be taken to the National Archives. The Trumps' personal belongings, such as clothes, jewellery, and other items will be moved to their new residence, most likely at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. And this year, the place will be deep cleaned. President Biden is expected to make decorative changes to the Oval Office The president, as well as Mr Miller and dozens of others at the White House, were infected with the coronavirus over the past several months, and the six-floor building, with its 132 rooms, will be thoroughly scrubbed down. Everything from handrails to elevator buttons to restroom fixtures will be wiped and sanitised, according to a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration, the federal agency that oversees the housekeeping effort. Incoming first families usually do some redecoration. Within days of arriving at the White House, Mr Trump had chosen a portrait of populist president Andrew Jackson for the Oval Office. He also replaced the drapes, couches and a rug in the office with ones that were gold-coloured. On inauguration day, Vice-President Pence and his wife will also make way for Kamala Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff. They will be settling into their official residence, a 19th Century residence on the Naval Observatory grounds, a couple of miles from the White House. Policy adviser Stephen Miller may have lingered in the West Wing, but others were ready to go. At the White House, people were lugging thick manila envelopes, framed photos and bags from a gift shop. ""It's my last day,"" says one man, smiling as he took a photo of his sons on the north lawn. A bulging backpack was slung over his shoulder. A group of National Security officials posed in front of the West Wing, asking me to take their picture. ""Make sure you get the marine guard,"" says one of the officials, referring to a marine who stands in front of the doorway when the president is in the Oval Office. The officials were in high spirits, joking and vamping for the camera. The political appointees at the White House were in a good mood for a reason. For weeks, they had been caught in an in-between world. Their boss was denying the validity of the election, but they knew that their days were numbered. Now they could plan openly for their future, and they seemed almost giddy. One political appointee, a man dressed in a dark suit, was already making plans. He ran into a colleague outside the Palm room, a reception area on the ground floor. ""See you on the flip side,"" he said, brightly. He was referring to the time after the inauguration, when they will both be out of their White House jobs. He mused about where they might meet again. ""Hopefully in the Greek isles or somewhere."" ""Oh, yes. That is for sure,"" said his colleague, laughing. They smacked a high-five and then parted ways.

Trump's final day fact-checked,"On leaving office as US president, President Trump has made a number of claims about his record. We've fact-checked some of things he said in a farewell speech at the Andrews Air Base in Maryland and in a video statement released by the White House. In his final public speech as president, he hailed his government's track record on the military. He's previously said it was depleted under former President Obama. It's true that Mr Trump's administration has increased the amount of military funding. Has Trump kept his promises on the military? However, the levels of spending are lower than what was spent on the military during Mr Obama's first administration (2009 to 2013), when using data adjusted for inflation. President Trump has also scaled back the number of troops in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. In his remarks at Andrews Air base, Mr Trump also said ""we have the greatest economy in the world"", and prior to the pandemic the numbers were ""at a level nobody had ever seen before"". The US economy had certainly done well under him prior to the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, but there have been periods under previous administrations when it did better. In his first three years in office, President Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%. This was slightly higher than the final three years of the Obama era. However, there have been many periods when the growth of GDP - the value of goods and services in the economy - was a lot higher. And in 2020, the economy saw the largest contraction on record because of the pandemic. It rebounded by 33% in the third quarter last year, itself a record for a quarterly increase, but this did not bring economic activity back to pre-pandemic levels. The economy under Trump in six charts President Trump also said: ""Now the stock market is actually substantially higher than it was at its higher point prior to the pandemic."" Although there have been recent wobbles, the stock market has bounced back to above pre-pandemic levels. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use for two Covid-19 vaccines - Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. The government's vaccine programme, Operation Warp Speed, did provide funding for the development of the Moderna vaccine. While Pfizer/BioNTech did sign a deal with the government to deliver doses, it didn't receive any money to do development or testing. And although Pfizer is a US firm, this particular vaccine was developed in conjunction with the German-based BioNTech company. It was their gene-based technology which was the key to making the vaccine. This needs context as it depends on how you define war. The US has formally enacted declarations of war against 11 countries in five separate conflicts. The last formal declaration of war was during World War II. Most of the time the US enters conflicts using the ""authorisation of military force"" granted by Congress to the president. For example, President George W Bush used this for the Iraq war in 2003. And President Obama sought Congressional approval to intervene in Syria after chemical weapons were used there. President Trump gave his final address late on Tuesday President Trump has engaged in military actions abroad using legislation passed by previous governments. In October 2019, he announced the killing of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a military operation, but said he decided not to notify Democrat leaders in Congress beforehand. In January 2020, President Trump ordered an airstrike which killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.  The White House cited Congress's ""authorisation of military force"" granted under the Bush administration as its legal basis. The Trump administration has alsoincreased US drone strikes in Somalia. Building a wall along the southern border with Mexico was one of his major pledges in the run-up to the 2016 election. As of 4 January 2021, a total of 452 miles (757km) of barrier has been built since he took office. However, the vast majority of this new wall replaced existing structures on the border. Trump's wall: How much has been built during his term? Only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there was none before. Of this 47 miles is what's called primary wall, and 33 miles is secondary wall that reinforces the initial barrier. President-elect Joe Biden said he would not build ""another foot"" of the wall. The African American unemployment rate hit 5.2% in August 2019, and the Hispanic rate hit 4% in September 2019. These were the lowest rates recorded since the US Labor Department started collecting these statistics in the 1970s. The unemployment rate has recently spiked significantly for both groups because of the huge impact of the pandemic on the US economy. What has Trump done for black jobs and poverty? And this has disproportionately affected African Americans and Hispanic Americans - their unemployment rates are 3.2 and 2.6 percentage points higher respectively than the overall figure. Asian American unemployment is currently 5.9%. It reached a record low of 2.1% in June 2019, but these records only date back to 2003. VA Choice is a government programme which offers better quality health care to ex-military members in the US. President Trump didn't pass this programme - it was created in 2014 under President Obama - but he did expand it. In June 2018, President Trump signed a law that reformed VA Choice, expanding the eligibility requirements for veterans to access private health care.

"Military to assist NI hospitals in Covid-19 fightThe health minister asks the Ministry of Defence to help out, primarily at a number of hospitals.Northern Ireland","More than 100 medically-trained military personnel will be deployed Members of the military are to be brought in to help medical staff in Northern Ireland in the fight against Covid-19. Health Minister Robin Swann has asked the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to help out, primarily at a number of hospitals across NI. More than 100 medically-trained military personnel will be deployed. Those brought in will assist nursing staff and help on the wards in a move designed to ease the pressure on staff. In the past, the use of the military in Northern Ireland has provoked controversy. While military help has already been used during the pandemic to transport equipment and patients, this is the first time military staff will be used in hospitals. It is thought the first military staff will be made available as early as next week. Mr Swann said it would have been an abdication of responsibility if he did not avail of help from the military. He said while coronavirus cases were lower than two weeks ago, the challenge posed remained ""intense"" and intensive care pressures were expected to increase further in the next eight to 10 days.

He confirmed that a request for military assistance for NI's health service had been accepted by the MoD. The health minister thanked the MoD for the Military Aid to the Civil Authorities agreement, which is being provided in other UK regions. ""The armed forces have provided invaluable support in this pandemic, including aeromedical evacuation, real-estate and ongoing logistical planning,"" he said. ""Our hospitals are under immense pressure and an additional staffing complement will be very welcome on the front line. ""This is a health decision and I am confident it will be supported on that basis."" NI Secretary Brandon Lewistweeted,external: ""Battling #COVID19 is a national effort. I'm pleased that 110 medically-trained personnel from our Armed Forces will support health and social care teams across Northern Ireland in their vital work on the frontline against coronavirus."" The move has been welcomed by the Democratic Unionist Party. When it was announcedlast April that the health minster had made requests for military help,Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said Mr Swann had taken that decision unilaterally. However, she later said her party would not rule out any measure necessary to save lives. Reacting to the latest request for help, Sinn FÃ©in said its priority throughout the pandemic had been to save lives, keep people safe and protect the health service. ""The Minister of Health has made a request for staffing support from the British Ministry of Defence,"" the party said. ""We do not rule out any measures to do so, and any effort to make the threat posed by Covid-19 into a green and orange issue is divisive and a distraction."" As of Wednesday, there were 832 people in hospital in Northern Ireland with coronavirus, of whom 67 were in intensive care, with 57 ventilated. A further 22 people with coronavirus died, bringing the Department of Health's total to 1,671 while there were 905 new cases. In the Republic of Ireland, 61 new Covid-19-related deaths were recorded on Wednesday, bringing the country's death toll to 2,768. A further 2,488 new cases of the virus were also confirmed by the Irish Department for Health. Speaking at Stormont's press briefing on Wednesday, Mr Swann confirmed the executive would review the current lockdown regulations on Thursday. Northern Ireland began a six-week lockdown on 26 December, in a bid to bring the virus under control. Ministers promised to review the regulations after four weeks. Mr Swann said he would not pre-empt the outcome of Thursday's meeting but confirmed he would bring recommendations from his officials to the meeting. ""This is not the time to open floodgates or take premature decisions that would lead to another spike in cases,"" he added. ""We must stay the course."" What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? Is Northern Ireland winning the Covid-19 battle? The minister also provided the latest update on the number of vaccinations - 160,396 doses have now been administered in NI, with 21,690 of those second doses. He said he understood the frustration of some people that they were still waiting to hear when their elderly or vulnerable relatives would receive their vaccine, but he urged patience. ""We cannot go faster than supplies allow,"" he said.

Edwin Poots reveals cancer diagnosisThe minister tells the Nolan Show there is a risk the disease could spread because of surgery delays.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots spoke to the Nolan Show Stormont minister Edwin Poots has been diagnosed with a cancerous growth on his kidney and fears it could spread because of surgery delays. He told the BBC's Stephen Nolan the prognosis is good but he needs surgery. The cancer was discovered whenhe was in hospital in December for emergency surgeryto remove his appendix. He said the announcement that all urgent cancer surgery was being cancelled due to coronavirus pressures ""came as an awful blow"". ""It is absolutely doubtless that there were will be excess deaths,"" the DUP agriculture minister said. Mr Poots, who is currently on a waiting list for cancer surgery, said his political ideology had always been against private healthcare, but he is now contemplating having a private operation. ""I would never have taken out private health insurance because I have always believed that what is good enough for the public is good enough for me as a public representative,"" he told the Nolan Show. ""But whenever I need it, it is not here to help me because it is totally absorbed in dealing with Covid-19 and that's hugely disappointing at a personal level."" Mr Poots added he had not yet made a decision on paying for his surgery, but would give it ""serious consideration"". ""If I have to spend Â£10,000 or Â£15,000 - I don't know how much it would be to be honest - if I have to spent that, I will do, because it is better to have something out of you that has the potential to take your life than carry on,"" he told the programme. ""Some people may criticise me for that but I'm not going to give up my life for a political ideology."" The 55-year-old added: ""Why would you let it spread to another organ, or let it grow, if you know the problem exists? ""My prognosis is good. I don't need chemotherapy. I don't need radio therapy. I need an operation."" Edwin Poots recovering after emergency surgery Poots opposes restrictions in email I did not link Covid spread to religion - Poots The former health minister said he did not regret previously calling for some of the coronavirus restrictions to be lifted, despite health chiefs warning they were needed to protect the NHS. He said he argued strongly that the executive needed to get tough on people who he described as ""superspreaders"" who ignored the law. Mr Poots said his Christian faith was helping him deal with his diagnosis The assembly member for Lagan Valley said doctors believed he would need six weeks' recovery time. Mr Poots, who had emergency surgery to remove his appendix in December, said he would be keen to get back to work as soon as possible. ""After my previous surgery, I got my iPad sent down to my hospital bed and got straight into my work again. I would get bored laying about,"" he said. ""I'll make that call with my party leader as to whether it is wise for me to carry on at that stage or whether I need to step back for a period of time. That's a judgment call I will make closer to the time."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said on Twitter that she had spoken to Mr Poots after he received his diagnosis. The first minister added she was reassured by the support for her party colleague from across the political spectrum. ""He has great determination & is sustained by a loving wife, family & great faith,"" she tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile HMRC is failing ""to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming"" support, the Public Accounts Committee says. The government said its ""top priority"" was helping those who are struggling. Since March, HM Revenue and Customs has provided more than Â£80bn in support to companies and individuals through government coronavirus support schemes, the committee says. They are also supporting the incomes of many of the self-employed. Despite this,a report from the MPs,externalsays ""quirks in the tax system"" have meant that workers who recently moved onto company payrolls or work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between - have been ineligible for furlough payments.

Indigenous communities in the Brazilian city of Manaus have started receiving vaccinations In recent days, we're been reporting stories of desperate oxygen shortages and over-run hospitals in Manaus in Brazil's Amazonas state. In the latest news from the city, some residents are queuing for up to 12 hours to buy their own oxygen tanks because of reports of high death rates in hospitals. ""Everyone here has a family member being treated at home. They prefer that to leaving them to die in the hospitals,"" one resident told AFP news agency. Brazil has been hit badly by Covid-19, with more than 211,000 deaths so far (the second highest in the world) and political discord over how to manage the crisis. But on Tuesday there was some good news for the county's badly-affected indigenous communities. Around 1,000 doses of the Chinese coronavirus vaccine are being flown deep into the Amazon rainforest along with military personnel to reach remote groups who are sometimes days away from medical clinics. Infections across the entire Americas region are currently extremely high, warns the World Health Organization's regional director. Carissa Ettiene said the rise in cases in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and the United States was a worrying sign that the region was failing to control the pandemic - last week the region registered more than half the world's new infections. Dr Ettiene suggested that new variants detected in Britain, South Africa and Brazil could be responsible.  Top-ranked Djokovic arrived in Australia last week ahead of the major We've been following the plight of 72 Australian Open tennis players confined to Melbourne hotel rooms after arriving on a plane that was also carrying covid infected passengers. World number one Novak Djokovic had made some demands for these players which were turned down by the government and today he insists he was not being ""selfish, difficult and ungrateful"". Djokovic is part of a group of top players enjoying better conditions while quarantining in Adelaide, but the 33-year-old said he had felt obliged to use his ""hard-earned"" privileges to make suggestions to tournament director Craig Tiley on how to improve conditions for players in Melbourne. In a long social media post, Djokovic wrote: ""I've earned my privileges the hard way and for that reason it is very difficult for me to be a mere onlooker knowing how much every help, gesture and good word mattered to me when I was small and insignificant in the world pecking order."" There have beencomplaints about miceat one quarantine hotel. A further 13,800 people have had their first vaccine in the past day in Wales, figures show There will be no ""significant easing"" of Wales' Covid restrictions when the guidelines are reviewed later this month, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has warned. He said in a Welsh Government briefing that while it was ""good news"" that case rates were falling, they still remain high. The NHS remains ""under pressure"", with critical care services operating at 150% of capacity, added Mr Gething. Mr Gething made the comments as he was outlining the current situation with Covid in Wales, but he said he did not want to prejudge a Welsh Government decision on the review. Wales has been in a level four lockdown since before Christmas, with a decision on a review of the current restrictions expected by 29 January. Read more here. Daily confirmed coronavirus cases are starting to fall overall - although they were higher today than on Tuesday. Today there were new 38,905 cases compared with more than 60,000 per day in early January. However daily deaths are increasing and the prime minister says there will be ""more to come"". The UK recorded a new daily high of 1,820 deaths. At the currrent rate of progress, the government would need to increase the rate of vaccination to meet the goal of 15m people by 15 February. Freelance TV and film sound editor Louise Burton isone of those who are unable to benefit from government pandemic support schemes, despite being out of work. Louise, 28, of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, has not had any financial assistance since her last job ended eight months ago. Louise fell foul of tax rules relating to self-employed people
and could not go on furlough, because the company that had employed her no
longer existed - with companies often created solely for the production of a film and then closed once it is completed. While she says she still has a roof over her head and can âjust
about put food on the tableâ, things are ânot easy"" and she fears for her
prospects in the next 12 months. According to MPs,external, whole
groups of people like Louise are falling through the cracks of Covid-19 support
schemes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned ""there will be more to come"", when asked about the record number of Covid-19 deaths recorded today. He said: ""These figures are appalling, and of course we think of the suffering that each one of those deaths represents to their families and to their friends. ""I've got to tell you... there will be more to come because what we're seeing is the result of the wave of the new variant that we saw just before Christmas on December 18, or thereabouts."" He said it had been ""a very big peak of infection"" which has ""spread very quickly"", not just where it started in London and the South East but now across the UK. Mr Johnson added: ""It's true that it looks as though the rates of infection in the country overall may now be peaking or flattening but they're not flattening very fast and it's clear that we must keep a grip on this. ""We must maintain discipline, formation, keep observing the lockdown."" John and Susan Docherty died within nine days of each other A woman whose parents died with Covid-19 within days of each other is urging people to take the virus seriously. Katie Tong's mum Susan Docherty 62, and her husband John, 65, died in November 2020. Mrs Docherty had suffered with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and retired taxi driver Mr Docherty had asthma. Both moved to Shrewsbury from Scotland 17 years ago. Mrs Tong was allowed to be in hospital with her mother for her final hours, but had to say goodbye to her father via a video call on 22 November. ""I am heartbroken because he died without his family and loved ones around him,"" she says. ""I have lost two people I loved dearly due to Covid-19. Covid-19 killed them. ""Please take this seriously. I've lost my mum and dad, but this could happen to anyone."" Read the full storyhere. In case you missed Prime Minister's Questions earlier here are some of the key moments. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the prime minister had not closed the borders to slow the spread of the virus in March, aftera recording emerged of Home Secretary Priti Patel saying she had been an ""advocate"" of such a move. This video can not be played And after being asked to commit to an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, Boris Johnson said the NHS was under ""unprecedented pressure"" and the idea that state resources should be used for an inquiry ""in the middle of the pandemic does not, I think, seem sensible to me"". This video can not be played You can catch up with everything that happened at PMQshere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Detailed
analysis of coronavirus samples has revealedhow and when the virus got into the country. The UKâs
epidemic was largely started by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in
early-to-mid-March and France in mid-to-late-March. China, where
the pandemic started, had a negligible impact. Completely
shutting the borders in March could have prevented some of those cases from
Spain and France coming in and sparking more outbreaks. But it is clear
the virus was here and spreading by that point. So the best
case scenario is it could have bought a bit of time, which begs the question: âTime to do what?â You have to
view border control as only one part of the governmentâs overall strategy. New Zealand,
which has faced minimal disruption from Covid, used its closed borders
alongside lockdown to go for a âzero-Covid strategyâ, which has never been on
the cards in the UK. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under half of the 1,820 deaths reported in the UK today happened yesterday. A further quarter occurred on Monday or Sunday. So there are some old deaths in here (about 8% happened more than a week ago), but the rise to 1,820 reflects a genuine rise in the number of people dying. Deaths that are reported today are likely to reflect infections that happened around Christmas time, so we are likely to see deaths continue to rise for some time yet, since cases continued to rise after Christmas. So when, roughly, did the deaths reported today happen?  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is the second consecutive daydeaths have hit a new high. That, unfortunately, was to be expected as it is a reflection of the surge in cases seen during December. It takes a week or two from the point of infection for someone to become seriously ill â and they can then spend some time fighting for their life. The high number is also a result of delays reporting deaths â a quarter of those reported today happened last week or even before. But make no mistake: the death toll is going up. If you look at the average over the course of a week, the numbers being reported at the moment are twice what they were just two weeks ago. However, we also know they should soon start coming down. The number of daily infections are falling, with signs lockdown is taking effect. For four days in a row new diagnoses have been below 40,000, after averaging 60,000 at the start of the year. It could be another week or so before we start to see the impact of that in the death figures. The hope then would be that, within a few weeks, we could start seeing a more rapid fall as the impact of the vaccination programme begins to bite. But before that happens, the daily totals reported could - sadly - go even higher. A former Royal Marine who fought in Afghanistan saidhome-schooling in the first lockdown last year pushed him to ""breaking point"". Mark Ormrod, from Plymouth, reminded parents it is ""normal"" to struggle. He described working for a veterans' charity while teaching two of his children as ""traumatic"", adding: ""I was going to bed each night drained and wiped out."" Mr Ormrod, who lost both legs and an arm when he stepped on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2007, said he was ""caught off guard"" when schools closed to most children. ""Sometimes I'd go three or four days without putting my legs on, and even getting out of my pyjamas didn't seem worth it because my workload was mounting up and I had to stick to the teaching schedule,"" he said. The father-of-three, who is classed as a key worker along with his partner, has been able to send their children back to school in the latest lockdown. Every time the coronavirus passes from person to person it picks up tiny changes to its genetic code, but scientists are starting to notice patterns in how the virus is mutating. Nearly a year after the global Covid-19 pandemic started, the issue of mutations looms large, with new variants capable of a faster spread emerging, leading to questions about whether they will make the newly-approved vaccines less effective. Virologists are trying to learn as much as possible about these variations, and how to neutralise them, with Michael Worobey, a viral evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, saying in the future the world could ""be in an arms race with this virus"". Our friends at BBC Future have told the full storyhere. Israel is currently in its third lockdown since the pandemic began there last year A nationwide lockdown in Israel is to be extended until the end of the month amid a spike in cases - despite an intense vaccination campaign, with more than two of the nine million population already having received their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It takes time for immunity to build
up, so its expected to take several weeks for vaccines to have an impact
on cases The man coordinating Israelâs pandemic
response, Nachman Ash, has warned that a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine in the country has been âless effective than we thoughtâ. According to Israeli Army Radio, Prof Ash told cabinet
members on Tuesday the data on the protective effect of a first dose against
the virus was âlower than Pfizer presentedâ. Pfizer saidits vaccine was roughly 52% effective two weeks after the first dose,externaland reaches
maximum efficacy of 95% after the second. Itâs not clear what data he is
referring to, but a not-yet published study from Israelâs largest healthcare
provider suggested a 33% fall in infections by day 14, at which point, full
immunity would not have been reached. Infections continued to fall in the
following days but the numbers were too small to put a percentage on it. Israel saw its highest daily case figure on Monday with 10,000 new infections The health ministry said on Tuesdaymore than 12,400 Israelis had tested positive for Covid-19 ten days after being vaccinated,externalâ 69 of these had already received a second dose. This was 6.6% of the 189,000 people who took Covid tests after being vaccinated, roughly tallying with the reported efficacy. Health experts say they are analysing the new Israeli data closely but warn it may be too early to draw any conclusions on the single dose efficacy of the vaccine based on the initial data gathered in Israel, which began vaccinating its population on 19 December. Members of the military are to be brought in to help medical staff in Northern Ireland in the fight against Covid-19. Some 100 medically-trained military staff are expected to be deployed in hospitals to ease the pressure on staff. It is thought the first military staff could be made available as early as next week, after Northern Irelandâs Health Minister Robin Swann made a request to the Ministry of Defence. While military help has already been used during the pandemic to transport equipment and patients, this is the first time military staff will be used in hospitals in Northern Ireland. Read more here. The Ministry of Justice could open courts in England and Wales for longer to help clear the backlog of cases built up during the pandemic, a justice minister said. Chris Philp told MPs that 20,000 remote hearings a week are now taking place and said ""we are adding more courtrooms, further increasing remote hearings and examining options for longer operating hours"". Labour shadow justice secretary David Lammy said victims were ""being denied the speedy justice that our society owes them"", with estimates showing the current backlog would ""take 10 years to clear at pre-pandemic rates"". He added the government's cuts to the justice system since 2010 have played a part in the current backlog. The comments come after criminal justice watchdogs warnedthe issues caused by the pandemic could damage the system for years. A further 1,820 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now 93,290. Yesterday's figure of 1,610 deaths was the previous highest daily total. Another 38,905 positive Covid cases have also been reported in the past 24 hours. Reality Check South Africa has had more than a third of all the Covid-19 cases in Africa and numbers are surging with the emergence of a new variant of the virus. But unlike some other badly hit countries in the world, South Africa, which has a population of 59.6 million, is yet to start its vaccination programme. President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa has so far secured twenty million doses, due to be delivered in the first half of 2021, but there's no detailed timeline for a programme. The country expects to acquire doses from several sources. There's been concern that many poorer countries are being left behind in the global competition to secure vaccine supplies - but as the continent's richest nation, critics suggest South Africa should not be in this position.

"UK records new daily high of 1,820 Covid deaths","Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned there will be ""tough weeks to come"" as the UK reported another all-time high of daily coronavirus deaths. A further 1,820 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test,according to government figures,external. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now 93,290. Mr Johnson said there was now a ""race against time"" to vaccinate the vulnerable but he hoped there would be a ""real difference"" by spring. In an interview with broadcasters, he said the high number of deaths was ""appalling"" and a reflection of the peak infection rates seen a couple of weeks ago. He said: ""I must warn people there will be tough weeks to come, but as the vaccine goes in and that programme accelerates, there will be, I think, a real difference by spring."" 'How do you prepare for people dying and dying?' How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Patel: UK should have closed borders in March 2020 Just under half of the newly reported deaths occurred on Tuesday, while a further quarter took place on Monday or Sunday with the remainder last week or even earlier. The previous highest number of daily deaths was the1,610 reported on Tuesday. Some 4,609,740 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine - a rise of 343,163 from yesterday. There were also a further 38,905 cases, with 3,887 more patients admitted into hospital. It is the second consecutive day deaths have hit a new high. That, sadly, was to be expected as it is a reflection of the surge in cases seen during December. It takes a week or two from the point of infection for someone to become seriously ill - and they can then spend some time in hospital.

The hope then would be that within a few weeks we could start seeing a more rapid fall as the impact of the vaccination programme begins to bite. But before that happens the daily totals reported could, sadly, go even higher. New coronavirus cases are down by 21.5% over the last seven days. But the number of patients being admitted into hospital in the same period has not yet fallen (up by 0.5%). The prime minister said it looked as though infection rates across the country overall might now be peaking or flattening, but he cautioned that ""they're not flattening very fast"". Asked if daily deaths would continue to rise, he said it was ""difficult to predict"". He added: ""We must hope that by getting the numbers of daily infections down in the way that perhaps has been happening since the lockdown that will feed through into a reduction in deaths as well. ""But I must stress that we have tough weeks to come now as we roll out the vaccine. ""The light will only really begin to dawn as we get those vaccination numbers up."" Earlier, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told Sky News: ""This is very, very bad at the moment, with enormous pressure, and in some cases it looks like a war zone in terms of the things that people are having to deal with."" He said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the form of the vaccination programme. But he said vaccines were ""not going to do the heavy lifting for us at the moment, anywhere near it"". Military personnel are going to be deployed to a number of hospitals to help staff cope with high numbers of cases, including inNorthern IrelandandExeter.

TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? In other developments, Home Secretary Priti Patel saidministers were working to ensure police and other frontline workers were moved up the priority list for the Covid vaccine. Mr Johnson said the government must rely on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, but wanted front-line workers to be immunised ""as soon as possible"". He also said the vaccination programme remained ""on track"" despite ""constraints on supply"". RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE UK:Mama Ru's back with 12 fabulous drag queens. Who gets the crown?

What kind of vice-president will Harris be?,"Kamala Harris spent her first morning as vice-president at a prayer service with the president Kamala Harris has made history, becoming the first woman and first black and South Asian American to serve as US vice-president. So what does the job involve? And what did Ms Harris do first? Historically speaking, not a lot. It has been described as the least understood, most ridiculed and most often ignored constitutional role in the federal government, and for a long time it stayed that way. ""The role of the vice-president was, frankly, to just be that heartbeat away from the president,"" said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Centre. Unless the president died, or was seriously ill, the vice-president's job was largely to sit around and wait. For some vice-presidents, the dynamic meant holding a job you hoped would never be needed. ""One of the vice-presidents in the early 20th Century said, 'Every day I ring the doorbell at the White House and hope the president will answer,'"" Ms Perry said. That's not a role to take lightly. Nine of the country's 45 presidents has left office before the end of their term, eight by death - about one fifth of all presidents - giving their vice-presidents a sudden promotion. At 78 years old, Mr Biden is the oldest president to assume the office, putting added stress on his next-in-line. It wasn't until the 1970s, under President Jimmy Carter, that the vice-president began to assume a bigger role. Mr Carter, a former Georgia governor, had built his candidacy around being a political outsider. ""He knew he didn't know Washington,"" Ms Perry said. So when he won the nomination, he called on Walter Mondale, a long-time US senator, to show him the ropes and be a ""true governing partner"". The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in The first 'second dude' in the White House While their close relationship was new, their strategic match followed a well-worn pattern of vice-presidents offering geographical or ideological balance to the president. The practice has continued on most recent political tickets. Barack Obama, then a relative political newcomer, tapped Joe Biden, a 35-year veteran of the US Senate. Donald Trump went with Mike Pence, whose evangelical bona fides were thought to smooth over Mr Trump's image for the religious right. And Ms Harris offers a counter to Joe Biden's age, gender and race. What's more, this time the ceremonial role held by the vice-president as president of the Senate will prove crucial for Ms Harris' party. There is currently a 50-50 seat split between Democrats and Republicans in the upper chamber, and Ms Harris will cast the deciding ballot in any tie. As she walked along Pennsylvania Avenue with her family in the inauguration parade, Vice-President Harris knew her ceremonial tasks were over. ""I'm just walking to work,"" she said. Moments later she was entering the White House, her new workplace, to join her new boss in tackling some pretty daunting challenges. She has reportedly been in all the key meetings during the transition, helping to shape the Biden agenda, so would have had major input on the 15 executive orders he signed on Wednesday. It wasn't long after arriving at the White House that she was off to the Senate, over which she now presides in her new job. There she swore in three new senators, and gave a chuckle as she read out her own resignation. This video can not be played ""That was very weird"" - Kamala Harris reads her own resignation certificate before swearing in new senators She has not yet moved into the vice-presidential residence, so spent the night in her current address. On Thursday morning she watched the virtual inaugural prayer service and received a daily intelligence briefing. Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will set up home in a different white house - a 19th Century mansion on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory in north-west Washington. Vice-presidents live in a white house, too The estate is close to the White House grounds, where Ms Harris will have her office, and not far from Georgetown University's law school, where Mr Emhoff, an attorney, is set to teach. To get around, Ms Harris and Mr Emhoff will also have access to Air Force Two, a Boeing 757, and they will have round-the-clock security. While Mr Biden and Mr Obama often put their bromance on display during their time in the White House, close personal relationships between presidents and vice-presidents have not been the norm, Ms Perry said. President Barack Obama and Vice-president Biden shared a famously friendly relationship But since Mr Biden officially brought on Ms Harris this summer, it has seemed to be smooth sailing, Ms Perry said. Mr Biden has said ""there's not a single decision I've made yet"" about his administration that he hasn't consulted with Ms Harris on first. She has also interviewed each of Biden's potential cabinet nominees. A friendly relationship makes sense between the two, considering it was Ms Harris' close relationship with Mr Biden's son, Beau - who died of brain cancer in 2015 - that reportedly sealed the deal for Mr Biden. It's a surprise to some who remember Ms Harris' sharp debate-stage attacks aimed directly at Mr Biden when they were both competing for the Democratic nomination. ""Biden clearly lets bygones be bygones,"" Ms Perry said. Mr Biden is likely to model Ms Harris' role after his own time as vice-president. When he introduced her as his running mate at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, he recalled the time he was chosen for the same job by Barack Obama in 2008. Mr Obama asked what Mr Biden wanted from the role. ""I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions,"" Mr Biden said. ""That's what I asked Kamala. I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room. To always tell me the truth."" Ms Harris joined Mr Biden's team as a political star in her own right. Though her own presidential bid failed to find its focus and sputtered to an early halt, it earned her a devoted fan following (they call themselves the #KHive). And despite continued criticism from the left wing of her party, Ms Harris had one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate, pursuing progressive causes like gay rights, immigration, legalisation of marijuana and gun control. She also has an extensive legal rÃ©sumÃ©, having served as California's top lawyer before her Senate bid. Her legal experience and advocacy for police reform will be useful in a White House that has promised to address ""systemic"" misconduct in US police forces. This summer, amid a wave of Black Lives Matters protests, Ms Harris was a vocal supporter of the demonstrations and called for a ""reimagining"" of US policing. But as a vice-presidential ""first"" three times over, she will enter office shouldering heavy expectations. ""While I may be the first woman in this office,"" Ms Harris is fond of saying, ""I will not be the last."" The historic moment for black Americans is worth celebrating, said Jennifer Edwards, senior director at racial justice organisation Color of Change. ""But we learned time and time again that representation alone doesn't lead to transformative change."" ""Hundreds of thousands of black women have fought, organised and voted to reach this moment. Now, Vice-President Kamala Harris has a responsibility to represent demands of the people who ushered her into office,"" she said. Ms Edwards said she will be looking for progress in Covid-19 economic relief, on criminal justice and voting and election reform. As the more left-wing half of the political partnership, Ms Harris may face blame for perceived shortfalls here, and elsewhere in their progressive agenda. And reports that Mr Biden will not seek re-election will mean a balancing act for Ms Harris - how to remain a loyal aide to Mr Biden while also plotting her own run. Firstly, it's crucial that the American public see the vice-president as competent, and able to take the reins as commander-in-chief at any moment. Vice-President Dan Quayle never lived down his spelling mistake This has not always been the case. President George Bush's deputy, Dan Quayle, for example, was ""not viewed as the brightest bulb in the drawer,"" Ms Perry said. The impression was cemented during a visit to an elementary school. A student was called upon to write a word, 'potato', on the chalkboard. ""The student wrote 'potato' as it was correctly spelled,'"" Ms Perry said. But Vice-President Quayle chipped in, saying the word needed an E at the end. A vice-president should also avoid getting on their boss's bad side. Soon after his 1828 election, President Andrew Jackson developed a deep dislike of Vice-President John Calhoun. The two differed on policy and on Washington's social scene. The antipathy between the two grew so intense that Mr Calhoun became the first vice-president in US history to resign. Still, the title for worst vice-presidential mistake probably rests with the country's third, Aaron Burr. While in office, Mr Burr shot and killed his rival, American founding father Alexander Hamilton, in a duel. But while it ruined his reputation, Mr Burr still completed his term, sheltered from prosecution.

Teachers to decide Welsh pupils' end-of-year grades,"Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she had no choice but to scrap the classroom assessments that were to replace exams Teachers are set to decide GCSE, AS and A-level grades in Wales after a system replacing end-of-year exams was axed. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the pandemic had left her ""no choice"" in scrapping the classroom assessments. Grades determined by schools and colleges based on the work covered would be ""simple and clear"", she said. Exams were cancelled in favour of assessments in November, but these were also ditched whenschools were told to close until February half term. Advice from the Design and Delivery Group of school and college leaders said grades should be based on ""evidence of learning"". The approach is similar to the so-called 'Centre Assessed Grades' given to students in the summer of 2020 when the Covid-19 crisis affected end-of-year assessments. 'I don't want exams to go ahead next year' Online education 'patchy and inconsistent' Plea to end remote teaching 'postcode lottery' The new measures include: Schools and colleges will be able to use a range of evidence to determine the grades to be awarded to their learners, including coursework and mocks. The WJEC exam board will also offer a set of adapted past papers to enable schools to carry on assessing their pupils Schools and colleges can access an assessment framework set by Qualifications Wales to help set grades and their plans will be quality assured by WJEC Deadlines for coursework or ""non-exam assessment"" are being removed and will not be moderated by WJEC WJEC will publish guidance and oversee schools and colleges' internal quality assurance processes and will have a role in quality assuring their implementation. Teachers and lecturers will be offered training so they are applied ""consistently, equitably, and fairly"" The grades are then submitted to the WJEC who will not change them. Appeals about grades will go to a school or college Learners in Year 12 will also be awarded a ""Centre Determined"" grade but it won't contribute to the final A level. It won't apply to Year 10 unit assessments, but will apply if they are finishing a qualification Ms Williams said in November that end-of-year exams would be cancelled because the varying impact of Covid-19 on different schools and pupils meant it was not possible to ensure a level playing field. A new system based on a mix of assessments was put in place, drawn up by an exams advisory group made up of school and college leaders. However, when it was announced schools and colleges would stay closed for most pupils until at least 29 January, and probably until after February half-term, the advisory group was asked to look again at how assessments should be carried out. Ms Williams said: ""The worsening situation with the pandemic has meant we have no choice but to revisit our approach to ensure wellbeing and public confidence in our qualifications system. ""The proposals we are announcing today puts trust in teachers' and lecturers' knowledge of their learners' work, as well as their commitment to prioritise teaching and learning in the time available to support learners' progression."" She said they were working with universities to see how they can ""provide a bridge into courses"". ""Teaching the core content and aspects of each course remains my absolute priority for learners in exam years, so they are supported to progress with certainty into their next steps, with confidence in their grades"", she added. WJEC chief executive Ian Morgan, said that after an ""exceptional year"" there needs to be a different approach to assessment in 2021. ""Our teams will work at pace to develop a package of guidance for our teachers, including adapted past papers, mark schemes, and a range of support materials. We will also work with the Design and Delivery Advisory Group to develop a quality assurance process to support schools and college,"" he said. A-level student Carys said clarity was needed In England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said grades would be decided by schools and colleges but pupils could be asked to sit mini-exams to help teachers with their assessments. Carys, an A-level student from Ysgol Bro Edern in Cardiff, said before the announcement she wished students had been given a clearer picture about what they would be facing. ""It has been very confusing for us,"" she said. ""I feel like we're all asking the teachers what's happening, what's going on, and they're just as much as in the dark as we are."" Carys said she and her friends had struggled to see how the external assessments would be different to their cancelled exams. ""It is causing a large concern to us all and we're not quite sure what we're aiming towards,"" she said. ""I just want all our hard work to be credited."" ""I know many pupils who have been off school for weeks, or months even,"" says GCSE pupil Betsy Betsy, a GCSE pupil also at Ysgol Bro Edern, said she felt the fairest way to grade pupils this year was to let teachers decide on grades. ""It has been very challenging,"" she said. ""I know many pupils who have been off school for weeks, or months even."" ""I feel like the most fair way to do this is to just collect loads of coursework and trust the teachers to give us predicted grades,"" she said. ""They know the effort we've put in through the lockdown and through the online learning. ""I know that we will always be classed as the coronavirus year that didn't do exams. ""Universities hopefully will take that into consideration."" This video can not be played ""I'm not going to be going into those assessments with the same sort of opportunities as everybody else"" The NASUWT union, which represents some teachers in Wales, said ""the devil will be in the detail"" and full consultation with teachers is needed as there were concerns over fairness and staff workloads. ""How is this going to be achieved and what are the workload implications going to be on already hard pressed teachers?"" said Neil Butler of the NASUWT. UCAC, another teaching union, said it was ""the only realistic solution under the current circumstances"". But their general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young added he would like to see external standardisation between schools. The school leaders' union NAHT Cymru said they were pleased to get clarity - but are ""concerned about the proposed processes for appeals. ""The suggestion that initial appeals are made directly to the school or college is misguided in principle, and logistically unworkable,"" said director Laura Doel. Executive members of the National Education Union Cymru said they were pleased to be moving to a system ""with more trust in teachers and lecturers"" and were keen there was ""no repeat of the position we all found ourselves in last summer"". The director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, Eithne Hughes, said it was a ""pragmatic solution"" but more detail is needed regarding quality control. The announcement does not include vocational and technical qualifications, which are being considered separately. Qualifications Wales said it would work with the awarding bodies offering Wales-only vocational qualifications ""to reflect these arrangements in those qualifications"".

Visual guide to inauguration security threats,"National Guard soldiers being issued with rifles outside the US Capitol President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn into office at midday on Wednesday at a ceremony in the US capital Washington DC. In some ways, the inauguration will be much the same as previous ones - Mr Biden will take the oath of office on the steps of the Capitol and then make his way to the White House. But with the event happening just two weeks after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol - and coming amid a global pandemic - there will be lots of differences. Here's an in-depth look at what measures have been put into place to deal with heightened concerns about security and Covid-19. Questions are still being asked about how a mob was able to overrun the Capitol on 6 January, leaving five people dead, and the FBI has warned of further armed protests - so it's no surprise that security measures have been greatly increased in recent days. Inaugurations are designated a ""National Special Security Event"", meaning the US Secret Service has overall command, but this time they will be supported by an increased mix of forces, including the DC Metropolitan Police Department and the National Guard. National Guardsmen began arriving at the Capitol last week and eventually around 25,000 are expected to be involved in security efforts. There were 8,000 at Mr Trump's inauguration in 2017. The Pentagon has given its approval for some of those troops to be armed, with many stationed around the Capital being pictured with handguns or rifles. Are US militia groups becoming more active? One of the main roles for those personnel will be manning dozens of road blocks across the centre of the city, including on several key bridges that cross the Potomac River. Access will be closely guarded, with only residents or businesses allowed to move around the outer ""green zone"" while the ""red zone"" will be limited to just authorised vehicles. More than a dozen subway stations have also been closed. With pro-Trump protesters expected to attempt to arrive in the city from across the country, travel companies have also put some special measures in place. Home rental firm Airbnb has cancelled bookings in DC for the period around the inauguration, as have several local hotel chains. Airlines and airports have also stepped up security, with many of the major carriers banning passengers from being able to travel with guns checked in with their luggage, while some of those present at the Capitol riots earlier this month have been added to a no-fly list. Amtrak, the US railway company, also said it was limiting its services in the region and passengers would see more police officers on its trains and at stations. Mr Biden, a keen Amtrak rider, had hoped to take a train to Washington DC from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday but changed his plans because of security concerns. What are far-right Trump supporters saying? Incoming presidents are usually keen to boost the number of people at their inauguration ceremonies, but that's not the case this year. Even before the attack on the Capitol on 6 January, Mr Biden's inaugural committee had asked supporters to stay at home because of fears that the traditional large gathering on the National Mall would turn into a coronavirus super-spreader event. Images of the stage on the west side of the Capitol being prepared show how different the event will look, with around 100 chairs spread over the space to allow the few guests there to keep socially distanced from one another. Those guests will be wearing face masks and will also be required to have had a negative Covid-19 test shortly before the event. There will be no mass of supporters stretching down the National Mall for Mr Biden to look out on either, in stark contrast to the crowd of two million that gathered to see President Obama sworn in for his first term in 2009. The National Park Service announced last week that the entire space would be closed to the public because of security concerns. Instead, a display of 200,000 flags will fill some of the space. The Capitol building itself looks more like a fortress than the home of America's politicians at the moment, with a ring of fencing around its perimeter that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy described as ""non-scalable"".  Similar fencing has also been erected around the White House. After they are sworn in, President Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris will head to the east side of the Capitol where they will take part in the traditional ""pass in review"" ceremony in which the new commander in chief inspects the troops. This would normally have kicked off the traditional parade along Pennsylvania Avenue, with a motorcade carrying the new president 1.5 miles to the White House as crowds cheer from the side of the road. That's off the cards this year because of Covid and the high risk of violence. Mr Biden will instead travel across the Potomac River to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington Cemetery, the country's largest military burial ground. He is expected to be accompanied by former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton - but not Donald Trump, who has broken with tradition to skip all of the inauguration day events. When Mr Biden is finished in Arlington, the motorcade carrying the 46th president of the US will make its way through the roadblocks to the White House, where he will begin his term in office. The building has seen several outbreaks of coronavirus in the last 12 months, with President Trump himself being admitted to hospital with the virus back in October. This means everything from handrails to elevator buttons to bathroom fixtures will be wiped and sanitised before the Biden administration moves in, according to the federal agency that oversees the housekeeping effort. How the White House gets ready for a new president Cleaners disinfecting a lectern in the White House back in April last year With the building being spread over six floors and containing 132 rooms, it will take a mammoth effort to disinfect everything in the time between the last member of Trump's staff leaving and the arrival of President Biden and his team. Once Mr Biden is in, he'll have a more relaxed evening schedule than is normal for a new president. Thanks to Covid and the security concerns, the traditional balls and after-parties have been scrapped this year and replaced with a virtual concert hosted by Tom Hanks.

"Van driver rescued after plunging into fordPolice say the van ""careered"" off the road and the man was rescued from the overturned vehicle.","The driver sat on his overturned van until rescuers arrived A supermarket delivery driver had to be rescued from his overturned van after he careered off the road and ended up in a fast-flowing ford, police said. Firefighters and police were called to the River Wear, Westgate, in Weardale, after reports that a Morrisons van was stuck at 17:00 GMT on Tuesday. Police said the van had ""careered"" off the road and the man sat on top of the vehicle before being rescued. County Durham Fire and Rescue Service said the rescue was ""challenging."" Water specialists from the fire service braved the river in a raft attached to a nearby footbridge and gave the man a life jacket. Police said the driver was not injured but was taken to hospital as a precaution. The fire service tweeted a video of the scene, and said they were ""so proud"" of the water rescue team.

'Van acted like a boat' He said: ""There's not a vehicle in the world that could have got through. ""The river was in flood - the snow here has melted and there was rain, so there was a lot of water in the river.

The van has not yet been recovered from the water He also said that rescuers had put their lives at risk. ""I know they practice for this but in those conditions, with that freezing water travelling at great speed, in the dark and the pouring rain, it was very dangerous and they were very brave,"" he said.

Deadly blast rocks centre of MadridAt least two people have died in a suspected gas blast that destroyed four floors of a building.Europe,"This video can not be played Video footage showed the aftermath of the deadly explosion At least three people have died following an explosion that caused a building to partially collapse in centre of the Spanish capital, Madrid. A fourth person was missing and several others were hurt, officials said. City officials said the blast, which destroyed four floors of the building, had been caused by a gas leak. Mayor JosÃ© Luis MartÃ­nez Almeida told reporters after the blast that a fire was raging inside the building, which belongs to the Catholic Church. The blast happened shortly before 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT) as gas workers were repairing a boiler at the back of the building in the central Puerta de Toledo area of Madrid. An 85-year-old woman passer-by and two men were killed while a third man who had been working on the boiler was missing, Spanish media reported. One of the injured was in a serious condition and taken to hospital, according to officials. Spanish reports said the upper floors affected were being used to house local priests. Rescue workers evacuated more than 50 people from a care home next-door to the building in Caille de Toledo, but a school on the other side was closed at the time of the blast. Four floors of the building were destroyed in the explosion, which could be heard in many areas of Madrid. Images shared on social media showed billowing smoke and debris strewn along the street. Emergency services said nine fire crews and 11 ambulances were at the scene and some of those caught up in the blast were treated on the street. Four floors of the building were destroyed in the explosion Police officers cleared the area, closing it to all traffic and pedestrians, and appealed to local residents not to come near. ""The noise was very loud, very loud, really,"" Lorenzo Fomento, who was working from home at a nearby apartment, told AFP news agency. ""I never heard anything so loud before,"" he added. The director of the nursing home, Antonio Berlanga, said all the elderly residents were fine and places were being found for them to spend the night.

Rollout of daily contact testing paused in schools,"Testing of close contacts of identified cases was due to start in secondary schools and colleges in England The government has paused plans to roll out rapid daily coronavirus testing of close contacts, in all but a small number of secondary schools and colleges. Testing close contacts of a positive case as an alternative to isolation showed some benefits in trials. But the emergence of a new variant means the risk of missing infections has risen, health officials say. Regular testing of staff will now increase to twice a week. More research is needed on how daily contact testing would work given the new, more transmissible, coronavirus variant, Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace say. In the meantime, routine testing to pick up asymptomatic cases in staff and pupils remains a key part of the government's plans. Mass testing in schools, using pregnancy-style lateral flow tests to detect the virus, had been due to start in January. However, under new lockdown restrictions, schools have had to switch to providing online teaching until February - although children of key workers are still allowed to attend - and plans were postponed. How testing of pupils will be organised once schools reopen is still not clear. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? School attendance higher than first lockdown Rapid coronavirus test use defended The original plan for rapid Covid testing in all secondary schools and colleges included: seven days of daily tests for pupils who had been near a positive case daily tests for teachers if they had a case in their class routine weekly testing for teachers The aim was to keep as many children in schools as possible by avoiding a whole bubble, class or year having to be sent home, and to reduce disruption from staff having to isolate. But some scientists have consistently expressed concerns about the accuracy of the rapid tests, which do not need to be sent to a lab for the results. They say the high number of false negatives means close contacts may wrongly think they are not infectious and go on to mix with more vulnerable people. And now PHE and NHS Test and Trace say the new variant, which ""increases the risk of transmission everywhere, including in school settings"", has made this a risk no longer worth taking. ""The balance between the risks (transmission of virus in schools and onward to households and the wider community) and benefits (education in a face-to-face and safe setting) for daily contact testing is unclear,"" their statement adds. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? A government spokesman said: ""NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England have reviewed their advice and concluded that, in light of the higher prevalence and rates of transmission of the new variant, further evaluation work is required to make sure it is achieving its aim of breaking chains of transmission and reducing cases of the virus in the community. ""There is no change to the main rollout of regular testing using rapid lateral flow tests in schools and colleges, which is already proving beneficial in finding teachers and students with coronavirus who do not have symptoms.""

Biden to be sworn in as Trump snubs inauguration,"This video can not be played President Biden: ""Democracy is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed"" Joe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th US president, ending one of the most dramatic political transitions in American history. ""Democracy has prevailed,"" he said after taking the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts. Donald Trump - who has not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden - snubbed the inauguration ceremony, in a departure from longstanding precedent. The new president swiftly signed a raft of measuresreversing Trump policies. Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice-president ahead of Mr Biden. She is the first woman - and the first black and Asian-American person - to serve in the role, a heartbeat from the presidency. Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency What will Joe Biden do first? Kamala Harris becomes first female, first black VP Follow the latest updates The inauguration took place at the US Capitol. There is extra-tight security after the building was stormed by violent pro-Trump protesters in a deadly riot on 6 January. This video can not be played Kamala Harris was sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor Some 25,000 National Guards protected the ceremony, which missed the traditional hundreds of thousands of spectators because of the coronavirus pandemic. In hisinaugural address, Mr Biden said it was a day of ""history and hope"". ""My whole soul is in putting America back together again,"" he added. This video can not be played The new president took his oath of office with Chief Justice John G Roberts. Highlighting a message of unity after the turbulent Trump years, he promised to be a president ""for all Americans"" - including those who voted against him. Among those attending the ceremony were three of his predecessors: Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served for eight years as vice-president - Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Mr Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence. Full transcript of Biden inauguration speech Does Biden's new team better reflect America? A beginner's guide to being the vice-president The inauguration ceremony included musical performances by Lady Gaga - who sang the national anthem - as well as Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks. An evening concert at the Lincoln Memorial in the city will be hosted by Tom Hanks and will feature Bruce Springsteen, John Legend, JonÂ Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, and Demi Lovato. Lady Gaga gave her rendition of the Star Spangled Banner In the afternoon, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris visited Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia to pay their respects to US war dead. The new president's motorcade then left for the White House. He walked the last block with his family, and hugged his wife Jill before entering their new home. Mr Biden later told reporters that Mr Trump had written ""a very generous letter"" to him, adding: ""Because it was private, I won't talk about it until I talk to him."" Joe Biden knows he has a hard job ahead of him. In his inaugural address, he outlined the biggest challenges facing his presidency - a devastating pandemic, massive job losses, a threatened environment, urgent calls for racial justice and a resurgence of political extremism. Mr Biden didn't offer a laundry list of solutions. Those will come in policy addresses and announcements of executive action in the coming days or even hours. In his first address as president, he offered only an overarching prescription for the nation's ills. ""Unity is the path forward,"" he said. ""And we must meet this moment as the United States of America."" Standing on ground that was occupied two weeks ago by an angry mob supporting his predecessor, Mr Biden called for an end to what he termed an ""uncivil war"". Biden campaigned as a centrist capable of healing the nation's wounds. In the months since his victory, the breadth of the divisions in the US has only become more apparent. With his party in control of Congress, he will have an opportunity to enact an ambitious presidential agenda. Keeping the nation united while doing so would be a significant accomplishment. Read Anthony's full piece here Mr Trump was the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since 1869. He left the White House early on Wednesday, and flew to the nearby Andrews Air Force base. This video can not be played Trump leaves the White House for the last time as US president In his farewell address at the base, he highlighted what he regarded as the successes of his presidency. ""What we've done has been amazing by any standard,"" Mr Trump said. The 74-year-old then left for his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, where he arrived later in the morning. In his last hours as president,Mr Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people,external, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who had been facing fraud charges. Trump pardons Bannon in final acts of clemency How will history remember Trump? This video can not be played Trump: ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success"" The political drama surrounding Mr Trump is far from over. The US Senate is expected to put him on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives for allegedly inciting the Capitol riot. On Tuesday, the Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said the mob had been provoked by Mr Trump and fed lies. The new president set to work straight after the inauguration. He signed executive orders aiming to: Reverse Mr Trump's withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate accord Revoke the presidential permit granted tothe Keystone XL Pipeline, which is opposed by environmentalists and Native American groups Revoke Trump policies on immigration enforcement and the emergency declaration that helped fund the construction of a Mexican border wall Bring about a mask and distancing mandate for federal employees and in federal buildings, and a new White House office on coronavirus End a travel ban on visitors from some, mainly Muslim, nations Other orders cover race and gender equality.

Trump's farewell video fact-checked,"On leaving office as US president, President Trump has made a number of claims about his record. We've fact-checked some of things he said in a farewell speech at the Andrews Air Base in Maryland and in a video statement released by the White House. In his final public speech as president, he hailed his government's track record on the military. He's previously said it was depleted under former President Obama. It's true that Mr Trump's administration has increased the amount of military funding. Has Trump kept his promises on the military? However, the levels of spending are lower than what was spent on the military during Mr Obama's first administration (2009 to 2013), when using data adjusted for inflation. President Trump has also scaled back the number of troops in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. In his remarks at Andrews Air base, Mr Trump also said ""we have the greatest economy in the world"", and prior to the pandemic the numbers were ""at a level nobody had ever seen before"". The US economy had certainly done well under him prior to the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, but there have been periods under previous administrations when it did better. In his first three years in office, President Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%. This was slightly higher than the final three years of the Obama era. However, there have been many periods when the growth of GDP - the value of goods and services in the economy - was a lot higher. And in 2020, the economy saw the largest contraction on record because of the pandemic. It rebounded by 33% in the third quarter last year, itself a record for a quarterly increase, but this did not bring economic activity back to pre-pandemic levels. The economy under Trump in six charts President Trump also said: ""Now the stock market is actually substantially higher than it was at its higher point prior to the pandemic."" Although there have been recent wobbles, the stock market has bounced back to above pre-pandemic levels. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use for two Covid-19 vaccines - Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. The government's vaccine programme, Operation Warp Speed, did provide funding for the development of the Moderna vaccine. While Pfizer/BioNTech did sign a deal with the government to deliver doses, it didn't receive any money to do development or testing. And although Pfizer is a US firm, this particular vaccine was developed in conjunction with the German-based BioNTech company. It was their gene-based technology which was the key to making the vaccine. This needs context as it depends on how you define war. The US has formally enacted declarations of war against 11 countries in five separate conflicts. The last formal declaration of war was during World War II. Most of the time the US enters conflicts using the ""authorisation of military force"" granted by Congress to the president. For example, President George W Bush used this for the Iraq war in 2003. And President Obama sought Congressional approval to intervene in Syria after chemical weapons were used there. President Trump gave his final address late on Tuesday President Trump has engaged in military actions abroad using legislation passed by previous governments. In October 2019, he announced the killing of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a military operation, but said he decided not to notify Democrat leaders in Congress beforehand. In January 2020, President Trump ordered an airstrike which killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.  The White House cited Congress's ""authorisation of military force"" granted under the Bush administration as its legal basis. The Trump administration has alsoincreased US drone strikes in Somalia. Building a wall along the southern border with Mexico was one of his major pledges in the run-up to the 2016 election. As of 4 January 2021, a total of 452 miles (757km) of barrier has been built since he took office. However, the vast majority of this new wall replaced existing structures on the border. Trump's wall: How much has been built during his term? Only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there was none before. Of this 47 miles is what's called primary wall, and 33 miles is secondary wall that reinforces the initial barrier. President-elect Joe Biden said he would not build ""another foot"" of the wall. The African American unemployment rate hit 5.2% in August 2019, and the Hispanic rate hit 4% in September 2019. These were the lowest rates recorded since the US Labor Department started collecting these statistics in the 1970s. The unemployment rate has recently spiked significantly for both groups because of the huge impact of the pandemic on the US economy. What has Trump done for black jobs and poverty? And this has disproportionately affected African Americans and Hispanic Americans - their unemployment rates are 3.2 and 2.6 percentage points higher respectively than the overall figure. Asian American unemployment is currently 5.9%. It reached a record low of 2.1% in June 2019, but these records only date back to 2003. VA Choice is a government programme which offers better quality health care to ex-military members in the US. President Trump didn't pass this programme - it was created in 2014 under President Obama - but he did expand it. In June 2018, President Trump signed a law that reformed VA Choice, expanding the eligibility requirements for veterans to access private health care.

Trump issues swathe of pardons,"Steve Bannon is accused of fraud over a fundraising campaign. He denies any wrongdoing In the final hours of his presidency, Donald Trump has pardoned 73 people, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who is facing fraud charges. Another 70 people had sentences commuted, ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration at noon (17:00 GMT). Rapper Lil Wayne received a pardon and there were commutations for rapper Kodak Black and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. The president has not issued preemptive pardons for himself or family members. He can still issue more pardons on Wednesday morning, as he remains president until Mr Biden takes the oath of office outside the US Capitol. Could Trump pardon himself? Why has Trump granted clemency to two rappers? US historians on what Donald Trump's legacy will be The inauguration ceremony will be tight on security following the recent breach of the Capitol by violent pro-Trump protesters. It will also be stripped of crowds due to the coronavirus pandemic. Biden set to be sworn in as Trump leaves office A statement from the White House,externallisted the 73 individuals who had received pardons and the 70 who had their sentences commuted. Although many on the list are conventional examples of convicts whose cases have been championed by rights activists and supporters in the community, others maintain the president's trend of focusing on allies. Steve Bannonwas a key strategist and adviser to President Trump during his 2016 campaign.He was charged in August last year with fraudover a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, a key plank of Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors said Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which pledged to use donations to build segments of the barrier and raised $25m (Â£18m). It was alleged Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses. He denied the claims. As he was yet to stand trial his pardon is unusual, though certainly not unprecedented. The White House statement said Mr Bannon had been ""an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen"". It said prosecutors had ""pursued"" him with charges ""related to fraud stemming from his involvement in a political project"". This video can not be played Steve Bannon defends Trump from racism accusations A full pardon was also issued toElliott Broidy,a Republican fundraiser who admitted accepting funds to lobby Mr Trump for Chinese and Malaysian interests. The White House cited his ""philanthropic efforts"". Ken Kurson, a friend of Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner charged with cyberstalking during a divorce, was pardoned. Lil Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, pleaded guilty to a federal weapons charge last year and has been pardoned. He posted a photo of himself with Mr Trump during the election campaign praising the president's work on criminal reform. As the list of pardons became clear, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff said: ""Thank God we have only 12 more hours of this den of thieves."" Other key recipients were: Kodak Black,real name Bill K Kapri, who was also charged with firearms offences, had his sentence of three years and 10 months commuted. The White House statement praised his philanthropic work Michael 'Harry O' Harris- co-founder of Death Row Records, who served 32 years for attempted murder and cocaine trafficking and whose case was championed by rapper Snoop Dogg. He was pardoned Kwame Kilpatrickwas sentenced in 2013 to 28 years in prison on charges of racketeering, bribery and extortion in relation to his period as Detroit mayor from 2002 to 2008. His sentence was commuted - the White House said this was ""strongly supported by prominent members of the Detroit community"" Anthony Levandowskireceived a full pardon from an 18-month sentence. He is a former Google engineer who admitted stealing secret technology related to the company's self-driving cars. The pardon says he had ""paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good"" The White House said Anthony Levandowski's sentencing judge called him a ""brilliant engineer"" However, a number of people whose names had been promoted in the media for possible pardons - including Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, and Joe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger King - have not been included. It is common for outgoing presidents to issue pardons before they leave the White House. Alexander Hamilton proposed the system in 1787, arguing it could ""restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth"". It is carried in Article II of the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton proposed the system in 1787 The president can only act on federal, not state, crimes. A pardon cancels a criminal conviction, while a commutation shortens or ends a prison sentence. Pardons have been controversial since they started. In the early years of the US, some acts of treason, piracy and rebellion were forgiven. One man convicted of stealing mail refused a pardon in 1833 and he was executed after the Supreme Court ruled he could turn it down. In latter days, Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for all offences he may have committed, and Jimmy Carter pardoned most who had evaded the Vietnam War draft - both examples of preemptive pardons. Bill Clinton caused uproar when he pardoned scores of people on his last day in office, including his half-brother, Roger. Mr Trump has always projected himself as a ""law and order"" president. In terms of numbers, his pardons and commutations are low. Only George HW Bush issued fewer in modern times. Mr Trump has granted less than 1% of requests for clemency, the lowest on record. However, it is the nature of the pardons that has caused controversy. A number of those pardoned have been close associates and allies, such as former campaign manager Paul Manafort, long-time ally Roger Stone and his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles. Steve Bannon adds to that list. Opponents accuse him of using his constitutional powers unconventionally, to benefit his friends and close supporters. There had been speculation Mr Trump could try to pardon himself or his family members ahead of any possible charges. It is unclear whether he has the legal power to do so and there is no precedent of a US leader issuing such a pardon. He does face a possible Senate impeachment trial for ""incitement to insurrection"", although dates have yet to be set for that.

"Trump vows 'we will be back' as he leaves officeDonald Trump tells supporters ""I will fight for you, I will be watching"" as he heads to Florida.US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump: ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success"" Donald Trump has vowed he will be ""back in some form"" after departing the White House for the final time as president. He told supporters as he prepared to fly to Florida that it had been ""a great honour to be your president"". He is the first president to snub his successor's inauguration since 1869 but did say: ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success."" Joe Biden will take the oath of office by noon (17:00 GMT) in Washington amid heavy security. Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency What happens at the inauguration? Some 25,000 troops will guard the inauguration ceremony following a deadly riot by pro-Trump supporters at the Capitol earlier this month. Mr Trump delivered his final speech as president at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, after flying there from the White House with First Lady Melania Trump. Donald and Melania Trump head towards the Marine One helicopter on the White House's South Lawn In a typically unscripted speech, he highlighted his ""amazing"" achievements, citing job creation, the establishment of a ""Space Force"", policies for veterans and on taxation, as well as the speedy development of Covid vaccines. He urged people to be ""very, very careful"" about the ""horrible"" pandemic and paid respects to those who had suffered. Trump's farewell video fact-checked Trump pardons Bannon in final acts of clemency How will history remember Trump? He added: ""It's been a great honour and privilege to be your president... I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening. ""I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they will have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular."" But, as with his farewell video address on Tuesday, he did not mention Mr Biden by name. Mr Trump added: ""Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form. Have a good life. We will see you soon."" He also paid tribute to his Vice-President Mike Pence, who was not at Andrews, having chosen instead to attend the inauguration ceremony. Mr Trump will be the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since Andrew Johnson snubbed Ulysses S Grant in 1869. He flew off to begin post-presidential life at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Palm Beach.

This video can not be played Trump gives his farewell address In a farewell video message on Tuesday, Mr Trump called on Americans to pray for the incoming administration. He said he was proud of what he had achieved over the past four years. Mr Trump has been relatively quiet since his supporters attacked Congress on 6 January, and his Twitter account was suspended. He has never congratulated Joe Biden on victory and had always disputed the result of the presidential election, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.

The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol,"Many were taken by surprise by the events in Washington, but to those who closely follow conspiracy and extreme right groups online, the warning signs were all there. At 02:21 Eastern Standard Time on election night, President Trump walked onto a stage set up in the East Room of the White House and declared victory. ""We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election."" His speech came an hour after he'd tweeted: ""They are trying to steal the election"". He hadn't won. There was no victory to steal. But to many of his most fervent supporters, these facts didn't matter, and still don't. Sixty five days later, a motley coalition of rioters stormed the US Capitol building. They included believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, members of ""Stop the Steal"" groups, far-right activists, online trolls and others. On Friday 8 January -  some 48 hours after the Washington riots - Twitter began a purge of some of the most influential pro-Trump accounts that had been pushing conspiracies and urging direct action to overturn the election result. Then came the big one - Mr Trump himself. The president was permanently banned from tweeting to his more than 88 million followers ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence"". The violence in Washington shocked the world and seemed to catch the authorities off guard. But for anyone who had been carefully watching the unfolding story - online and on the streets of American cities - it came as no surprise. The idea of a rigged election was seeded by the president in speeches and on Twitter, months before the vote. On election day, the rumors started just as Americans were going to the polls. A video of a Republican poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station went viral. It was a genuine error, caused by confusion about the rules. The man was laterallowed into the stationto observe the count. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But it became the first of many videos, images, graphics and claims that went viral in the days that followed, giving rise to a hashtag: #StopTheSteal. The message behind it was clear - Mr Trump had won a landslide victory, but dark forces in the establishment ""deep state"" had stolen it from him. In the early hours of Wednesday 4 November, while votes were still being counted and three days before the US networks called the election for Joe Biden, President Trump claimed victory, alleging ""a fraud on the American public"". Mr Trump did not provide any evidence to back up his claims.Studies carried out for previous US electionshave shown that voter fraud is extremely rare. By mid-afternoon a Facebook group called ""Stop the Steal"" was created and quickly became one of the fastest-growing in the platform's history. By Thursday morning, it had added more than 300,000 members. Many of the posts focused on unsubstantiated allegations of mass voter fraud, including manufactured claims that thousands of dead people had voted and that voting machines had somehow been programmed to flip votes from Mr Trump to Mr Biden. 'Stop the steal': The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy US Election 2020: The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive US Election 2020: Trump claims about Dominion machines fact-checked But some of the posts were more alarming, speaking of the need for a ""civil war"" or ""revolution"". By Thursday afternoon, Facebook had taken down Stop the Steal, but not before it had generated nearly half a million comments, shares, likes, and reactions. Dozens of other groups quickly sprang up in its place. The idea of a stolen election continued to spread online and take hold. Soon, a dedicated Stop the Steal website was launched in a bid to register ""boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the vote"". On Saturday 7 November, major news organisations declared that Joe Biden had won the election. In Democratic strongholds, throngs of people took to the streets to celebrate. But the reaction online from Mr Trump's most ardent supporters was one of anger and defiance. They planned a rally in Washington DC for the following Saturday, dubbed the Million MAGA (Make America Great Again) March. Trump tweeted that he might try to stop by the demonstration and ""say hello"". Previous pro-Trump rallies in Washington had failed to attract large crowds. But thousands gathered at Freedom Plaza that sunny morning. One extremism researchercalled it,externalthe ""debut of the pro-Trump insurgency"". As Trump's motorcade drove through the city, supporters screaming with delight rushed to catch a glimpse of the president, who beamed at them wearing a red MAGA hat. While mainstream conservative figures were present, the event was dominated by far-right groups. Dozens of members of the far-right, anti-immigrant, all-male group Proud Boys, who have repeatedly been involved in violent street protests and were among those who would later break into the US Capitol, joined the march. Militia groups, far-right media figures and promoters of conspiracy theories were also there. Capitol riots: Who broke into the building? US Election 2020: Who are the Proud Boys - and who are antifa? As night fell, clashes between Trump supporters and counter-protesters broke out, including a brawl about five blocks from the White House. The violence - although largely contained by police on this occasion - was a clear sign of things to come. By now, President Trump and his legal team had invested their hopes in dozens of legal cases. Although a number of courts had already dismissed fraud allegations, many in the pro-Trump online world became fascinated with two lawyers with close ties to the president - Sidney Powell and L Lin Wood. Ms Powell and Mr Wood promised they were preparing cases of voter fraud so comprehensive that when released, they would destroy the case for Mr Biden having won the presidency. Watch Aleem Maqbool's film America: Storming the Capitol, in which he examines the question - how safe is American democracy? Ms Powell, 65, a conservative activist and former federal prosecutor, told Fox News that the effort would ""release the Kraken"" - a reference to a gigantic sea monster from Scandinavian folklore that rises up from the ocean to devour its enemies. The ""Kraken"" quickly became an internet meme, representing sprawling, unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud. Ms Powell and Mr Wood became heroes to followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory - who believe President Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state made up of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood. What is QAnon? What is the 'Kraken' conspiracy? The lawyers became a conduit between the president and his most conspiracy-minded supporters - a number of whom ended up inside the Capitol on 6 January. Ms Powell and Mr Wood were successful in whipping up sound and fury online, but their legal efforts came to nothing. When they released almost 200 pages of documents in late November, it became clear thattheir lawsuitconsisted predominantly of conspiracy theories and debunked allegations that had already been rejected by dozens of courts. The filings contained simple legal errors - and basic misspellings and typos. Still, the meme lived on. The terms ""Kraken"" and ""Release the Kraken"" were used more than a million times on Twitter before the Capitol riot. As courts rejected Mr Trump's legal cases, far-right activists increasingly targeted election workers and officials. Death threats were made against a Georgia election worker, and Republican officials in the state - including Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the official in charge of the state's voting systems, Gabriel Sterling - were branded ""traitors"" online. Mr Sterling issued an emotional and prescient warning to the president in a press conference on 1 December. This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats ""Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, and it's not right,"" he said. In Michigan in early December, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, had just finished trimming her Christmas tree with her four-year-old son when she heard a commotion outside her Detroit home. About 30 protesters with banners stood outside, shouting ""Stop the steal!"" through megaphones. ""Benson, you are a villain,"" one person yelled. ""You're a threat to democracy!"" called another. One of the demonstrators live-streamed the protest on Facebook, stating that her group was ""not going away"". It was just one of a rash of protests targeting people involved in the vote. In Georgia, a constant stream of Trump supporters drove past Mr Raffensperger's home, honking their horns. His wife received threats of sexual violence. In Arizona, demonstrators gathered outside of the home of Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, at one point warning: ""We are watching you."" On 11 December,the Supreme Court rejectedan attempt by the state of Texas to throw out election results. As the president's legal and political windows continued to close, the language in pro-Trump online circles became increasingly violent. On 12 December, a second Stop the Steal rally was held in the capital. Once again, thousands attended, and once again prominent far-right activists, QAnon supporters, fringe MAGA groups and militia movements were among the demonstrators. Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security advisor, likened the protesters to the biblical soldiers and priests breaching the walls of Jericho. This echoed the rally organisers' call for ""Jericho Marches"" to overturn the election result. Nick Fuentes, the leader of Groypers, a far-right movement that targets Republican politicians and figures they deem too moderate, told the crowd: ""We are going to destroy the GOP!"" The march once againturned violent. Then two days later,the Electoral College certifiedMr Biden's victory, one of the final steps required for him to take office. On online platforms, supporters were becoming resigned to the view that all legal avenues were dead ends, and only direct action could save the Trump presidency. Since election day, alongside Mr Flynn, Ms Powell and Mr Wood, a new figure had rapidly gained prominence among pro-Trump circles online. Ron Watkins is the son of Jim Watkins, the man behind 8chan and 8kun - message boards filled with extreme language and views, violence and extreme sexual content. They gave rise to the QAnon movement. In a series of viral tweets on 17 December, Ron Watkins suggested President Trump should follow the example of Roman leader Julius Caesar, and capitalise on ""fierce loyalty of the military"" in order to ""restore the Republic"". Ron Watkins encouraged his more than 500,000 followers to make #CrossTheRubicon a Twitter trend, referring to the moment when Caesar launched a civil war by crossing the Rubicon river in 49BC. The hashtag was also used by more mainstream figures - including the chairwoman of Arizona Republican Party,Kelli Ward,external. In a separate tweet, Ron Watkins said Mr Trump must invoke the Insurrection Act, which empowers the president to deploy the military and federal forces. Mr Trump met Ms Powell, Mr Flynn and others at a strategy meeting at the White House the following day, 18 December. During the meeting, according to the New York Times, Mr Flynn called on Mr Trump toimpose martial law,externaland deploy the military to ""rerun"" the election. The meeting further stoked online chatter about ""war"" and ""revolution"" in far-right circles. Many came to see the joint session of Congress on 6 January, normally a formality, as a last roll of the dice. A wishful story began to take hold among QAnon and some MAGA supporters. They hoped that Vice-President Mike Pence, who was set to preside over the 6 January ceremony, would ignore the electoral college votes. The president, they said, would then deploy the military to quell any unrest, order the mass arrest of the ""deep state cabal"" who had rigged the election and send them to Guantanamo Bay military prison. Back in the land of reality, none of this was remotely feasible. But it launched a movement for ""patriot caravans"" to organise ride shares to help transport thousands from around the country to Washington DC on 6 January. Long processions of vehicles flying Trump flags and sometimes towing elaborately decorated trailers gathered in car parks in cities including Louisville, Kentucky, Atlanta, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""We are on our way,"" one caravaner posted on Twitter with a picture of about two dozen supporters. At an Ikea parking lot in North Carolina, another man showed off his truck. ""The flags are a little tattered - we'll call them battle flags now,"" he said. As it became clear that Mr Pence and other key Republicans would follow the law and allow Congress to certify Mr Biden's win, the language towards them became vicious. ""Pence will be in jail awaiting trial for treason,"" Mr Wood tweeted. ""He will face execution by firing squad."" Online discussion reached boiling point. References to firearms, war and violence were rife on self-styled ""free speech""social platformssuch as Gab and Parler, which are popular with Trump supporters, as well as on other sites. In Proud Boys groups, where members had once supported police, some turned against authorities, whom they deemed to no longer be on their side. Hundreds of posts on a popular pro-Trump site, TheDonald, openly discussed plans to cross barricades, carry firearms and other weapons to the march in defiance of Washington's strict gun laws. There was open chatter about storming the Capitol and arresting ""treasonous"" members of Congress. On Wednesday 6 January, Mr Trump addressed a crowd of thousands at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House, for more than an hour. Early on he encouraged supporters to ""peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard"", but he ended with a warning. ""We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. ""So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenueâ¦ and we're going to the Capitol."" To some observers, the potential for violence that day was clear from the outset. Michael Chertoff, former secretary of homeland security under President George W Bush, blamed the Capitol Police, who reportedly turned down offers of assistance from the much larger National Guard ahead of time. He characterised it as ""the worst failure of a police force I can think of"". ""I think it was a very foreseeable potential negative turn of events,"" Mr Chertoff said. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol ""To be blunt, it was obvious. If you read the newspaper and were awake, you understood that you've got a lot of people who have been convinced there was a fraudulent election. Some of them are extremists, and violent. Some of the groups openly said, 'Bring your guns'."" Still, many Americans were astonished by Wednesday's scenes, like James Clark, a 68-year-old Republican from Virginia. ""I find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this,""he toldthe BBC. But the signs were there for weeks. A hodgepodge of extreme and conspiratorial groups were convinced that the election was stolen. Online, they repeatedly talked about arming themselves, and violence. Perhaps the authorities didn't think their posts were serious, or specific enough to investigate. They now face pointed questions. For Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January, Mr Chertoff is expecting a ""much stronger showing"" by security services than last Wednesday night. But that hasn't stopped many on extreme platforms calling for further violence and disruption on the day. There are questions, too, for the major social media platforms, which enabled conspiracy theories to reach millions of people. Late on Friday, Twitter deleted the accounts of Mr Flynn, the former Trump advisor, the ""Kraken"" lawyers Ms Powell and Mr Wood, and Mr Watkins. Then Mr Trump himself. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account Arrests of those who stormed the Capitol continue. But most of the rioters still live in a parallel online universe - a subterranean world filled with alternative facts. They have already come up with fanciful explanations to dismiss Mr Trump'svideo statement, posted on Twitter the day after the riots, in which he acknowledged for the first time that ""a new administration will be inaugurated on 20 January"". He can't possibly be giving up, they contend. Among their new theories - it's not really him in the video but a computer-generated ""deep fake"". Or perhaps the president is being held hostage. Many still believe Mr Trump will prevail. There's no evidence behind any of this, but it does prove one thing. No matter what happens to Donald Trump, the rioters who stormed the US Capitol are not backing down anytime soon.

"Murdered student 'may have been drugged'The body of Joy Morgan was found two months after a man was convicted of her murder.Beds, Herts & Bucks","Joy Morgan was a second year midwifery student at the University of Hertfordshire A student murdered by a fellow church member may have been given drugs without her knowing, an inquest heard. The body of Joy Morgan, 20, was found in Hertfordshire woodland in October 2019, two months after Shohfah-El Israel was convicted of her murder. Traces of MDMA were found in her body and the inquest was told there was no evidence that Ms Morgan would have taken the drug herself voluntarily. A coroner recorded a conclusion of ""unlawful killing"". Israel, of Fordwych Road, north-west London, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 17 years for Ms Morgan's murder in August 2019, despite the fact her body had not been found. During sentencing, Judge Michael Soole said Israel's ""cruel and cowardly"" refusal to reveal her whereabouts caused ""continuing distress and suffering"" to her family. Shohfah-El Israel was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court Two months later, the remains of Ms Morgan were found in woodland off Chadwell Road, Norton Green, near Stevenage. Part of the police evidence showed the killer had been in the area of the woods shortly after Ms Morgan's disappearance in December 2018. She was reported missing on 7 February 2019 after failing to return to her studies. Both Israel and Ms Morgan, who was in her second year at the University of Hertfordshire studying midwifery, were worshippers at the Israel United in Christ Church in Ilford. Man jailed for murdering fellow church member The murder of Joy Morgan An inquest at Hatfield Coroner's Court heard her body was found badly decomposed, and wrapped in black plastic bin liners and gaffer tape. The court heard toxicology tests showed MDMA in her body, and Det Insp Justine Jenkins said there was no evidence to indicate she would have voluntarily or knowingly taken illegal drugs. ""She was a church-goer, there is nothing to suggest [she took drugs] at all. ""We did, however, find MDMA in Israel's car, and it is likely that he was responsible for giving her these drugs."" Joy Morgan's remains were found in woodland at Norton Green Forensic pathologist Dr Charlotte Randall said there were three possible minor bruises on Ms Morgan's limbs. She added there was no evidence that Ms Morgan had been stabbed or shot, or restrained or suffered injuries consistent with a sexual assault. She found evidence of a possible fracture to her hyoid bone, but there was nothing to suggest she had suffered compression of the neck. Dr Randall said there was no evidence the student had suffered a head injury, but said she could have been rendered unconscious by a blow to the head that was ""non-fatal"". She could not rule out suffocation as a cause of death, potentially following milder blunt force trauma to the head. Coroner Geoffrey Sullivan said: ""[The MDMA] is not something that she would have taken and one can't exclude that she was given that, and it in some way rendered her incapable or unconscious."" He said the cause of Ms Morgan's death could not be ascertained. After the inquest, her mother Carol Morgan described her daughter as ""an amazing person"". ""She's been cremated, I haven't decided where to put her ashes so at the moment she's still at home with me,"" she said.

Cases affected by lost police data not known - PM,"The government does not know how many cases might be affected by hundreds of thousands of police records being accidentally wiped, the PM has said. Boris Johnson told the House of Commons the police were working ""round the clock"" to rectify the error. Around 400,000 fingerprint, DNA and arrest records were deleted from the police database. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was not yet known whether any of the data had been permanently lost. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""The Home Office is actively working to assess the damage and... they believe that they will be able to rectify the results of this complex incident and they hope very much that they'll be able to restore the data in question."" Asked by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer how many convicted criminals had had their records wrongly deleted, Mr Johnson said: ""We don't know how many cases might be frustrated as a result of what has happened."" He added: ""Of course it is outrageous that any data should have been lost."" Patel: Work to restore lost police records ongoing Last week it was revealed that the information was wiped from the Police National Computer (PNC) - which stores and shares criminal records information across the UK - after being inadvertently flagged for deletion. The PNC is used in police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. An estimated 213,000 offence records, 175,000 arrest records and 15,000 records on people were potentially incorrectly deleted as a result of a defective code. Ms Patel, who has launched an internal investigation, told ITV's Good Morning Britain that criminals would not get away with serious crimes as a result of the error. ""It is not about serious criminals getting away with anything. Multiple records are held on the same individuals on the same crimes on other profiling systems as well."" She told the BBC that officials could be instructed to re-submit the entries manually. ""I'm also clear with Home Office engineers and technicians that if we have to do manual uploads from other systems, that is effectively what we will do and that will potentially take time, but that is another option for us right now. ""We will absolutely provide updates once we know what has happened in terms of retrieving data. This will take time because it is a coding error."" The Home Office previously said that the faulty script was introduced in November 2020, but it did not run until earlier this month when the error within it immediately became apparent.

Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency,"When Joe Biden becomes US president on 20 January plenty of change is expected under his new administration. For those who want to put Donald Trump in the rear view mirror, there's a lot to look forward to. Others are not sure if he can bring unity to a divided country and enact lasting change. Here's what members of our BBC voter panel told us. Peyton Forte is a recent college graduate who now works as a reporter. She was not the big supporter of Biden and Kamala Harris, but says getting rid of Donald Trump is an urgent and necessary first step towards change. What are you hopeful the Biden administration can accomplish? For starters, easing the pandemic and ensuring more collaboration between federal and state governments on vaccine distribution. I'm looking forward to his stimulus packages to kickstart the economy and make sure people are actually alive to reap the benefits of it. We can also look forward to a president whose main mode of communication is not Twitter. The biggest thing is undoing the damage of the prior administration, from immigration laws to our relationships with foreign allies. What are your fears for the Biden presidency? To be honest, I haven't really gotten to that point because I'm so ready for the Trump administration to be gone. So ask me that question again in a few weeks. I'm really encouraged by Biden's financial and economic cabinet picks because I think he is trying to stunt the racial wealth gap. There will be a time and place to nitpick his choices, but not yet. As somebody who is black, I know he rejected calls to defund the police. The phrase is inflammatory, but that money is redirected into our communities, so I'd like for him to take another look at it and maybe he'll reconsider. With so much talk of the need for unity and healing, where does the country go from here? 'Unity and healing' is the new 'thoughts and prayers'. I know it has been kind of a calling card for Biden to contrast himself with Trump, but I'm going to have to see it to believe it. Are you just faking it or are you doing the work to actually unify people? Time will tell if people actually want unity or if some are just mad that their candidate lost. Jim is a property manager and conservative Republican who no longer supports President Trump since his refusal to accept the results of the election. He wants the incoming administration to find common ground rather than be too left wing. What are your hopes for Biden? I'm hopeful for some stability and less drama. America's standing in the world, particularly in the last couple of weeks, has really diminished and I would hope they would be able to return us to our traditional position in the world. I would like to see the bill he puts forward on Covid relief. If we're going to put money into people's hands, we need to make sure it actually makes a difference. Six hundred dollars is a slap in the face when you look at how we're giving away billions of dollars to other countries. What are your fears about his presidency? I am worried they're going to overreach and placate the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and create deeper polarisation. I worry they will try to pack the Supreme Court. I am concerned about immigration policy. I would hope they have the courage to be more moderate in tone, action and policy, at least for the first few years. That way, things can level off and then we can have reasonable debate about issues on a case-by-case basis. One side is really having a hard time accepting the reality of [Trump's] loss; that's too many people to just ignore and it seems like there's a real mood for retaliation. How can Biden unify America? Compromises will need to happen and both sides on the extreme right and left will not be happy with it. In the immediate moment, we need to have a good tone from the top that is conciliatory and respectful. I'm looking for Biden to reassure Americans their vote was secure and legitimate, restore a sense of public confidence and competence to the US government and spend serious time on rebuilding unity. One in, one out: How the White House changes hands Inauguration:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in Lesley is a small business owner and an immigrant from Canada. Joe Biden was not her first choice for president by a long shot, but she now says he is ""the best person"" for this moment in the country's history and she hopes he can follow through. What are your hopes for Biden? I'm looking forward to real leadership and an administration that actually cares about getting things done. We need to get the virus under control. They have an actual plan; I hate that it's going to cost another $2tn, but it wouldn't have cost that if we had taken the time to do the hard work early. From climate change and fire management to infrastructure and renewable energy, they'll get us back on track. From a civil rights perspective, we have the greatest opportunity. The administration is diverse and he's trying to give everyone a seat at the table. What are your fears about his presidency? Nothing comes to mind. I feel like this administration is going to reset, refocus and prioritise things that should be prioritised. There's so much that needs to be addressed at once, but like the rest of the world, they have to learn to multitask and do their jobs. This video can not be played What do countries around the world want from Joe Biden? How can Biden unify America? We need our elected officials, when doing their jobs, to not just represent one segment of the population. They can see what has happened by turning a blind eye and not listening. For the Democrats, they need to find a way to communicate so the concerns they've raised are taken seriously but without turning off the other side. For the Republicans, they need to pay attention not just to the loudest people - just being loud doesn't mean they're right. Moving forward, everybody has to do their part to prioritise what is best for the country. We're never going to get rid of the element that attacked the Capitol, but it's like herd immunity. The only people who were surprised by what happened last week were the ones who were not paying attention. Jazmin is a writer and youth voting rights activist who says the past four years have damaged the psyche of young people. She wants the new administration to rebuild trust and show people like her that government can be a force for good in their lives. What are your hopes for Biden? I hope that the Biden administration is bold on climate, an equitable Covid economic recovery and racial justice. Personally though, I think we fundamentally need to look at our broken system. Restoring voting rights, stronger ethics and anti-corruption measures, as well as campaign finance reform can restore balance and transparency within our government, so we can trust in our elections and elected officials. What are your fears about his presidency? I've been thinking a lot about the pace of change. There's so much that needs to be done but we're also looking at departments that have been gutted. The damage of the past three years has been so deep and the rolling back of it will take a lot of time, so we have to practise patience and we have to be realistic. How can Biden unify America? Our government only works when people decide not to disengage and be cynical, but instead step up and figure out how to get involved. The events of the Capitol work were horrific and traumatising for so many people, but the day before it was a Georgia election with incredibly high youth voter turnout. There is a lot of vitriol and hate, but the majority of folks believe in working to ensure our country is serving the best interests of everyone. Gabriel is a writer and the activism chair for the New York Young Republicans. He wishes the Biden administration good luck, but is concerned it will sow more division in a vulnerable moment for the country. What are your hopes for Biden? As an American, I am hopeful that things go well under this administration. I don't wish for Joe Biden to fail because the president is like the pilot of a plane: if he goes down, so do we. I hope he can answer the renewable energy debate, create more nuclear power plants and allow the United States to remain the number one exporter of energy. Hopefully, we'll see some sort of voter ID laws enforced, for greater election integrity. I hope he doesn't fuel more divisions. What are your fears about his presidency? My fear is that he will listen to people like AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and Bernie Sanders, who are trying to push him to accept more far left policies that will do more harm than good to the US in an economic sense. He may continue the harsh lockdowns and ignore censorship of conservatives. Under the Trump administration, we decreased our presence in the Middle East and were stopping the forever wars, so I really hope we don't return there. How can Biden unify America? After what happened at the Capitol, Biden came out and started very well, then devolved into race-baiting rhetoric - that's not something our country needs right now. There are millions of people who feel as though they were cheated and did not get a fair election, and some of them might not even recognise Biden as president, so it's very important that he treads lightly and focuses on unity. Don't lump them together as insurgents or other labels because you're going to further alienate people. Speak to every American and say that it is time to come together.

Self-employed: 'No work and no furlough help',"Louise worries about her prospects for the next 12 months Freelance TV and film sound editor Louise Burton is one of those who are unable to benefit from government pandemic support schemes, despite being out of work. Louise, 28, of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, has not had a single penny of assistance since her last job ended eight months ago. ""With the last production that I was on, I was hired as a PAYE freelancer, which means that I essentially do exactly the same job as what I do as a freelancer, but I was paying tax at source,"" she told the BBC. ""What often happens with film is that production companies are made for the sole purpose of the film. So they create these companies and everything goes through the company - and then once the film is completed, they then shut the company."" That means Louise fell foul of tax rules relating to self-employed people. And she could not go on furlough, because the company that had employed her no longer existed. ""I always feel guilty saying that I am one of the people who is suffering, because actually, I still have a roof over my head and I can just about put food on my table, but it's not easy,"" she says, adding that she fears for her prospects in the next 12 months. According to MPs, whole groups of people like Louise are falling through the cracks of Covid-19 support schemes because of out-of-date tax systems. Covid: Self-employed mothers 'deserve equal help' Coronavirus: What help are self-employed getting from government? Some freelancers and self-employed people have been particularly excluded, despite lockdowns and restrictions meaning they cannot work, the Public Accounts Committee said. Others, meanwhile, are able to abuse the system, it said. The government said its ""top priority"" was helping those who are struggling. Since March, HM Revenue and Customs has provided more than Â£80bn in support to companies and individuals through government coronavirus support schemes, the committee said. They are also supporting the incomes of many of the self-employed. But despite this,a report from the MPs,externalsays ""quirks in the tax system"" have meant that groups of workers - including freelancers and self-employed people who recently moved onto company payrolls or work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between - have been ineligible for furlough payments. ""As public spending balloons to unprecedented levels in response to the pandemic, out-of-date tax systems are one of the barriers to getting help to a significant number of struggling taxpayers who should be entitled to support,"" said MP Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). By contrast, she said some large companies that had used government support schemes had continued to pay dividends to shareholders and high salaries to executives. She added that HMRC was in many cases failing ""to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming"" support. The tax agency should explain to freelancers and other groups why they have been excluded from receiving support and set out steps to fix the problem within six weeks, the MPs said. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The PAC also said that a lack of certainty about government coronavirus support schemes had made it difficult for businesses to plan effectively. For example, HMRC could not provide clarity on whether the Job Retention Bonus scheme had been delayed or scrapped, the committee said. The scheme was meant to pay employers an incentive for every worker they brought back from furlough and kept in employment until January. ""Such lack of clarity may lead to unnecessary hardships for some businesses, who in good faith were relying on the payments from the scheme to meet some of their needs,"" the MPs said. A government spokesperson said it had done ""all it can to help as many people as possible"". ""HMRC delivered Covid-19 support schemes at unprecedented speed, protecting the livelihoods of millions of people. ""We do not underestimate the challenges faced by individuals and businesses during the pandemic, and our top priority is getting financial support to those struggling... while protecting the taxpayer against fraud. ""Those not eligible for support through these schemes can still benefit from the strengthened welfare safety net, accessing help like universal credit.""

Van driver rescued after plunging into ford,"The driver sat on his overturned van until rescuers arrived A supermarket delivery driver had to be rescued from his overturned van after he careered off the road and ended up in a fast-flowing ford, police said. Firefighters and police were called to the River Wear, Westgate, in Weardale, after reports that a Morrisons van was stuck at 17:00 GMT on Tuesday. Police said the van had ""careered"" off the road and the man sat on top of the vehicle before being rescued. County Durham Fire and Rescue Service said the rescue was ""challenging."" Water specialists from the fire service braved the river in a raft attached to a nearby footbridge and gave the man a life jacket. Police said the driver was not injured but was taken to hospital as a precaution. The fire service tweeted a video of the scene, and said they were ""so proud"" of the water rescue team.

Scott Bisset, who lives nearby, went to see if he could help after he was called by people who heard the driver shouting for help. Mr Bisset, a member of the local mountain rescue team, said he thought the driver may have ended up there after being directed by his sat-nav. 'Van acted like a boat' He said: ""There's not a vehicle in the world that could have got through. ""The river was in flood - the snow here has melted and there was rain, so there was a lot of water in the river. ""The van was washed off and turned over on its side, luckily the front was pointing upstream, so it acted like a boat. ""If the water had been hitting the side of the van or the back, the driver would unfortunately have drowned. ""When I got there the driver was extremely distressed."" The van has not yet been recovered from the water He also said that rescuers had put their lives at risk. ""I know they practice for this but in those conditions, with that freezing water travelling at great speed, in the dark and the pouring rain, it was very dangerous and they were very brave,"" he said.

"Rollout of daily contact testing paused in schoolsMore work is needed to understand its benefits in schools in England given the new variant, health officials say.Health","Testing of close contacts of identified cases was due to start in secondary schools and colleges in England The government has paused plans to roll out rapid daily coronavirus testing of close contacts, in all but a small number of secondary schools and colleges. Testing close contacts of a positive case as an alternative to isolation showed some benefits in trials. But the emergence of a new variant means the risk of missing infections has risen, health officials say. Regular testing of staff will now increase to twice a week. More research is needed on how daily contact testing would work given the new, more transmissible, coronavirus variant, Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace say. In the meantime, routine testing to pick up asymptomatic cases in staff and pupils remains a key part of the government's plans. Mass testing in schools, using pregnancy-style lateral flow tests to detect the virus, had been due to start in January. However, under new lockdown restrictions, schools have had to switch to providing online teaching until February - although children of key workers are still allowed to attend - and plans were postponed. How testing of pupils will be organised once schools reopen is still not clear. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? School attendance higher than first lockdown Rapid coronavirus test use defended The original plan for rapid Covid testing in all secondary schools and colleges included: seven days of daily tests for pupils who had been near a positive case daily tests for teachers if they had a case in their class routine weekly testing for teachers The aim was to keep as many children in schools as possible by avoiding a whole bubble, class or year having to be sent home, and to reduce disruption from staff having to isolate. But some scientists have consistently expressed concerns about the accuracy of the rapid tests, which do not need to be sent to a lab for the results. They say the high number of false negatives means close contacts may wrongly think they are not infectious and go on to mix with more vulnerable people. And now PHE and NHS Test and Trace say the new variant, which ""increases the risk of transmission everywhere, including in school settings"", has made this a risk no longer worth taking. ""The balance between the risks (transmission of virus in schools and onward to households and the wider community) and benefits (education in a face-to-face and safe setting) for daily contact testing is unclear,"" their statement adds. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? A government spokesman said: ""NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England have reviewed their advice and concluded that, in light of the higher prevalence and rates of transmission of the new variant, further evaluation work is required to make sure it is achieving its aim of breaking chains of transmission and reducing cases of the virus in the community. ""There is no change to the main rollout of regular testing using rapid lateral flow tests in schools and colleges, which is already proving beneficial in finding teachers and students with coronavirus who do not have symptoms.""

"Cost of living jumps despite Covid Christmas curbsThe UK inflation rate jumps to 0.6% in December from 0.3% in November, led by higher transport costs.","Prices rose at a faster rate in the UK in December, despite Covid curbs that forced non-essential shops to shut. Consumer Prices Index inflation jumped to 0.6%, from 0.3% in November, pushed higher by rising transport and clothes prices,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. Many people rushed to travel and beat Christmas restrictions, forcing up prices. The rise was slightly higher than many economists' forecasts of 0.5%. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: ""Clothing prices put upward pressure on inflation in December, despite some evidence of continued discounting. UK economy shrank in November amid lockdown UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' ""Transport costs, including air, sea and coach fares, as well as petrol prices, rose as some travel restrictions eased during parts of the month. ""These were partially offset by falling food prices, most notably for vegetables and meat."" Statisticians said it was normal for transport costs such as the price of flights to rise at this time of year, but that the rise was bigger than usual. ""Despite the travel restrictions in place in December, prices for air fares followed their usual seasonal pattern, with price increases between November and December 2020, albeit by more than between the same two months in 2019,"" the ONS said. The ONS added that clothing prices rose ""fractionally"" in December, a month in which they usually tend to fall because of sales. Price increases for items such as children's toys, computer games and consoles - which fall under the category of ""recreation and culture"" - also helped push the cost of living higher in December. Food and non-alcoholic drinks were the main things that were cheaper last month, particularly vegetables, the ONS said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the rise in transport costs was partly due to the timing of the ONS survey. ""The ONS collected its data five days closer to Christmas Day last month than in December 2019; airline fares tend to rise sharply as the Christmas holidays approach,"" he said. ""Looking ahead, we expect CPI inflation to hover between 0.5% and 0.8% in [the first quarter], before leaping to 1.5% in April, when Ofgem likely will increase its default tariff cap for electricity and natural gas prices, and the anniversary of last year's slump in oil prices will be met."" Janine Boshoff, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the institute's own measure of underlying inflation, which excludes extreme price movements, remained unchanged at 0.3% in December. ""Our analysis at regional level indicates that regions that entered higher tiers of restrictions in December experienced marked decreases in consumer prices during the month,"" she added. ""Inflation is likely to remain subdued in the short-term due to the effects of continued lockdown measures to stem the spread of Covid-19."" The rate of increase of prices in November was still very modest, but this figure is the first of a few such rises expected. The biggest contributor was an increase in the cost of transport services such as air fares, as well as a smaller decline in clothing prices. Some of these figures are distorted by the unusual pandemic patterns of spending. In the coming months, energy price rises, a return to VAT of 20% and rises in costs of EU imports and freight costs will also push up overall prices. But with pandemic pressures on the economy remaining, such increases in inflation are not likely to require the Bank of England to lift interest rates. It will recalculate its forecasts for the economy next month. Progress in immunisation will be as important for that as the path of inflation. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Self-employed: 'No work and no furlough help'Out-of-date tax systems mean people are falling through the cracks for help, MPs say.","Louise worries about her prospects for the next 12 months Freelance TV and film sound editor Louise Burton is one of those who are unable to benefit from government pandemic support schemes, despite being out of work. Louise, 28, of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, has not had a single penny of assistance since her last job ended eight months ago. ""With the last production that I was on, I was hired as a PAYE freelancer, which means that I essentially do exactly the same job as what I do as a freelancer, but I was paying tax at source,"" she told the BBC. ""What often happens with film is that production companies are made for the sole purpose of the film. So they create these companies and everything goes through the company - and then once the film is completed, they then shut the company."" That means Louise fell foul of tax rules relating to self-employed people. And she could not go on furlough, because the company that had employed her no longer existed. ""I always feel guilty saying that I am one of the people who is suffering, because actually, I still have a roof over my head and I can just about put food on my table, but it's not easy,"" she says, adding that she fears for her prospects in the next 12 months. According to MPs, whole groups of people like Louise are falling through the cracks of Covid-19 support schemes because of out-of-date tax systems. Covid: Self-employed mothers 'deserve equal help' Coronavirus: What help are self-employed getting from government? Some freelancers and self-employed people have been particularly excluded, despite lockdowns and restrictions meaning they cannot work, the Public Accounts Committee said. Others, meanwhile, are able to abuse the system, it said. The government said its ""top priority"" was helping those who are struggling. Since March, HM Revenue and Customs has provided more than Â£80bn in support to companies and individuals through government coronavirus support schemes, the committee said. They are also supporting the incomes of many of the self-employed. But despite this,a report from the MPs,externalsays ""quirks in the tax system"" have meant that groups of workers - including freelancers and self-employed people who recently moved onto company payrolls or work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between - have been ineligible for furlough payments. ""As public spending balloons to unprecedented levels in response to the pandemic, out-of-date tax systems are one of the barriers to getting help to a significant number of struggling taxpayers who should be entitled to support,"" said MP Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). By contrast, she said some large companies that had used government support schemes had continued to pay dividends to shareholders and high salaries to executives. She added that HMRC was in many cases failing ""to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming"" support. The tax agency should explain to freelancers and other groups why they have been excluded from receiving support and set out steps to fix the problem within six weeks, the MPs said. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The PAC also said that a lack of certainty about government coronavirus support schemes had made it difficult for businesses to plan effectively. For example, HMRC could not provide clarity on whether the Job Retention Bonus scheme had been delayed or scrapped, the committee said. The scheme was meant to pay employers an incentive for every worker they brought back from furlough and kept in employment until January. ""Such lack of clarity may lead to unnecessary hardships for some businesses, who in good faith were relying on the payments from the scheme to meet some of their needs,"" the MPs said. A government spokesperson said it had done ""all it can to help as many people as possible"". ""HMRC delivered Covid-19 support schemes at unprecedented speed, protecting the livelihoods of millions of people. ""We do not underestimate the challenges faced by individuals and businesses during the pandemic, and our top priority is getting financial support to those struggling... while protecting the taxpayer against fraud. ""Those not eligible for support through these schemes can still benefit from the strengthened welfare safety net, accessing help like universal credit.""

Charting Bannon's rise and fall,"In the end, the master provocateur ended up provoking the wrong person in the wrong way at the wrong time. Until August 2017, Steve Bannon was arguably the second most powerful man in Washington. The president's one-time chief strategist was the puller of strings, the Trump-whisperer, revelling in his role as an agent of chaos. After the 2016 election, he was among ""the best talent in politics"" - in Trump's words. Then he became ""Sloppy Steve"", a derogatory nickname used by the US president after Bannon was quoted in a book saying several things that appear to have made his former boss unhappy. One example that made headlines was that the president's son, Donald Trump Jr, had committed a ""treasonous"" act in talking to Russians. Bannon's backers cut their ties with him, he left the powerful right-wing media empire Breitbart, and the future of the man behind some of Trump's most headline-grabbing policies was left up in the air. And then in August 2020, more bad news. Bannon was arrested and charged with fraud over an online fundraising scheme to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Prosecutors said he received more than $1m - and used some of it to pay off personal expenses. He pleaded not guilty. Even in a White House where political careers have the life expectancy of a house fly, Bannon's sudden rise and fall over four years is remarkable. Here's how it came about. 17 August 2016 As executive chairman of Breitbart - a combative conservative site with an anti-establishment agenda - Bannon was an early cheerleader for Trump and Trumpism. But it was not until 15 months into the property tycoon's presidential race that Bannon joined his team. By that point he was already, according to a profile on the Bloomberg website, ""the most dangerous political operative in America"", a man with Democrats and establishment Republicans in his crosshairs, and a knack for well-timed confrontation. A disruptive Trump presented Bannon with a golden opportunity. Without Seinfeld, there is no Steve Bannon - it will become clear, don't worry Bannon was born into a family of Irish Catholics - all Kennedy Democrats - in Virginia in November 1953. He was not political, he said, until an eight-year stint with the Navy starting in 1977, when he became a Reagan Republican in response to President Carter's handling of the Iran conflict. A master of reinvention, he went on to work as an executive with the Goldman Sachs bank, before helping finance and produce Hollywood films and later emerging as a political Svengali. His record in Hollywood can be described as patchy at best (""The business runs on talent relationships,""one former colleague told the New Yorker.,external""He had this real will-to-power vibe that was so off-putting."") But Bannon did strike gold in one big way - by negotiating a share of the profits in a new television show, Seinfeld, in 1993. The show ran for nine seasons and was widely syndicated - in November 2016, Forbes estimated that Bannon, if he owned only a 1% share in the show's profits, would have earned $32.6m (Â£24m) by that point. After returning to the US from the Chinese city of Shanghai in 2008 feeling the Bush administration was a ""disaster"", Bannon was struck by what he described to the New Yorker as ""this phenomenon called Sarah Palin"". Bannon warmed to the brand of populism employed by the Alaskan governor picked as John McCain's Republican running mate in the 2008 presidential race. That populist wave would come crashing to shore with Trump's participation in the 2016 election, a wave Bannon proudly rode the whole way. In Trump, he recognised a willing outlet for his idea that, according to Wolff, ""the new politics was not the art of compromise, but the art of conflict"". Read more on Bannon's background Bannon had long talked up Trump's chances on Breitbart News Network, which he took over in 2012 after the death of its founder, Andrew Breitbart. Bannon considered Trump, according to Wolff's book, ""a big warm-hearted monkey"". Like many of the businessman's cheerleaders, Bannon was eventually invited into his inner circle, becoming the CEO of the Trump campaign in August 2016. Dishevelled, regularly unshaven, and prone to wearing two shirts at the same time, he was an unlikely candidate to work closely with Trump, who places a high value on appearance. But somehow it worked. Bannon's economic nationalist outlook and his eagerness for a ""deconstruction of the administrative state"" - a tearing apart of the system of taxes and regulations that he believed had hindered the US over years - chimed with Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" plea. Two days after his arrival, Bannon replaced Paul Manafort as campaign chairman. Bannon's counterpart in the Democratic camp, Robby Mook, responded furiously: ""Donald Trump has decided to double down on his most small, nasty and divisive instincts by turning his campaign over to someone who is best known for running a so-called news site that peddles divisive, sometimes racist... sometimes anti-Semitic conspiracy theories."" The provocateur in Bannon will almost certainly have enjoyed the reaction to his appointment. Less than three months later, he'd have even more to celebrate. 8 November 2016 Trump and Bannon thought as one in the last weeks of the campaign, to the extent thatthe Republican candidate would often demand: ""Where's my Steve? Where's my Steve?"",external, according to one former Trump aide. In interviews after the event, Bannon said he always believed Trump would win. But not everyone else did, according to Michael Wolff's book. Indeed, in the weeks after the billionaire won, ""he had come to credit Bannon with something like mystical powers"" for having predicted the victory. White House appointments aren't often met with wide protests - but then Steve Bannon's was no ordinary appointment Days after the election, Trump named his trusted lieutenant as ""chief strategist"" - a newly created role - in his cabinet. There were wide protests against the decision, and169 members of the House - all Democrats - sent a letter to the president-elect asking him to withdraw Bannon's nomination,external, saying ""bigotry, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia should have no place in our society, and they certainly have no place in the White House"". Bannon's vision was made clear in Trump's bleak inaugural address, which he wrote. Wolff says in his book it was ""a Bannon-driven message to the other side that the country was about to undergo profound change... his take-back-the-country, America-first, carnage-everywhere vision of the country"". The ""American carnage"" speech painted a vision of a US with ""mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation"". Trump's angry inaugural speech explained What promises has Trump kept? The full ramifications of Bannon's America First policy were made clear a week later, with Trump signing an executive order dreamt up by his chief strategist that banned people from seven Muslim-majority countries from travelling to the US. It caught many White House staff unaware. Bannon, Wolff writes, was ""satisfied"" at the move and the subsequent outrage. ""He could not have hoped to draw a more vivid line between the two Americas - Trump's and liberals',"" Wolff writes, adding that the timing of its release before a busy weekend was deliberate - so it could cause as much chaos as possible. One word that regularly features in interviews with Bannon is ""war"". Trump HQ on election night was ""the war room"", the same name he gave to the Oval Office when Trump took over. When Bannon would go on to leave the White House, he said he was going to ""war"" on Trump's behalf. For Bannon, disorder was the new order in the White House. He and Trump were creating conflict and confusion, and that suited Bannon just fine. 28 January 2017 This video can not be played Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency A day after Trump's executive order on immigration was signed, there was another controversial announcement -the US president downgraded military chiefs of staff from his National Security Council and gave a regular seat to Bannoninstead. Only career diplomats and generals usually join the council, the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs. By being invited to be a member, Bannon - in his first government job, aged 63 - was allowed to join high-level discussions about national security. The reaction was, predictably, one of shock. Democrat former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders called the move ""dangerous and unprecedented"", and Obama's former national security adviser Susan Rice tweeted: ""This is stone-cold crazy. After a week of crazy."" The White House, of course, defended their man as being more than capable enough to be on the council, pointing out his Navy service. But in retrospect, this promotion is about as good as it got for Bannon in the White House. 18 August 2017 This video can not be played Some of the people who have resigned or been fired under President Trump In the end,Bannon lasted a little over two months on the National Security Council, leaving in April. It was not a demotion, White House officials said, but the reasons for the change were not clear. Perhaps, just by shaking up the old order, the appointment had done its job. But this change in his responsibilities became an indication of what was to come. After a summer of reports that Bannon was less and less visible in a White House suffering infighting and leaks, he left his position last August. It was sold as a strategic move -Bannon would head back to Breitbart, where he would fight for Trump's agenda. ""I've got my hands back on my weapons,"" he said. ""It's Bannon the Barbarian.""

Breitbart welcomed back what it called its ""populist hero"", with editor-in-chief Alex Marlow saying Bannon had ""his finger on the pulse of the Trump agenda"". But his departure from the White House came at the end of a week in which Bannon had come under fire from a number of quarters, and amid reports of tension with key aides including National Security Adviser HR McMaster. This video can not be played Charlottesville was the culmination of months of protests by white supremacists Clashes had taken place the previous weekend between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, after which Trump blamed ""both sides"" for the violence -Bannon had once said his Breitbart site was ""a platform for the alt-right"",externalwho were responsible for the violence. Two days before he left his job, an interview with Bannon in the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, reportedly infuriated the president. Bannon was quoted as dismissing the idea of a military solution in North Korea, undercutting Trump. Then, a day later,a BuzzFeed report that said that Trump was unhappy with the credit his adviser was taking,externalfor the election victory. ""He undermined Trump's ego,"" Joshua Green, the author of a book on Bannon's relationship with Trump, Devil's Bargain, told the BBC. ""Trump can't abide the thesis of my book and Michael Wolff's book, which is that Bannon is the brains of the operation and Trump is an erratic charlatan. That's what Trump won't abide."" 12 December 2017 Bannon backed Roy Moore in the Alabama senate race - it didn't end well for them Now on the outside looking in, Bannon was more than happy to tell Trump where he thought he was going wrong. He attacked him through Breitbart for reversing course and sending more troops to Afghanistan, and called Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey the biggest mistake in ""modern political history"". But Bannon was back in his natural habitat as he gunned for the Republican establishment, putting his weight behind ultra-conservative populist candidate Roy Moore in a senate race in Alabama. Moore comfortably won the primary against Luther Strange, the incumbent backed by Trump and the Republican machine. This video can not be played Roy Moore: 'Sexual perversion and sodomy sweep this land' But Moore went on to face allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, which he denied, and in December he lost the race to Doug Jones, who became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in 25 years. The five consequences of Moore's defeat Bannon's man, one eventually backed by Trump and the Republican party, had suffered a humiliating loss in what was supposed to be Bannon's first big victory. A win would have given him momentum in his campaign to field populist candidates against Republican senators in the 2018 mid-terms. A loss made that much harder. Bannon - humbled, surprised - credited Democrats for having worked hardest, but the defeat risked grounding his populist movement to a halt. 9 January 2018 This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his 'worst enemies' Trump may once have been Bannon's ""big warm-hearted monkey"". But even cuddly monkeys can bite. As details of Michael Wolff's book emerged, one key line stood out - Bannon described a meeting Donald Trump Jr held in New York with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign as ""treasonous"". ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV,"" he told Wolff. A knife-fight with consequences 11 explosive claims in new book The reaction from the White House - reeling from a special-counsel investigation into possible collusion between the Trump team and Russia - was swift. Bannon had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House position, the president said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Soon after, Rebekah Mercer, a wealthy benefactor of Bannon's, said she had ended her support for his political efforts. Bannon, left with fewer and fewer allies, insisted his comments were not directed at Mr Trump's son but at another former aide, Paul Manafort, who was also present at the meeting in Trump Tower. But there was only one way left to go. The goodbye from Breitbart was polite, and Bannon was out. Somewhere, somehow, Bannon the master string-puller will re-emerge - possibly in a different guise. Could he and Trump ever reconcile? ""Trump has fired people before and then let them back in,"" Joshua Green, the author of Devil's Bargain, said. ""But I've never seen Trump bury somebody as forcefully as he did Bannon, both in his statement and the parade of White House officials who have come out to heap scorn and derision on Bannon. ""It's awfully hard to imagine how Bannon could recover from that."" 20 August 2020 An unexpected twist unfolded ahead of the November 2020 election when Bannon and three other people were arrested and charged with fraud over a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. You'll remember that building this wall was a key pledge of Trump's 2016 campaign, which Bannon played a leading role in. Bannon, Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which raised $25m (Â£19m), the Department of Justice (DoJ) said. Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses, the DoJ said. Each of the two charges - conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering - carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

Putin palace claims give Navalny video hit in jail,"The report claims the vast property features a casino, an ice rink and a vineyard A video investigation by Russia's leading opposition figure that claims President Vladimir Putin spent illicit funds on an extravagant Black Sea palace has reached more than 20 million people within a day of publication. Alexei Navalny's team released it after he was jailed on his return to Moscow. The investigation alleges the property cost Â£1bn ($1.37bn) and was paid for ""with the largest bribe in history"". The Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president. Claims that federal officials were guarding a vast palace complex on the Black Sea coast were ""pure nonsense"", spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Navalny investigation describes the property as 39 times the size of Monaco. The report was released on Tuesday, two days after Mr Navalny flew back from Germany and was arrested at the airport. He was placed in pre-trial detention for 30 days on Monday on a charge of violating probation terms for a suspended sentence for embezzlement that he maintains is politically motivated. A separate case against him was due to start on Wednesday but was postponed. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life The 44-year-old was almost killed in a nerve agent attack last August, which he blamed personally on Mr Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations of security service involvement have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. The report claims the property in the resort town of Gelendzhik was constructed using illicit funds provided by members of Mr Putin's inner circle, including oil chiefs and billionaires. ""[They] built a palace for their boss with this money,"" Mr Navalny says in the video. It alleges that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) owns some 27 sq miles (70 sq km) of land surrounding the private residence. The video was viewed more than 20 million times within a day of its release The report describes various details of the property, and claims it features a casino, an underground ice hockey complex and a vineyard. ""It has impregnable fences, its own port, its own security, a church, its own permit system, a no-fly zone, and even its own border checkpoint,"" Mr Navalny says in the video. ""It is a separate state within Russia,"" he adds. ""And in this state there is a single, irreplaceable tsar. Putin."" Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 Mr Peskov told state news agency RIA Novosti on Tuesday that claims made in the report were ""untrue"" and that the president ""doesn't own palaces"". He went further on Wednesday, insisting that the president declared all his property annually. ""These are all absolutely unfounded claims,"" he said. ""This is pure nonsense and... there's nothing else in it."" The video report was released on Tuesday,externaland, within little over 24 hours, it had already been viewed more than 22 million times. It ends with a plea for people to take to the streets. ""If 10% of those who are disaffected take to the streets, the government will not dare falsify elections,"" Mr Navalny says. Alexei Navalny had already raised the stakes by returning to Russia. It was a direct challenge to President Putin: the man he accuses of ordering his poisoning. So it came as no surprise when he was detained at the airport and remanded in custody for 30 days. But it seems that from his cell, Russia's most high-profile opposition figure still has the power to embarrass the Kremlin. Within hours his investigation into ""Putin's Palace"" had notched up millions of views. Mr Navalny's supporters have called for protests this weekend to demand his release. Will images of an opulent palace and new accusations of corruption bring more people onto the streets? That's unclear. One thing, however, is certain: Mr Navalny has achieved something that seemed impossible just a day ago. In his confrontation with the authorities, he's raised the stakes even higher. On 2 February, a court will consider whether a suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years that Mr Navalny received in 2014 on fraud charges should be converted into a jail term. Three days later, he will face another court appearance, on a charge of libelling a World War Two veteran. He is being held at the Matrosskaya Tishina prison in Moscow, after a judge ordered his detention until 15 February for violating the terms of his suspended fraud sentence. Instead of reporting regularly to the prison service, he was recuperating in Germany from the nerve agent attack. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. He travelled to Russia from Germany - where he had been receiving medical treatment since August - despite warnings he would be arrested on arrival. Mr Navalny said his legal treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described Monday's hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". His lawyers have said they are planning to appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. There are also questions over whether his detention contravenesa 2018 decision by Europe's top human rights court, which found the fraud charges against Mr Navalny were ""arbitrary"".

BBC faces 'financial risk' over licence fee income,"The National Audit Office has had full access to the BBC's accounts since 2010 The BBC faces ""significant"" uncertainty over its financial future due to changes in viewing habits, a National Audit Office report has found. ""While the BBC remains the most used media brand in the UK, its share of younger audiences has been under pressure,"" the spending watchdog said. ""Falling audience share poses a financial risk as people are less likely to pay the licence fee."" The BBC said it had already set out plans for ""urgent"" reforms. According to the NAO report,external, the BBC has seen ""a notable drop"" in audience viewing while its income from the licence fee has also declined. The BBC ""faces considerable uncertainty"" about its licence fee income and should produce ""a long-term financial plan... as soon as possible"", it states. Such a plan, the report recommends, should ""set out the detail for the next stage of its savings, and how it will fund its new strategic priorities"". In 2019-20, the BBC generated total income of Â£4.94bn, of which Â£3.52bn was public funding from the licence fee. That was Â£310m less than the corporation received from the licence fee between 2017-18. The current cost of an annual television licence is Â£157.50 The report also highlighted a 30% decline in BBC TV viewing over the past decade. On average, the amount of time an adult spent watching broadcast BBC television fell from 80 minutes a day in 2010 to 56 minutes in 2019. And the NAO said the BBC's financial health had been ""unexpectedly weakened"" by the impact of the coronavirus response. Last November, the BBC began negotiations with the government about the future funding it will receive from the licence fee. The fee, which is currently Â£157.50 annually, is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends. In response, the BBC said it had made ""significant savings and increased efficiencies, while maintaining our spending on content, and continuing to be the UK's most-used media organisation"". It added: ""We have set out plans for urgent reforms focused on providing great value for all audiences and we will set out further detail on this in the coming months. ""The report also stresses the importance of stable funding for the future, which we welcome as we begin negotiations with government over the licence fee."" The National Union of Journalists said the report's findings ""come as no surprise"" and that the BBC needs ""a financially secure long-term deal that will guarantee its future."" The NAO scrutinises the finances of government departments and other public sector bodies.Last week Richard Sharp, the BBC's incoming chairman, said the licence fee was the ""least worst"" way of funding the corporation, but it ""may be worth reassessing"" in future.

A beginner's guide to being the vice-president,"Kamala Harris spent her first morning as vice-president at a prayer service with the president Kamala Harris has made history, becoming the first woman and first black and South Asian American to serve as US vice-president. So what does the job involve? And what did Ms Harris do first? Historically speaking, not a lot. It has been described as the least understood, most ridiculed and most often ignored constitutional role in the federal government, and for a long time it stayed that way. ""The role of the vice-president was, frankly, to just be that heartbeat away from the president,"" said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Centre. Unless the president died, or was seriously ill, the vice-president's job was largely to sit around and wait. For some vice-presidents, the dynamic meant holding a job you hoped would never be needed. ""One of the vice-presidents in the early 20th Century said, 'Every day I ring the doorbell at the White House and hope the president will answer,'"" Ms Perry said. That's not a role to take lightly. Nine of the country's 45 presidents has left office before the end of their term, eight by death - about one fifth of all presidents - giving their vice-presidents a sudden promotion. At 78 years old, Mr Biden is the oldest president to assume the office, putting added stress on his next-in-line. It wasn't until the 1970s, under President Jimmy Carter, that the vice-president began to assume a bigger role. Mr Carter, a former Georgia governor, had built his candidacy around being a political outsider. ""He knew he didn't know Washington,"" Ms Perry said. So when he won the nomination, he called on Walter Mondale, a long-time US senator, to show him the ropes and be a ""true governing partner"". The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in The first 'second dude' in the White House While their close relationship was new, their strategic match followed a well-worn pattern of vice-presidents offering geographical or ideological balance to the president. The practice has continued on most recent political tickets. Barack Obama, then a relative political newcomer, tapped Joe Biden, a 35-year veteran of the US Senate. Donald Trump went with Mike Pence, whose evangelical bona fides were thought to smooth over Mr Trump's image for the religious right. And Ms Harris offers a counter to Joe Biden's age, gender and race. What's more, this time the ceremonial role held by the vice-president as president of the Senate will prove crucial for Ms Harris' party. There is currently a 50-50 seat split between Democrats and Republicans in the upper chamber, and Ms Harris will cast the deciding ballot in any tie. As she walked along Pennsylvania Avenue with her family in the inauguration parade, Vice-President Harris knew her ceremonial tasks were over. ""I'm just walking to work,"" she said. Moments later she was entering the White House, her new workplace, to join her new boss in tackling some pretty daunting challenges. She has reportedly been in all the key meetings during the transition, helping to shape the Biden agenda, so would have had major input on the 15 executive orders he signed on Wednesday. It wasn't long after arriving at the White House that she was off to the Senate, over which she now presides in her new job. There she swore in three new senators, and gave a chuckle as she read out her own resignation. This video can not be played ""That was very weird"" - Kamala Harris reads her own resignation certificate before swearing in new senators She has not yet moved into the vice-presidential residence, so spent the night in her current address. On Thursday morning she watched the virtual inaugural prayer service and received a daily intelligence briefing. Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will set up home in a different white house - a 19th Century mansion on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory in north-west Washington. Vice-presidents live in a white house, too The estate is close to the White House grounds, where Ms Harris will have her office, and not far from Georgetown University's law school, where Mr Emhoff, an attorney, is set to teach. To get around, Ms Harris and Mr Emhoff will also have access to Air Force Two, a Boeing 757, and they will have round-the-clock security. While Mr Biden and Mr Obama often put their bromance on display during their time in the White House, close personal relationships between presidents and vice-presidents have not been the norm, Ms Perry said. President Barack Obama and Vice-president Biden shared a famously friendly relationship But since Mr Biden officially brought on Ms Harris this summer, it has seemed to be smooth sailing, Ms Perry said. Mr Biden has said ""there's not a single decision I've made yet"" about his administration that he hasn't consulted with Ms Harris on first. She has also interviewed each of Biden's potential cabinet nominees. A friendly relationship makes sense between the two, considering it was Ms Harris' close relationship with Mr Biden's son, Beau - who died of brain cancer in 2015 - that reportedly sealed the deal for Mr Biden. It's a surprise to some who remember Ms Harris' sharp debate-stage attacks aimed directly at Mr Biden when they were both competing for the Democratic nomination. ""Biden clearly lets bygones be bygones,"" Ms Perry said. Mr Biden is likely to model Ms Harris' role after his own time as vice-president. When he introduced her as his running mate at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, he recalled the time he was chosen for the same job by Barack Obama in 2008. Mr Obama asked what Mr Biden wanted from the role. ""I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions,"" Mr Biden said. ""That's what I asked Kamala. I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room. To always tell me the truth."" Ms Harris joined Mr Biden's team as a political star in her own right. Though her own presidential bid failed to find its focus and sputtered to an early halt, it earned her a devoted fan following (they call themselves the #KHive). And despite continued criticism from the left wing of her party, Ms Harris had one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate, pursuing progressive causes like gay rights, immigration, legalisation of marijuana and gun control. She also has an extensive legal rÃ©sumÃ©, having served as California's top lawyer before her Senate bid. Her legal experience and advocacy for police reform will be useful in a White House that has promised to address ""systemic"" misconduct in US police forces. This summer, amid a wave of Black Lives Matters protests, Ms Harris was a vocal supporter of the demonstrations and called for a ""reimagining"" of US policing. But as a vice-presidential ""first"" three times over, she will enter office shouldering heavy expectations. ""While I may be the first woman in this office,"" Ms Harris is fond of saying, ""I will not be the last."" The historic moment for black Americans is worth celebrating, said Jennifer Edwards, senior director at racial justice organisation Color of Change. ""But we learned time and time again that representation alone doesn't lead to transformative change."" ""Hundreds of thousands of black women have fought, organised and voted to reach this moment. Now, Vice-President Kamala Harris has a responsibility to represent demands of the people who ushered her into office,"" she said. Ms Edwards said she will be looking for progress in Covid-19 economic relief, on criminal justice and voting and election reform. As the more left-wing half of the political partnership, Ms Harris may face blame for perceived shortfalls here, and elsewhere in their progressive agenda. And reports that Mr Biden will not seek re-election will mean a balancing act for Ms Harris - how to remain a loyal aide to Mr Biden while also plotting her own run. Firstly, it's crucial that the American public see the vice-president as competent, and able to take the reins as commander-in-chief at any moment. Vice-President Dan Quayle never lived down his spelling mistake This has not always been the case. President George Bush's deputy, Dan Quayle, for example, was ""not viewed as the brightest bulb in the drawer,"" Ms Perry said. The impression was cemented during a visit to an elementary school. A student was called upon to write a word, 'potato', on the chalkboard. ""The student wrote 'potato' as it was correctly spelled,'"" Ms Perry said. But Vice-President Quayle chipped in, saying the word needed an E at the end. A vice-president should also avoid getting on their boss's bad side. Soon after his 1828 election, President Andrew Jackson developed a deep dislike of Vice-President John Calhoun. The two differed on policy and on Washington's social scene. The antipathy between the two grew so intense that Mr Calhoun became the first vice-president in US history to resign. Still, the title for worst vice-presidential mistake probably rests with the country's third, Aaron Burr.

"Cost of living jumps despite Covid Christmas curbsThe UK inflation rate jumps to 0.6% in December from 0.3% in November, led by higher transport costs.BusinessComments","Prices rose at a faster rate in the UK in December, despite Covid curbs that forced non-essential shops to shut. Consumer Prices Index inflation jumped to 0.6%, from 0.3% in November, pushed higher by rising transport and clothes prices,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. Many people rushed to travel and beat Christmas restrictions, forcing up prices. The rise was slightly higher than many economists' forecasts of 0.5%. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: ""Clothing prices put upward pressure on inflation in December, despite some evidence of continued discounting. UK economy shrank in November amid lockdown UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' ""Transport costs, including air, sea and coach fares, as well as petrol prices, rose as some travel restrictions eased during parts of the month. ""These were partially offset by falling food prices, most notably for vegetables and meat."" Statisticians said it was normal for transport costs such as the price of flights to rise at this time of year, but that the rise was bigger than usual. ""Despite the travel restrictions in place in December, prices for air fares followed their usual seasonal pattern, with price increases between November and December 2020, albeit by more than between the same two months in 2019,"" the ONS said. The ONS added that clothing prices rose ""fractionally"" in December, a month in which they usually tend to fall because of sales. Price increases for items such as children's toys, computer games and consoles - which fall under the category of ""recreation and culture"" - also helped push the cost of living higher in December. Food and non-alcoholic drinks were the main things that were cheaper last month, particularly vegetables, the ONS said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the rise in transport costs was partly due to the timing of the ONS survey. ""The ONS collected its data five days closer to Christmas Day last month than in December 2019; airline fares tend to rise sharply as the Christmas holidays approach,"" he said. ""Looking ahead, we expect CPI inflation to hover between 0.5% and 0.8% in [the first quarter], before leaping to 1.5% in April, when Ofgem likely will increase its default tariff cap for electricity and natural gas prices, and the anniversary of last year's slump in oil prices will be met."" Janine Boshoff, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the institute's own measure of underlying inflation, which excludes extreme price movements, remained unchanged at 0.3% in December. ""Our analysis at regional level indicates that regions that entered higher tiers of restrictions in December experienced marked decreases in consumer prices during the month,"" she added. ""Inflation is likely to remain subdued in the short-term due to the effects of continued lockdown measures to stem the spread of Covid-19."" The rate of increase of prices in November was still very modest, but this figure is the first of a few such rises expected. The biggest contributor was an increase in the cost of transport services such as air fares, as well as a smaller decline in clothing prices. Some of these figures are distorted by the unusual pandemic patterns of spending. In the coming months, energy price rises, a return to VAT of 20% and rises in costs of EU imports and freight costs will also push up overall prices. But with pandemic pressures on the economy remaining, such increases in inflation are not likely to require the Bank of England to lift interest rates. It will recalculate its forecasts for the economy next month. Progress in immunisation will be as important for that as the path of inflation. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"PM's aid cut damaged UK's moral leadership, says May","Theresa May has accused her successor Boris Johnson of ""abandoning"" the UK's moral leadership on the world stage. The ex-prime minister said Mr Johnson's decision to cut the overseas aid budget below 0.7% of national income had reduced the UK's global ""credibility"". She wrote in the Daily Mail,externalthe UK had to ""live up to its values"" and would be judged by its actions not its rhetoric. Mr Johnson said the UK was ""embarking on a quite phenomenal year"" of global leadership. Questioned about Mrs May's comments by the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's very important the prime minister of the UK has the best possible relationship with the president of the United States. ""That's part of the job description."" Trump leaves White House for final time May 'cannot support' government's Brexit bill Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budget He cited the UK's hosting ofa global vaccine summit, the upcoming COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, as well as theG7 summit of leading industrial nations, in Cornwall, and his pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 as examples of the UK's global leadership. Mr Blackford called on the PM to reverse ""his cruel policy of cutting international aid for the world's poorest"". This video can not be played The SNP Westminster leader called in the PM to reverse his ""cruel"" international aid policy Later on Wednesday, Joe Biden will be inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States, succeeding Donald Trump. In advance of the event, Mr Johnson  said he looked forward to working ""hand-in-hand"" with the new administration and that post-Covid challenges could only be tackled by ""international co-operation"". But, in an article in the Daily Mail, Mrs May suggested Mr Johnson had squandered international goodwill by choosing not to meet the longstanding UN target of spending 0.7% of income on international development. The government says it cannot meet the figure - enshrined in UK law - this year because of the strain placed on the public finances by the pandemic. Theresa May has made these criticisms - on overseas aid and the threat by the government to override international law - before. Quite often she gets a dig in when she stands up in the House of Commons. But packaging it all up in this way, on this day, is, in the words of one of her close former advisers, ""quite punchy"". The government would rather focus on the relationship it is going to forge with the new US president. Ministers feel they have quite a lot in common with Joe Biden when it comes to working together on the world stage, fighting climate change and co-operating on global security. Mrs May also criticised Mr Johnson's support for legislation which could have allowed the UK to go back on parts of its Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, had it been passed. Controversial clauses were ultimately removed from the Internal Market Bill in December, after the UK and EU reached an agreement. But Mr Johnson's threat to break international law was criticised in Europe and the US - where Mr Biden warned it could imperil peace in Northern Ireland. Mrs May said the UK was ""well placed to play a decisive role in shaping this more co-operative world but to lead we must live up to our values"". ""Other countries listen to what we say not simply because of who we are, but because of what we do. The world does not owe us a prominent place on its stage,"" she added. ""Whatever the rhetoric we deploy, it is our actions which count. So, we should do nothing which signals a retreat from our global commitments."" Mrs May suggested the end of the Trump presidency could be a catalyst for a change in world politics Mrs May, who had a sometimes strained relationship with Mr Trump, said Mr Biden's election presented the UK with a ""golden opportunity"" for Western democracies to reverse the trend towards ""absolutism"" - and a ""few strongmen facing off against each other"" - in global affairs. The UK holds the presidency of the G7 this year and hosts the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Mr Johnson said he looked forward to welcoming Mr Biden to the UK at least twice in 2021. ""In our fight against Covid and across climate change, defence, security, and in promoting and defending democracy, our goals are the same and our nations will work hand-in-hand to achieve them,"" he added.

Smear-test delays prompt calls for DIY screening,"Sophie Davies, from Shropshire, recovering from cervical cancer, says delays to screening could be a matter of life and death Smear-test delays during lockdown have prompted calls for home-screening kits. Cervical cancer screening has restarted across the UK - but some women say they will not attend their appointments for fear of catching Covid. Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust is urging ""faster action"" on home tests for HPV, which causes 99% of cervical cancers. An NHS official said GP practices should continue screening throughout lockdown, and ""anyone invited for a cervical smear test should attend"". Cancer Research UK said it was not yet known how effective and accurate self-sampling could be in cervical screening. Screenings in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have restarted after being halted during the first lockdown. In England, the NHS told GPs and clinics not to halt smear tests - but,as the prime minister heard last week,some patients were experiencing cancellations and long waiting times. About 600,000 tests had failed to go ahead in the UK in April and May,Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said,in addition to a backlog of 1.5 million appointments missed annually. In March, Sophie Davies was told she needed a hysterectomy ""within the month"" but had to wait until December for surgery A survey by gynaecological cancer charity the Eve Appeal indicates nearly one in three missed smear tests are the result of people being ""put off"" by coronavirus. And a Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust survey during the pandemic suggests the same proportion would prefer to take their own human-papillomavirus (HPV) test rather than go to a GP. Acting chief executive Rebecca Shoosmith said coronavirus had added ""more barriers"" to going for a smear test. ""Sadly those who found it difficult before are likely to be no closer to getting tested,"" she said. ""Self-sampling would be a game-changer."" Both charities emphasise smear tests are for ""women and anyone with a cervix"" and transgender and non-binary people may have additional barriers to going. Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said DIY tests could also help people who had been sexually assaulted and those with disabilities or from backgrounds where smear tests were taboo. Samantha Renke felt anxious about catching coronavirus when she went for her smear test Samantha Renke had received an abnormal test result and needed to go for a follow-up test during the pandemic. The broadcaster and campaigner, who has brittle bones and uses a wheelchair, said a home-testing kit would have made things easier. ""I am at very high risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19,"" the 35-year-old, from Lancashire, said. ""So I was incredibly anxious sitting in the waiting room for my test. ""Women with a physical disability are so much more likely to find cervical screening difficult, to the point where it can sometimes be impossible just to get through the door. ""We shouldn't have to fight to get this life-saving test. ""Self-sampling would be so much easier for people like me. ""It would allow me to take my health into my own hands."" Ishita Ranjan said talk of smear tests was taboo in traditional South Asian families Ishita Ranjan finally went for her smear test in August, having put it off for a ""really long time"". ""In most traditional South Asian families, women's sexual health is not something you talk about openly,"" the 31-year-old, from London, said. ""Young women are left to figure this stuff out. ""Until you get married, older female relatives find it problematic to share that kind of information."" A fear of catching coronavirus could be also stopping people belonging to ethnic minorities attending appointments. ""We have seen high Covid infection and death rates and people are genuinely scared,"" Ms Ranjan said. ""But this is essential. ""And it's really important that you do still go and do it. ""I was in and out in five minutes, no sitting around waiting rooms."" Denmark and Australia already offer self-testing and there are pilots to see if it would be viable in the UK In January, a study launched in north and east London, offering 31,000 people overdue for their smear test ahome-testing kit,external Another pilot,externalis under way in Dumfries and Galloway Kits are sent in the post and contain a long cotton bud to take a swab without touching the cervix Anyone testing positive for HPV is asked to have a standard test by a clinician Helen Austin founded At your Cervix, a support network for people who find smear tests difficult After experiencing sexual violence, it took Helen Austin 10 years to work up the courage to go for her smear test. ""When my first invite arrived through the post, years ago, my body froze, and I then ripped it up,"" she said. Self-sampling would have given her time and privacy, the 35-year-old, from Lincolnshire, said. ""If my appointment had been during the pandemic and I could not have brought someone I trust with me to help me, I would never have gone,"" she said. ""Other trauma survivors I speak to find wearing a mask triggering and are putting off attending their test partly for this reason too."" Sophie Davies, 32, saw in the new year alone in hospital, after having a hysterectomy After developing a rare form of cervical cancer, Sophie Davies had a trachelectomy to remove her cervix, in April 2018, allowing doctors to save her ovaries and two-thirds of her womb. But in March 2020, she was told the risk of cancer coming back meant she needed a hysterectomy and the removal of both ovaries. ""I was advised the operation needed to be done 'the sooner the better' and 'within the month',"" the 32-year-old, from Shropshire, said. ""Then, Covid-19 happened."" And she had an ""agonising"" wait, until 30 December, for her surgery. ""I'm still awaiting my results, more than three weeks on, and praying I have not been left for the best part of a year with cancer growing inside me,"" Ms Davies said. ""These months of delay could be the difference in saving fertility or losing fertility. ""It could be the difference in needing chemotherapy or radiotherapy or not needing it, or could be the difference of life or death."" Cancer Research UK early diagnosis head Dr Jodie Moffat said research was under way to understand how effective and accurate self-sampling could be in cervical screening. But getting more people screened ""is not the only hurdle to overcome"". ""The NHS is under immense pressure and would need more staff and equipment to ensure patients receive their results and any follow-up treatment as quickly as possible,"" she said. An NHS official said: ""The NHS guidance that cervical screening should continue has not changed, which has been communicated to GP practices, which have adjusted the way they work to remain open and safe, while local NHS services across the country have put extra measures in place to protect people from coronavirus and so anyone invited for a cervical smear test should attend.""

What happens at the inauguration?,"The inauguration of a new president is a day that usually follows decades of custom and precedent. A day that follows a routine set in stone. Well, you can forget all that this year. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will still take the oath, of course, to make them officially US president and vice-president, but this will be a much scaled back affair, due to Covid and the recent riots. Here's everything you need to know about the big day. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the start of a new presidency, and it takes place in Washington DC. The only required feature is that the president-elect recite the presidential oath of office. ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" What Joe Biden wants to do The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Does Biden's new team better reflect America? Once he utters these words, Mr Biden will then take his place as the 46th president and the inauguration will be complete (but that's not all - celebrations follow). Kamala Harris will become vice-president once she takes the oath of office, which usually happens just before the president. Opening remarks are usually scheduled for around 11:30 EST (16:30 GMT) and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in around midday. By law, inauguration day is always 20 January. Mr Biden will move into the White House later in the day - his home for the next four years. Presidential inaugurations typically involve detailed security plans, but even more so now, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. Officials have ramped up security and closed off large sections of the city. The Secret Service has taken command of the security plans, backed up by some 25,000 National Guard troops, in addition to thousands of police officers. This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration Washington DC is already under a state of emergency and will remain that way through inauguration. Agent Matt Miller, who is leading the security effort on behalf of the Secret Service, told reporters on Friday that planning for the event has been going on for over a year. How security threats have changed Bidenâs inauguration And while Mr Biden has insisted on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition, attendance to the event will be scaled back. It's become customary for the outgoing president to watch the next in line being sworn in, which can sometimes make things awkward. This year, it will be a different type of awkward - the outgoing president will be a no-show. ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,"" Mr Trump tweeted on 8 January. He is widely expected to be travelling to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. Some of his supporters say they are planning a virtual ""second inauguration"" for Mr Trump on the same day (and time) that Mr Biden takes office. More than 68,000 people said on Facebook they would attend an online event to show their support for Mr Trump.  Facebook said it removed this event the week before the inauguration, because it violated its policies. Barack Obama was there to see Donald Trump sworn in When Mr Trump was sworn in, Hillary Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the inauguration - just two months after her election defeat and a bitter campaign against Mr Trump. Only three presidents - John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson - have actively chosen to sit out their successor's inaugurations, and none in the last century. Vice-President Mike Pence, however, has said that he will attend. In normal circumstances, Washington DC would see hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city, swarming the National Mall and selling out hotels - an estimated two million came when President Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009. But this year, the celebration's size will be ""extremely limited"", the Biden team has said, and it has urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital, a call that has been repeated by DC authorities following the storming of Congress.  Viewing stands that had been constructed along the parade route have been taken down. One tradition that will be preserved is that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will still take their oaths in front of the US Capitol, overlooking the Mall (a tradition that started with President Ronald Reagan in 1981). About 200 people will sit, socially distanced, on the stage with them,the Washington Post reports,external. There will be masks and everybody on the platform will have to be tested within a couple of days of the event itself, it added. As for the moment of the swearing in itself, Mr Bidensaid back in June that he would not wear one to take the presidential oath,external. Inauguration rehearsals took place on Monday on the West Front at the Capitol In the past, up to 200,000 tickets were up for grabs to attend the official ceremony, but with infections still surging across the US, only around 1,000 tickets will be available. This year, there will still be a ""pass in review"" ceremony - a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, where the new commander in chief inspects the troops, but instead of the usual parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, organisers say they will host a ""virtual parade"" across the US. Chairs are arranged to allow for social distancing Mr Biden, Ms Harris and their spouses will then be escorted to the White House by members of the military, including a band and drum corps. Tickets are required for seated and standing areas near the stage and seats along the parade route in normal years, and traditionally, the rest of the National Mall remained open to the public. So if you want to watch the inaugural ceremonies from up close, you'll need to talk to your local representatives first. Inaugural balls and other related events around the city require separate tickets. Barack Obama's first inauguration reportedly drew some two million people to the celebrations Senators and members of Congress are the keepers of the keys. Each has an allotted number of free tickets that they can distribute. This year's pandemic-restricted number amounts to each lawmaker plus a guest. Commemorative tickets will be available for constituents after inauguration day. In recent years, incoming presidents have added some of the country's most beloved performers to the day's programme. Despite the pandemic, this year won't be any different. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga - an active supporter of the incoming president - who will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will sing during the ceremony's musical performance. After Mr Biden is sworn in, actor Tom Hanks will host 90-minutes of primetime television - a Covid-friendly replacement of celebrations typically held in-person. It will feature Garth Brooks, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake and will be broadcast across all major US networks and streaming platforms - with the exception of Fox News, a conservative network that has primarily supported Mr Trump during his presidency. Beyonce performed at both of Obama's inaugurations In 2009, Aretha Franklin sang at Barack Obama's inauguration, performing My Country 'Tis of Thee. BeyoncÃ© was also present, singing At Last to the first couple at Mr Obama's inaugural ball. At his second inauguration in 2013, President Obama called on Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to do the honours. BeyoncÃ© was back again, this time to sing the national anthem. Donald Trump reportedly had more trouble booking performers. Elton John declined Mr Trump's offer to perform, and reports circulated that Celine Dion, Kiss and Garth Brooks did the same. In the end, the Rockettes, country artist Lee Greenwood, and the band 3 Doors Down turned out for Mr Trump's day. Third time lucky: Biden's journey to White House.

Patel 'working to get jabs to frontline roles',"The home secretary (centre) says ministers are working to get frontline workers vaccinated Ministers are working to ensure police and other front-line workers are moved up the priority list for the Covid vaccine, the home secretary has said. Priti Patel told the BBC there was ""a lot of work taking place in government right now"" on the issue. The committee advising the government on vaccines has also said it will consider factors like exposure risk and occupation in the rollout's next phase. The most vulnerable are being prioritised for the vaccine first. The government is aiming to offer everyone in the top four priority groups a first dose by mid-February. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the government was ""on track"" to meet the pledge, however, he said it was ""very hard"" because of constraints on supply. Asked whether groups whose work brings them into contact with others, such as police officers, emergency service workers and teachers, should be vaccinated next, the prime minister said the government must rely on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). However, he said the government wanted those groups to be vaccinated ""as soon as possible"". When will I get a Covid vaccine? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Patel: UK should have closed borders in March 2020 Vaccine rollout extended to over-70s in England Ms Patel, in response to being asked whether she wanted to see police officers ""bumped up the queue"" for the vaccine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's both police, fire and other front-line workers. And the health secretary and I are working to absolutely try and make that happen. ""This isn't just something we are thinking about. There is a lot of work taking place in government right now. ""If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says that is a possibility, we can make it happen. We have the supply, we have the logistical plans in place, we will absolutely work to make that happen."" Residents in care homes for older adults and their carers 80-year-olds and over and front-line health and social care workers 75-year-olds and over 70-year-olds and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals When will I get a vaccine? Ms Patel added that Health Secretary Matt Hancock was ""supporting all our efforts across government on this"" and she was talking to police partners, including the National Police Chiefs Council and the Met Police Commissioner, about getting officers ""ready to take the vaccine when that comes"". Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the JCVI, which advises the government, said phase two of the rollout would continue to work down the priority list through the over-50s. However, he told BBC Radio 5 live phase two would also concentrate on people who are potentially at risk of being exposed to the virus, such as teachers and police officers, as well as ""those that are important to keep the economy running"". ""There are a lot of factors in phase two which we'll be looking at in depth,"" he added. Questions about who will be next in the priority list for vaccination once the first phase is complete keep coming. If all goes well with rollout, by the end of April all the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions should have been offered a jab. But what happens after that has not been decided - and will not be until nearer the time. Ministers heed the advice of an expert committee, the JCVI, and they want to know more about the effectiveness of vaccine and to what extent it stops transmission - people who have been vaccinated passing on the virus even if they themselves do not fall sick. Knowing that is crucial. If it stops transmissions - known as sterilising immunity - the next phase could involve targeting the vaccine at people who are most likely to spread it. That could see younger age groups prioritised, for example. But if the vaccine does not do that the preference, as it is currently, would be to target the vaccine at those most at risk. Once you get down to the under-50s without health conditions the risk is small. Less than 1% of Covid deaths have been in these age groups. At such low levels of risk exposure becomes a more crucial factor, which is why there is a logic in targeting key workers like teachers, the police and transport workers. But phasing vaccination in this way is more complex than simply working through the age groups, and so, in the end, may mean vaccination rollout takes longer overall There is a fine balance to tread. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Asked when phase two would begin, Prof Harnden said: ""We haven't put a timescale on it, but we will be looking at this over the next few weeks."" ""One of the really difficult things about this vaccine is we don't know yet whether it prevents transmission,"" he said. ""If we can show through data that the vaccine does prevent transmission, it's a whole new ball game in terms of who we immunise because of course we may look at groups that actually transmit that virus to others."" It comes after Met Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said she was ""baffled"" about why front-line police officers were not closer to the front of the queue to receive the vaccine. The Fire Brigades Union said it was ""glad"" Ms Patel ""appears to be listening"" to its calls for firefighters to receive priority access to vaccinations. But it said ""vaccines alone will not secure the safety of firefighters and the public"" and called for safety measures in fire services to be properly implemented. The teachers' union NASUWT welcomed support from ministers to prioritise education staff for the vaccine and called for the government to ""make good"" on their comments. General secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: ""Alongside the need for tougher control measures in schools and colleges, providing education workers with access to vaccines will help to minimise further disruption to children's education and help ensure the safe and sustainable resumption of school and college-based education for all pupils as quickly as possible."" Last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid he wanted school staff to be a ""top priority"" for the vaccine in the next phase of the rollout. Ms Patel was also asked about why the rollout of the vaccine appeared to be slower this week than last week. She said Pfizer, which is producing one of the vaccines being used in the UK, was upgrading its factories and changing its supply chains, which would ""inevitably have an implication in terms of the actual supply of the vaccine"". More than 4.2 million people in the UK have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine so far, including more than half of over-80s and half of elderly care home residents.

Child gender clinic rated 'inadequate',"The Gender Identity Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust The NHS's child gender-identity service has been rated ""inadequate"" after inspectors identified ""significant concerns"". The Care Quality Commission inspected the Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust in October. More than 4,600 young people were on the waiting list and some had waited over two years for a first appointment. The trust said it took the CQC report ""very seriously"". England and Wales' only children's gender-identity service was inspected after healthcare professionals and the children's commissioner for England raised concerns around ""clinical practice, safeguarding procedures, and assessments of capacity and consent to treatment"". The children's commissioner had been providedevidence of staff concernsby BBC Newsnight. The CQC's previous inspection, in 2016, had resulted in an overall ""good"" rating. But in the latest inspection at clinics run by the trust in north London and Leeds, Gids was rated: ""inadequate"" for being well led and responsive to patients' needs ""requires improvement"" for being safe and effective ""good"" for being caring - with staff being said to treat young people with ""compassion and kindness"" Overall, the service is now rated as ""inadequate"". And the CQC has begun enforcement action, demanding monthly updates of the numbers on the waiting list and actions to reduce them. The inspectors found Gids ""difficult to access"" and raised concerns over managing the risk to those on the waiting list, saying many of those waiting for or receiving a service were ""vulnerable and at risk of self-harm"". ""The size of the waiting list meant that staff were unable to proactively manage the risks to patients waiting for a first appointment,"" they added. Record-keeping at Gids was also criticised, with the CQC noting that ""staff had not consistently recorded the competency, capacity and consent of patients referred for medical treatment before January 2020"". This had changed since, but the CQC noted that in an audit of 10 records of young people referred for hormone blockers in March 2020, ""only three contained a completed consent form and checklist for referral"". by Hannah Barnes and Deborah Cohen, BBC Newsnight A rating of inadequate is the lowest a healthcare provider can receive from the Care Quality Commission. It means that a service is ""performing badly"". Gids had been rated good at its last inspection in 2016, but since then a number of concerns have been raised about the service. The number of young people referred to Gids has increased significantly in recent years - leading to some of the delays in care highlighted by the inspection. BBC Newsnight has explored the standard of healthcare received by young people questioning their gender identity for the last 18 months. In that time, NHS England has changed its guidance on the use of puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, saying little is known about the long-term side effects, and an independent review of this area of health is under way. Last June we revealed how some Gids staff had raised serious concerns about safeguarding at the service, the speed of assessments, and whether patients' traumatic backgrounds and other difficulties were always adequately explored. The comments were made as part of an official internal review into Gids, which also described how staff felt they had been ""shut down"". We also discovered that some of these concerns dated back to 2005. Furthermore, it was not possible to clearly understand why clinical decisions had been made. After reviewing 35 care records, the CQC found there was ""no clearly defined assessment process"" and ""many records did not demonstrate good practice"". The records also appeared to be ""insufficient"" in considering the needs of young people with autism spectrum disorders. In a sample of 22 records, the CQC found more than half mentioned autistic spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but ""records did not demonstrate consideration of the relationship between autistic spectrum disorder and gender dysphoria"". Significant variation in the clinical approach of different staff members was also noted. Assessments of young people ranged from ""two or three sessions"" in some cases to over 25, or even more than 50. CQC deputy chief inspector of hospitals Kevin Cleary said his team continued to monitor the trust ""extremely closely"" and inspected the service again because ""we were extremely clear that there were improvements needed in providing person-centred care, capacity and consent, safe care and treatment, and governance"". ""In addition, vulnerable young people were not having their needs met as they were waiting too long for treatment."" The leadership at the trust knew ""exactly what improvements are needed"", he added. The trust said: ""We take the CQC's report very seriously and would like to say sorry to patients for the length of time they are waiting to be seen, which was a critical factor in arriving at this rating."" Accepting there was a ""need for improvements in our assessments, systems and processes"", the trust said it agreed with the CQC that the ""growth in referrals has exceeded the capacity of the service"". It added improvements were being made, saying: ""We are already finalising plans to bring in senior clinical and operational expertise from outside the service to help us implement the necessary changes and consider how we can improve on current processes and practice - including how we standardise our assessment process.""

"Musicians 'failed by government', stars say","Liam Gallagher, Sir Elton John and Nicola Benedetti have put their names to the letter Some of the UK's biggest music stars have written to the government demanding action to ensure visa-free touring in the European Union. Sir Elton John, Liam Gallagher and Nicola Benedetti are among 110 artists who have signed the open letter. It said they had been ""shamefully failed"" by the government over post-Brexit travel rules for UK musicians. The government said the signatories should be asking the EU why they ""rejected the sensible UK proposal"". Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will meet music industry representatives on Wednesday to address their concerns. Earlier this week, culture minister Caroline Dinenage said the EU's ""very broad"" offer ""would not have been compatible with the government's manifesto commitment to take back control of our borders"". However, she said ""the door is open"" if the EU was willing to consider the UK's proposals to reach an agreement for musicians. In the meantime, she confirmed, musicians and artists touring the continent ""will be required to check domestic immigration and visitor rules for each member state in which they intend to tour"". That may require them to have multiple visas or work permits, which some industry experts say will be expensive and potentially prohibitive - especially for musicians at the start of their careers. EU blames UK after outcry over musicians' touring Pressure mounts over EU tour visas for musicians Other names on the open letter include Ed Sheeran, Sir Simon Rattle, Sting, Radiohead, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, Kim Wilde, Roger Daltrey, Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis, and Judith Weir, Master of the Queen's Music. The letter was organised by the Incorporated Society of Musicians and the Liberal Democrats, andpublished in The Times,external. ""The reality is that British musicians, dancers, actors and their support staff have been shamefully failed by their government,"" it said. ""The deal done with the EU has a gaping hole where the promised free movement for musicians should be. Everyone on a European music tour will now need costly work permits for many countries they visit and a mountain of paperwork for their equipment."" The extra costs will ""tip many performers over the edge"", it claimed. ""We call on the government to urgently do what it said it would do and negotiate paperwork-free travel in Europe for British artists and their equipment,"" it added. ""For the sake of British fans wanting to see European performers in the UK and British venues wishing to host them, the deal should be reciprocal."" The Who frontman Daltrey signed despite telling the BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme in 2018: ""It's nothing that can't be solved. I mean, we used to work in Europe before the EU was even thought about. We had the golden period of the 60s and the 70s."" This video can not be played The Who frontman Roger Daltrey gave his take on Brexit in 2018 On Wednesday, the veteran rocker said the two positions were compatible. ""I have not changed my opinion on the EU,"" he said in a statement to the PA news agency. ""I'm glad to be free of Brussels, not Europe. ""I would have preferred reform, which was asked for by us before the referendum and was turned down by the then president of the EU. I do think our government should have made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority. ""Every tour, individual actors and musicians should be treated as any other 'goods' at the point of entry to the EU with one set of paperwork. Switzerland has borders with five EU countries, and trade is electronically frictionless. Why not us?"" Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, said: ""World-renowned performers, emerging artists from every genre and the most respected figures from leading organisations within our sector are now sending a clear message. ""It is essential for the government to negotiate a new reciprocal agreement that allows performers to tour in Europe for up to 90 days, without the need for a work permit."" Responding to the letter, a UK government spokesperson said that musicians' concerns were being taken seriously. ""We absolutely agree that musicians should be able to work across Europe,"" they said in a statement. ""The UK Government put forward a proposal, based on feedback from the music sector, that would have allowed musicians to tour - but the EU repeatedly rejected this. ""The EU's offer in the negotiations would not have worked for touring musicians: it did not deal with work permits at all, and would not have allowed support staff to tour with artists. The signatories of this letter should be asking the EU why they rejected the sensible UK proposal.""

Meanwhile HMRC is failing ""to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming"" support, the Public Accounts Committee says. The government said its ""top priority"" was helping those who are struggling. Since March, HM Revenue and Customs has provided more than Â£80bn in support to companies and individuals through government coronavirus support schemes, the committee says. They are also supporting the incomes of many of the self-employed.

Indigenous communities in the Brazilian city of Manaus have started receiving vaccinations In recent days, we're been reporting stories of desperate oxygen shortages and over-run hospitals in Manaus in Brazil's Amazonas state. In the latest news from the city, some residents are queuing for up to 12 hours to buy their own oxygen tanks because of reports of high death rates in hospitals. ""Everyone here has a family member being treated at home. They prefer that to leaving them to die in the hospitals,"" one resident told AFP news agency. Brazil has been hit badly by Covid-19, with more than 211,000 deaths so far (the second highest in the world) and political discord over how to manage the crisis. But on Tuesday there was some good news for the county's badly-affected indigenous communities. Around 1,000 doses of the Chinese coronavirus vaccine are being flown deep into the Amazon rainforest along with military personnel to reach remote groups who are sometimes days away from medical clinics. Infections across the entire Americas region are currently extremely high, warns the World Health Organization's regional director. Carissa Ettiene said the rise in cases in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and the United States was a worrying sign that the region was failing to control the pandemic - last week the region registered more than half the world's new infections. Dr Ettiene suggested that new variants detected in Britain, South Africa and Brazil could be responsible.  Top-ranked Djokovic arrived in Australia last week ahead of the major We've been following the plight of 72 Australian Open tennis players confined to Melbourne hotel rooms after arriving on a plane that was also carrying covid infected passengers. World number one Novak Djokovic had made some demands for these players which were turned down by the government and today he insists he was not being ""selfish, difficult and ungrateful"". Djokovic is part of a group of top players enjoying better conditions while quarantining in Adelaide, but the 33-year-old said he had felt obliged to use his ""hard-earned"" privileges to make suggestions to tournament director Craig Tiley on how to improve conditions for players in Melbourne. In a long social media post, Djokovic wrote: ""I've earned my privileges the hard way and for that reason it is very difficult for me to be a mere onlooker knowing how much every help, gesture and good word mattered to me when I was small and insignificant in the world pecking order."" There have beencomplaints about miceat one quarantine hotel. A further 13,800 people have had their first vaccine in the past day in Wales, figures show There will be no ""significant easing"" of Wales' Covid restrictions when the guidelines are reviewed later this month, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has warned. He said in a Welsh Government briefing that while it was ""good news"" that case rates were falling, they still remain high. The NHS remains ""under pressure"", with critical care services operating at 150% of capacity, added Mr Gething. Mr Gething made the comments as he was outlining the current situation with Covid in Wales, but he said he did not want to prejudge a Welsh Government decision on the review. Wales has been in a level four lockdown since before Christmas, with a decision on a review of the current restrictions expected by 29 January. Read more here. Daily confirmed coronavirus cases are starting to fall overall - although they were higher today than on Tuesday. Today there were new 38,905 cases compared with more than 60,000 per day in early January. However daily deaths are increasing and the prime minister says there will be ""more to come"". The UK recorded a new daily high of 1,820 deaths. At the currrent rate of progress, the government would need to increase the rate of vaccination to meet the goal of 15m people by 15 February. Freelance TV and film sound editor Louise Burton isone of those who are unable to benefit from government pandemic support schemes, despite being out of work. Louise, 28, of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, has not had any financial assistance since her last job ended eight months ago. Louise fell foul of tax rules relating to self-employed people
and could not go on furlough, because the company that had employed her no
longer existed - with companies often created solely for the production of a film and then closed once it is completed. While she says she still has a roof over her head and can âjust
about put food on the tableâ, things are ânot easy"" and she fears for her
prospects in the next 12 months. According to MPs,external, whole
groups of people like Louise are falling through the cracks of Covid-19 support
schemes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned ""there will be more to come"", when asked about the record number of Covid-19 deaths recorded today. He said: ""These figures are appalling, and of course we think of the suffering that each one of those deaths represents to their families and to their friends. ""I've got to tell you... there will be more to come because what we're seeing is the result of the wave of the new variant that we saw just before Christmas on December 18, or thereabouts."" He said it had been ""a very big peak of infection"" which has ""spread very quickly"", not just where it started in London and the South East but now across the UK. Mr Johnson added: ""It's true that it looks as though the rates of infection in the country overall may now be peaking or flattening but they're not flattening very fast and it's clear that we must keep a grip on this. ""We must maintain discipline, formation, keep observing the lockdown."" John and Susan Docherty died within nine days of each other A woman whose parents died with Covid-19 within days of each other is urging people to take the virus seriously. Katie Tong's mum Susan Docherty 62, and her husband John, 65, died in November 2020. Mrs Docherty had suffered with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and retired taxi driver Mr Docherty had asthma. Both moved to Shrewsbury from Scotland 17 years ago. Mrs Tong was allowed to be in hospital with her mother for her final hours, but had to say goodbye to her father via a video call on 22 November. ""I am heartbroken because he died without his family and loved ones around him,"" she says. ""I have lost two people I loved dearly due to Covid-19. Covid-19 killed them. ""Please take this seriously. I've lost my mum and dad, but this could happen to anyone."" Read the full storyhere. In case you missed Prime Minister's Questions earlier here are some of the key moments. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why the prime minister had not closed the borders to slow the spread of the virus in March, aftera recording emerged of Home Secretary Priti Patel saying she had been an ""advocate"" of such a move. This video can not be played And after being asked to commit to an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, Boris Johnson said the NHS was under ""unprecedented pressure"" and the idea that state resources should be used for an inquiry ""in the middle of the pandemic does not, I think, seem sensible to me"". This video can not be played You can catch up with everything that happened at PMQshere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Detailed
analysis of coronavirus samples has revealedhow and when the virus got into the country. The UKâs
epidemic was largely started by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in
early-to-mid-March and France in mid-to-late-March. China, where
the pandemic started, had a negligible impact. Completely
shutting the borders in March could have prevented some of those cases from
Spain and France coming in and sparking more outbreaks. But it is clear
the virus was here and spreading by that point. So the best
case scenario is it could have bought a bit of time, which begs the question: âTime to do what?â You have to
view border control as only one part of the governmentâs overall strategy. New Zealand,
which has faced minimal disruption from Covid, used its closed borders
alongside lockdown to go for a âzero-Covid strategyâ, which has never been on
the cards in the UK. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under half of the 1,820 deaths reported in the UK today happened yesterday. A further quarter occurred on Monday or Sunday. So there are some old deaths in here (about 8% happened more than a week ago), but the rise to 1,820 reflects a genuine rise in the number of people dying. Deaths that are reported today are likely to reflect infections that happened around Christmas time, so we are likely to see deaths continue to rise for some time yet, since cases continued to rise after Christmas. So when, roughly, did the deaths reported today happen?  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is the second consecutive daydeaths have hit a new high. That, unfortunately, was to be expected as it is a reflection of the surge in cases seen during December. It takes a week or two from the point of infection for someone to become seriously ill â and they can then spend some time fighting for their life. The high number is also a result of delays reporting deaths â a quarter of those reported today happened last week or even before. But make no mistake: the death toll is going up. If you look at the average over the course of a week, the numbers being reported at the moment are twice what they were just two weeks ago. However, we also know they should soon start coming down. The number of daily infections are falling, with signs lockdown is taking effect. For four days in a row new diagnoses have been below 40,000, after averaging 60,000 at the start of the year. It could be another week or so before we start to see the impact of that in the death figures. The hope then would be that, within a few weeks, we could start seeing a more rapid fall as the impact of the vaccination programme begins to bite. But before that happens, the daily totals reported could - sadly - go even higher. A former Royal Marine who fought in Afghanistan saidhome-schooling in the first lockdown last year pushed him to ""breaking point"". Mark Ormrod, from Plymouth, reminded parents it is ""normal"" to struggle. He described working for a veterans' charity while teaching two of his children as ""traumatic"", adding: ""I was going to bed each night drained and wiped out."" Mr Ormrod, who lost both legs and an arm when he stepped on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2007, said he was ""caught off guard"" when schools closed to most children. ""Sometimes I'd go three or four days without putting my legs on, and even getting out of my pyjamas didn't seem worth it because my workload was mounting up and I had to stick to the teaching schedule,"" he said. The father-of-three, who is classed as a key worker along with his partner, has been able to send their children back to school in the latest lockdown. Every time the coronavirus passes from person to person it picks up tiny changes to its genetic code, but scientists are starting to notice patterns in how the virus is mutating. Nearly a year after the global Covid-19 pandemic started, the issue of mutations looms large, with new variants capable of a faster spread emerging, leading to questions about whether they will make the newly-approved vaccines less effective. Virologists are trying to learn as much as possible about these variations, and how to neutralise them, with Michael Worobey, a viral evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, saying in the future the world could ""be in an arms race with this virus"". Our friends at BBC Future have told the full storyhere. Israel is currently in its third lockdown since the pandemic began there last year A nationwide lockdown in Israel is to be extended until the end of the month amid a spike in cases - despite an intense vaccination campaign, with more than two of the nine million population already having received their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It takes time for immunity to build
up, so its expected to take several weeks for vaccines to have an impact
on cases The man coordinating Israelâs pandemic
response, Nachman Ash, has warned that a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine in the country has been âless effective than we thoughtâ. According to Israeli Army Radio, Prof Ash told cabinet
members on Tuesday the data on the protective effect of a first dose against
the virus was âlower than Pfizer presentedâ. Pfizer saidits vaccine was roughly 52% effective two weeks after the first dose,externaland reaches
maximum efficacy of 95% after the second. Itâs not clear what data he is
referring to, but a not-yet published study from Israelâs largest healthcare
provider suggested a 33% fall in infections by day 14, at which point, full
immunity would not have been reached. Infections continued to fall in the
following days but the numbers were too small to put a percentage on it. Israel saw its highest daily case figure on Monday with 10,000 new infections The health ministry said on Tuesdaymore than 12,400 Israelis had tested positive for Covid-19 ten days after being vaccinated,externalâ 69 of these had already received a second dose. This was 6.6% of the 189,000 people who took Covid tests after being vaccinated, roughly tallying with the reported efficacy. Health experts say they are analysing the new Israeli data closely but warn it may be too early to draw any conclusions on the single dose efficacy of the vaccine based on the initial data gathered in Israel, which began vaccinating its population on 19 December. Members of the military are to be brought in to help medical staff in Northern Ireland in the fight against Covid-19. Some 100 medically-trained military staff are expected to be deployed in hospitals to ease the pressure on staff. It is thought the first military staff could be made available as early as next week, after Northern Irelandâs Health Minister Robin Swann made a request to the Ministry of Defence. While military help has already been used during the pandemic to transport equipment and patients, this is the first time military staff will be used in hospitals in Northern Ireland. Read more here. The Ministry of Justice could open courts in England and Wales for longer to help clear the backlog of cases built up during the pandemic, a justice minister said. Chris Philp told MPs that 20,000 remote hearings a week are now taking place and said ""we are adding more courtrooms, further increasing remote hearings and examining options for longer operating hours"". Labour shadow justice secretary David Lammy said victims were ""being denied the speedy justice that our society owes them"", with estimates showing the current backlog would ""take 10 years to clear at pre-pandemic rates"". He added the government's cuts to the justice system since 2010 have played a part in the current backlog. The comments come after criminal justice watchdogs warnedthe issues caused by the pandemic could damage the system for years. A further 1,820 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now 93,290. Yesterday's figure of 1,610 deaths was the previous highest daily total. Another 38,905 positive Covid cases have also been reported in the past 24 hours. Reality Check South Africa has had more than a third of all the Covid-19 cases in Africa and numbers are surging with the emergence of a new variant of the virus. But unlike some other badly hit countries in the world, South Africa, which has a population of 59.6 million, is yet to start its vaccination programme. President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa has so far secured twenty million doses, due to be delivered in the first half of 2021, but there's no detailed timeline for a programme. The country expects to acquire doses from several sources. There's been concern that many poorer countries are being left behind in the global competition to secure vaccine supplies - but as the continent's richest nation, critics suggest South Africa should not be in this position.

While military help has already been used during the pandemic to transport equipment and patients, this is the first time military staff will be used in hospitals in Northern Ireland. Read more here. The Ministry of Justice could open courts in England and Wales for longer to help clear the backlog of cases built up during the pandemic, a justice minister said. Chris Philp told MPs that 20,000 remote hearings a week are now taking place and said ""we are adding more courtrooms, further increasing remote hearings and examining options for longer operating hours"". Labour shadow justice secretary David Lammy said victims were ""being denied the speedy justice that our society owes them"", with estimates showing the current backlog would ""take 10 years to clear at pre-pandemic rates"". He added the government's cuts to the justice system since 2010 have played a part in the current backlog. The comments come after criminal justice watchdogs warnedthe issues caused by the pandemic could damage the system for years. A further 1,820 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now 93,290. Yesterday's figure of 1,610 deaths was the previous highest daily total. Another 38,905 positive Covid cases have also been reported in the past 24 hours. Reality Check South Africa has had more than a third of all the Covid-19 cases in Africa and numbers are surging with the emergence of a new variant of the virus. But unlike some other badly hit countries in the world, South Africa, which has a population of 59.6 million, is yet to start its vaccination programme. President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa has so far secured twenty million doses, due to be delivered in the first half of 2021, but there's no detailed timeline for a programme. The country expects to acquire doses from several sources. There's been concern that many poorer countries are being left behind in the global competition to secure vaccine supplies - but as the continent's richest nation, critics suggest South Africa should not be in this position.

"Inflation jumps despite Covid Christmas curbsThe UK inflation rate jumps to 0.6% in December from 0.3% in November, led by higher transport costs.","Prices rose at a faster rate in the UK in December, despite Covid curbs that forced non-essential shops to shut. Consumer Prices Index inflation jumped to 0.6%, from 0.3% in November, pushed higher by rising transport and clothes prices,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. Many people rushed to travel and beat Christmas restrictions, forcing up prices. The rise was slightly higher than many economists' forecasts of 0.5%. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: ""Clothing prices put upward pressure on inflation in December, despite some evidence of continued discounting. UK economy shrank in November amid lockdown UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' ""Transport costs, including air, sea and coach fares, as well as petrol prices, rose as some travel restrictions eased during parts of the month. ""These were partially offset by falling food prices, most notably for vegetables and meat."" Statisticians said it was normal for transport costs such as the price of flights to rise at this time of year, but that the rise was bigger than usual. ""Despite the travel restrictions in place in December, prices for air fares followed their usual seasonal pattern, with price increases between November and December 2020, albeit by more than between the same two months in 2019,"" the ONS said. The ONS added that clothing prices rose ""fractionally"" in December, a month in which they usually tend to fall because of sales. Price increases for items such as children's toys, computer games and consoles - which fall under the category of ""recreation and culture"" - also helped push the cost of living higher in December. Food and non-alcoholic drinks were the main things that were cheaper last month, particularly vegetables, the ONS said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the rise in transport costs was partly due to the timing of the ONS survey. ""The ONS collected its data five days closer to Christmas Day last month than in December 2019; airline fares tend to rise sharply as the Christmas holidays approach,"" he said. ""Looking ahead, we expect CPI inflation to hover between 0.5% and 0.8% in [the first quarter], before leaping to 1.5% in April, when Ofgem likely will increase its default tariff cap for electricity and natural gas prices, and the anniversary of last year's slump in oil prices will be met."" Janine Boshoff, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the institute's own measure of underlying inflation, which excludes extreme price movements, remained unchanged at 0.3% in December. ""Our analysis at regional level indicates that regions that entered higher tiers of restrictions in December experienced marked decreases in consumer prices during the month,"" she added. ""Inflation is likely to remain subdued in the short-term due to the effects of continued lockdown measures to stem the spread of Covid-19."" The rate of increase of prices in November was still very modest, but this figure is the first of a few such rises expected. The biggest contributor was an increase in the cost of transport services such as air fares, as well as a smaller decline in clothing prices. Some of these figures are distorted by the unusual pandemic patterns of spending. In the coming months, energy price rises, a return to VAT of 20% and rises in costs of EU imports and freight costs will also push up overall prices. But with pandemic pressures on the economy remaining, such increases in inflation are not likely to require the Bank of England to lift interest rates. It will recalculate its forecasts for the economy next month. Progress in immunisation will be as important for that as the path of inflation. Why are prices rising in the UK?

Â£80m for treatment services in drug crackdown,"Drug treatment services in England are to receive an extra Â£80m as part of government's efforts to cut crime. This will mean more places for people released from prison and criminals handed community sentences. It comes after warnings last year over government cuts to help for addicts. A further Â£40m is being earmarked for law enforcement to target drug gangs including so-called county lines operations in which young and vulnerable people act as couriers. The investment will also see another Â£28m put into a three-year pilot project called ADDER - Addiction, Diversion, Disruption, Enforcement and Recovery - which will combine policing with treatment and recovery services. The funding will see police target dealers, and local councils and health services help people with addictions, in five areas with high rates of drug use - Blackpool, Hastings, Middlesbrough, Norwich and Swansea Bay. Young drug users offered support over prosecution Drug gangs on 'recruitment drive' during lockdown Announcing the Â£148m package, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The government's work to tackle county lines drugs gangs has already resulted in thousands more people being arrested and hundreds more vulnerable people being safeguarded, but we must do more to tackle the underlying drivers behind serious violence."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: ""Addiction and crime are inextricably linked and to truly break the cycle we must make sure people can access the help they need to get their lives back on track for good."" Ms Patel told BBC Breakfast the government wanted to focus on rehabilitation and treatment for drug addicts as well as law enforcement, saying this was ""something we've not been doing enough of"". ""We have to do much more to support individuals whose lives have been blighted by years and years of drug abuse,"" she said. AHome Office-commissioned review into the drugs trade,externalby Prof Dame Carol Black released last February put the total cost to society of illegal drugs at about Â£20bn a year in England and said treatment services have been curtailed by local government funding cuts. Dame Carol welcomed the funding, saying: ""Drug treatment has a vital role to play in helping people to come off drugs and thereby reduce crime, from minor acquisitive crime right through to homicide.""

"MPs criticise HMRC Covid support for freelancersOut-of-date tax systems mean people are falling through the cracks for help, MPs say.Business","Louise worries about her prospects for the next 12 months Freelance TV and film sound editor Louise Burton is one of those who are unable to benefit from government pandemic support schemes, despite being out of work. Louise, 28, of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, has not had a single penny of assistance since her last job ended eight months ago. ""With the last production that I was on, I was hired as a PAYE freelancer, which means that I essentially do exactly the same job as what I do as a freelancer, but I was paying tax at source,"" she told the BBC. ""What often happens with film is that production companies are made for the sole purpose of the film. So they create these companies and everything goes through the company - and then once the film is completed, they then shut the company."" That means Louise fell foul of tax rules relating to self-employed people. And she could not go on furlough, because the company that had employed her no longer existed. ""I always feel guilty saying that I am one of the people who is suffering, because actually, I still have a roof over my head and I can just about put food on my table, but it's not easy,"" she says, adding that she fears for her prospects in the next 12 months. According to MPs, whole groups of people like Louise are falling through the cracks of Covid-19 support schemes because of out-of-date tax systems. Covid: Self-employed mothers 'deserve equal help' Coronavirus: What help are self-employed getting from government? Some freelancers and self-employed people have been particularly excluded, despite lockdowns and restrictions meaning they cannot work, the Public Accounts Committee said. Others, meanwhile, are able to abuse the system, it said. The government said its ""top priority"" was helping those who are struggling. Since March, HM Revenue and Customs has provided more than Â£80bn in support to companies and individuals through government coronavirus support schemes, the committee said. They are also supporting the incomes of many of the self-employed. But despite this,a report from the MPs,externalsays ""quirks in the tax system"" have meant that groups of workers - including freelancers and self-employed people who recently moved onto company payrolls or work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between - have been ineligible for furlough payments. ""As public spending balloons to unprecedented levels in response to the pandemic, out-of-date tax systems are one of the barriers to getting help to a significant number of struggling taxpayers who should be entitled to support,"" said MP Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). By contrast, she said some large companies that had used government support schemes had continued to pay dividends to shareholders and high salaries to executives. She added that HMRC was in many cases failing ""to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming"" support. The tax agency should explain to freelancers and other groups why they have been excluded from receiving support and set out steps to fix the problem within six weeks, the MPs said. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The PAC also said that a lack of certainty about government coronavirus support schemes had made it difficult for businesses to plan effectively. For example, HMRC could not provide clarity on whether the Job Retention Bonus scheme had been delayed or scrapped, the committee said. The scheme was meant to pay employers an incentive for every worker they brought back from furlough and kept in employment until January. ""Such lack of clarity may lead to unnecessary hardships for some businesses, who in good faith were relying on the payments from the scheme to meet some of their needs,"" the MPs said. A government spokesperson said it had done ""all it can to help as many people as possible"". ""HMRC delivered Covid-19 support schemes at unprecedented speed, protecting the livelihoods of millions of people. ""We do not underestimate the challenges faced by individuals and businesses during the pandemic, and our top priority is getting financial support to those struggling... while protecting the taxpayer against fraud. ""Those not eligible for support through these schemes can still benefit from the strengthened welfare safety net, accessing help like universal credit.""

"Child gender clinic rated 'inadequate'Services and waiting times must improve at the NHS's child gender-identity service, inspectors say.Health","The Gender Identity Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust The NHS's child gender-identity service has been rated ""inadequate"" after inspectors identified ""significant concerns"". The Care Quality Commission inspected the Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust in October. More than 4,600 young people were on the waiting list and some had waited over two years for a first appointment. The trust said it took the CQC report ""very seriously"". England and Wales' only children's gender-identity service was inspected after healthcare professionals and the children's commissioner for England raised concerns around ""clinical practice, safeguarding procedures, and assessments of capacity and consent to treatment"". The children's commissioner had been providedevidence of staff concernsby BBC Newsnight. The CQC's previous inspection, in 2016, had resulted in an overall ""good"" rating. But in the latest inspection at clinics run by the trust in north London and Leeds, Gids was rated: ""inadequate"" for being well led and responsive to patients' needs ""requires improvement"" for being safe and effective ""good"" for being caring - with staff being said to treat young people with ""compassion and kindness"" Overall, the service is now rated as ""inadequate"". And the CQC has begun enforcement action, demanding monthly updates of the numbers on the waiting list and actions to reduce them. The inspectors found Gids ""difficult to access"" and raised concerns over managing the risk to those on the waiting list, saying many of those waiting for or receiving a service were ""vulnerable and at risk of self-harm"". ""The size of the waiting list meant that staff were unable to proactively manage the risks to patients waiting for a first appointment,"" they added. Record-keeping at Gids was also criticised, with the CQC noting that ""staff had not consistently recorded the competency, capacity and consent of patients referred for medical treatment before January 2020"". This had changed since, but the CQC noted that in an audit of 10 records of young people referred for hormone blockers in March 2020, ""only three contained a completed consent form and checklist for referral"". by Hannah Barnes and Deborah Cohen, BBC Newsnight A rating of inadequate is the lowest a healthcare provider can receive from the Care Quality Commission. It means that a service is ""performing badly"". Gids had been rated good at its last inspection in 2016, but since then a number of concerns have been raised about the service. The number of young people referred to Gids has increased significantly in recent years - leading to some of the delays in care highlighted by the inspection. BBC Newsnight has explored the standard of healthcare received by young people questioning their gender identity for the last 18 months. In that time, NHS England has changed its guidance on the use of puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, saying little is known about the long-term side effects, and an independent review of this area of health is under way. Last June we revealed how some Gids staff had raised serious concerns about safeguarding at the service, the speed of assessments, and whether patients' traumatic backgrounds and other difficulties were always adequately explored. The comments were made as part of an official internal review into Gids, which also described how staff felt they had been ""shut down"". We also discovered that some of these concerns dated back to 2005. Furthermore, it was not possible to clearly understand why clinical decisions had been made. After reviewing 35 care records, the CQC found there was ""no clearly defined assessment process"" and ""many records did not demonstrate good practice"". The records also appeared to be ""insufficient"" in considering the needs of young people with autism spectrum disorders. In a sample of 22 records, the CQC found more than half mentioned autistic spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but ""records did not demonstrate consideration of the relationship between autistic spectrum disorder and gender dysphoria"". Significant variation in the clinical approach of different staff members was also noted. Assessments of young people ranged from ""two or three sessions"" in some cases to over 25, or even more than 50. CQC deputy chief inspector of hospitals Kevin Cleary said his team continued to monitor the trust ""extremely closely"" and inspected the service again because ""we were extremely clear that there were improvements needed in providing person-centred care, capacity and consent, safe care and treatment, and governance"". ""In addition, vulnerable young people were not having their needs met as they were waiting too long for treatment."" The leadership at the trust knew ""exactly what improvements are needed"", he added. The trust said: ""We take the CQC's report very seriously and would like to say sorry to patients for the length of time they are waiting to be seen, which was a critical factor in arriving at this rating."" Accepting there was a ""need for improvements in our assessments, systems and processes"", the trust said it agreed with the CQC that the ""growth in referrals has exceeded the capacity of the service"". It added improvements were being made, saying: ""We are already finalising plans to bring in senior clinical and operational expertise from outside the service to help us implement the necessary changes and consider how we can improve on current processes and practice - including how we standardise our assessment process.""

Wales' pupils await decision on grade assessments,"Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she had no choice but to scrap the classroom assessments that were to replace exams Teachers are set to decide GCSE, AS and A-level grades in Wales after a system replacing end-of-year exams was axed. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the pandemic had left her ""no choice"" in scrapping the classroom assessments. Grades determined by schools and colleges based on the work covered would be ""simple and clear"", she said. Exams were cancelled in favour of assessments in November, but these were also ditched whenschools were told to close until February half term. Advice from the Design and Delivery Group of school and college leaders said grades should be based on ""evidence of learning"". The approach is similar to the so-called 'Centre Assessed Grades' given to students in the summer of 2020 when the Covid-19 crisis affected end-of-year assessments. 'I don't want exams to go ahead next year' Online education 'patchy and inconsistent' Plea to end remote teaching 'postcode lottery' The new measures include: Schools and colleges will be able to use a range of evidence to determine the grades to be awarded to their learners, including coursework and mocks. The WJEC exam board will also offer a set of adapted past papers to enable schools to carry on assessing their pupils Schools and colleges can access an assessment framework set by Qualifications Wales to help set grades and their plans will be quality assured by WJEC Deadlines for coursework or ""non-exam assessment"" are being removed and will not be moderated by WJEC WJEC will publish guidance and oversee schools and colleges' internal quality assurance processes and will have a role in quality assuring their implementation. Teachers and lecturers will be offered training so they are applied ""consistently, equitably, and fairly"" The grades are then submitted to the WJEC who will not change them. Appeals about grades will go to a school or college Learners in Year 12 will also be awarded a ""Centre Determined"" grade but it won't contribute to the final A level. It won't apply to Year 10 unit assessments, but will apply if they are finishing a qualification Ms Williams said in November that end-of-year exams would be cancelled because the varying impact of Covid-19 on different schools and pupils meant it was not possible to ensure a level playing field. A new system based on a mix of assessments was put in place, drawn up by an exams advisory group made up of school and college leaders. However, when it was announced schools and colleges would stay closed for most pupils until at least 29 January, and probably until after February half-term, the advisory group was asked to look again at how assessments should be carried out. Ms Williams said: ""The worsening situation with the pandemic has meant we have no choice but to revisit our approach to ensure wellbeing and public confidence in our qualifications system. ""The proposals we are announcing today puts trust in teachers' and lecturers' knowledge of their learners' work, as well as their commitment to prioritise teaching and learning in the time available to support learners' progression."" She said they were working with universities to see how they can ""provide a bridge into courses"". ""Teaching the core content and aspects of each course remains my absolute priority for learners in exam years, so they are supported to progress with certainty into their next steps, with confidence in their grades"", she added. WJEC chief executive Ian Morgan, said that after an ""exceptional year"" there needs to be a different approach to assessment in 2021. ""Our teams will work at pace to develop a package of guidance for our teachers, including adapted past papers, mark schemes, and a range of support materials. We will also work with the Design and Delivery Advisory Group to develop a quality assurance process to support schools and college,"" he said. A-level student Carys said clarity was needed In England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said grades would be decided by schools and colleges but pupils could be asked to sit mini-exams to help teachers with their assessments. Carys, an A-level student from Ysgol Bro Edern in Cardiff, said before the announcement she wished students had been given a clearer picture about what they would be facing. ""It has been very confusing for us,"" she said. ""I feel like we're all asking the teachers what's happening, what's going on, and they're just as much as in the dark as we are."" Carys said she and her friends had struggled to see how the external assessments would be different to their cancelled exams. ""It is causing a large concern to us all and we're not quite sure what we're aiming towards,"" she said. ""I just want all our hard work to be credited."" ""I know many pupils who have been off school for weeks, or months even,"" says GCSE pupil Betsy Betsy, a GCSE pupil also at Ysgol Bro Edern, said she felt the fairest way to grade pupils this year was to let teachers decide on grades. ""It has been very challenging,"" she said. ""I know many pupils who have been off school for weeks, or months even."" ""I feel like the most fair way to do this is to just collect loads of coursework and trust the teachers to give us predicted grades,"" she said. ""They know the effort we've put in through the lockdown and through the online learning. ""I know that we will always be classed as the coronavirus year that didn't do exams. ""Universities hopefully will take that into consideration."" This video can not be played ""I'm not going to be going into those assessments with the same sort of opportunities as everybody else"" The NASUWT union, which represents some teachers in Wales, said ""the devil will be in the detail"" and full consultation with teachers is needed as there were concerns over fairness and staff workloads. ""How is this going to be achieved and what are the workload implications going to be on already hard pressed teachers?"" said Neil Butler of the NASUWT. UCAC, another teaching union, said it was ""the only realistic solution under the current circumstances"". But their general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young added he would like to see external standardisation between schools. The school leaders' union NAHT Cymru said they were pleased to get clarity - but are ""concerned about the proposed processes for appeals. ""The suggestion that initial appeals are made directly to the school or college is misguided in principle, and logistically unworkable,"" said director Laura Doel. Executive members of the National Education Union Cymru said they were pleased to be moving to a system ""with more trust in teachers and lecturers"" and were keen there was ""no repeat of the position we all found ourselves in last summer"". The director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, Eithne Hughes, said it was a ""pragmatic solution"" but more detail is needed regarding quality control. The announcement does not include vocational and technical qualifications, which are being considered separately. Qualifications Wales said it would work with the awarding bodies offering Wales-only vocational qualifications ""to reflect these arrangements in those qualifications"". It added it would ""continue to work with our fellow regulators to determine the arrangements for vocational and technical qualifications offered across the UK. Ofqual are currently consulting on proposals"".

MPs criticise HMRC Covid support for freelancers,"Louise worries about her prospects for the next 12 months Freelance TV and film sound editor Louise Burton is one of those who are unable to benefit from government pandemic support schemes, despite being out of work. Louise, 28, of St Albans, in Hertfordshire, has not had a single penny of assistance since her last job ended eight months ago. ""With the last production that I was on, I was hired as a PAYE freelancer, which means that I essentially do exactly the same job as what I do as a freelancer, but I was paying tax at source,"" she told the BBC. ""What often happens with film is that production companies are made for the sole purpose of the film. So they create these companies and everything goes through the company - and then once the film is completed, they then shut the company."" That means Louise fell foul of tax rules relating to self-employed people. And she could not go on furlough, because the company that had employed her no longer existed. ""I always feel guilty saying that I am one of the people who is suffering, because actually, I still have a roof over my head and I can just about put food on my table, but it's not easy,"" she says, adding that she fears for her prospects in the next 12 months. According to MPs, whole groups of people like Louise are falling through the cracks of Covid-19 support schemes because of out-of-date tax systems. Covid: Self-employed mothers 'deserve equal help' Coronavirus: What help are self-employed getting from government? Some freelancers and self-employed people have been particularly excluded, despite lockdowns and restrictions meaning they cannot work, the Public Accounts Committee said. Others, meanwhile, are able to abuse the system, it said. The government said its ""top priority"" was helping those who are struggling. Since March, HM Revenue and Customs has provided more than Â£80bn in support to companies and individuals through government coronavirus support schemes, the committee said. They are also supporting the incomes of many of the self-employed. But despite this,a report from the MPs,externalsays ""quirks in the tax system"" have meant that groups of workers - including freelancers and self-employed people who recently moved onto company payrolls or work on a series of short-term employment contracts with gaps in between - have been ineligible for furlough payments. ""As public spending balloons to unprecedented levels in response to the pandemic, out-of-date tax systems are one of the barriers to getting help to a significant number of struggling taxpayers who should be entitled to support,"" said MP Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). By contrast, she said some large companies that had used government support schemes had continued to pay dividends to shareholders and high salaries to executives. She added that HMRC was in many cases failing ""to capture or deal with those wrongly claiming"" support. The tax agency should explain to freelancers and other groups why they have been excluded from receiving support and set out steps to fix the problem within six weeks, the MPs said. PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The PAC also said that a lack of certainty about government coronavirus support schemes had made it difficult for businesses to plan effectively. For example, HMRC could not provide clarity on whether the Job Retention Bonus scheme had been delayed or scrapped, the committee said. The scheme was meant to pay employers an incentive for every worker they brought back from furlough and kept in employment until January. ""Such lack of clarity may lead to unnecessary hardships for some businesses, who in good faith were relying on the payments from the scheme to meet some of their needs,"" the MPs said. A government spokesperson said it had done ""all it can to help as many people as possible"". ""HMRC delivered Covid-19 support schemes at unprecedented speed, protecting the livelihoods of millions of people. ""We do not underestimate the challenges faced by individuals and businesses during the pandemic, and our top priority is getting financial support to those struggling... while protecting the taxpayer against fraud. ""Those not eligible for support through these schemes can still benefit from the strengthened welfare safety net, accessing help like universal credit.""

Â£23m support fund for struggling fishing firms,"The government has unveiled details of a Â£23m fund to support fishing firms as it tries to quell industry anger over Brexit border delays. The money will help firms whose exports to the EU have fallen sharply since rules changed on 1 January. Fishing firms say extra paperwork has made it difficult to deliver fresh produce to the EU before it goes off, hammering their businesses. One trade group called the fund ""welcome"" but a ""sticking plaster"". On Monday, fish exporters held demonstrations outside government departments in central London, warning their livelihoods were under threat. Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted many had experienced ""bureaucratic delays [and] difficulties getting their goods through"" to buyers on the other side of the channel. Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruption 'My Â£50,000 shellfish lorry was delayed for a day' Having left the EU's customs union and the single market, UK exports are subject to new customs and veterinary checks which have caused problems at the border. Covid has worsened the issue, with the industry also facing lower market prices and demand from restaurants due to the pandemic. The government said the scheme would be targeted at small and medium-sized fishing businesses who will be able to claim a maximum of Â£100,000 to cover losses. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay said: ""This further Â£23m package of support will help our hardworking fishing sector navigate the challenges of the next few months. ""It is vital that no community nor region within our United Kingdom is left behind as we continue to support British jobs and build back better from the coronavirus pandemic."" In addition to funding, the government will provide further training to help fishing businesses adapt to the new export processes. Separately, the prime minister committed to providing a further Â£100m to help modernise UK fishing fleets and the fish processing industry. Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland, said: ""After almost three weeks of voicing their concerns and frustrations, we welcome the fact that the Scottish seafood sector has been heard and action is being taken. ""This [fund] will offer a ray of light to some small and medium-sized companies that have experienced crippling losses over the past few weeks."" However, while the money was ""a much-needed sticking plaster"", she said it would not ""completely staunch the wound"". ""The sector still needs a period of grace during which the [new trade] systems must be overhauled so they are fit for purpose.""

"UK records new daily high of 1,610 Covid deathsThe total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test during the pandemic is now above 90,000.UKComments","A further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now above 90,000. A total of 4,266,577 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Another 33,355 positive Covid cases have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January. It is the lowest number of daily cases seen since 27 December - before the start of England's third nationwide lockdown. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""Whilst there are some early signs that show our sacrifices are working, we must continue to strictly abide by the measures in place."" She said reducing contact with others and staying at home will lead to ""a fall in the number of infections over time"". Covid antibodies in 1 in 10 people in December Health secretary self-isolating after Covid alert The figures come as new estimates from the Office for National Statistics showabout one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodiesin December - roughly double the October figure. The rising number of deaths was to be expected, sadly, after the surge in cases during December. And it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even higher than this. Today's numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays in registering deaths over the weekend tends to lead to higher figures being reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day. To put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half of that. But there are two rays of hope in the daily update. Firstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 for a third day in a row. Just two weeks ago we saw a few days above 60,000. That means in the coming weeks we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths. The number of vaccinations also continues to rise. It seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. But each increase at least takes us one step closer to getting on top of the virus. Meanwhile, NHS England said 400 military personnel were now assisting in hospitals in London and the Midlands, as wards face ""unprecedented pressure"". On Monday, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said it would be ""some time"" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals. Widower says pregnant women 'neglected in pandemic' Covid 'can affect anybody,' warn patient's family And in other developments, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has saidhe is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app .that he had been in close contact with somebody who tested positive. He said self-isolation was ""perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing"" and urged others to do the same if contacted. This video can not be played Martin Freeborn's wife, Helen, died from Covid at the Royal London Hospital: 'Don't end up like us, please' The previous highest number of daily deaths was last Wednesday, when 1,564 deaths were recorded. Tuesday's figure brings the total number of deaths recorded during the pandemic in the UK to 91,470. These government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, butthere are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths. Another method is to count all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate. That figure has now officially reached 95,829, although that is only measured up to 8 January. The UK has recorded the fifth-highest number of deaths globally,according to Johns Hopkins University,external- behind the US, Brazil, India and Mexico.
