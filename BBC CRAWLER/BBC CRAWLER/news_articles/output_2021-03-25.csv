Jab passports possible 'after all offered vaccine',"This video can not be played The PM says drinkers will not need to prove they have had a vaccine when pubs in England open for outside trade from 12 April It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested. He said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June. There were ""difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed"", the PM added. Any passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity. On Thursday afternoon,MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in Englandfor another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. The Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Will I need a vaccine passport to go to the pub? When can I go to the pub or a restaurant? Pubs could ask to see vaccine passports - PM Meanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago. The latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. Meanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen. A government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. Mr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted. ""There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together."" However he added: ""No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway."" Speaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: ""There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this. ""You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine."" In the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: ""A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate. ""What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,"" he added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? Under government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. The idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". Mr Johnson said the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future ""may be up to individual publicans"". A Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said ""all sorts of things were being considered"" and it was ""really a bit premature"" to speculate on details about how a possible vaccine passport would apply to pubs. The boss of Young's pubs said requiring vaccine passports would be ""unworkable"", while Greene King and the City Pub Group also voiced their opposition to any such measure. The chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain said asking pub-goers to show vaccine passports was a ""fairly poorly thought out idea"" he would not be adopting. Jonathan Neame told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law. ""But if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues."" Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the industry was ""very nervous"" about the ""damage"" such a measure could do to it and ""the future of the Great British Pub"". She told BBC News: ""They're asking us to enforce this at each venue and that's impossible for some of our venues to do - particularly our smaller community pubs in rural locations."" However, Peter Marks, from nightclub owner Rekom UK, said a vaccine certificate ""could work"" in his industry and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour was ""happy to look"" at any government proposals for vaccine and testing certification, but he called for clarity for the hospitality industry about how the measures could work in practice. He said the hospitality industry had been through ""incredibly difficult times over the last year"", adding: ""And suddenly the prime minister comes along, out of the blue, to say here's a new responsibility you're going to have to deal with, without much clarity."" Senior Tory backbencher Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, also expressed concern that businesses would be able to turn away customers ""from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine"".

Plans for 'family hubs' to help new parents,"Deborah thinks ""family hubs"" could help new parents find out more about local services like health visits New parents will have more co-ordinated access to help and services under plans to improve children's health in England, the government says. A ""family hub"" network will be set up and the ""red books"" used to log babies' health information will be digitised. Andrea Leadsom, who chaired the government review on early years health, said the plans would identify those families most in need of support. Labour called them ""a smokescreen for a decade of failure on early years"". ""Red books"" - or personal child health records - are given to parents around the time that their baby is born, and are used to record details like weight, height and vaccinations. The government said it will bring forward plans to digitise them, meaning they will go online by April 2023. Local authorities will be asked to produce a single ""Start for Life"" document for parents with information about support services in their area - from health visits to help quitting smoking. Under the plans,published as part of a review on Thursday,,externalthere will also be ""family hubs"" - centres where parents could access a range of services. The government says these services could include birth registration, midwifery, health visiting, mental health support and feeding advice. Deborah Gibb, a 32-year-old teacher from Bradford, is trying to calm her four-month-old, Freyja, when she picks up the phone. ""I think she's started to teethe, which is ridiculously young,"" she laughs. She seems to breathe a sigh of relief when I tell her that the red book will be moving online (although that might just be because Freyja has settled down). ""As a mother, going out of the house you pack your entire life with you. But remembering that red book that's in the back of the cupboard?"" she says. ""It seems ridiculous."" She thinks having a single publication that lists local services would be useful, so long as it's digitised. She was given leaflets ""left, right and centre"" when she left hospital after giving birth to her older daughter, Eilidh, now three. ""They just go in a pile and you don't get time to read them.

She says her job meant she felt reasonably clued up about what support services were available in her area - but many new parents don't. ""I was having a conversation the other day about how I've signed Freyja up for nursery for when I return to work in September. They were like, 'you've already put her name down?'"" She says it is important for first-time parents to have ""somewhere to go centrally to get all the information that isn't an intimidating place"". Ms Leadsom, a former cabinet minister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the plans would also help identify families who ""would go on to have real difficulties"" without support. ""What families will see differently is they will receive a joined-up Start for Life offer, which will show them explicitly what services they can get to support them in the period from conception to the age of two,"" she said. She said the digitisation of the red books would ""make a huge difference"". ""For families, they won't have to keep telling their story again and again. For professionals, they will be able to see what's happened to that family to provide them with the support that they need,"" she added.

EU: AstraZeneca must 'catch up' on jab deliveries,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged AstraZeneca to ""honour its contract"" European Union leaders have stopped short of banning vaccine exports after a protracted row with the Anglo-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca. At a summit on Thursday they gave backing in principle for toughening export controls. But a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of global supply chains needed to produce vaccinations. Elements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said AstraZeneca must ""catch up"" on deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere. French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters this marked ""the end of naivety"" from the EU. Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering promised doses. AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract. The EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates ""I think it is clear that first of all the company has to catch up,"" Mrs von der Leyen told a news conference after the virtual leaders' summit. ""[It] has to honour the contract it has with European member states before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,"" she said. ""We want to explain to our European citizens that they [can] get their fair share."" The EU was accused, primarily by the UK and the World Health Organization (WHO), of so-called vaccine nationalism after it introduced export controls on jabs produced within the bloc. In response, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that ""blockades"" were not ""sensible"". He said a ban would imperil the UK's vaccination drive, which has so far been more successful than EU member states' vaccine programmes. Mr Johnson also warned that a ban that extended beyond AstraZeneca's disputed supply could also block jabs produced for BioNTech/Pfizer in Belgium. France's foreign minister said on Friday that the EU ""shouldn't be paying the price"" for the UK's vaccination policy. ""One can't play with blackmail, having given a lot of first jabs and then run into problems with the second,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. Mrs von der Leyen said on Thursday that EU was the ""region that exports most vaccines worldwide"" and invited other countries to ""match our openness"". Her comments came a day after the EU issued a joint statement with the UK in which both sides pledged to work together after weeks of tensions over the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron backed the EU's export controls. ""I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments with Europeans,"" he said. Earlier, he expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. ""We didn't shoot for the stars,"" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. ""We were wrong to lack ambition."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures ""acceptable"", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo. Both those two countries are home to factories involved in the production of the AstraZeneca shot, which it's suggested may soon be sending increased supplies to European nations - a move that may assuage some EU anger, BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake reports. Mr Rutte said an agreement with the UK over AstraZeneca components produced in the Netherlands could be announced this weekend. Following the virtual summit, the EU's 27 member states agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc. ""Accelerating the production, delivery and deployment of vaccines remains essential and urgent to overcome the crisis. Efforts to this end must be further intensified,"" they said in a joint statement. ""We underline the importance of transparency as well as of the use of export authorisations,"" they added. The EU also called on vaccine manufacturers to ""ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines"". This video can not be played Juncker: ""We are not in war, we are not enemies"" US President Joe Biden also attended the virtual meeting, in an effort to repair ties with the EU after the strained relationship between the bloc and his predecessor, Donald Trump. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, a former president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged the bloc to avoid a ""stupid vaccine war"" with the UK. ""We are not in war, and we are not enemies,"" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme. He added that threats of export bans could cause ""major reputational damage"" to the EU. A third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe. EU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000. Yet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US. Speaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to ""a new pandemic"". ""The situation is serious,"" she said. ""Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again."" Lockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there isparticular concern over eastern EU states. Poland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged.

The key takeaways,"This video can not be played ""My predecessor - oh God, I miss him"" - and other news conference highlights Joe Biden waited longer than any modern president to hold his first solo press conference, turning what should have been a relatively routine event into a high-profile media spectacle. With expectations raised, Biden took to the East Room of the White House and addressed a socially distanced group of reporters. Here are some key takeaways from the occasion. â¢Biden's first news conference fact-checked What a difference an election makes. Donald Trump's press conferences were like a no-holds-barred cage match, where the commander-in-chief tried to prove his dominance over his media critics. Biden's performance was more akin to a cautious walk across a not-quite-frozen lake. Every step was careful and calculated, lest an unexpected crack led to a dark, icy fate. He relied heavily on notes and called from what appeared to be a pre-determined list of reporters - one that didn't include Fox News or any other right-leaning outlets. At one point, in an answer about the filibuster - an arcane Senate rule that has thwarted many a president's ambitious agenda - Biden appeared to lose his train of thought, ending his sentence with the wave of a hand. It wasn't exactly a bravura performance, but conservatives have set the bar so low for Biden's coherence, that as in the presidential debates, Biden was able to surpass most expectations. Biden pressed on child migrants at border Before he took questions from the gathered journalists, Biden gave a few prepared remarks, and his focus was on the twin crises he inherited as president, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil. He led with a newsworthy promise that, by his 100th day in office, healthcare workers will have distributed 200 million vaccination jabs (that's very good news, although the US still lags behind some other countries when comparing the number of jabs done relative to the size of the population). He also boasted about the economic aid package he shepherded through Congress on the back of universal Democratic support - a fiscal shot-in-the-arm that should help the economic recovery. ""Help is here,"" he said. ""Hope is on the way."" Reporters didn't spend any time asking about the pandemic or the economy after that, which was another big clue that the Biden administration has - at least in their minds - done a good job addressing the biggest challenge of his presidency so far. Three reasons Biden's Covid relief bill is a big deal One topic Biden was repeatedly pressed on by reporters was the deteriorating situation at the US-Mexico border, as a growing number of undocumented migrants - including unaccompanied children - are being detained by US border patrols. Biden didn't have much new information to share, an indication that he would prefer the headlines from the press conference to be about other topics. When he did speak on the topic, he blamed Trump for cutting aid to Central American countries that could have address the root causes of humanitarian crisis. He said the surge in entries was cyclical in nature and not a result of immigrants believing he was a ""nice guy"" who would let them in. He also promised that if the processing of children at the border wasn't improved, he'd start firing people. This video can not be played The challenges facing Biden at the US-Mexico border Biden very rarely mentions his predecessor by name, but when asked about his policy of admitting unaccompanied children into the US, it's exactly what he did. He wasn't going to turn children away to starve, he said. ""No previous administration did that either, except Trump,"" he said. ""I'm not going to do it."" Democrats have criticised Trump's immigration policies as draconian and heartless. Biden's task, whether he wants to talk about it or not, is to prove that there is a better way. What's happening with child migrants at the border? When one journalist offered a laundry list of topics that Biden might tackle next, and asked how he would work with Republicans to accomplish them, Biden at first deferred. Immigration, gun control, voting rights, climate change - those were all ""long-term problems,"" he said. But later, Biden tipped his hand on what his next priority will be - a massive infrastructure spending bill. The idea of ""infrastructure week"" had become a running joke during the Trump presidency, as the White House made multiple futile attempts to prioritise new spending on large civic works projects as a way of boosting jobs and helping the economy. It appears team Biden will take their own crack at it, although their effort will include more spending on green-energy projects and could include a boost to the minimum wage. Of all the potential items on Biden's agenda, infrastructure could be the most likely to get some Republican support, which - after a partisan pandemic aid bill - might be why it has moved up the president's list. There was scant talk on foreign policy for much of the afternoon, but the subject did occasionally come up. Biden said it was unlikely that the US would be out of Afghanistan by the 1 May deadline, but that in a year he ""can't picture"" troops being there in 2022. ""We will leave,"" he said. ""The question is when we leave, but we're not staying a long time."" On China, the president tried to talk down the growing war of words between the two nations. ""I'm not looking for a confrontation,"" he said - but, in nearly the same breath, added that he criticised the country's polices and pledged that China from was not going to become the most powerful country in the world ""on my watch"". With rhetoric like that, a confrontation may be hard to avoid. It's impossible to gather more than a handful of political reporters together in Washington without the subject of the next presidential election coming up - and it did on Thursday. Biden, who was coy about his 2024 plans before last year's election, was asked if he intended to run for re-election. He said it was his ""intention"" to do so - and to keep Kamala Harris as his running mate (the fate of vice-presidents is another popular topic in Washington). It was hardly a firm declaration of candidacy, but it should be enough to give ambitious Democrats eyeing the Oval Office reason to keep their desires to themselves for now.

VideoJuncker: We must pull back from vaccine war,"This video can not be played The European Commission and the UK government should not be discussing the distribution of coronavirus vaccines in an atmosphere of war, former president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker has said. While he understood the recent move of the president of the Commission to threaten export bans, it could create a major reputational damage to the European Union - which used to be the world free-trade champion - and was not the right way to act, he told BBC Hardtalk. EU leaders are holding virtual talksto discuss ways of boosting supplies of coronavirus vaccines and how they are distributed across the bloc on Thursday. The Commission is seeking added controls on exports. The UK and the EU announced they wanted to âcreate a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for allâ earlier this week.

"Call for unity as EU leaders meet for vaccine summitThe president of the EU parliament says members must work together, as tensions rise over supplies.Europe","Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. The meeting on Thursday will also see EU leaders decide whether to approve proposals to toughen export controls. Such controls could affect supply to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned against imposing ""blockades"". European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the summit would ""ensure that Europeans get their fair share of vaccines"".She also said the EU had exported some 77 million doses to 33 countries since December,external, making the bloc the world's largest vaccine exporter. Some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the bloc's distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference on Thursday. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company has denied that it is failing to honour its contract. European Council President Charles Michel is hosting the video conference with EU leaders, as tensions rise over how to distribute doses among member states. Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is heading a campaign with five Eastern European nations to address what they say has been an uneven distribution of vaccines. ""If no solution is found here it could cause damage to the European Union the likes of which we have not seen in a long time,"" Mr Kurz said ahead of the summit. EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines The EU is also divided over plans to introduce new export controls on vaccines in an effort to boost its own supply. Some member states fear the controls would disrupt global supply chains and damage already strained relations with the UK after Brexit, the BBC's Katya Adler says. The proposals are most likely to affect vaccine-exporting countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. When considering whether to limit exports, the EU would consider the state of the pandemic in that country, its vaccination rate, and whether the country is itself exporting vaccines. There would, however, be no outright export bans. A site in Belgium produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and another in the Netherlands is expected to increase supplies of the jab in the EU. On Thursday, an EU official told the AFP news agency that 21 million vaccines had been sent from the bloc to the UK but none had been sent the other way. A draft of the summit's conclusions, seen by various news media including AFP and Reuters, reportedly says EU leaders will stress ""the importance of ... export authorisations"" while emphasising that vaccine producers must respect agreed delivery deadlines. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, the former president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker urged the bloc to avoid a ""stupid vaccine war"" with the UK. ""This cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere,"" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme. ""We are not in war, and we are not enemies."" He added that threats of export bans could cause ""major reputational damage"" to the EU. This video can not be played Juncker: ""We are not in war, we are not enemies"" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the EU to boost its capacity for vaccine production. ""We can see clearly that British facilities are producing for Great Britain,"" she said. ""The United States isn't exporting, and therefore we are dependent upon what can be produced in Europe."" Mrs Merkel also defended the EU's decision to procure coronavirus vaccines jointly, before warning that the impact of the pandemic could go ""far beyond this year"". French President Emmanuel Macron expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. ""We didn't shoot for the stars,"" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. ""We were wrong to lack ambition."" In another development, Denmark suspended its use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab by a further three weeks and said it was still looking ata possible link to blood clots. Europe's medicines regulator declared that the jab was ""safe and effective"" last week, and is convening a group of experts to explore the issue further on Monday. There is no evidence that the jab is connected to the reports of clots. On the eve of this meeting, a ghost of summits past visited with a warning. Jean-Claude Junker's concern that the EU's reputation could be damaged by threatening export bans is shared, in part, by some member states. The Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland and Belgium are worried about the impact on supply chains. Italy - which has already blocked a consignment of AstraZeneca doses - and France believe tougher action is needed to ensure the EU gets its fair share. There are also smaller divisions over the distribution of the jabs the EU has actually managed to get hold of. Austria is leading a handful of disgruntled Eastern European nations who want a bigger portion. The way the European Commission unveiled its proposals for stricter controls on exports has meant there has been little time for members to consider them. So, while we may see some degree of unity in a non-specific joint statement, clear agreement on the best and quickest way to tackle the EU's vaccination crisis does not seem imminent. A third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe. EU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000. Yet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US. Speaking earlier this week, Mrs Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to ""a new pandemic"". ""The situation is serious,"" she said. ""Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again."" Lockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there isparticular concern over eastern EU states. Poland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged. Why did EU take AstraZeneca to court over vaccines?

Tourism businesses 'ready to go' if given go-aheadWales' first minister has said tourism could start to reopen from 27 March if case rates stay down.Wales,"Tenby and other popular Welsh resorts could soon be welcoming tourists again Tourism businesses say they have been ""preparing like crazy"" and are ready to reopen if given the green light in Friday's lockdown review. Welsh government ministers are expected to discuss later whether travel restrictions can be eased to allow limited tourism over Easter. Self-catered accommodation could reopen from 27 March and outdoor hospitality will be considered for 22 April. People in England cannot go on holiday anywhere in the UK until 12 April. This video can not be played Welsh government ministers are expected to discuss whether travel restrictions can be eased ""We have been preparing like crazy for the last two or three weeks to open,"" said William Greenwood from the National Trust's Bodnant Garden in Conwy. ""So we are pretty much ready to go as soon as we are given the go ahead."" Officials at Bodnant Garden believe they can reopen it within two of three days a formal announcement With 20 miles of paths and 80 acres of gardens, Mr Greenwood said there should not be an issue with social distancing and they could welcome up to 2,000 visitors a day. At the last lockdown review in Waleshairdressers, garden centresandsome non-essential retailwere given their dates to open. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced tourism could start to reopen by Easter if case rates stayed low. This video can not be played ""There's going to be an influx of people,"" said one woman But, he warned a decision would not be made until""the last moment""and tourism openings would come to a halt""if bookings were made from outside Wales"". Plaid Cymru's Adam Price said businesses needed more detail on what they can expect, while the Tories have called for a roadmap out of lockdown. Italian-style village Portmeirion in Gwynedd was designed and built by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis Geoffrey Lyons-Mound, of Lyons Holidays Parks - which has 10 sites across Wales and Cumbria - said it had been a ""long winter"" but there were ""positive signs"". He added: ""About 95% of our customers are from England and 5% are Welsh - but all will be welcomed back. ""You find Welsh people tend to holiday in England and vice versa. But hopefully we will get there in the end."" Catherine Hummel, co-owner of Riverside Camping near Caernarfon, said she was expecting a ""softer reopening"" because of having to decline English bookings - which she said made up about 90% of their business - but they were making preparations to open. Catherine Hummel said different rules across the border made it more ""complicated"" to reopen Could Wales' lockdown begin lifting by Easter? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? She said: ""We have had to cancel around 100 bookings from England for Easter already, some were double cancellations from last year, so that's a double cancellation for some which isn't nice to do. ""Business-wise, I'm sad we can't welcome guests from England back just yet, but as a parent and member of the community I want to keep staff and guests as safe as possible."" Anglesey at one point has some of the lowest case rates in the UK but is currently 35th - Holyhead is now second highest of the Wales localised hotspots Nia Rhys Jones, joint chair of Anglesey Tourism Association and owner of some self-catering accommodation, said for some businesses it was ""just not worth the cost of reopening"". She said: ""It's all good allowing self-contained accommodation to reopen, but a lot of businesses on Anglesey are not opening because the bulk of trade comes from England, so opening is not worth the cost for some. ""There is some nervousness about people from parts of south Wales travelling up here and potentially seeing rates rise again. ""It's a real double-edged sword, businesses need trade from England, but also don't want to be bringing coronavirus back into our communities."" Zip World runs three zip line attractions in North Wales Sean Taylor, founder of the Zip World group of attractions in Snowdonia, said he would be glad to see businesses open but ""the most important thing is notice"". He said: ""We're a well-run business, but we need to be able to plan ahead. Any reopening after lockdown will need some time for staff training to take place and for us to organise things with suppliers. Even the most basic things as tea and coffee need a moment to get sorted before you can open the doors."" Paula Ellis said the last 12 months had been ""the most challenging time of our careers"" Paula Ellis is the group general manager for Retreats Group Ltd, chair of South West Tourism Forum and a member of the Covid Emergency Taskforce Group for Tourism, Hospitality and Events. She said lockdown had been ""the most challenging time of our careers"" and that without government support she did not know how the industry would have survived. She said she hoped the plans could go ahead to open tourism by Easter and preparations had been under way since ministers announced in February it was a possibility, but she said she would understand if it was not the case. ""We understand that if further strains are found or the R number changes in Wales that the Welsh government would have to retract the opening. ""For all our hopes and aspirations, the health of the nation does need to come first."" She added she would feel ""a lot more confident to open safely"" this summer as opposed to last as people have begun to be vaccinated and a lot of her guests tended to be older so would probably have had their jabs already. ""My main concern since last year is how I can look after my colleagues, community and guests, and in that order. ""My team are champing at the bit to be back and you can really feel the camaraderie."" About 350 people lost their jobs at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort during the pandemic. But with the easing of lockdown, chief executive Ian Edwards said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". He told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he was confident up to 250 furloughed staff and 150 still working would keep their jobs. ""The vaccine rollout has given us hopeâ¦ it has been a very tough 12 months, but there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. People visiting Snowdonia's Pen y Pas will have to book a parking space in advance and use a park and ride service between April and November. Emyr Williams, Snowdonia National Park's chief executive, told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast the change was in response to hundreds of incidences ofdangerous parking in the arealast summer.

Blood scandal victims to get equal support,"Contaminated blood victims in Wales had campaigned for a rise in support payments Contaminated blood transfusion victims in Wales are set to get the same cash support as the rest of the UK. Haemophiliac patients, who were among thousands to receivecontaminated blood in the 1970s and 80s, currently get Â£14,000 less than those in England. Payments to victims and families will now be backdated to April 2019, with lump sums for those infected with HIV and Hepatitis C backdated to 2017. The UK government will issue a House of Commons statement later. Health Minister Vaughan Gething welcomed the decision to provide ""additional financial support for those infected with hepatitis C and/or HIV via contaminated blood or blood products"". ""The significant impact of such infections on many individuals' lives has been extensively discussed in the Senedd chamber,"" he said. Infected blood victim Kirk Ellis said: ""I am relieved that this day has finally come. It means so much to myself and my family to finally have some financial security."" Haemophilia Wales chairwoman Lynne Kelly said: ""We are pleased that the infected blood ex-gratia payments have been levelled up across the UK to include bereaved partners as this is a step in the right direction and will help alleviate immediate hardship."" Solicitor Lucy O'Brien, who has been acting for Mr Ellis and Haemophilia Wales, said: ""It comes as a relief to our clients, all of whom have been campaigning and fighting tirelessly for parity of support for Welsh victims for nearly two years now, that they don't have to endure a protracted court battle over this issue."" UK government paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, said any future changes to national schemes would be ""subject to consultation between the UK government and devolved administrations"". She said an ""independent reviewer"" would undertake a study looking at options for a compensation framework. ""The terms of reference of this study will be finalised in consultation between the independent reviewer and those infected and affected,"" she added. Agreement was reached in principle between the four UK nations' health departments to end the disparities in July 2019. The UK Treasury will fund a number of changes to the four schemes to close the gap, including backdated payments. Payments through the Welsh Infected Blood Support Scheme will be increased to the rates currently paid in England and Scotland. Man 'not told of Aids diagnosis for 18 months' Blood scandal victims 'waiting for equal payments' Contaminated blood scandal: Welsh frustration at payments wait Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Bereaved partners will receive 100% of the beneficiaries payment in the first year, with 75% in the following year before equalling payments in Scotland. Lump sum payments to patients who contracted Hepatitis C (Stage1) will increase from Â£20,000 to Â£50,000, with an additional Â£20,000 payable if the patient moves into Stage 2. The total lump sum payable for Hepatitis C beneficiaries remains at Â£70,000, in line with Scotland, and will be backdated to April 2017. Lump sum payments for HIV of Â£80,500 will be brought into line with England and backdated to April 2017.

Your updates were brought to you by Emma Owen, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Owen Amos and Victoria Lindrea. We hope you have a peaceful evening - and the live page will be back in the morning. We are going to be drawing our live updates to a close soon so here's a look back at the day's news: Head gardener Simon Tetlow is preparing for the return of visitors to Tatton Park in Cheshire Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Northern Irelandâs devolved government has announced youth
services will be reopened on a phased basis at the start of next month. The
SureStart programme, which supports the parents of children aged under four, will
also resume. Ministers in the power-sharing Stormont Executive also discussed
international travel at a meeting this afternoon. At a news conference
afterwards, the First Minister Arlene Foster and the deputy First Minister
Michelle OâNeill indicated travellers arriving from countries on the so-called
âred listâ would soon have to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. There are currently
no international flights operating to or from Northern Ireland, but plans are
being made for the quarantine system to come into operation when air routes
resume. OâNeill also said the current coronavirus R-rate in Northern
Ireland is thought to be between 0.75 and 0.95. The Government could face ""chaos"" and a ""Wild West"" of A-level and GCSE grades after this summer's exams were cancelled, MPs have warned. Teacher assessments could lead to ""much higher grade inflation"", the House of Commons Education Select Committee heard. Conservative MP Robert Halfon, committee chairman, said it could ""create chaos for the thousands of students chasing college and further and higher education places in August"". His comments came as Britain's largest teaching union accused the government of ""hiding behind"" teachers who are likely to be ""lambasted"" if this summer's GCSE and A-level grades are higher. In a letter to the Education Secretary, Halfon says: ""The DfE and Ofqual should consider some kind of standardised assessment and a more robust way of validating teacher-assessed grades."" England are due to arrive in Albania on Saturday England's World Cup qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday looked at risk of being called off today because of doubts over security - but the issue now seems to have been resolved. The Albanian Football Association (AFA) earlier said it had been informed by local police the force could not guarantee the safety of the teams. But the country's state police have since issued a statement to say they have ""taken all measures to guarantee order and security"" for the game. The dilemma followed the AFA's request for a restricted number of fans vaccinated against Covid-19 to be permitted to attend the game, which was rejected by government. The match will therefore be played behind closed doors, and with no other lockdown measures in place in the country it could have meant the area around the Air Albania Stadium being busy - seemingly with no promise of adequate policing until the guarantees were given by police. The AFA said it would have had ""catastrophic consequences for the image of our country, the national team and in general for Albanian football"" if it had been forced to cancel the game. England open up their campaignagainst San Marino in less than half an hour, while Albania play in Andorra at the same time. Read more here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News No Covid vaccines have yet been authorised for use in
children under 16 but there are numerous trials now taking place to test their
effects in this age group. Pfizer is the latest drug company to announce the start of a
trial in children under 12, saying it hopes to produce data in the second half
of this year. The US company has already been testing vaccines in teenage
children aged 12-15 and expects to have results from those trials in the next
few weeks. AstraZeneca announced vaccine trials in children aged 6-17some time ago and the first of 300 volunteers were due to be jabbed last month, and Moderna
has said it will test its vaccine on 12 to 17-year-olds. Childrenâs risk of becoming ill or dying with Covid-19 is tiny
and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment. But as countries attempt to bring down deaths, illness and
infection levels to very low levels so normal life can resume, children are now
being considered possible candidates for vaccination as well as adults. If children do play a role in transmission, even if not to
the same extent as adults, then vaccinating them would make sense. But there are lots of hoops to go through first. Are
vaccines safe in children? Do they stop them spreading the virus? What real
difference would vaccinating children make? Only when these questions are answered would regulators give
the green light to approve its use in millions of young children. Will vaccine certificates enable summer travel? EU leaders are looking at how digital certificates - called theGreen Digital Certificate,external- might work to enable travel across Europe in time for summer. The aim is to enable anyone who has been vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU. But some individual countries, such as Denmark and Estonia, have already outlined plans for so-called vaccine certificates. And outside of the EU, Israel has a working system in place. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world,external, with more than half the population having already received two doses, and last month it was able to begin easing a nationwide lockdown. A ""Green Pass"" is available to anyone who has been fully vaccinated or has recovered from Covid-19,external. To access some of the country's facilities - like hotels, gyms or theatres - people have to show their pass. It is available as a paper certificate or in an app, which links users to their health ministry data. The app opens the possibility of being used for international travel, andIsrael has struck deals with Greeceand Cyprus to allow its citizens with vaccination passports to travel to those two countries.

won't trouble Boris Johnson, overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers
to respond to the pandemic. Many of the Tories who voted against the
government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and
lockdowns. For them, it's about trust. Reassurances from ministers about powers
only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. There is deep unease about the scope of
these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if
they're not being used. But the pandemic has changed expectations
of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances, freedoms
considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. The public may have been willing to
largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the
price society has paid has been too high. Sir Graham Brady took part in the debate over whether to extend the Coronavirus Act A senior Tory backbencher who was among 35 of his party's MPs to vote against extending emergency coronavirus laws this afternoon says we need to find ""ways of living sensibly"" with Covid in future winters, as more lockdowns are not the answer. Sir Graham Brady tells Radio 4's PM programme there is a ""fundamental question"" stemming from the fact an endemic disease ""might be coming back every winter for the foreseeable future"". ""If you are going to respond to say that the only reaction to that is to close down the country, to prevent people from seeing their families, to stop people from doing business and earning a living,"" he says, ""then I think that's an apocalyptic vision that would definitely cause far more harm in terms both of deaths and mental health problems and economic devastation than the alternative. ""So I think it's inevitable if we see this coming back in future years and future winters, which is entirely likely, we are going to have to find ways of living sensibly with a very nasty virus, which will include some restrictions. ""But I don't think it's plausible to suggest that lockdown is the answer to that."" US President Joe Biden says officials aim to deliver 200 million coronavirus jabs in the first 100 days of his administration. The target is double the original goal. ""I believe we can do it,"" he says. After a slow start under the Trump presidency, the pace of vaccinations has been rapidly climbing. Biden says economic growth is now expected to exceed 6% this year as his recovery plan takes effect. He says there are still too many Americans out of work and hurting, but help is on the way. Biden has been making the comments in his first news conference since taking office. This video can not be played Johnson: 'I do badly need a hair cut' Prime Minister Boris Johnson admits he ""badly"" needs a haircut, but jokes that he's booked in to the pub. In video recorded shortly before an interview, he's asked if Carrie Symonds, his fiancÃ©e, might cut his hair, to which he responds ""she's going to have another go, yeah"". The group will be given exclusive use of a hotel on the Greek island of Rhodes A Dutch travel firm will take nearly 200 people for an eight-day holiday in Greece aimed at seeing if tourism is feasible during the Covid-19 pandemic. Those picked will have an all-inclusive getaway on the island of Rhodes at a cost of â¬399 (Â£344; $472) per person, but there are some catches. They will not be allowed to leave the resort and will have to quarantine for up to ten days when they return home. At least 25,000 people have signed up for the government-backed experiment. TheDutch government's travel advice,externalotherwise is that all foreign trips should be avoided, unless essential, until at least the middle of May. While many people may like to swap a life of lockdown for a week of Greek sunshine, questions have been raised about whether enabling such escapism is responsible or reckless at a time when both the infection rate and hospital admissions in the Netherlands are on the rise, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports. The Netherlands has recorded at least 16,536 deaths,externaland 2,746,581 cases of infection during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. But with public pressure mounting to allow summer holidays to go ahead, experiments like this one could help to determine whether there is a Covid-secure way to allow people to take an overseas break during the pandemic, she adds.

It means that almost half the adult population - 703,334 people - have had at least one jab. The official figures showed that more than 104,907 people had now received a second dose. There have been no further Covid-related deaths recorded by NI's Department of health, meaning the total number of deaths remains at 2,107. The latest figures come after Health minister Robin Swann said on Wednesday thatforeign travel in the summer should be ruled out. Mr Swann said Westminster and the devolved governments were discussing the so-called ""red list"" for foreign countries. He added that fragilities in NI's health system underlined the need for caution as lockdown eases. Professor Ultan Power, a virologist at Queen's University, said that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a Covid vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. He told Good Morning Ulster: ""If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place."" Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company denies that it is failing to honour its contract. Read more here. The UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures,external. Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure of 6,303 but the number of Covid-related deaths reported has fallen 32, compared with 95 last Thursday. Meanwhile, the latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. The exact figure is 28,991,188 - and 2,775,481 people have had their second dose. MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus laws for
another six months. A total of 484 MPs were for the motion and 76 against giving a majority of 408. MPs have finished debating whether to extend emergency coronavirus laws to the end of September and it's gone to a vote. Wrapping up the three and a half hour debate, Health and Social Care Minister Edward Argar says: ""They are not measures any of us would choose to do were we not faced with such a grave situation,"" but, he says they are ""necessary"". Nationwide says UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme. It comes after half of staff surveyed said they wanted to work from home full-time. TheUK's biggest building society says its ""work anywhere"" plan will allow employees more controlof their lives. Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Nationwide boss Joe Garner says âfundamentallyâ employees will have total control over where they work from. âOur report says people do still want to  go to the officeâ¦ they just donât want to be compelled to go every day,â he tells Radio 4. âPeople are saying they need the flexibility.â Garner also suggests employees are making âbetter decisionsâ as a consequence of home-working. He says many organisations - not just Nationwide - have observed productivity benefits and benefits to well-being from flexible working.  In the long term, he adds, there might also be environmental benefits. Garner insists the decision is not driven by cost, although he does think in time there will be cost benefits to Nationwide. The move by the building society comes as companies across the UK look into how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model marrying some office work with days working from home. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told EU leaders that the bloc has exported 77 million doses of coronavirus vaccines since early December. The figure is greater than the number of inoculations given to EU citizens so far, and includes more than 30 million doses delivered to low and middle income countries under the global vaccine sharing scheme.

Leaders at a virtual summit are debating the Commission's proposal to tighten export controls on vaccines as a way to boost supplies within the EU, as infections surge in many member states. Speaking to German MPs before the summit, Chancellor Angela Merkeldefended the EU's decision to procure vaccines jointlyas the bloc struggles with delays in rollout. But some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Prof Tim Spector, who leads the Covid Symptom Tracker app study run by King's College London, says any vaccine passport would have to be digital and people just have to ""bite the bullet"". He tells the PA news agency: ""It was always obvious to me that vaccine passports were going to come in. ""Bits of paper are not going to be that. It's got to be digital, it's got to be something on your phone, and I think that's going to be useful in some scenarios."" Prof Spector says: ""We just need to get used to it and bite the bullet, in a way, because it's going to affect our travel outside this country as well, so we might as well get our own system in order. ""It has got to be a simple system - that should be quite possible - and everyone gets a unique code number from their vaccine that can be checked."" Â© 2025 BBC.

US President Joe Biden says officials aim to deliver 200 million coronavirus jabs in the first 100 days of his administration. The target is double the original goal. ""I believe we can do it,"" he says. After a slow start under the Trump presidency, the pace of vaccinations has been rapidly climbing. Biden says economic growth is now expected to exceed 6% this year as his recovery plan takes effect. He says there are still too many Americans out of work and hurting, but help is on the way.

It means that almost half the adult population - 703,334 people - have had at least one jab. The official figures showed that more than 104,907 people had now received a second dose. There have been no further Covid-related deaths recorded by NI's Department of health, meaning the total number of deaths remains at 2,107. The latest figures come after Health minister Robin Swann said on Wednesday thatforeign travel in the summer should be ruled out. Mr Swann said Westminster and the devolved governments were discussing the so-called ""red list"" for foreign countries. He added that fragilities in NI's health system underlined the need for caution as lockdown eases. Professor Ultan Power, a virologist at Queen's University, said that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a Covid vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. He told Good Morning Ulster: ""If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place."" Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses.

The UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures,external. Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure of 6,303 but the number of Covid-related deaths reported has fallen 32, compared with 95 last Thursday. Meanwhile, the latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. The exact figure is 28,991,188 - and 2,775,481 people have had their second dose. MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus laws for
another six months. A total of 484 MPs were for the motion and 76 against giving a majority of 408. MPs have finished debating whether to extend emergency coronavirus laws to the end of September and it's gone to a vote. Wrapping up the three and a half hour debate, Health and Social Care Minister Edward Argar says: ""They are not measures any of us would choose to do were we not faced with such a grave situation,"" but, he says they are ""necessary"". Nationwide says UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme. It comes after half of staff surveyed said they wanted to work from home full-time. TheUK's biggest building society says its ""work anywhere"" plan will allow employees more controlof their lives. Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Nationwide boss Joe Garner says âfundamentallyâ employees will have total control over where they work from. âOur report says people do still want to  go to the officeâ¦ they just donât want to be compelled to go every day,â he tells Radio 4. âPeople are saying they need the flexibility.â Garner also suggests employees are making âbetter decisionsâ as a consequence of home-working. He says many organisations - not just Nationwide - have observed productivity benefits and benefits to well-being from flexible working.  In the long term, he adds, there might also be environmental benefits. Garner insists the decision is not driven by cost, although he does think in time there will be cost benefits to Nationwide. The move by the building society comes as companies across the UK look into how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model marrying some office work with days working from home. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told EU leaders that the bloc has exported 77 million doses of coronavirus vaccines since early December. The figure is greater than the number of inoculations given to EU citizens so far, and includes more than 30 million doses delivered to low and middle income countries under the global vaccine sharing scheme.

We hope you have a peaceful evening - and the live page will be back in the morning. We are going to be drawing our live updates to a close soon so here's a look back at the day's news: Head gardener Simon Tetlow is preparing for the return of visitors to Tatton Park in Cheshire Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Northern Irelandâs devolved government has announced youth
services will be reopened on a phased basis at the start of next month. The
SureStart programme, which supports the parents of children aged under four, will
also resume. Ministers in the power-sharing Stormont Executive also discussed
international travel at a meeting this afternoon. At a news conference
afterwards, the First Minister Arlene Foster and the deputy First Minister
Michelle OâNeill indicated travellers arriving from countries on the so-called
âred listâ would soon have to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. There are currently
no international flights operating to or from Northern Ireland, but plans are
being made for the quarantine system to come into operation when air routes
resume. OâNeill also said the current coronavirus R-rate in Northern
Ireland is thought to be between 0.75 and 0.95. The Government could face ""chaos"" and a ""Wild West"" of A-level and GCSE grades after this summer's exams were cancelled, MPs have warned. Teacher assessments could lead to ""much higher grade inflation"", the House of Commons Education Select Committee heard. Conservative MP Robert Halfon, committee chairman, said it could ""create chaos for the thousands of students chasing college and further and higher education places in August"". His comments came as Britain's largest teaching union accused the government of ""hiding behind"" teachers who are likely to be ""lambasted"" if this summer's GCSE and A-level grades are higher. In a letter to the Education Secretary, Halfon says: ""The DfE and Ofqual should consider some kind of standardised assessment and a more robust way of validating teacher-assessed grades."" England are due to arrive in Albania on Saturday England's World Cup qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday looked at risk of being called off today because of doubts over security - but the issue now seems to have been resolved. The Albanian Football Association (AFA) earlier said it had been informed by local police the force could not guarantee the safety of the teams. But the country's state police have since issued a statement to say they have ""taken all measures to guarantee order and security"" for the game. The dilemma followed the AFA's request for a restricted number of fans vaccinated against Covid-19 to be permitted to attend the game, which was rejected by government. The match will therefore be played behind closed doors, and with no other lockdown measures in place in the country it could have meant the area around the Air Albania Stadium being busy - seemingly with no promise of adequate policing until the guarantees were given by police. The AFA said it would have had ""catastrophic consequences for the image of our country, the national team and in general for Albanian football"" if it had been forced to cancel the game. England open up their campaignagainst San Marino in less than half an hour, while Albania play in Andorra at the same time. Read more here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News No Covid vaccines have yet been authorised for use in
children under 16 but there are numerous trials now taking place to test their
effects in this age group. Pfizer is the latest drug company to announce the start of a
trial in children under 12, saying it hopes to produce data in the second half
of this year. The US company has already been testing vaccines in teenage
children aged 12-15 and expects to have results from those trials in the next
few weeks. AstraZeneca announced vaccine trials in children aged 6-17some time ago and the first of 300 volunteers were due to be jabbed last month, and Moderna
has said it will test its vaccine on 12 to 17-year-olds. Childrenâs risk of becoming ill or dying with Covid-19 is tiny
and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment. But as countries attempt to bring down deaths, illness and
infection levels to very low levels so normal life can resume, children are now
being considered possible candidates for vaccination as well as adults. If children do play a role in transmission, even if not to
the same extent as adults, then vaccinating them would make sense. But there are lots of hoops to go through first. Are
vaccines safe in children? Do they stop them spreading the virus? What real
difference would vaccinating children make? Only when these questions are answered would regulators give
the green light to approve its use in millions of young children. Will vaccine certificates enable summer travel? EU leaders are looking at how digital certificates - called theGreen Digital Certificate,external- might work to enable travel across Europe in time for summer. The aim is to enable anyone who has been vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU. But some individual countries, such as Denmark and Estonia, have already outlined plans for so-called vaccine certificates. And outside of the EU, Israel has a working system in place. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world,external, with more than half the population having already received two doses, and last month it was able to begin easing a nationwide lockdown. A ""Green Pass"" is available to anyone who has been fully vaccinated or has recovered from Covid-19,external. To access some of the country's facilities - like hotels, gyms or theatres - people have to show their pass. It is available as a paper certificate or in an app, which links users to their health ministry data. The app opens the possibility of being used for international travel, andIsrael has struck deals with Greeceand Cyprus to allow its citizens with vaccination passports to travel to those two countries.

won't trouble Boris Johnson, overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers
to respond to the pandemic. Many of the Tories who voted against the
government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and
lockdowns. For them, it's about trust. Reassurances from ministers about powers
only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. There is deep unease about the scope of
these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if
they're not being used. But the pandemic has changed expectations
of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances, freedoms
considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. The public may have been willing to
largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the
price society has paid has been too high. Sir Graham Brady took part in the debate over whether to extend the Coronavirus Act A senior Tory backbencher who was among 35 of his party's MPs to vote against extending emergency coronavirus laws this afternoon says we need to find ""ways of living sensibly"" with Covid in future winters, as more lockdowns are not the answer. Sir Graham Brady tells Radio 4's PM programme there is a ""fundamental question"" stemming from the fact an endemic disease ""might be coming back every winter for the foreseeable future"". ""If you are going to respond to say that the only reaction to that is to close down the country, to prevent people from seeing their families, to stop people from doing business and earning a living,"" he says, ""then I think that's an apocalyptic vision that would definitely cause far more harm in terms both of deaths and mental health problems and economic devastation than the alternative.

"Jab passports possible 'after all offered vaccine'A review on certificates showing jab status is ongoing but no decisions have been made, PM says.UKComments","This video can not be played The PM says drinkers will not need to prove they have had a vaccine when pubs in England open for outside trade from 12 April It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested. He said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June. There were ""difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed"", the PM added. Any passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity. On Thursday afternoon,MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in Englandfor another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. The Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Will I need a vaccine passport to go to the pub? When can I go to the pub or a restaurant? Pubs could ask to see vaccine passports - PM Meanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago. The latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. Meanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen. A government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. Mr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted. ""There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together."" However he added: ""No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway."" Speaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: ""There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this. ""You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine."" In the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: ""A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate. ""What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,"" he added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? Under government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. The idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". Mr Johnson said the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future ""may be up to individual publicans"". A Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said ""all sorts of things were being considered"" and it was ""really a bit premature"" to speculate on details about how a possible vaccine passport would apply to pubs. The boss of Young's pubs said requiring vaccine passports would be ""unworkable"", while Greene King and the City Pub Group also voiced their opposition to any such measure. The chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain said asking pub-goers to show vaccine passports was a ""fairly poorly thought out idea"" he would not be adopting. Jonathan Neame told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law. ""But if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues."" Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the industry was ""very nervous"" about the ""damage"" such a measure could do to it and ""the future of the Great British Pub"". She told BBC News: ""They're asking us to enforce this at each venue and that's impossible for some of our venues to do - particularly our smaller community pubs in rural locations."" However, Peter Marks, from nightclub owner Rekom UK, said a vaccine certificate ""could work"" in his industry and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour was ""happy to look"" at any government proposals for vaccine and testing certification, but he called for clarity for the hospitality industry about how the measures could work in practice. He said the hospitality industry had been through ""incredibly difficult times over the last year"", adding: ""And suddenly the prime minister comes along, out of the blue, to say here's a new responsibility you're going to have to deal with, without much clarity."" Senior Tory backbencher Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, also expressed concern that businesses would be able to turn away customers ""from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine"".

Shrewsbury baby deaths prompt plan for more midwives,"Nearly Â£100m is to be spent improving maternity safety in England. It is understood as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 obstetrics consultants will be hired. NHS England made the funding commitment in response to the maternity scandal at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust. Richard Stanton, whose daughter Kate died in 2009 after mistakes at the trust, said the money was ""good news"" and ""a step in the right direction for everyone"". Mr Stanton said the announcement was a relief after 12 years of campaigning, alongside his wife, Rhiannon. ""It's something that should have been done sooner... and that is perhaps one criticism here that this should have never taken this long to have got to where we are today. ""If this money can be spent to improve maternity care at grassroots levels in hospitals, there are likely to be children alive in years to come because the care that they receive is as a direct result. ""That is a really humbling legacy to take away from Kate's death,"" said Mr Stanton. An inquiry into maternity failings at the Shropshire trust is looking into 1,862 cases, the vast majority since the year 2000. Rhiannon Davies, pictured with daughter Kate, campaigned for a review into maternity care An initialreport published last year by Donna Ockenden,external, the midwife leading the review, recommended that maternity units across England carry out what she termed seven ""immediate and essential"" actions. Hospital 'blamed' mothers for babies' deaths Investigation of maternity deaths 'too late' These included ensuring midwives and consultants train together, listening properly to the views of women and their families, and better investigations when things go wrong, with lessons learned across the regional NHS system. Today's funding announcement is a response to those concerns and includes money to help the NHS recruit staff from overseas. Figures published by the Nursing and Midwifery Council found there had been an increase of 937 midwives in the UK in the six months to September 2020, bringing the total to just under 39,000. The Royal College of Midwives has estimated that the NHS in England needs more than 2,000 midwives to provide optimal care. RCM chief executive Gill Walton called the new investment ""a significant boost for our under-resourced and under-staffed maternity services. ""Now we must all work together to use this money to have an impact on direct front-line care as quickly as possible, so that we have the right numbers of staff, with the right training, in the right place."" Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said Donna Ockenden's report into the baby deaths scandal had been ""a wake-up call for the system"". ""We look forward to working closely with the government to ensure every penny of this funding is spent in the best way it can be,"" said Dr Morris.

Royal Navy Hawk jet crashes in Cornwall,"Wreckage is shown where the jet ploughed into the woodland north of the village of St Martin A Royal Navy Hawk T1 jet has crashed in woodland in Cornwall. Two pilots ejected from the aircraft which is from the 736 Naval Air Squadron based at RNAS Culdrose, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed. The pilots, who were airlifted to hospital, are in a stable condition ""without significant injury"", police said. Defence Minister Johnny Mercer said the crash was due to ""suspected engine failure"". Updates on the plane crash Emergency services are at the scene of the crash near St Martin ""There's nothing more to it than that,"" he said. ""They've had a problem, they've ejected, they've been picked up. ""We're assessing them and we'll have more information in due course."" Ejection seat manufacturer Martin-Baker said it was the first Royal Navy ejection in 18 years. Police said they received reports of the two-seater training aircraft crashing in the St Martin area on the Lizard Peninsula. Eyewitness David Hoskin, a farmer, said he heard an ""unbelievable bang"" and saw two people ejecting from the plane. He found the two men ""in fairly good spirits"" and ""chatting"" in a field near the crash scene. One had ""cuts and bruises"" on his face from landing in trees next to the field. ""The pilot was very concerned about the whereabouts of the jet,"" he said. ""He said they aimed to put it in the Helford River but we saw it heading away from the river."" A parachute lays tangled in a tree where one of the crew landed By Johnny O'Shea, BBC South West The plane crashed into a small woodland at the bottom of a field. The police have allowed us to within about 50m of the debris but the only evidence of the crash from here is a hole in a hedge and the strong smell of fuel in the air. Beyond the hedge they tell us the plane has broken up into lots of pieces. The military will now be investigating what happened. The fire service has dammed a river that runs through the woodland to reduce the risk of fuel getting into the water course. A discarded helmet at the scene of the crash near St Martin Another eyewitness, Richard Cooper, said: ""There's no plane in view, it's gone through a load of trees and down a valley into a wooded area.

""Then a few minutes later I saw the emergency service vehicles screaming down. ""My heart skipped a few beats when I read the news. I just pray that the guys were OK."" Emma Davis, who was walking near Falmouth, said she saw the jet flying ""low and slowly"" over Helford village ""then in the blink of an eye it was gone"". She said: ""I heard a massive impact explosion, and was expecting to see fire, or smoke, but didn't. ""Then I saw the two pilots had ejected."" Eyewitnesses described an ""unbelievable bang"" before seeing the crew ejecting from the plane Eyewitness Layla Astley said: ""I saw the plane flying low over our house. I heard a clunking sound.

Owner of cargo ship blocking Suez Canal apologises,"This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks The Japanese owner of the giant cargo ship that has been blocking Egypt's Suez Canal since Tuesday has apologised for the disruption to global trade. Shoei Kisen Kaisha said it was trying to resolve the situation as soon as possible, but that dislodging the Ever Given was proving extremely difficult. Marine and salvage engineers failed in their latest attempt on Thursday. The 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel became wedged across the canal amid high winds and a dust storm. How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Evergreen Marine, the Taiwanese firm that operates the ship, has said salvage experts are working with the captain and the Suez Canal Authority to design a more effective plan for refloating it. The blockage is creating long tailbacks in the waterway, with more than 150 vessels currently waiting in the area to pass. About 12% of global trade passes through the canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. The Ever Given is almost as long as Manhattan's Empire State Building is high ""In co-operation with local authorities and Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, a vessel management company, we are trying to refloat [the Ever Given], but we are facing extreme difficulty,"" the owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, said in a statement on Thursday. ""We sincerely apologise for causing a great deal of worry to ships in the Suez Canal and those planning to go through the canal,"" it added. Industry sources told Reuters news agency that even if the Ever Given was refloated quickly its owner and insurers faced claims totalling millions of dollars for the delays and extra costs accrued by other companies. Diggers on the ground are clearing sand and mud away from the Ever Given's bow Toshiaki Fujiwara, an official at Shoei Kisen Kaisha, told AFP news agency that the ship had an insurance policy, but that he was unaware of the details or any costs involved at this stage. ""It's just the beginning,"" he said. Global crude oil prices rose 6% on Wednesday after traffic through the canal was suspended, though they fell more than 4% on Thursday. A flotilla of tugboats, as well as dredgers and diggers resumed efforts to move the Ever Given at high tide on Thursday morning, after stopping overnight. Later, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said in a statement that an attempt to refloat the vessel at about 08:00 was not successful, and that another attempt would be made in the afternoon. The management company added that a team of salvage experts from Smit Salvage had been appointed and were attending to the ship. All navigation through Suez Canal has been temporarily suspended The CEO of Smit Salvage's parent company, Boskalis, warned that it could take weeks, rather than days, to refloat the ship. ""It is like an enormous beached whale. It's an enormous weight on the sand,"" Peter Berdowski told the Dutch TV station NPO. ""We might have to work with a combination of reducing the weight by removing containers, oil and water from the ship, tug boats and dredging of sand."" By Sally Nabil, BBC News, Ismailia The suspension of navigation through the Suez Canal has created an atmosphere of uncertainty. No-one knows exactly when things will go back to normal. The canal is congested. Dozens of ships are waiting to resume their journeys. Experts say that the salvage efforts might work when the tides gets stronger early next week. If attempts to free the ship fail, one of the options would be to unload part of its cargo. But that would take a long time too. The authorities are not giving much detail, and the situation is very tense. The strategic waterway is a huge asset for Egypt. Not only is it a source of national pride, but it also provides much needed foreign cash to the Egyptian economy, which is already struggling. The Ever Given ran aground on Tuesday as it sailed northwards through the canal on its way from China to the Netherlands with two canal pilots on board. Evergreen Marine said the ship ""was suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate from waterway"". Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said initial investigations had ruled out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding. Shoei Kisen Kaisha said the Ever Given's 25-member crew, who are all Indian nationals, were safe and that no oil leaks had been detected. Eight tug boats are pushing and pulling the Ever Given in an attempt to refloat it Almost 19,000 ships passed through the canal in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority - an average of 51.5 ships per day. Service provider Leth Agencies saida total of 156 vessels waiting in the area on Thursday,external, and that three behind Ever Given were being assisted and escorted back to Port Suez in the south. Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at BIMCO, told the BBC that the delayed vessels were not only container ships, but oil and gas tankers and bulk carriers transporting grain supplies. ""We may see production stop at conveyer belts in Europe shortly,"" he warned. In 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal after it ran aground following reported mechanical issues. The Egyptian authorities deployed tug boats and the ship was refloated within hours. Did you witness the incident? Are you on board another vessel on the Suez Canal?

Santander to close more than 100 branches,"Santander has announced plans to close 111 branches across the country due to the shift to mobile and online banking. The bank said it had taken the decision because fewer customers were choosing to bank in branch. About 840 staff will be affected by the closures, although Santander promised to try to find them other jobs within the business. Santander said the reduction in branch visits was a long-term trend that had been accelerated by the pandemic. ""Branch usage by customers has fallen considerably over recent years so we have made the difficult decision to consolidate our presence in areas where we have multiple branches relatively close together,"" said Adam Bishop, head of branches at Santander. The move will reduce Santander's High Street presence to 452 branches. But the bank said the majority of closing branches were within three miles of another Santander branch. The furthest is five miles, it said. ""All are within half a mile of at least two free-to-use ATMs and one mile of the nearest Post Office,"" it added. In the two years before the beginning of the pandemic, the number of transactions handled in branches fell by a third, the bank said. Last year, it declined by a further 50%. Meanwhile, mobile and online transactions have grown 20% each year with more than two-thirds of transactions now completed without customers visiting a branch. Bank of Ireland to shut more than half NI branches HSBC to close 82 branches this year The bank also plans to move its headquarters from London to Milton Keynes and reduce the amount of space it rents in the capital. It will close offices in Bootle, Newcastle, London and Manchester before the end of the year. The 5,000 office staff affected will be asked to work from home more often or travel in to one of its six remaining offices in Belfast, Bradford, Glasgow, London and Sheffield, as well as its new headquarters. ""The pandemic has accelerated the existing trend towards greater flexible working, and our colleagues have told us this has brought significant benefits for many of them,"" Santander's UK boss Nathan Bostock said. ""At the same time, physical spaces remain very important and our sites around the UK will provide our colleagues with first-class facilities fit for the future."" The decision to reduce the number of offices it rents and ask staff to work from home more often followsan announcementfrom building society Nationwide which told its 13,000 office staff that they could choose where they work.

Spears asks judge to end father's conservatorshipThe singer formally asks a judge to remove Jamie Spears from his role as her conservator.,"Britney Spears is under two conservatorships - one of her estate and one of her as a person Britney Spears' lawyer has formally asked a judge to permanently remove the pop star's father from his role overseeing her personal affairs. The singer's life has been controlled by a court-ordered conservatorship since 2008 after her public breakdown. A temporary conservator, Jodi Montgomery, was appointed in 2019 after her father Jamie Spears stepped down due to health issues. Spears is now requesting that Montgomery be made permanent. Spears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person. The singer's father Jamie used to be in control of both, but stepped down from being her personal conservator in 2019 due to health reasons. He remained a co-conservator of her estate alongside financial company the Bessemer Trust. Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, replaced Jamie Spears as the singer's personal conservator on what has been a temporary basis. Fans from the ""Free Britney"" movement regularly campaign outside the court hearings At the most recent hearing into 39-year-old's conservatorship, Britney Spears' lawyer Samuel D Ingham III told a judge in Los Angeles he would file a petition to make Montgomery's appointment permanent. In addition, court papers show Spears has asked her father to resign from his role overseeing her personal life. The legal documents also state Spears reserves the right to eventually request an end to the conservatorship. The papers say: ""Petitioner expressly reserves the right to petition for termination of this conservatorship under Probate Code section 1861. Nothing in the within petition shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of that right."" Britney Spears' lawyer previously told the court she was scared of her father and would not be returning to the stage while he remained in control of her life. Earlier this year,Jamie Spears' lawyer Vivian Thoreen saidhe is ""a fiercely loving, dedicated and loyal father"" who had stopped Britney from being exploited. As her permanent personal conservator, Montgomery would have the power to ""restrict and limit"" visitors - aside from Ingham - to Spears. Montgomery would also be able to speak with medical professionals about Spears and would have access to her medical records. She would also have the ability to retain caretakers and security guards for the singer, and powers to prosecute civil harassment restraining orders on the star's behalf. Jamie Spears and Britney, pictured in 2006 Although he is not currently acting as his daughter's personal conservator, Jamie Spears remains a co-conservator of his daughter's finances. He oversees her estimated $60m (Â£43.8m) estate alongside private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust. Jamie Spears previously requested the financial company be removed as co-conservator, buta judge ruled in Februarythat he must continue to share the financial conservatorship with the trust. Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears Under the current legal agreement, Britney Spears has not controlled her own finances since 2008. The next hearing in the case is set to take place in April.

How would passport app work?,"There is speculation the NHS app could be amended to include a Covid vaccine certificate As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play. And despiteprevious denialsthat a ""Covid passport"" app was being considered, it is now on the agenda. After all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision. But earlier this weekThe Times reported,externalthat the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England. It is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it. But according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start. Officially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject. But it's clear there would be several benefits. Firstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records. In fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information. (Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself). So health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information. There is a risk countries develop Covid passports that rely on local systems that do not intercommunicate Secondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved. To set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence. The smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification. And then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access. However, there are still issues to be addressed. People would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen. And then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily. Another health pass app points the way to how that might be done. Tested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff. Of course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it. Tested.me presents a QR barcode over a view of the user's face to provide a quick way for employers to verify and log their health status And there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue. That presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated. And one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on. So the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others. A further consideration is that these ""passports"" would probably not be used for travel abroad. The World Health Organization is exploringwhat specifications an international scheme,externalwould require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. It already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate. And the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app. The face-scanning tech used by the NHS app is supplied by iProov One last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. These would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data. Identity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this. Its chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter. In any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. And that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality.

Royal Navy Hawk jet crashes in CornwallTwo pilots are taken to hospital after ejecting from the Hawk T1 jet near RNAS Culdrose.,"Wreckage is shown where the jet ploughed into the woodland north of the village of St Martin A Royal Navy Hawk T1 jet has crashed in woodland in Cornwall. Two pilots ejected from the aircraft which is from the 736 Naval Air Squadron based at RNAS Culdrose, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed. The pilots, who were airlifted to hospital, are in a stable condition ""without significant injury"", police said. Defence Minister Johnny Mercer said the crash was due to ""suspected engine failure"". Updates on the plane crash Emergency services are at the scene of the crash near St Martin ""There's nothing more to it than that,"" he said. ""They've had a problem, they've ejected, they've been picked up. ""We're assessing them and we'll have more information in due course."" Ejection seat manufacturer Martin-Baker said it was the first Royal Navy ejection in 18 years. Police said they received reports of the two-seater training aircraft crashing in the St Martin area on the Lizard Peninsula. Eyewitness David Hoskin, a farmer, said he heard an ""unbelievable bang"" and saw two people ejecting from the plane. He found the two men ""in fairly good spirits"" and ""chatting"" in a field near the crash scene. One had ""cuts and bruises"" on his face from landing in trees next to the field. ""The pilot was very concerned about the whereabouts of the jet,"" he said. ""He said they aimed to put it in the Helford River but we saw it heading away from the river."" A parachute lays tangled in a tree where one of the crew landed By Johnny O'Shea, BBC South West The plane crashed into a small woodland at the bottom of a field. The police have allowed us to within about 50m of the debris but the only evidence of the crash from here is a hole in a hedge and the strong smell of fuel in the air. Beyond the hedge they tell us the plane has broken up into lots of pieces. The military will now be investigating what happened. The fire service has dammed a river that runs through the woodland to reduce the risk of fuel getting into the water course. A discarded helmet at the scene of the crash near St Martin Another eyewitness, Richard Cooper, said: ""There's no plane in view, it's gone through a load of trees and down a valley into a wooded area. There's a handful of broken branches. ""There was a strong smell of fuel when I first arrived but that's gone now."" One eyewitness said the scene looked ""a little chaotic"" but emergency services appeared to have it under control Tina Searle, who lives on a farm near St Martin, said: ""I thought it was a bit low but I just thought they're doing a manoeuvre or something. ""Then a few minutes later I saw the emergency service vehicles screaming down. ""My heart skipped a few beats when I read the news. I just pray that the guys were OK."" Emma Davis, who was walking near Falmouth, said she saw the jet flying ""low and slowly"" over Helford village ""then in the blink of an eye it was gone"". She said: ""I heard a massive impact explosion, and was expecting to see fire, or smoke, but didn't. ""Then I saw the two pilots had ejected."" Eyewitnesses described an ""unbelievable bang"" before seeing the crew ejecting from the plane Eyewitness Layla Astley said: ""I saw the plane flying low over our house. I heard a clunking sound. It flew on over our fields and then there was a loud crack and we saw two pilots ejecting. ""I watched as their parachutes opened. ""I then saw the plane bank left and over the top of a hill before hearing a very loud bang. There was no smoke or fire and I hear from locals that thankfully no-one was seriously hurt.""

Details of injuries not known at this time."" Craig Hoyle, editor of Flight International Magazine and a former Hawk pilot, said the simulated attacks which 736 Squadron specialises in were ""very exciting"". ""You end up flying above the water at about 100ft at 400mph, so it's pretty exhilarating stuff,"" he said. Accidents were ""very rare"" and the aircraft were ""very well maintained"", he said, but if the plane's single engine had failed as suspected, the crew would not have been able to return to RNAS Culdrose.

Father of young IRA victim criticises Libya decision,"Muammar Gaddafi supplied weapons, including Semtex explosives, to the IRA during the Troubles Victims of IRA bombs have expressed anger at news the UK government cannot use frozen Libyan assets for compensation. The father of a 12-year-old boy killed in the 1993 Warrington bomb has also questioned the government's rejection of calls to publish a report commissioned to examine the issue. Colin Parry's son Tim died in 1993 alongside three-year-old Jonathan Ball. Libyan-supplied Semtex explosive was thought to have been used. Tim Parry, 12, died in the 1993 Warrington bomb Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Parry said the public ""may never know"" the reasons behind the government's refusal to compensate the victims of Libyan-backed terrorism. ""It's not as if it's a financial block - it's clearly a political decision,"" he said. ""It's a decision I can only imagine is based on the multi-layered complexity when it comes to historical issues related to Northern Ireland terrorism. The government has said it would be against international law to use some Â£12bn in frozen Libyan assets to compensate victims. Colin Parry said the issue could be easily resolved by releasing the assets On Wednesday,it emerged that a report examining compensation options, completed last year by government investigator William Shawcross, will not be published. Mr Parry asked why William Shawcross was given the remit to look into the issue ""if [the government] weren't prepared to act upon what he might say"". ""It's easily resolved through seized Libyan assets, but for reasons we may never know, the government is sitting on this report. I can only conclude that the government fears it will open up all sorts of matters which have been buried deep for some time now."" Mervyn Lewers, from Londonderry, who lost his legs following an under-car booby-trap bombing in 1988, said the government ""wants all victims to die off and go away"". He said his life is ""a continuing battle"". He told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme: ""It's 33 years since I was injured and I'm heading again to Musgrave Hospital today."" Compensation would have ""meant a lot"", he said, as he has to pay someone to assist with ""ordinary things around the house"". Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime supplied large amounts of weapons and explosives to the IRA during the Troubles. Mr Lewers questioned why William Shawcross, who was appointed by the government to look into the issue of compensation, met representatives of Sinn FÃ©in, but not victims, before filing his report. ""It's public knowledge that members of Sinn FÃ©in were convicted terrorists. For me, it's wrong."" Mr Shawcross, who appeared before the NI Affairs Committee on Wednesday, said he could not disclose details of his own report. Libya tax cash 'should go to IRA victims' Frozen Libyan assets won't be used for IRA victims In a written statement to parliament on Tuesday, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly said the ""internal scoping report"" was commissioned to provide advice to ministers and draws on ""private and confidential conversations"". Libyan Semtex was used in the Remembrance Sunday bombing in Enniskillen He said the ""frozen assets may not be seized by the UK government"". He also ruled out using public funds to pay compensation to victims and then recouping the money from the Libyan government. He said the responsibility for providing compensation lies with the Libyan state and the government had urged the authorities at the ""highest level"" to engage with UK victims. Unionist peer Lord Empey described the refusal to use the assets to compensate victims as ""a very murky business"". ""Other countries - the United States, France and Germany - all of them have got compensation for their victims. The United Kingdom hasn't even asked for it. So there's something wrong."" Kenny Donaldson, of Innocent Victims United, said: ""For two years the UK government has been responsible for heaping further pain upon those already treated so shamefully. ""The Shawcross Report can't even be described as a 'whitewash' because it continues to be held back from victims, the full contents remain hidden.""

NI fishermen 'short-changed' in Brexit fish quota,"Northern Ireland's fishermen say they have been short-changed in a UK share-out of extra Brexit fish. They say they got only Â£14m of the Â£20m-a-year worth of additional quota they believe they were due. A spokesman for one of the two main fishing organisations, Alan McCulla, said Northern Ireland's Brexit fish dividend had been ""plundered"". He warned last week that the government intended to give the bulk of the Brexit fish to Scotland. Mr McCulla claimed it was part of a ploy to shore up support for the Conservative candidates ahead of key elections there in May, in order to see off a future Scottish independence referendum. A Department of Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson said: ""We have worked closely with the devolved administrations to make sure that the additional fishing quota we have secured for the UK is allocated fairly. ""For the majority of Northern Ireland priority stocks, such as haddock, fishers receive a higher share than they did last year."" The UK negotiated a return of fish previously caught by EU boats in UK waters as part of the Brexit deal. It was left to Whitehall to decide how to share it out in consultation with the devolved nations. The detail of the share-out was quietly published on Wednesday. NI fishermen want 'fair share' of UK Brexit quota NI fishermen fear being 'mugged' of extra Brexit fish Mr McCulla said Northern Ireland had got a fair share in the Irish Sea, but pointed out that 60% of the fleet's catch by value was taken in wider UK waters. He said his members had been ""mugged"" of new opportunities in those areas. ""The London government's spin that the Brexit fisheries boost is distributed across the UK may be true, but the fact is that distribution has been rigged to favour some areas more than others,"" he said. Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said: ""I am disappointed with the secretary of state's decision to allocate additional quota gained from the EU in 2021, using a method based on track record and geographical zonal attachment. ""I and the NI industry had argued strongly for allocation based on the existing system of fixed quota allocation units as this would have delivered the greatest gain in additional quota for Northern Ireland. ""Our industry fishes not just in the Irish Sea but all round the UK and any element of geographical zonal attachment in the apportionment calculation works to our disadvantage. I will continue to press for a fair share of additional fishing quota for 2022 and beyond.""

"Vaccine passport review due by April, says PMBoris Johnson says certificates showing jab status could only come in when everyone has been vaccinated.","This video can not be played The PM says drinkers will not need to prove they have had a vaccine when pubs in England open for outside trade from 12 April It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested. He said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June. There were ""difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed"", the PM added. Any passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity. On Thursday afternoon,MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in Englandfor another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. The Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Will I need a vaccine passport to go to the pub? When can I go to the pub or a restaurant? Pubs could ask to see vaccine passports - PM Meanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago. The latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. Meanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen. A government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. Mr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted. ""There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together."" However he added: ""No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway."" Speaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: ""There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this. ""You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine."" In the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: ""A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate. ""What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,"" he added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? Under government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. The idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". Mr Johnson said the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future ""may be up to individual publicans"". A Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply.

Your updates were brought to you by Emma Owen, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Owen Amos and Victoria Lindrea. We hope you have a peaceful evening - and the live page will be back in the morning. We are going to be drawing our live updates to a close soon so here's a look back at the day's news: Head gardener Simon Tetlow is preparing for the return of visitors to Tatton Park in Cheshire Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Northern Irelandâs devolved government has announced youth
services will be reopened on a phased basis at the start of next month. The
SureStart programme, which supports the parents of children aged under four, will
also resume. Ministers in the power-sharing Stormont Executive also discussed
international travel at a meeting this afternoon. At a news conference
afterwards, the First Minister Arlene Foster and the deputy First Minister
Michelle OâNeill indicated travellers arriving from countries on the so-called
âred listâ would soon have to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. There are currently
no international flights operating to or from Northern Ireland, but plans are
being made for the quarantine system to come into operation when air routes
resume. OâNeill also said the current coronavirus R-rate in Northern
Ireland is thought to be between 0.75 and 0.95. The Government could face ""chaos"" and a ""Wild West"" of A-level and GCSE grades after this summer's exams were cancelled, MPs have warned. Teacher assessments could lead to ""much higher grade inflation"", the House of Commons Education Select Committee heard. Conservative MP Robert Halfon, committee chairman, said it could ""create chaos for the thousands of students chasing college and further and higher education places in August"". His comments came as Britain's largest teaching union accused the government of ""hiding behind"" teachers who are likely to be ""lambasted"" if this summer's GCSE and A-level grades are higher. In a letter to the Education Secretary, Halfon says: ""The DfE and Ofqual should consider some kind of standardised assessment and a more robust way of validating teacher-assessed grades."" England are due to arrive in Albania on Saturday England's World Cup qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday looked at risk of being called off today because of doubts over security - but the issue now seems to have been resolved. The Albanian Football Association (AFA) earlier said it had been informed by local police the force could not guarantee the safety of the teams. But the country's state police have since issued a statement to say they have ""taken all measures to guarantee order and security"" for the game. The dilemma followed the AFA's request for a restricted number of fans vaccinated against Covid-19 to be permitted to attend the game, which was rejected by government. The match will therefore be played behind closed doors, and with no other lockdown measures in place in the country it could have meant the area around the Air Albania Stadium being busy - seemingly with no promise of adequate policing until the guarantees were given by police. The AFA said it would have had ""catastrophic consequences for the image of our country, the national team and in general for Albanian football"" if it had been forced to cancel the game. England open up their campaignagainst San Marino in less than half an hour, while Albania play in Andorra at the same time. Read more here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News No Covid vaccines have yet been authorised for use in
children under 16 but there are numerous trials now taking place to test their
effects in this age group. Pfizer is the latest drug company to announce the start of a
trial in children under 12, saying it hopes to produce data in the second half
of this year. The US company has already been testing vaccines in teenage
children aged 12-15 and expects to have results from those trials in the next
few weeks. AstraZeneca announced vaccine trials in children aged 6-17some time ago and the first of 300 volunteers were due to be jabbed last month, and Moderna
has said it will test its vaccine on 12 to 17-year-olds. Childrenâs risk of becoming ill or dying with Covid-19 is tiny
and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment. But as countries attempt to bring down deaths, illness and
infection levels to very low levels so normal life can resume, children are now
being considered possible candidates for vaccination as well as adults. If children do play a role in transmission, even if not to
the same extent as adults, then vaccinating them would make sense. But there are lots of hoops to go through first. Are
vaccines safe in children? Do they stop them spreading the virus? What real
difference would vaccinating children make? Only when these questions are answered would regulators give
the green light to approve its use in millions of young children. Will vaccine certificates enable summer travel? EU leaders are looking at how digital certificates - called theGreen Digital Certificate,external- might work to enable travel across Europe in time for summer. The aim is to enable anyone who has been vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU. But some individual countries, such as Denmark and Estonia, have already outlined plans for so-called vaccine certificates. And outside of the EU, Israel has a working system in place. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world,external, with more than half the population having already received two doses, and last month it was able to begin easing a nationwide lockdown. A ""Green Pass"" is available to anyone who has been fully vaccinated or has recovered from Covid-19,external. To access some of the country's facilities - like hotels, gyms or theatres - people have to show their pass. It is available as a paper certificate or in an app, which links users to their health ministry data. The app opens the possibility of being used for international travel, andIsrael has struck deals with Greeceand Cyprus to allow its citizens with vaccination passports to travel to those two countries.

won't trouble Boris Johnson, overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers
to respond to the pandemic. Many of the Tories who voted against the
government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and
lockdowns. For them, it's about trust. Reassurances from ministers about powers
only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. There is deep unease about the scope of
these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if
they're not being used. But the pandemic has changed expectations
of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances, freedoms
considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. The public may have been willing to
largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the
price society has paid has been too high. Sir Graham Brady took part in the debate over whether to extend the Coronavirus Act A senior Tory backbencher who was among 35 of his party's MPs to vote against extending emergency coronavirus laws this afternoon says we need to find ""ways of living sensibly"" with Covid in future winters, as more lockdowns are not the answer. Sir Graham Brady tells Radio 4's PM programme there is a ""fundamental question"" stemming from the fact an endemic disease ""might be coming back every winter for the foreseeable future"". ""If you are going to respond to say that the only reaction to that is to close down the country, to prevent people from seeing their families, to stop people from doing business and earning a living,"" he says, ""then I think that's an apocalyptic vision that would definitely cause far more harm in terms both of deaths and mental health problems and economic devastation than the alternative. ""So I think it's inevitable if we see this coming back in future years and future winters, which is entirely likely, we are going to have to find ways of living sensibly with a very nasty virus, which will include some restrictions. ""But I don't think it's plausible to suggest that lockdown is the answer to that."" US President Joe Biden says officials aim to deliver 200 million coronavirus jabs in the first 100 days of his administration. The target is double the original goal. ""I believe we can do it,"" he says. After a slow start under the Trump presidency, the pace of vaccinations has been rapidly climbing. Biden says economic growth is now expected to exceed 6% this year as his recovery plan takes effect. He says there are still too many Americans out of work and hurting, but help is on the way. Biden has been making the comments in his first news conference since taking office. This video can not be played Johnson: 'I do badly need a hair cut' Prime Minister Boris Johnson admits he ""badly"" needs a haircut, but jokes that he's booked in to the pub. In video recorded shortly before an interview, he's asked if Carrie Symonds, his fiancÃ©e, might cut his hair, to which he responds ""she's going to have another go, yeah"". The group will be given exclusive use of a hotel on the Greek island of Rhodes A Dutch travel firm will take nearly 200 people for an eight-day holiday in Greece aimed at seeing if tourism is feasible during the Covid-19 pandemic. Those picked will have an all-inclusive getaway on the island of Rhodes at a cost of â¬399 (Â£344; $472) per person, but there are some catches. They will not be allowed to leave the resort and will have to quarantine for up to ten days when they return home. At least 25,000 people have signed up for the government-backed experiment. TheDutch government's travel advice,externalotherwise is that all foreign trips should be avoided, unless essential, until at least the middle of May. While many people may like to swap a life of lockdown for a week of Greek sunshine, questions have been raised about whether enabling such escapism is responsible or reckless at a time when both the infection rate and hospital admissions in the Netherlands are on the rise, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports. The Netherlands has recorded at least 16,536 deaths,externaland 2,746,581 cases of infection during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. But with public pressure mounting to allow summer holidays to go ahead, experiments like this one could help to determine whether there is a Covid-secure way to allow people to take an overseas break during the pandemic, she adds.

It means that almost half the adult population - 703,334 people - have had at least one jab. The official figures showed that more than 104,907 people had now received a second dose. There have been no further Covid-related deaths recorded by NI's Department of health, meaning the total number of deaths remains at 2,107. The latest figures come after Health minister Robin Swann said on Wednesday thatforeign travel in the summer should be ruled out. Mr Swann said Westminster and the devolved governments were discussing the so-called ""red list"" for foreign countries. He added that fragilities in NI's health system underlined the need for caution as lockdown eases. Professor Ultan Power, a virologist at Queen's University, said that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a Covid vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. He told Good Morning Ulster: ""If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place."" Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company denies that it is failing to honour its contract. Read more here. The UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures,external. Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure of 6,303 but the number of Covid-related deaths reported has fallen 32, compared with 95 last Thursday. Meanwhile, the latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. The exact figure is 28,991,188 - and 2,775,481 people have had their second dose. MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus laws for
another six months. A total of 484 MPs were for the motion and 76 against giving a majority of 408. MPs have finished debating whether to extend emergency coronavirus laws to the end of September and it's gone to a vote. Wrapping up the three and a half hour debate, Health and Social Care Minister Edward Argar says: ""They are not measures any of us would choose to do were we not faced with such a grave situation,"" but, he says they are ""necessary"". Nationwide says UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme. It comes after half of staff surveyed said they wanted to work from home full-time. TheUK's biggest building society says its ""work anywhere"" plan will allow employees more controlof their lives. Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Nationwide boss Joe Garner says âfundamentallyâ employees will have total control over where they work from. âOur report says people do still want to  go to the officeâ¦ they just donât want to be compelled to go every day,â he tells Radio 4. âPeople are saying they need the flexibility.â Garner also suggests employees are making âbetter decisionsâ as a consequence of home-working. He says many organisations - not just Nationwide - have observed productivity benefits and benefits to well-being from flexible working.  In the long term, he adds, there might also be environmental benefits. Garner insists the decision is not driven by cost, although he does think in time there will be cost benefits to Nationwide. The move by the building society comes as companies across the UK look into how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model marrying some office work with days working from home. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told EU leaders that the bloc has exported 77 million doses of coronavirus vaccines since early December. The figure is greater than the number of inoculations given to EU citizens so far, and includes more than 30 million doses delivered to low and middle income countries under the global vaccine sharing scheme.

Leaders at a virtual summit are debating the Commission's proposal to tighten export controls on vaccines as a way to boost supplies within the EU, as infections surge in many member states. Speaking to German MPs before the summit, Chancellor Angela Merkeldefended the EU's decision to procure vaccines jointlyas the bloc struggles with delays in rollout. But some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Prof Tim Spector, who leads the Covid Symptom Tracker app study run by King's College London, says any vaccine passport would have to be digital and people just have to ""bite the bullet"". He tells the PA news agency: ""It was always obvious to me that vaccine passports were going to come in. ""Bits of paper are not going to be that. It's got to be digital, it's got to be something on your phone, and I think that's going to be useful in some scenarios."" Prof Spector says: ""We just need to get used to it and bite the bullet, in a way, because it's going to affect our travel outside this country as well, so we might as well get our own system in order. ""It has got to be a simple system - that should be quite possible - and everyone gets a unique code number from their vaccine that can be checked."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Vaccine passport review due by April, says PM","This video can not be played The PM says drinkers will not need to prove they have had a vaccine when pubs in England open for outside trade from 12 April It may only be possible to introduce a vaccine passports scheme once all adults have been offered a jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested. He said no decisions had been made but there would be an update on the idea in April. A review will report in June. There were ""difficult issues... moral complexities, ethical problems that need to be addressed"", the PM added. Any passport could also reflect a negative test result as well as whether someone was vaccinated or has immunity. On Thursday afternoon,MPs voted to extend emergency coronavirus powers in Englandfor another six months, with 484 in favour, and 76 against, giving a majority of 408. The Coronavirus Act was introduced in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Will I need a vaccine passport to go to the pub? When can I go to the pub or a restaurant? Pubs could ask to see vaccine passports - PM Meanwhile, the UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures.,external Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure - but the number of Covid-related deaths has fallen by 32, compared with a week ago. The latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. Meanwhile, publicans have case doubt on a suggestion from Mr Johnson that pub-goers might have to prove their vaccination status when venues reopen. A government review into the possible use of coronavirus passports or status certificates to allow people to visit pubs and other venues is taking place under the plans to ease England's lockdown. Mr Johnson said previous coronavirus infections could be a feature, if the certificates are adopted. ""There are three basic components. There's the vaccine, there's your immunity you might have had after you've had Covid, and there's testing - they are three things that could work together."" However he added: ""No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April 12 when it will all be outdoors anyway."" Speaking on a visit to a nursery in west London, Mr Johnson said: ""There are some people who for medical reasons can't get a vaccination, pregnant women can't get a vaccination at the moment, you've got to be careful about how you do this. ""You might only be able to implement a thorough-going vaccination passport scheme even if you wanted such a thing in the context of when absolutely everybody had been offered a vaccine."" In the Commons, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, told MPs: ""A system that relied purely on vaccination would not be appropriate. ""What would be right was a system that ensured we could open up our economy to the maximum extent that takes into account both vaccine status but also of recent test status and indeed potentially also antibody status as well,"" he added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? Under government plans to ease the lockdown in England, pubs will be able to start serving customers indoors - with a size limit applied to groups - from 17 May at the earliest. The idea of asking pub-goers to show a so-called vaccine passport or certificate was raised at Wednesday's House of Commons Liaison Committee hearing when Boris Johnson was asked whether they were ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". Mr Johnson said the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" - pointing out that doctors already have to have hepatitis B jabs - although he stressed such a move in future ""may be up to individual publicans"". A Downing Street source earlier said the review would include looking at how people's vaccination and testing status could be stored securely and displayed on a mobile phone, and the circumstances under which such a system could apply. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said ""all sorts of things were being considered"" and it was ""really a bit premature"" to speculate on details about how a possible vaccine passport would apply to pubs. The boss of Young's pubs said requiring vaccine passports would be ""unworkable"", while Greene King and the City Pub Group also voiced their opposition to any such measure. The chief executive of the Shepherd Neame pub chain said asking pub-goers to show vaccine passports was a ""fairly poorly thought out idea"" he would not be adopting. Jonathan Neame told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's absolutely fine to exclude people where there is a situation of bad behaviour or drunkenness, and that's already enshrined in law. ""But if you're going to exclude people for what they are, or what they have not done, that's a wholly different issue which does touch on discrimination, civil liberties, and in this case data protection issues."" Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the industry was ""very nervous"" about the ""damage"" such a measure could do to it and ""the future of the Great British Pub"". She told BBC News: ""They're asking us to enforce this at each venue and that's impossible for some of our venues to do - particularly our smaller community pubs in rural locations."" However, Peter Marks, from nightclub owner Rekom UK, said a vaccine certificate ""could work"" in his industry and would probably be accepted by customers already used to carrying IDs to get into venues. However, he said he was concerned introducing such a measure could delay the reopening of businesses. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Labour was ""happy to look"" at any government proposals for vaccine and testing certification, but he called for clarity for the hospitality industry about how the measures could work in practice. He said the hospitality industry had been through ""incredibly difficult times over the last year"", adding: ""And suddenly the prime minister comes along, out of the blue, to say here's a new responsibility you're going to have to deal with, without much clarity."" Senior Tory backbencher Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, also expressed concern that businesses would be able to turn away customers ""from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine"".

Merkel defends rollout as vaccine pressure growsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel defends the EU's decision to procure coronavirus vaccines jointly.Europe,"Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. The meeting on Thursday will also see EU leaders decide whether to approve proposals to toughen export controls. Such controls could affect supply to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned against imposing ""blockades"". European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the summit would ""ensure that Europeans get their fair share of vaccines"".She also said the EU had exported some 77 million doses to 33 countries since December,external, making the bloc the world's largest vaccine exporter. Some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the bloc's distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference on Thursday. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company has denied that it is failing to honour its contract. European Council President Charles Michel is hosting the video conference with EU leaders, as tensions rise over how to distribute doses among member states. Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is heading a campaign with five Eastern European nations to address what they say has been an uneven distribution of vaccines. ""If no solution is found here it could cause damage to the European Union the likes of which we have not seen in a long time,"" Mr Kurz said ahead of the summit. EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines The EU is also divided over plans to introduce new export controls on vaccines in an effort to boost its own supply. Some member states fear the controls would disrupt global supply chains and damage already strained relations with the UK after Brexit, the BBC's Katya Adler says. The proposals are most likely to affect vaccine-exporting countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. When considering whether to limit exports, the EU would consider the state of the pandemic in that country, its vaccination rate, and whether the country is itself exporting vaccines. There would, however, be no outright export bans. A site in Belgium produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and another in the Netherlands is expected to increase supplies of the jab in the EU. On Thursday, an EU official told the AFP news agency that 21 million vaccines had been sent from the bloc to the UK but none had been sent the other way. A draft of the summit's conclusions, seen by various news media including AFP and Reuters, reportedly says EU leaders will stress ""the importance of ... export authorisations"" while emphasising that vaccine producers must respect agreed delivery deadlines. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, the former president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker urged the bloc to avoid a ""stupid vaccine war"" with the UK. ""This cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere,"" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme. ""We are not in war, and we are not enemies."" He added that threats of export bans could cause ""major reputational damage"" to the EU. This video can not be played Juncker: ""We are not in war, we are not enemies"" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the EU to boost its capacity for vaccine production. ""We can see clearly that British facilities are producing for Great Britain,"" she said. ""The United States isn't exporting, and therefore we are dependent upon what can be produced in Europe."" Mrs Merkel also defended the EU's decision to procure coronavirus vaccines jointly, before warning that the impact of the pandemic could go ""far beyond this year"". French President Emmanuel Macron expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. ""We didn't shoot for the stars,"" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. ""We were wrong to lack ambition."" In another development, Denmark suspended its use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab by a further three weeks and said it was still looking ata possible link to blood clots. Europe's medicines regulator declared that the jab was ""safe and effective"" last week, and is convening a group of experts to explore the issue further on Monday. There is no evidence that the jab is connected to the reports of clots. On the eve of this meeting, a ghost of summits past visited with a warning. Jean-Claude Junker's concern that the EU's reputation could be damaged by threatening export bans is shared, in part, by some member states. The Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland and Belgium are worried about the impact on supply chains. Italy - which has already blocked a consignment of AstraZeneca doses - and France believe tougher action is needed to ensure the EU gets its fair share. There are also smaller divisions over the distribution of the jabs the EU has actually managed to get hold of. Austria is leading a handful of disgruntled Eastern European nations who want a bigger portion. The way the European Commission unveiled its proposals for stricter controls on exports has meant there has been little time for members to consider them. So, while we may see some degree of unity in a non-specific joint statement, clear agreement on the best and quickest way to tackle the EU's vaccination crisis does not seem imminent. A third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe. EU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000. Yet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US. Speaking earlier this week, Mrs Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to ""a new pandemic"". ""The situation is serious,"" she said. ""Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again."" Lockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there isparticular concern over eastern EU states. Poland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged. Why did EU take AstraZeneca to court over vaccines? EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines Italy blocks AstraZeneca shipment to Australia Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Royal Navy plane crashes in Cornwall,"Wreckage is shown where the jet ploughed into the woodland north of the village of St Martin A Royal Navy Hawk T1 jet has crashed in woodland in Cornwall. Two pilots ejected from the aircraft which is from the 736 Naval Air Squadron based at RNAS Culdrose, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed. The pilots, who were airlifted to hospital, are in a stable condition ""without significant injury"", police said. Defence Minister Johnny Mercer said the crash was due to ""suspected engine failure"". Updates on the plane crash Emergency services are at the scene of the crash near St Martin ""There's nothing more to it than that,"" he said. ""They've had a problem, they've ejected, they've been picked up. ""We're assessing them and we'll have more information in due course."" Ejection seat manufacturer Martin-Baker said it was the first Royal Navy ejection in 18 years. Police said they received reports of the two-seater training aircraft crashing in the St Martin area on the Lizard Peninsula. Eyewitness David Hoskin, a farmer, said he heard an ""unbelievable bang"" and saw two people ejecting from the plane. He found the two men ""in fairly good spirits"" and ""chatting"" in a field near the crash scene. One had ""cuts and bruises"" on his face from landing in trees next to the field. ""The pilot was very concerned about the whereabouts of the jet,"" he said. ""He said they aimed to put it in the Helford River but we saw it heading away from the river."" A parachute lays tangled in a tree where one of the crew landed By Johnny O'Shea, BBC South West The plane crashed into a small woodland at the bottom of a field. The police have allowed us to within about 50m of the debris but the only evidence of the crash from here is a hole in a hedge and the strong smell of fuel in the air. Beyond the hedge they tell us the plane has broken up into lots of pieces. The military will now be investigating what happened. The fire service has dammed a river that runs through the woodland to reduce the risk of fuel getting into the water course. A discarded helmet at the scene of the crash near St Martin Another eyewitness, Richard Cooper, said: ""There's no plane in view, it's gone through a load of trees and down a valley into a wooded area. There's a handful of broken branches. ""There was a strong smell of fuel when I first arrived but that's gone now."" One eyewitness said the scene looked ""a little chaotic"" but emergency services appeared to have it under control Tina Searle, who lives on a farm near St Martin, said: ""I thought it was a bit low but I just thought they're doing a manoeuvre or something. ""Then a few minutes later I saw the emergency service vehicles screaming down. ""My heart skipped a few beats when I read the news. I just pray that the guys were OK."" Emma Davis, who was walking near Falmouth, said she saw the jet flying ""low and slowly"" over Helford village ""then in the blink of an eye it was gone"". She said: ""I heard a massive impact explosion, and was expecting to see fire, or smoke, but didn't. ""Then I saw the two pilots had ejected."" Eyewitnesses described an ""unbelievable bang"" before seeing the crew ejecting from the plane Eyewitness Layla Astley said: ""I saw the plane flying low over our house. I heard a clunking sound. It flew on over our fields and then there was a loud crack and we saw two pilots ejecting. ""I watched as their parachutes opened. ""I then saw the plane bank left and over the top of a hill before hearing a very loud bang. There was no smoke or fire and I hear from locals that thankfully no-one was seriously hurt.""

""You end up flying above the water at about 100ft at 400mph, so it's pretty exhilarating stuff,"" he said. Accidents were ""very rare"" and the aircraft were ""very well maintained"", he said, but if the plane's single engine had failed as suspected, the crew would not have been able to return to RNAS Culdrose.

North Korea fires two ballistic missiles,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's return to testing missiles will be getting the attention of the White House North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles into the sea to its east, say the US and Japan, the first such test since Joe Biden became US president. Pyongyang is banned from testing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions. Both Japan and South Korea, which call it the Sea of Japan and East Sea respectively, have condemned the test. It comes just days after North Korea reportedly fired two non-ballistic missiles into the Yellow Sea. Japan said no debris had fallen within its territorial waters. The US Pacific Command, which oversees military forces in the Asia-Pacific region, said on Thursday that the test highlighted ""the threat that North Korea's illicit weapons programme poses to its neighbours and the international community"". North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea 'not responding' to US contact efforts Mr Biden is yet to officially comment. On Tuesday,he played down a non-ballistic missile launch which took place over the weekend,saying the US did not consider it a provocation. Those short-range missiles were thought to be either artillery or cruise missiles, which are not banned under the UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea. Thursday's test also comes days after the US received its first North Korean in custody after Mun Chol Myung was extradited from Malaysia.Mr Mun is a businessman accused of laundering money through the US financial system,externalto provide luxury items to North Korea. The incident angered North Korea so much it cut off diplomatic ties with Malaysia. This is a bigger deal for the US and its allies. The test at the weekend of either artillery or cruise missiles can be shrugged off. But this ballistic missile test is a clear violation of United Nations Security sanctions. Having said that, Mr Biden's predecessor Donald Trump did wave off any questions regarding similar weapons tests in 2019. The deal between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un reached in Singapore in 2018 was that Pyongyang would not test long-range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons. At that time, the White House did not concern itself with smaller tests. But Mr Biden's team is just back from Japan and South Korea, and promised that ""America was back"" and supporting its allies. Perhaps then, the administration will have to say something about a weapons test which threatens its friends in North East Asia. Washington will also be aware that Pyongyang has bigger weapons in its arsenal which it has not tested since late 2017. North Korea has spent more than a year in isolation. It even cut off most trade with its closest ally China amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, and its economy is thought to be in a dire state. Now that the weapons tests appear to be making a return, many are wondering just how far is Kim Jong-un willing to go to get the attention of the White House. Japanese officials said North Korea fired the two missiles after 07:00 local time on Thursday (20:00 GMT Wednesday). They flew 420km and 430km respectively before landing in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone. There was no damage inflicted to ships or aeroplanes. North Korea last fired ballistic missiles, considered threatening weapons, a year agoamid stalled relations between then-US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The Biden administration says it has unsuccessfully tried to make diplomatic contact with North Korea. Pyongyang has yet to acknowledge that Mr Biden is now in office, and the two countries remain at loggerheads over the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

"Churchill, Kermit and Janet preserved for posterityThey're part of the 25 recordings being added to this year's recordings for the US Library of Congress.","Spotify recently revealed that 60,000 tracks are uploaded to its servers every day - that's a new song every one and a half seconds. The US Library of Congress is more picky: admitting just 25 recordings to its Recording Registry every year. Those works, which are deemed to have historical and cultural significance, are then preserved for posterity. This year's inductees have just been announced, with Janet Jackson, Winston Churchill and The Muppets on the list. Nas' iconic debut, Illmatic, was also added to the registry, as was Labelle's Lady Marmalade and Louis Armstrong's 1938 recording of When the Saints Go Marching In. Raised on Janet: How the star changed one fan's life The Village People's YMCA preserved for posterity Radiohead album preserved by Congress Churchill is included for his speech at the White House on Christmas Eve 1941, less than three weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into the Second World War. Broadcast around the world, the speech was a plea to put the horrors of war on pause during Christmas. ""Let the children have their night of fun and laughter,"" said the British prime minister.  ""Let the gifts of Father Christmas delight their play.  Let us grown-ups share to the full in their unstinted pleasures before we turn again to the stern task and the formidable years that lie before us."" Janet Jackson's 1989 album Rhythm Nation 1814 is one of the newest records to be added to the registry this year. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Merkel defends rollout as vaccine pressure grows,"Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. The meeting on Thursday will also see EU leaders decide whether to approve proposals to toughen export controls. Such controls could affect supply to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned against imposing ""blockades"". European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the summit would ""ensure that Europeans get their fair share of vaccines"".She also said the EU had exported some 77 million doses to 33 countries since December,external, making the bloc the world's largest vaccine exporter. Some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the bloc's distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference on Thursday. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company has denied that it is failing to honour its contract. European Council President Charles Michel is hosting the video conference with EU leaders, as tensions rise over how to distribute doses among member states. Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is heading a campaign with five Eastern European nations to address what they say has been an uneven distribution of vaccines. ""If no solution is found here it could cause damage to the European Union the likes of which we have not seen in a long time,"" Mr Kurz said ahead of the summit. EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines The EU is also divided over plans to introduce new export controls on vaccines in an effort to boost its own supply. Some member states fear the controls would disrupt global supply chains and damage already strained relations with the UK after Brexit, the BBC's Katya Adler says. The proposals are most likely to affect vaccine-exporting countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. When considering whether to limit exports, the EU would consider the state of the pandemic in that country, its vaccination rate, and whether the country is itself exporting vaccines. There would, however, be no outright export bans. A site in Belgium produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and another in the Netherlands is expected to increase supplies of the jab in the EU. On Thursday, an EU official told the AFP news agency that 21 million vaccines had been sent from the bloc to the UK but none had been sent the other way. A draft of the summit's conclusions, seen by various news media including AFP and Reuters, reportedly says EU leaders will stress ""the importance of ... export authorisations"" while emphasising that vaccine producers must respect agreed delivery deadlines. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, the former president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker urged the bloc to avoid a ""stupid vaccine war"" with the UK. ""This cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere,"" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme. ""We are not in war, and we are not enemies."" He added that threats of export bans could cause ""major reputational damage"" to the EU. This video can not be played Juncker: ""We are not in war, we are not enemies"" Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for the EU to boost its capacity for vaccine production. ""We can see clearly that British facilities are producing for Great Britain,"" she said. ""The United States isn't exporting, and therefore we are dependent upon what can be produced in Europe."" Mrs Merkel also defended the EU's decision to procure coronavirus vaccines jointly, before warning that the impact of the pandemic could go ""far beyond this year"". French President Emmanuel Macron expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. ""We didn't shoot for the stars,"" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. ""We were wrong to lack ambition."" In another development, Denmark suspended its use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab by a further three weeks and said it was still looking ata possible link to blood clots. Europe's medicines regulator declared that the jab was ""safe and effective"" last week, and is convening a group of experts to explore the issue further on Monday. There is no evidence that the jab is connected to the reports of clots. On the eve of this meeting, a ghost of summits past visited with a warning. Jean-Claude Junker's concern that the EU's reputation could be damaged by threatening export bans is shared, in part, by some member states. The Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland and Belgium are worried about the impact on supply chains. Italy - which has already blocked a consignment of AstraZeneca doses - and France believe tougher action is needed to ensure the EU gets its fair share. There are also smaller divisions over the distribution of the jabs the EU has actually managed to get hold of. Austria is leading a handful of disgruntled Eastern European nations who want a bigger portion. The way the European Commission unveiled its proposals for stricter controls on exports has meant there has been little time for members to consider them. So, while we may see some degree of unity in a non-specific joint statement, clear agreement on the best and quickest way to tackle the EU's vaccination crisis does not seem imminent. A third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe. EU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000. Yet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US. Speaking earlier this week, Mrs Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to ""a new pandemic"". ""The situation is serious,"" she said. ""Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again."" Lockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there isparticular concern over eastern EU states. Poland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged. Why did EU take AstraZeneca to court over vaccines? EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines Italy blocks AstraZeneca shipment to Australia Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Churchill, Kermit and Janet preserved for posterity","Spotify recently revealed that 60,000 tracks are uploaded to its servers every day - that's a new song every one and a half seconds. The US Library of Congress is more picky: admitting just 25 recordings to its Recording Registry every year. Those works, which are deemed to have historical and cultural significance, are then preserved for posterity. This year's inductees have just been announced, with Janet Jackson, Winston Churchill and The Muppets on the list. Nas' iconic debut, Illmatic, was also added to the registry, as was Labelle's Lady Marmalade and Louis Armstrong's 1938 recording of When the Saints Go Marching In. Raised on Janet: How the star changed one fan's life The Village People's YMCA preserved for posterity Radiohead album preserved by Congress Churchill is included for his speech at the White House on Christmas Eve 1941, less than three weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into the Second World War. Broadcast around the world, the speech was a plea to put the horrors of war on pause during Christmas. ""Let the children have their night of fun and laughter,"" said the British prime minister.  ""Let the gifts of Father Christmas delight their play.  Let us grown-ups share to the full in their unstinted pleasures before we turn again to the stern task and the formidable years that lie before us."" Janet Jackson's 1989 album Rhythm Nation 1814 is one of the newest records to be added to the registry this year. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"North Korea fires two ballistic missilesPyongyang is banned from testing such missiles, which were launched into the Sea of Japan.Asia","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's return to testing missiles will be getting the attention of the White House North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles into the sea to its east, say the US and Japan, the first such test since Joe Biden became US president. Pyongyang is banned from testing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions. Both Japan and South Korea, which call it the Sea of Japan and East Sea respectively, have condemned the test. It comes just days after North Korea reportedly fired two non-ballistic missiles into the Yellow Sea. Japan said no debris had fallen within its territorial waters. The US Pacific Command, which oversees military forces in the Asia-Pacific region, said on Thursday that the test highlighted ""the threat that North Korea's illicit weapons programme poses to its neighbours and the international community"". North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea 'not responding' to US contact efforts Mr Biden is yet to officially comment. On Tuesday,he played down a non-ballistic missile launch which took place over the weekend,saying the US did not consider it a provocation. Those short-range missiles were thought to be either artillery or cruise missiles, which are not banned under the UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea. Thursday's test also comes days after the US received its first North Korean in custody after Mun Chol Myung was extradited from Malaysia.Mr Mun is a businessman accused of laundering money through the US financial system,externalto provide luxury items to North Korea. The incident angered North Korea so much it cut off diplomatic ties with Malaysia. This is a bigger deal for the US and its allies. The test at the weekend of either artillery or cruise missiles can be shrugged off. But this ballistic missile test is a clear violation of United Nations Security sanctions. Having said that, Mr Biden's predecessor Donald Trump did wave off any questions regarding similar weapons tests in 2019. The deal between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un reached in Singapore in 2018 was that Pyongyang would not test long-range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons. At that time, the White House did not concern itself with smaller tests. But Mr Biden's team is just back from Japan and South Korea, and promised that ""America was back"" and supporting its allies. Perhaps then, the administration will have to say something about a weapons test which threatens its friends in North East Asia. Washington will also be aware that Pyongyang has bigger weapons in its arsenal which it has not tested since late 2017. North Korea has spent more than a year in isolation. It even cut off most trade with its closest ally China amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, and its economy is thought to be in a dire state. Now that the weapons tests appear to be making a return, many are wondering just how far is Kim Jong-un willing to go to get the attention of the White House. Japanese officials said North Korea fired the two missiles after 07:00 local time on Thursday (20:00 GMT Wednesday). They flew 420km and 430km respectively before landing in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone. There was no damage inflicted to ships or aeroplanes. North Korea last fired ballistic missiles, considered threatening weapons, a year agoamid stalled relations between then-US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The Biden administration says it has unsuccessfully tried to make diplomatic contact with North Korea. Pyongyang has yet to acknowledge that Mr Biden is now in office, and the two countries remain at loggerheads over the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

"French snowboard champion dies in Swiss avalancheJulie Pomagalski, 40, was swept away while skiing off-piste on a mountain in Switzerland.","Julie Pomagalski, France's former world champion snowboarder, has been killed in an avalanche in Switzerland, the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) has announced. Pomagalski, 40, was swept away while skiing off-piste in a group of four in the canton of Uri, officials said. Another French freeride snowboarder was also killed in the avalanche. Pomagalski was a teenager when she became world champion in snowboard cross in 1999. She took the World Cup title for the discipline in 2004 and registered nine wins on the World Cup circuit. In 2002 she competed in the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and four years later in the Turin Games. ""Julie's tragic disappearance has left the French Olympic team in mourning for one of their own,"" CNOSF said in a post on Twitter. Police said the avalanche struck on Tuesday as the group was descending from the Gemsstock mountain. The 2,961m (10,000ft) summit is popular with off-piste skiers because of its steep slopes and powder snow. ""For reasons still unknown a sheet of snow broke away"", sweeping three of the skiers away, officials said. Pomagalski and the other skier who was killed - named by the French ski federation as Bruno Putelli, a mountain rescuer from Albertville - ""were completely buried"".

Reports of plane crash in Cornwall,"Wreckage is shown where the jet ploughed into the woodland north of the village of St Martin A Royal Navy Hawk T1 jet has crashed in woodland in Cornwall. Two pilots ejected from the aircraft which is from the 736 Naval Air Squadron based at RNAS Culdrose, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed. The pilots, who were airlifted to hospital, are in a stable condition ""without significant injury"", police said. Defence Minister Johnny Mercer said the crash was due to ""suspected engine failure"". Updates on the plane crash Emergency services are at the scene of the crash near St Martin ""There's nothing more to it than that,"" he said. ""They've had a problem, they've ejected, they've been picked up. ""We're assessing them and we'll have more information in due course."" Ejection seat manufacturer Martin-Baker said it was the first Royal Navy ejection in 18 years. Police said they received reports of the two-seater training aircraft crashing in the St Martin area on the Lizard Peninsula. Eyewitness David Hoskin, a farmer, said he heard an ""unbelievable bang"" and saw two people ejecting from the plane. He found the two men ""in fairly good spirits"" and ""chatting"" in a field near the crash scene. One had ""cuts and bruises"" on his face from landing in trees next to the field. ""The pilot was very concerned about the whereabouts of the jet,"" he said. ""He said they aimed to put it in the Helford River but we saw it heading away from the river."" A parachute lays tangled in a tree where one of the crew landed By Johnny O'Shea, BBC South West The plane crashed into a small woodland at the bottom of a field. The police have allowed us to within about 50m of the debris but the only evidence of the crash from here is a hole in a hedge and the strong smell of fuel in the air. Beyond the hedge they tell us the plane has broken up into lots of pieces. The military will now be investigating what happened. The fire service has dammed a river that runs through the woodland to reduce the risk of fuel getting into the water course. A discarded helmet at the scene of the crash near St Martin Another eyewitness, Richard Cooper, said: ""There's no plane in view, it's gone through a load of trees and down a valley into a wooded area. There's a handful of broken branches. ""There was a strong smell of fuel when I first arrived but that's gone now."" One eyewitness said the scene looked ""a little chaotic"" but emergency services appeared to have it under control Tina Searle, who lives on a farm near St Martin, said: ""I thought it was a bit low but I just thought they're doing a manoeuvre or something. ""Then a few minutes later I saw the emergency service vehicles screaming down. ""My heart skipped a few beats when I read the news. I just pray that the guys were OK."" Emma Davis, who was walking near Falmouth, said she saw the jet flying ""low and slowly"" over Helford village ""then in the blink of an eye it was gone"".

EU leaders to discuss boosting vaccine supplies,"The EU's vaccine rollout campaign has been slower than that of the UK EU leaders are to hold virtual talks to discuss ways of boosting Covid vaccine supplies and improving the rollout of doses across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission will on Thursday ask leaders to support plans for added controls on vaccine exports, which could affect supply to the UK. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier warned against imposing ""blockades"". The virtual summit comes as a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeps across much of mainland Europe. US President Joe Biden will also dial in to the talks later on Thursday to discuss EU-US relations. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates The European Union's vaccine rollout campaign has been slower than that of the UK. The European Commission has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering the promised doses to the EU. However, leaders are divided over proposals for new restrictions on vaccine exports out of the bloc, which would aim to boost supplies within the EU. A site in Belgium produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and another in the Netherlands is expected to increase supplies of the jab in the EU. Brussels has said that of the more than 40 million doses exported from the EU over the past two months, a quarter were sent to the UK. In a joint statement on Wednesday, the UK and the EU said they wanted to ""create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all"". ""We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" the statement added. The tone of Wednesday's EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as ""slow, cumbersome and difficult"". On both sides. That doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. EU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. Meanwhile, leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK. While there have been suggestions that the proposals being put before EU leaders on Thursday would be focused on the UK and US in particular, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said that this was not the case. ""We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,"" he said. Asked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe ""that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines"" would be ""sensible"". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments ""in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed"", he added. The tougher export controls are most likely to affect vaccine-exporting countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. The key criteria for the proposed regulations are ""reciprocity"" and ""proportionality"": The EU says there is no reciprocity if a country importing vaccines from the EU restricts exports itself - so it may review exports to this country Member states and the Commission will also consider the state of the pandemic in that country, its vaccination rate and vaccine supplies There will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. Vaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned. In an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. ""I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,"" he said. He said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: ""We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why"". AstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU. This video can not be played Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton says the EU has been ""heavily penalised"" and wants to know why A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout."" Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return. Her colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say. UK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports.

"Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton","H&M is facing a backlash in China over its refusal to use Xinjiang cotton Retail giants Nike and H&M are facing a backlash in China after they expressed concern about the alleged use of Uighur forced labour in cotton production. Many Chinese have called for boycotts, celebrities have cut ties and e-commerce platforms have dropped H&M. SeveralWestern countries imposed sanctions on China this week. It is accused of committing serious human rights violations against the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang autonomous region. China denies this. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, target senior officials in the north-west region. In December the BBC published in an investigation based on new research showingChina was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities including Uighurs into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields. The statements in question were made by the companies last year, but only resurfaced in recent days following the announcement of Western sanctions. Both companies had said in separate statements that they were ""concerned"" about reports that Uighurs were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, and that they did not source products from the region. But the latest furore appears to have been sparked by a recent social media post by the Communist Youth League, a Chinese Communist Party group. ""Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!"" it said on microblogging platform Weibo on Wednesday morning, as it shared screenshots of H&M's statement. Fashion brands face scrutiny over Xinjiang cotton UK tightens rules on using Uighur-picked cotton State media outlets have since launched campaigns defending Xinjiang cotton and criticising the brands. Chinese state media CGTN shared a video on Weibo claiming to show the reality of cotton-picking in Xinjiang, which involved automation and quotes from a Uighur farmer saying that people ""fought"" to work there for high earnings. State broadcaster CCTV said that H&M (Hennes & Mauritz) - a multinational firm with the headquarters in Sweden - had ""miscalculated"" in trying to be a ""righteous hero"", and that it ""must pay a heavy price for its wrong actions"". H&M China has not yet responded to queries from the BBC, but the company posted a statement on Weibo on Wednesday saying that it ""respects Chinese consumers as always"" and that it ""does not represent any political position"". People's Daily shared an image with the hashtag 'I support Xinjiang cotton' in Chinese By Wednesday night, at least three major Chinese e-commerce platforms - Pinduoduo, JD.com and Tmall -  had withdrawn H&M products from sale, reports said. Various celebrities such as Wang Yibo, Huang Xuan and Victoria Song released statements that they were severing ties with the brands, with one noting that ""the country's interests are above all"". Social media has seen a huge wave of backlash against both companies, with numerous calls for people to boycott their products. The hashtag ""I support Xinjiang cotton"" is now the top trending topic on Weibo with more than 1.8bn views. H&M has a long relationship with China, which is important to both sides. China is one of H&M's main sources of supply and it is a big market too. But calling out China on what it regards as a core domestic issue is something Beijing doesn't like. Just ask South Korea or the Philippines, whose shop chains and fruit exports both suffered after diplomatic spats. China likes to use its trading might and retail nationalism to pressure governments and multinationals - both at the same time preferably - to keep them quiet about its abuses. The timing of this sudden ""grassroots"" reaction, led by celebrities who've been happy to take H&M money in exchange for endorsement, is down to a wave of co-ordinated sanctions imposed by the UK, US and EU in the last few days - endorsed by Sweden among others. Xinjiang, China's biggest region, produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. An autonomous region in theory, in reality it faces restrictions which have only increased in recent years Millions of China's Uighurs, a Muslim minority that sees itself as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations, live in Xinjiang In recent decades, mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) to Xinjiang has fuelled tensions with Uighurs which has at points flared into deadly violence This has resulted in a massive security crackdown and an extensive state surveillance programme, which critics say violate Uighur human rights. China says such measures are necessary to combat separatism and terrorism Uighurs have been detained at camps whereallegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.China has denied these claims saying the camps are ""re-education"" facilities aimed at lifting Uighurs out of poverty Read more:Who are the Uighurs?

LiveLiveVaccine passport decisions 'may be up to landlords'5 minutes ago,"A Commons vote on extending emergency coronavirus laws for another six months has passed by 484 to 76 During the debate, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned ""we're not at the finish line yet"" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour supported the government ""without any enthusiasm or relish"" Some 35 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government to oppose the measures And 21 Labour MPs and former leader Jeremy Corbyn, currently sitting as an Independent, also voted against Boris Johnson says it may only be possible to implement a vaccine passports scheme once everybody has been offered a vaccine Kate Nicholls, of the trade body UK Hospitality, says she doesn't think vaccine passports are ""necessary or appropriate"" for High Street venues EU leaders have been meeting virtually to discuss proposals aimed at improving vaccine supplies as cases continue to rise in several countries The head of the European Commission says the EU ""needs to ensure Europeans get a fair share of vaccines"" A travel ban within Portugal that covers the whole of Easter week has been brought forward to midnight Edited by Emma Owen and James Clarke That's all from the live team for today. Your updates were brought to you by Emma Owen, George Wright, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Owen Amos and Victoria Lindrea. We hope you have a peaceful evening - and the live page will be back in the morning. We are going to be drawing our live updates to a close soon so here's a look back at the day's news: Head gardener Simon Tetlow is preparing for the return of visitors to Tatton Park in Cheshire Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Northern Irelandâs devolved government has announced youth
services will be reopened on a phased basis at the start of next month. The
SureStart programme, which supports the parents of children aged under four, will
also resume. Ministers in the power-sharing Stormont Executive also discussed
international travel at a meeting this afternoon. At a news conference
afterwards, the First Minister Arlene Foster and the deputy First Minister
Michelle OâNeill indicated travellers arriving from countries on the so-called
âred listâ would soon have to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. There are currently
no international flights operating to or from Northern Ireland, but plans are
being made for the quarantine system to come into operation when air routes
resume. OâNeill also said the current coronavirus R-rate in Northern
Ireland is thought to be between 0.75 and 0.95. The Government could face ""chaos"" and a ""Wild West"" of A-level and GCSE grades after this summer's exams were cancelled, MPs have warned. Teacher assessments could lead to ""much higher grade inflation"", the House of Commons Education Select Committee heard. Conservative MP Robert Halfon, committee chairman, said it could ""create chaos for the thousands of students chasing college and further and higher education places in August"". His comments came as Britain's largest teaching union accused the government of ""hiding behind"" teachers who are likely to be ""lambasted"" if this summer's GCSE and A-level grades are higher. In a letter to the Education Secretary, Halfon says: ""The DfE and Ofqual should consider some kind of standardised assessment and a more robust way of validating teacher-assessed grades."" England are due to arrive in Albania on Saturday England's World Cup qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday looked at risk of being called off today because of doubts over security - but the issue now seems to have been resolved. The Albanian Football Association (AFA) earlier said it had been informed by local police the force could not guarantee the safety of the teams. But the country's state police have since issued a statement to say they have ""taken all measures to guarantee order and security"" for the game. The dilemma followed the AFA's request for a restricted number of fans vaccinated against Covid-19 to be permitted to attend the game, which was rejected by government. The match will therefore be played behind closed doors, and with no other lockdown measures in place in the country it could have meant the area around the Air Albania Stadium being busy - seemingly with no promise of adequate policing until the guarantees were given by police. The AFA said it would have had ""catastrophic consequences for the image of our country, the national team and in general for Albanian football"" if it had been forced to cancel the game. England open up their campaignagainst San Marino in less than half an hour, while Albania play in Andorra at the same time. Read more here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News No Covid vaccines have yet been authorised for use in
children under 16 but there are numerous trials now taking place to test their
effects in this age group. Pfizer is the latest drug company to announce the start of a
trial in children under 12, saying it hopes to produce data in the second half
of this year. The US company has already been testing vaccines in teenage
children aged 12-15 and expects to have results from those trials in the next
few weeks. AstraZeneca announced vaccine trials in children aged 6-17some time ago and the first of 300 volunteers were due to be jabbed last month, and Moderna
has said it will test its vaccine on 12 to 17-year-olds. Childrenâs risk of becoming ill or dying with Covid-19 is tiny
and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment. But as countries attempt to bring down deaths, illness and
infection levels to very low levels so normal life can resume, children are now
being considered possible candidates for vaccination as well as adults. If children do play a role in transmission, even if not to
the same extent as adults, then vaccinating them would make sense. But there are lots of hoops to go through first. Are
vaccines safe in children? Do they stop them spreading the virus? What real
difference would vaccinating children make? Only when these questions are answered would regulators give
the green light to approve its use in millions of young children. Will vaccine certificates enable summer travel? EU leaders are looking at how digital certificates - called theGreen Digital Certificate,external- might work to enable travel across Europe in time for summer. The aim is to enable anyone who has been vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU. But some individual countries, such as Denmark and Estonia, have already outlined plans for so-called vaccine certificates. And outside of the EU, Israel has a working system in place. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world,external, with more than half the population having already received two doses, and last month it was able to begin easing a nationwide lockdown. A ""Green Pass"" is available to anyone who has been fully vaccinated or has recovered from Covid-19,external. To access some of the country's facilities - like hotels, gyms or theatres - people have to show their pass. It is available as a paper certificate or in an app, which links users to their health ministry data. The app opens the possibility of being used for international travel, andIsrael has struck deals with Greeceand Cyprus to allow its citizens with vaccination passports to travel to those two countries.

won't trouble Boris Johnson, overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers
to respond to the pandemic. Many of the Tories who voted against the
government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and
lockdowns. For them, it's about trust. Reassurances from ministers about powers
only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. There is deep unease about the scope of
these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if
they're not being used. But the pandemic has changed expectations
of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances, freedoms
considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. The public may have been willing to
largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the
price society has paid has been too high. Sir Graham Brady took part in the debate over whether to extend the Coronavirus Act A senior Tory backbencher who was among 35 of his party's MPs to vote against extending emergency coronavirus laws this afternoon says we need to find ""ways of living sensibly"" with Covid in future winters, as more lockdowns are not the answer. Sir Graham Brady tells Radio 4's PM programme there is a ""fundamental question"" stemming from the fact an endemic disease ""might be coming back every winter for the foreseeable future"". ""If you are going to respond to say that the only reaction to that is to close down the country, to prevent people from seeing their families, to stop people from doing business and earning a living,"" he says, ""then I think that's an apocalyptic vision that would definitely cause far more harm in terms both of deaths and mental health problems and economic devastation than the alternative. ""So I think it's inevitable if we see this coming back in future years and future winters, which is entirely likely, we are going to have to find ways of living sensibly with a very nasty virus, which will include some restrictions. ""But I don't think it's plausible to suggest that lockdown is the answer to that."" US President Joe Biden says officials aim to deliver 200 million coronavirus jabs in the first 100 days of his administration. The target is double the original goal. ""I believe we can do it,"" he says. After a slow start under the Trump presidency, the pace of vaccinations has been rapidly climbing. Biden says economic growth is now expected to exceed 6% this year as his recovery plan takes effect. He says there are still too many Americans out of work and hurting, but help is on the way. Biden has been making the comments in his first news conference since taking office. This video can not be played Johnson: 'I do badly need a hair cut' Prime Minister Boris Johnson admits he ""badly"" needs a haircut, but jokes that he's booked in to the pub. In video recorded shortly before an interview, he's asked if Carrie Symonds, his fiancÃ©e, might cut his hair, to which he responds ""she's going to have another go, yeah"". The group will be given exclusive use of a hotel on the Greek island of Rhodes A Dutch travel firm will take nearly 200 people for an eight-day holiday in Greece aimed at seeing if tourism is feasible during the Covid-19 pandemic. Those picked will have an all-inclusive getaway on the island of Rhodes at a cost of â¬399 (Â£344; $472) per person, but there are some catches. They will not be allowed to leave the resort and will have to quarantine for up to ten days when they return home. At least 25,000 people have signed up for the government-backed experiment. TheDutch government's travel advice,externalotherwise is that all foreign trips should be avoided, unless essential, until at least the middle of May. While many people may like to swap a life of lockdown for a week of Greek sunshine, questions have been raised about whether enabling such escapism is responsible or reckless at a time when both the infection rate and hospital admissions in the Netherlands are on the rise, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports. The Netherlands has recorded at least 16,536 deaths,externaland 2,746,581 cases of infection during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. But with public pressure mounting to allow summer holidays to go ahead, experiments like this one could help to determine whether there is a Covid-secure way to allow people to take an overseas break during the pandemic, she adds.

It means that almost half the adult population - 703,334 people - have had at least one jab. The official figures showed that more than 104,907 people had now received a second dose. There have been no further Covid-related deaths recorded by NI's Department of health, meaning the total number of deaths remains at 2,107. The latest figures come after Health minister Robin Swann said on Wednesday thatforeign travel in the summer should be ruled out. Mr Swann said Westminster and the devolved governments were discussing the so-called ""red list"" for foreign countries. He added that fragilities in NI's health system underlined the need for caution as lockdown eases. Professor Ultan Power, a virologist at Queen's University, said that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a Covid vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. He told Good Morning Ulster: ""If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place."" Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company denies that it is failing to honour its contract. Read more here. The UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures,external. Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure of 6,303 but the number of Covid-related deaths reported has fallen 32, compared with 95 last Thursday. Meanwhile, the latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. The exact figure is 28,991,188 - and 2,775,481 people have had their second dose. MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus laws for
another six months. A total of 484 MPs were for the motion and 76 against giving a majority of 408. MPs have finished debating whether to extend emergency coronavirus laws to the end of September and it's gone to a vote. Wrapping up the three and a half hour debate, Health and Social Care Minister Edward Argar says: ""They are not measures any of us would choose to do were we not faced with such a grave situation,"" but, he says they are ""necessary"". Nationwide says UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme. It comes after half of staff surveyed said they wanted to work from home full-time. TheUK's biggest building society says its ""work anywhere"" plan will allow employees more controlof their lives. Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Nationwide boss Joe Garner says âfundamentallyâ employees will have total control over where they work from. âOur report says people do still want to  go to the officeâ¦ they just donât want to be compelled to go every day,â he tells Radio 4. âPeople are saying they need the flexibility.â Garner also suggests employees are making âbetter decisionsâ as a consequence of home-working. He says many organisations - not just Nationwide - have observed productivity benefits and benefits to well-being from flexible working.  In the long term, he adds, there might also be environmental benefits. Garner insists the decision is not driven by cost, although he does think in time there will be cost benefits to Nationwide. The move by the building society comes as companies across the UK look into how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model marrying some office work with days working from home. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told EU leaders that the bloc has exported 77 million doses of coronavirus vaccines since early December. The figure is greater than the number of inoculations given to EU citizens so far, and includes more than 30 million doses delivered to low and middle income countries under the global vaccine sharing scheme.

Leaders at a virtual summit are debating the Commission's proposal to tighten export controls on vaccines as a way to boost supplies within the EU, as infections surge in many member states. Speaking to German MPs before the summit, Chancellor Angela Merkeldefended the EU's decision to procure vaccines jointlyas the bloc struggles with delays in rollout. But some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Prof Tim Spector, who leads the Covid Symptom Tracker app study run by King's College London, says any vaccine passport would have to be digital and people just have to ""bite the bullet"". He tells the PA news agency: ""It was always obvious to me that vaccine passports were going to come in. ""Bits of paper are not going to be that.

We hope you have a peaceful evening - and the live page will be back in the morning. We are going to be drawing our live updates to a close soon so here's a look back at the day's news: Head gardener Simon Tetlow is preparing for the return of visitors to Tatton Park in Cheshire Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Northern Irelandâs devolved government has announced youth
services will be reopened on a phased basis at the start of next month. The
SureStart programme, which supports the parents of children aged under four, will
also resume. Ministers in the power-sharing Stormont Executive also discussed
international travel at a meeting this afternoon. At a news conference
afterwards, the First Minister Arlene Foster and the deputy First Minister
Michelle OâNeill indicated travellers arriving from countries on the so-called
âred listâ would soon have to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. There are currently
no international flights operating to or from Northern Ireland, but plans are
being made for the quarantine system to come into operation when air routes
resume. OâNeill also said the current coronavirus R-rate in Northern
Ireland is thought to be between 0.75 and 0.95. The Government could face ""chaos"" and a ""Wild West"" of A-level and GCSE grades after this summer's exams were cancelled, MPs have warned. Teacher assessments could lead to ""much higher grade inflation"", the House of Commons Education Select Committee heard. Conservative MP Robert Halfon, committee chairman, said it could ""create chaos for the thousands of students chasing college and further and higher education places in August"". His comments came as Britain's largest teaching union accused the government of ""hiding behind"" teachers who are likely to be ""lambasted"" if this summer's GCSE and A-level grades are higher. In a letter to the Education Secretary, Halfon says: ""The DfE and Ofqual should consider some kind of standardised assessment and a more robust way of validating teacher-assessed grades."" England are due to arrive in Albania on Saturday England's World Cup qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday looked at risk of being called off today because of doubts over security - but the issue now seems to have been resolved. The Albanian Football Association (AFA) earlier said it had been informed by local police the force could not guarantee the safety of the teams. But the country's state police have since issued a statement to say they have ""taken all measures to guarantee order and security"" for the game. The dilemma followed the AFA's request for a restricted number of fans vaccinated against Covid-19 to be permitted to attend the game, which was rejected by government. The match will therefore be played behind closed doors, and with no other lockdown measures in place in the country it could have meant the area around the Air Albania Stadium being busy - seemingly with no promise of adequate policing until the guarantees were given by police. The AFA said it would have had ""catastrophic consequences for the image of our country, the national team and in general for Albanian football"" if it had been forced to cancel the game. England open up their campaignagainst San Marino in less than half an hour, while Albania play in Andorra at the same time. Read more here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News No Covid vaccines have yet been authorised for use in
children under 16 but there are numerous trials now taking place to test their
effects in this age group. Pfizer is the latest drug company to announce the start of a
trial in children under 12, saying it hopes to produce data in the second half
of this year. The US company has already been testing vaccines in teenage
children aged 12-15 and expects to have results from those trials in the next
few weeks. AstraZeneca announced vaccine trials in children aged 6-17some time ago and the first of 300 volunteers were due to be jabbed last month, and Moderna
has said it will test its vaccine on 12 to 17-year-olds. Childrenâs risk of becoming ill or dying with Covid-19 is tiny
and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment. But as countries attempt to bring down deaths, illness and
infection levels to very low levels so normal life can resume, children are now
being considered possible candidates for vaccination as well as adults. If children do play a role in transmission, even if not to
the same extent as adults, then vaccinating them would make sense. But there are lots of hoops to go through first. Are
vaccines safe in children? Do they stop them spreading the virus? What real
difference would vaccinating children make? Only when these questions are answered would regulators give
the green light to approve its use in millions of young children. Will vaccine certificates enable summer travel? EU leaders are looking at how digital certificates - called theGreen Digital Certificate,external- might work to enable travel across Europe in time for summer. The aim is to enable anyone who has been vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU. But some individual countries, such as Denmark and Estonia, have already outlined plans for so-called vaccine certificates. And outside of the EU, Israel has a working system in place. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world,external, with more than half the population having already received two doses, and last month it was able to begin easing a nationwide lockdown. A ""Green Pass"" is available to anyone who has been fully vaccinated or has recovered from Covid-19,external. To access some of the country's facilities - like hotels, gyms or theatres - people have to show their pass. It is available as a paper certificate or in an app, which links users to their health ministry data. The app opens the possibility of being used for international travel, andIsrael has struck deals with Greeceand Cyprus to allow its citizens with vaccination passports to travel to those two countries.

won't trouble Boris Johnson, overall MPs backed the renewal of sweeping powers
to respond to the pandemic. Many of the Tories who voted against the
government have been persistent critics of its approach to restrictions and
lockdowns. For them, it's about trust. Reassurances from ministers about powers
only being used when necessary in extreme circumstances don't cut it. There is deep unease about the scope of
these powers and the very fact they are available to the government, even if
they're not being used. But the pandemic has changed expectations
of what governments can and should do in extreme circumstances, freedoms
considered sacrosanct have been suspended in the spirit of saving lives. The public may have been willing to
largely comply, but there are at least a few dozen MPs willing to argue the
price society has paid has been too high. Sir Graham Brady took part in the debate over whether to extend the Coronavirus Act A senior Tory backbencher who was among 35 of his party's MPs to vote against extending emergency coronavirus laws this afternoon says we need to find ""ways of living sensibly"" with Covid in future winters, as more lockdowns are not the answer. Sir Graham Brady tells Radio 4's PM programme there is a ""fundamental question"" stemming from the fact an endemic disease ""might be coming back every winter for the foreseeable future"". ""If you are going to respond to say that the only reaction to that is to close down the country, to prevent people from seeing their families, to stop people from doing business and earning a living,"" he says, ""then I think that's an apocalyptic vision that would definitely cause far more harm in terms both of deaths and mental health problems and economic devastation than the alternative. ""So I think it's inevitable if we see this coming back in future years and future winters, which is entirely likely, we are going to have to find ways of living sensibly with a very nasty virus, which will include some restrictions. ""But I don't think it's plausible to suggest that lockdown is the answer to that."" US President Joe Biden says officials aim to deliver 200 million coronavirus jabs in the first 100 days of his administration. The target is double the original goal. ""I believe we can do it,"" he says. After a slow start under the Trump presidency, the pace of vaccinations has been rapidly climbing. Biden says economic growth is now expected to exceed 6% this year as his recovery plan takes effect. He says there are still too many Americans out of work and hurting, but help is on the way. Biden has been making the comments in his first news conference since taking office. This video can not be played Johnson: 'I do badly need a hair cut' Prime Minister Boris Johnson admits he ""badly"" needs a haircut, but jokes that he's booked in to the pub. In video recorded shortly before an interview, he's asked if Carrie Symonds, his fiancÃ©e, might cut his hair, to which he responds ""she's going to have another go, yeah"". The group will be given exclusive use of a hotel on the Greek island of Rhodes A Dutch travel firm will take nearly 200 people for an eight-day holiday in Greece aimed at seeing if tourism is feasible during the Covid-19 pandemic. Those picked will have an all-inclusive getaway on the island of Rhodes at a cost of â¬399 (Â£344; $472) per person, but there are some catches. They will not be allowed to leave the resort and will have to quarantine for up to ten days when they return home. At least 25,000 people have signed up for the government-backed experiment. TheDutch government's travel advice,externalotherwise is that all foreign trips should be avoided, unless essential, until at least the middle of May. While many people may like to swap a life of lockdown for a week of Greek sunshine, questions have been raised about whether enabling such escapism is responsible or reckless at a time when both the infection rate and hospital admissions in the Netherlands are on the rise, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports. The Netherlands has recorded at least 16,536 deaths,externaland 2,746,581 cases of infection during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. But with public pressure mounting to allow summer holidays to go ahead, experiments like this one could help to determine whether there is a Covid-secure way to allow people to take an overseas break during the pandemic, she adds.

It means that almost half the adult population - 703,334 people - have had at least one jab. The official figures showed that more than 104,907 people had now received a second dose. There have been no further Covid-related deaths recorded by NI's Department of health, meaning the total number of deaths remains at 2,107. The latest figures come after Health minister Robin Swann said on Wednesday thatforeign travel in the summer should be ruled out. Mr Swann said Westminster and the devolved governments were discussing the so-called ""red list"" for foreign countries. He added that fragilities in NI's health system underlined the need for caution as lockdown eases. Professor Ultan Power, a virologist at Queen's University, said that at least 80% of the population of Northern Ireland should have two doses of a Covid vaccine before travel to Europe is allowed again. He told Good Morning Ulster: ""If we have mass foreign travel we run the risk of picking up new variants that may not be covered by the vaccine and that could being us back to a pretty bad place."" Austria's chancellor - pictured here at Thursday's summit - has complained about the EU's vaccine distribution European countries must not turn on each other amid growing tensions over Covid vaccine supplies, the president of the EU Parliament has said. The call for unity comes as EU leaders hold virtual talks to discuss supplies and improving distribution across the bloc's 27 member states. Some countries have complained that doses have not been distributed fairly. ""There is no sense in us turning on each other, just as there is no sense in thinking that others are doing much better,"" European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said at a press conference. ""The more unity we show, the more trust we will inspire,"" he added. ""Salvation lies in working together."" Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. The company denies that it is failing to honour its contract. Read more here. The UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures,external. Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure of 6,303 but the number of Covid-related deaths reported has fallen 32, compared with 95 last Thursday. Meanwhile, the latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. The exact figure is 28,991,188 - and 2,775,481 people have had their second dose. MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus laws for
another six months. A total of 484 MPs were for the motion and 76 against giving a majority of 408. MPs have finished debating whether to extend emergency coronavirus laws to the end of September and it's gone to a vote. Wrapping up the three and a half hour debate, Health and Social Care Minister Edward Argar says: ""They are not measures any of us would choose to do were we not faced with such a grave situation,"" but, he says they are ""necessary"". Nationwide says UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme. It comes after half of staff surveyed said they wanted to work from home full-time. TheUK's biggest building society says its ""work anywhere"" plan will allow employees more controlof their lives. Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Nationwide boss Joe Garner says âfundamentallyâ employees will have total control over where they work from. âOur report says people do still want to  go to the officeâ¦ they just donât want to be compelled to go every day,â he tells Radio 4. âPeople are saying they need the flexibility.â Garner also suggests employees are making âbetter decisionsâ as a consequence of home-working. He says many organisations - not just Nationwide - have observed productivity benefits and benefits to well-being from flexible working.  In the long term, he adds, there might also be environmental benefits. Garner insists the decision is not driven by cost, although he does think in time there will be cost benefits to Nationwide. The move by the building society comes as companies across the UK look into how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model marrying some office work with days working from home. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told EU leaders that the bloc has exported 77 million doses of coronavirus vaccines since early December. The figure is greater than the number of inoculations given to EU citizens so far, and includes more than 30 million doses delivered to low and middle income countries under the global vaccine sharing scheme.

Leaders at a virtual summit are debating the Commission's proposal to tighten export controls on vaccines as a way to boost supplies within the EU, as infections surge in many member states. Speaking to German MPs before the summit, Chancellor Angela Merkeldefended the EU's decision to procure vaccines jointlyas the bloc struggles with delays in rollout. But some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Prof Tim Spector, who leads the Covid Symptom Tracker app study run by King's College London, says any vaccine passport would have to be digital and people just have to ""bite the bullet"". He tells the PA news agency: ""It was always obvious to me that vaccine passports were going to come in. ""Bits of paper are not going to be that.

"EU leaders to discuss boosting vaccine suppliesLeaders will also review plans to curb exports of Covid vaccines, which could affect supply to the UK.","The EU's vaccine rollout campaign has been slower than that of the UK EU leaders are to hold virtual talks to discuss ways of boosting Covid vaccine supplies and improving the rollout of doses across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission will on Thursday ask leaders to support plans for added controls on vaccine exports, which could affect supply to the UK. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier warned against imposing ""blockades"". The virtual summit comes as a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeps across much of mainland Europe. US President Joe Biden will also dial in to the talks later on Thursday to discuss EU-US relations. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates The European Union's vaccine rollout campaign has been slower than that of the UK. The European Commission has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering the promised doses to the EU. However, leaders are divided over proposals for new restrictions on vaccine exports out of the bloc, which would aim to boost supplies within the EU. A site in Belgium produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and another in the Netherlands is expected to increase supplies of the jab in the EU. Brussels has said that of the more than 40 million doses exported from the EU over the past two months, a quarter were sent to the UK. In a joint statement on Wednesday, the UK and the EU said they wanted to ""create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all"". ""We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" the statement added. The tone of Wednesday's EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as ""slow, cumbersome and difficult"". On both sides. That doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. EU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. Meanwhile, leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK. While there have been suggestions that the proposals being put before EU leaders on Thursday would be focused on the UK and US in particular, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said that this was not the case. ""We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,"" he said. Asked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe ""that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines"" would be ""sensible"". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments ""in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed"", he added. The tougher export controls are most likely to affect vaccine-exporting countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. The key criteria for the proposed regulations are ""reciprocity"" and ""proportionality"": The EU says there is no reciprocity if a country importing vaccines from the EU restricts exports itself - so it may review exports to this country Member states and the Commission will also consider the state of the pandemic in that country, its vaccination rate and vaccine supplies There will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. Vaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned. In an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. ""I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,"" he said. He said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: ""We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why"". AstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU. This video can not be played Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton says the EU has been ""heavily penalised"" and wants to know why A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout."" Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return. Her colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say. UK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports.

Buyer defends paying $2.9m for 'Mona Lisa' of tweets,"Mr Estavi bought Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet for $2.9m The buyer of Twitter's first ever tweet by its founder Jack Dorsey for $2.9m (Â£2.1m) sees it as a wise investment. ""It's a piece of human history in the form of a digital asset. Who knows what will be the price of the first tweet of human history 50 years from now,"" Malaysia-based Sina Estavi said. Mr Estavi compared his newly-acquired tweet to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Experts agree that the first tweet from the Twitter founder on his own platform is a highly valuable asset. Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet sells for $2.9m Bids top $2.5m for Jack Dorsey's first tweet What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? Jack Dorsey's tweet, which said ""just setting up my twttr,"" was first published on 21 March 2006 and was auctioned off by Mr Dorsey for Give Directly's Africa Response charity. Mr Estavi, the chief executive of cryptocurrency firm Bridge Oracle, bought the tweet using ether, a rival currency to bitcoin. It was sold as a non-fungible token (NFT), a unique digital certificate that states who owns a photo, video or other form of online media. NFTs have become hugely popular this year, with expensive digital artwork also being sold this way. ""I believe it's an emerging market and it's just the beginning. All forms of digital arts and creations such as music, photos, videos, tweets and blog posts can be traded in the form of an NFT,"" Mr Estavi, a 29-year-old Malaysian national told the BBC. He added that his investors and colleagues ""are really appreciative and happy about this investment because they know the value and future price of this particular NFT and the impact it made on social media."" While the price paid for the tweet raised a few eyebrows, experts believe it could be a shrewd investment. ""A way to explain it is that owning this first tweet can be viewed in the future almost like the first edition of a rare book,"" said Cathy Hackl, a social media expert. ""Twitter ushered in a new era of communication and this tweet launched it."" This video can not be played Will digital-only trading cards replace physical ones? Mr Dorsey's tweet was sold via an online platform called Valuables, owned by US-based company Cent. Cameron Hejazi, co-founder of Cent, said this was the highest valued asset sold on the platform so far. ""I was shocked but not surprised - the value of these assets is highly subjective. Plus we are happy the money is going to such a good cause,"" he told the BBC. The NFT market is now worth $1bn and uses the same blockchain technology that underpins digital currencies such as bitcoin to establish ownership and authentication. However, it's still early days to determine precisely how buyers will value other online social media posts. ""To be able to capture the first tweet, of the person who invented this, makes it very important memorabilia,"" said Nanne Dekking, the founder of Artory, which records artworks on blockchain technology. Others think some of Donald Trump's controversial tweets as US president might make for future investment targets. As the buyer, Mr Estavi will receive a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, ""If that person is a crypto investor, it makes even more sense as they will find a way to make the investment work for them,"" added Ms Hackl. While Mr Estavi owns the Dorsey tweet, anyone with internet access can see and read it.

The UK has recorded another 6,397 new infections and 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the government's daily figures,external. Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure of 6,303 but the number of Covid-related deaths reported has fallen 32, compared with 95 last Thursday. Meanwhile, the latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. The exact figure is 28,991,188 - and 2,775,481 people have had their second dose. MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus laws for
another six months. A total of 484 MPs were for the motion and 76 against giving a majority of 408. MPs have finished debating whether to extend emergency coronavirus laws to the end of September and it's gone to a vote. Wrapping up the three and a half hour debate, Health and Social Care Minister Edward Argar says: ""They are not measures any of us would choose to do were we not faced with such a grave situation,"" but, he says they are ""necessary"". Nationwide says UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme. It comes after half of staff surveyed said they wanted to work from home full-time. TheUK's biggest building society says its ""work anywhere"" plan will allow employees more controlof their lives. Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Nationwide boss Joe Garner says âfundamentallyâ employees will have total control over where they work from. âOur report says people do still want to  go to the officeâ¦ they just donât want to be compelled to go every day,â he tells Radio 4. âPeople are saying they need the flexibility.â Garner also suggests employees are making âbetter decisionsâ as a consequence of home-working. He says many organisations - not just Nationwide - have observed productivity benefits and benefits to well-being from flexible working.  In the long term, he adds, there might also be environmental benefits. Garner insists the decision is not driven by cost, although he does think in time there will be cost benefits to Nationwide. The move by the building society comes as companies across the UK look into how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model marrying some office work with days working from home. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told EU leaders that the bloc has exported 77 million doses of coronavirus vaccines since early December. The figure is greater than the number of inoculations given to EU citizens so far, and includes more than 30 million doses delivered to low and middle income countries under the global vaccine sharing scheme.

It's got to be digital, it's got to be something on your phone, and I think that's going to be useful in some scenarios."" Prof Spector says: ""We just need to get used to it and bite the bullet, in a way, because it's going to affect our travel outside this country as well, so we might as well get our own system in order. ""It has got to be a simple system - that should be quite possible - and everyone gets a unique code number from their vaccine that can be checked."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"NHS staff in Scotland to be offered 4% pay riseThe Scottish government praised staff for their ""service and dedication"" during the Covid pandemic.Scotland","NHS staff in Scotland are to be offered a pay rise of at least 4%, the Scottish government has confirmed. Nurses, paramedics and domestic staff are among those who could receive the boost to their salaries. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the average pay of a front-line NHS nurse would rise by over Â£1,200 a year. She said the offer - which does not apply to doctors - recognised the ""service and dedication"" of staff during the pandemic The settlement will be backdated to 1 December 2020 in recognition of an ""exceptional year of significant pressure"". It follows theÂ£500 thank you paymentfor all health and social care workers which was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in November. Earlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a1% pay rise. He praised ""heroic"" health and social care workers but said the rise was as much as the government could afford during the ""tough times"" of the pandemic. Ms Freeman described the Scottish government's offer as ""the biggest single pay uplift since devolution"" for NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) staff. AfC is the current grading and pay system forÂ NHSÂ staff. It does not include doctors, dentists, executives and senior managers. Across cycles of economic growth and contraction, public sector pay remains stable while private sector pay is more volatile - racing ahead in the good times, taking the bigger hit and redundancies when they turn tough. So when private employer competition for skilled workers is lower, public sector pay increases can be reined in. However, the Scottish government has opted to boost pay, going against that cycle and in contrast with the 1% offered to NHS staff in England. Coming at the end of a three-year 9% pay deal, the cost looks to be about Â£135m next year, and unlike the Â£500 one-off NHS payment last year, it is baked in to future pay rises. NHS staff have political support, so it makes sense ahead of an election. However, with a balanced budget required, a pound spent on pay cannot be spent on others who have been at the Covid battlefront - for instance, care home workers, those in the voluntary sector, welfare benefits for unpaid carers. A further consideration in NHS pay is that demand for scarce skills is on the rise, without easy access to EU labour, with doctor retirement, many GPs working part-time and loss of medical expertise overseas. This is one sign of the measures the NHS has to take to ensure it recruits and retains the staff it needs. She added that it would benefit 154,000 staff and including domestic staff, porters and health care support workers. This group, which she described as ""the backbone of our services"" would see pay rises of more than Â£1,000, the equivalent of between 4% and 5.4%. Those on the highest salaries will receive a Â£800 pay rise. Ms Freeman said: ""This has been an exceptionally challenging year for our health service and I am pleased that the Scottish government is able to recognise the service and dedication of our healthcare staff."" The announcement follows ongoing negotiations between the Scottish government, NHS employers and unions, who will now consult their members on the offer. And the offer is significantly higher than the pay rise proposals for other public sector workers. This is not just a bumper pay offer for many NHS workers in Scotland, it is a powerful negotiating tool for health unions trying to prise more cash from the UK government. It is hard to imagine nurses and other healthcare staff in England settling for a proposed 1% rise when their colleagues in Scotland are receiving 4%. That contrast will presumably not go unnoticed by the independent pay review panel in England which is due to make its recommendations in May. In Scotland, details of the new pay offer were released just hours before the start of the Holyrood election campaign, during which governments are obliged to avoid making big spending announcements. It may lead to a wider debate in the campaign about how other public sector workers are rewarded and the support available to those in the private sector struggling as a result of the Covid crisis. In her budget, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announced a 3% rise for people earning under Â£25,000, with 1% for people earning up to Â£80,000 a year. She called it a ""progressive and restorative approach"" but unions said it was disappointing after a year of working through the pandemic. Colin Poolman, Royal College of Nursing Scotland senior officer, said: ""The timescale for negotiations was tight as a result of the forthcoming election but we have now received an offer for a one year pay deal."" Willie Duffy, Unison regional organiser, said that each of the individual trade unions would now enter into discussions with their members on the offer. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There will be a view that it's not enough but we managed through the negotiations to get extra money into the pay envelope."" He also compared the offer to the 1% offered in England by the Westminster government. He said: ""It shows the stark difference between the two governments and their attitude to trying to deal with health service workers."" All of Scotland's main opposition parties have made the NHS a central part of their appeals in the forthcoming Holyrood election. The Scottish Conservatives have promised to deliver an increased share of funding to GPs. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the NHS pay offer was welcome but it did not consider social care workers, whom she called ""the unsung heroes of the pandemic"". Ms Baillie said Scottish Labour was committed to a wage rise to Â£15 an hour for the social care workforce, with an immediate increase to Â£12 an hour. The Scottish Greens have pledged support for a properly funded publicly-owned NHS Scotland while the Scottish Liberal Democrats are promising a ""decent"" pay rise for NHS staff.

services will be reopened on a phased basis at the start of next month. The
SureStart programme, which supports the parents of children aged under four, will
also resume. Ministers in the power-sharing Stormont Executive also discussed
international travel at a meeting this afternoon. At a news conference
afterwards, the First Minister Arlene Foster and the deputy First Minister
Michelle OâNeill indicated travellers arriving from countries on the so-called
âred listâ would soon have to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. There are currently
no international flights operating to or from Northern Ireland, but plans are
being made for the quarantine system to come into operation when air routes
resume. OâNeill also said the current coronavirus R-rate in Northern
Ireland is thought to be between 0.75 and 0.95. The Government could face ""chaos"" and a ""Wild West"" of A-level and GCSE grades after this summer's exams were cancelled, MPs have warned. Teacher assessments could lead to ""much higher grade inflation"", the House of Commons Education Select Committee heard. Conservative MP Robert Halfon, committee chairman, said it could ""create chaos for the thousands of students chasing college and further and higher education places in August"". His comments came as Britain's largest teaching union accused the government of ""hiding behind"" teachers who are likely to be ""lambasted"" if this summer's GCSE and A-level grades are higher. In a letter to the Education Secretary, Halfon says: ""The DfE and Ofqual should consider some kind of standardised assessment and a more robust way of validating teacher-assessed grades."" England are due to arrive in Albania on Saturday England's World Cup qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday looked at risk of being called off today because of doubts over security - but the issue now seems to have been resolved. The Albanian Football Association (AFA) earlier said it had been informed by local police the force could not guarantee the safety of the teams. But the country's state police have since issued a statement to say they have ""taken all measures to guarantee order and security"" for the game. The dilemma followed the AFA's request for a restricted number of fans vaccinated against Covid-19 to be permitted to attend the game, which was rejected by government. The match will therefore be played behind closed doors, and with no other lockdown measures in place in the country it could have meant the area around the Air Albania Stadium being busy - seemingly with no promise of adequate policing until the guarantees were given by police. The AFA said it would have had ""catastrophic consequences for the image of our country, the national team and in general for Albanian football"" if it had been forced to cancel the game.

Today's case numbers are up 94 on last Thursday's figure of 6,303 but the number of Covid-related deaths reported has fallen 32, compared with 95 last Thursday. Meanwhile, the latest vaccination figures show almost 29 million people have now received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. The exact figure is 28,991,188 - and 2,775,481 people have had their second dose. MPs have voted to extend emergency coronavirus laws for
another six months. A total of 484 MPs were for the motion and 76 against giving a majority of 408. MPs have finished debating whether to extend emergency coronavirus laws to the end of September and it's gone to a vote. Wrapping up the three and a half hour debate, Health and Social Care Minister Edward Argar says: ""They are not measures any of us would choose to do were we not faced with such a grave situation,"" but, he says they are ""necessary"". Nationwide says UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices Nationwide is to allow 13,000 office staff to choose where they work under a new flexibility scheme. It comes after half of staff surveyed said they wanted to work from home full-time. TheUK's biggest building society says its ""work anywhere"" plan will allow employees more controlof their lives. Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Nationwide boss Joe Garner says âfundamentallyâ employees will have total control over where they work from. âOur report says people do still want to  go to the officeâ¦ they just donât want to be compelled to go every day,â he tells Radio 4. âPeople are saying they need the flexibility.â Garner also suggests employees are making âbetter decisionsâ as a consequence of home-working. He says many organisations - not just Nationwide - have observed productivity benefits and benefits to well-being from flexible working.  In the long term, he adds, there might also be environmental benefits. Garner insists the decision is not driven by cost, although he does think in time there will be cost benefits to Nationwide. The move by the building society comes as companies across the UK look into how to tackle the issue of remote versus office working once lockdown ends, with many backing a hybrid model marrying some office work with days working from home. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has told EU leaders that the bloc has exported 77 million doses of coronavirus vaccines since early December. The figure is greater than the number of inoculations given to EU citizens so far, and includes more than 30 million doses delivered to low and middle income countries under the global vaccine sharing scheme.

Speaking to German MPs before the summit, Chancellor Angela Merkeldefended the EU's decision to procure vaccines jointlyas the bloc struggles with delays in rollout. But some EU states, led by Austria, are calling for a revision in the distribution method after failing to obtain enough doses earlier this year. Prof Tim Spector, who leads the Covid Symptom Tracker app study run by King's College London, says any vaccine passport would have to be digital and people just have to ""bite the bullet"". He tells the PA news agency: ""It was always obvious to me that vaccine passports were going to come in. ""Bits of paper are not going to be that. It's got to be digital, it's got to be something on your phone, and I think that's going to be useful in some scenarios."" Prof Spector says: ""We just need to get used to it and bite the bullet, in a way, because it's going to affect our travel outside this country as well, so we might as well get our own system in order. ""It has got to be a simple system - that should be quite possible - and everyone gets a unique code number from their vaccine that can be checked."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cottonThe two brands face threats of boycotts for expressing concern over forced Uighur labour claims.","H&M is facing a backlash in China over its refusal to use Xinjiang cotton Retail giants Nike and H&M are facing a backlash in China after they expressed concern about the alleged use of Uighur forced labour in cotton production. Many Chinese have called for boycotts, celebrities have cut ties and e-commerce platforms have dropped H&M. SeveralWestern countries imposed sanctions on China this week. It is accused of committing serious human rights violations against the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang autonomous region. China denies this. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, target senior officials in the north-west region. In December the BBC published in an investigation based on new research showingChina was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities including Uighurs into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields. The statements in question were made by the companies last year, but only resurfaced in recent days following the announcement of Western sanctions. Both companies had said in separate statements that they were ""concerned"" about reports that Uighurs were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, and that they did not source products from the region. But the latest furore appears to have been sparked by a recent social media post by the Communist Youth League, a Chinese Communist Party group. ""Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!"" it said on microblogging platform Weibo on Wednesday morning, as it shared screenshots of H&M's statement. Fashion brands face scrutiny over Xinjiang cotton UK tightens rules on using Uighur-picked cotton State media outlets have since launched campaigns defending Xinjiang cotton and criticising the brands. Chinese state media CGTN shared a video on Weibo claiming to show the reality of cotton-picking in Xinjiang, which involved automation and quotes from a Uighur farmer saying that people ""fought"" to work there for high earnings. State broadcaster CCTV said that H&M (Hennes & Mauritz) - a multinational firm with the headquarters in Sweden - had ""miscalculated"" in trying to be a ""righteous hero"", and that it ""must pay a heavy price for its wrong actions"". H&M China has not yet responded to queries from the BBC, but the company posted a statement on Weibo on Wednesday saying that it ""respects Chinese consumers as always"" and that it ""does not represent any political position"". People's Daily shared an image with the hashtag 'I support Xinjiang cotton' in Chinese By Wednesday night, at least three major Chinese e-commerce platforms - Pinduoduo, JD.com and Tmall -  had withdrawn H&M products from sale, reports said. Various celebrities such as Wang Yibo, Huang Xuan and Victoria Song released statements that they were severing ties with the brands, with one noting that ""the country's interests are above all"". Social media has seen a huge wave of backlash against both companies, with numerous calls for people to boycott their products. The hashtag ""I support Xinjiang cotton"" is now the top trending topic on Weibo with more than 1.8bn views. H&M has a long relationship with China, which is important to both sides. China is one of H&M's main sources of supply and it is a big market too. But calling out China on what it regards as a core domestic issue is something Beijing doesn't like. Just ask South Korea or the Philippines, whose shop chains and fruit exports both suffered after diplomatic spats. China likes to use its trading might and retail nationalism to pressure governments and multinationals - both at the same time preferably - to keep them quiet about its abuses. The timing of this sudden ""grassroots"" reaction, led by celebrities who've been happy to take H&M money in exchange for endorsement, is down to a wave of co-ordinated sanctions imposed by the UK, US and EU in the last few days - endorsed by Sweden among others. Xinjiang, China's biggest region, produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. An autonomous region in theory, in reality it faces restrictions which have only increased in recent years Millions of China's Uighurs, a Muslim minority that sees itself as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations, live in Xinjiang In recent decades, mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) to Xinjiang has fuelled tensions with Uighurs which has at points flared into deadly violence This has resulted in a massive security crackdown and an extensive state surveillance programme, which critics say violate Uighur human rights. China says such measures are necessary to combat separatism and terrorism Uighurs have been detained at camps whereallegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.China has denied these claims saying the camps are ""re-education"" facilities aimed at lifting Uighurs out of poverty Read more:Who are the Uighurs?

Big investors shun Deliveroo over workers' rightsTwo of the UK's biggest investors won't invest in the delivery firm over concerns about workers' rights.,"Six big UK investment firms say they will not buy Deliveroo shares after concerns over workers' rights. The delivery company hopes to be valued at up to Â£8.8bn when it lists its shares in April. But Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, CCLA, LGIM and M&G said they were put off by factors including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power. Deliveroo said it had seen ""significant demand"" for stock with interest rising. ""We lookÂ forward to welcoming new shareholders next week alongside our currently highly respected existing investors,"" it added. Deliveroo riders are self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to earn a minimum wage from the company, or holiday and sick pay. Rupert Krefting, head of corporate finance and stewardship at M&G, said the company's reliance on gig-economy workers made it a risk for investors. He pointed out that Uber had recently had greater legal rights enforced by the Supreme Court for drivers previously categorised as self-employed. ""Deliveroo's narrow profit margins could be at risk if it is required to change its rider benefits to catch up with peers,"" Mr Krefting added. Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) said it was put off by an ""unequal voting rights"" structure. Deliveroo is planning to let its founder and chief executive Will Shu have more than 50% of shareholder voting rights. ""It is important to protect minority and end-investors against potential poor management behaviour, that could lead to value destruction and avoidable investor loss,"" LGIM said. Phil Webster, a portfolio manager at BMO, said labour issues represented a ""ticking bomb on the side"" for Deliveroo, which contributed to making it ""uninvestable"". Andrew Millington, head of UK Equities at Aberdeen Standard, told the BBC's Today programme that the conditions were a ""red flag"", adding: ""We wouldn't be comfortable that the way in which its workforce is employed is sustainable."" He compared Aberdeen Standard's recent decision to sell off Boohoo shares, following allegations of worker exploitation at suppliers to the online clothing company. Large institutional investors such as Aberdeen Standard can use their financial muscle to try to influence the way firms are run - such as through relationships with managers and shareholder votes. But Mr Millington said that sometimes ""disinvesting or not investing in the first place is our only option"". He added that it would be interesting to see whether Deliveroo can attract investors over the longer term ""without making progress"" on worker rights. One of the biggest-ever floats on the London market of a home-grown technology company should have meant a feeding frenzy among the City's institutional investors, the companies that have the job of putting trillions of pounds of retail and pension investors money to work. For years they have watched with envy as their US counterparts have put cash into a steady stream of technology companies. Not all have been big hits after listing their shares on public markets, but enough of them have been - think Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and a string of others - to have made it a big source of investment returns. Deliveroo's listing, which could value the company at just short of Â£9bn, should have been a rare similar opportunity on the London market. Instead some big players, including Aviva Investors and Aberdeen Standard, are turning their backs, saying the way the company employs its riders is not socially acceptable, and poses a risk to its future. Deliveroo deems its riders to be self-employed, and points out that the High Court has upheld that view. What is more, Deliveroo says its riders value the flexibility that employment status gives them, although it is worth noting that Uber maintained the same thing until it eventually decided its drivers were in fact workers, not self-employed contractors. There is no danger to Deliveroo's float - there are enough investors around who are happy to buy the shares. The buying strike by large investors could have ramifications well beyond one company, however. Does this mean that all gig economy companies are off limits? Does it signal that all companies on the London market will now have to ensure their worldwide organisations meet the best employment standards? Andrew Millington of Aberdeen Standard told the Today programme that would be the battle to come - that his firm would hold on to a company's shares as long as it was moving in the right directions, and paid proper attention to employment standards. That is a subtle warning to boardrooms that they will in future be judged by the way their treat their most junior staff. David Cumming, chief investment officer at Aviva, said investors were taking social responsibilities ""a lot more seriously"". ""A lot of employers could make a massive difference to workers' lives if they guaranteed working hours or a living wage, and how companies behave is becoming more important."" Deliveroo targets valuation of up to Â£8.8bn Deliveroo boss: 'I was never into start-ups' A report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism,external(BIJ) - based on thousands of invoices from 300 Deliveroo riders - claims that one in three is earning less than the National Living Wage, which is currently Â£8.72 an hour. However, Deliveroo said the sample of 300 people was ""not a meaningful or representative proportion"" of their riders and that they can earn up to Â£13 an hour ""at our busiest times"". ""These findings [by the BIJ] raise concerns,"" said Tom Powdrill, head of stewardship at shareholder lobby group Pirc. ""Investors considering taking a position in Deliveroo should familiarise themselves with these matters and the risks and responsibilities involved along with all other relevant factors."" Mr Cumming also warned of the risk that drivers will have to be reclassified as workers, which would entitle them to rights such as sick and holiday pay. ""It's an investment risk if the legislation changes,"" said Mr Cumming. Uber recently reclassified its drivers as workers after a landmark UK supreme court case last month. Deliveroo's chief executive, Will Shu, founded the business in 2013 Since losing a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status, Uber has offered holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage, and pensions benefits to its drivers. Other gig economy companies have been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February, although it does not directly apply to Uber Eats - the food delivery arm of the business. Deliveroo has set aside more than Â£112m to cover potential legal costs relating to the employment status of its delivery riders. It warned potential investors of the risk of litigation around the world in documents setting out its plans for a stock market debut published on Monday. ""The European Commission is set to draw up new legislation governing how the gig economy model works across the bloc,"" pointed out Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""If Deliveroo is forced to change the way it classifies its riders in the future, it is likely to puncture its profits prospects, and could even derail the delivery giant."" Deliveroo, which was founded in 2013, has said it will hand its riders bonuses of between Â£200 and Â£10,000 when it floats, depending on the number of orders they have delivered.

Tourism businesses 'champing at the bit' to openWales' first minister has said tourism could start to reopen from 27 March if case rates stay down.Wales,"Tenby and other popular Welsh resorts could soon be welcoming tourists again Tourism businesses say they have been ""preparing like crazy"" and are ready to reopen if given the green light in Friday's lockdown review. Welsh government ministers are expected to discuss later whether travel restrictions can be eased to allow limited tourism over Easter. Self-catered accommodation could reopen from 27 March and outdoor hospitality will be considered for 22 April. People in England cannot go on holiday anywhere in the UK until 12 April. This video can not be played Welsh government ministers are expected to discuss whether travel restrictions can be eased ""We have been preparing like crazy for the last two or three weeks to open,"" said William Greenwood from the National Trust's Bodnant Garden in Conwy. ""So we are pretty much ready to go as soon as we are given the go ahead."" Officials at Bodnant Garden believe they can reopen it within two of three days a formal announcement With 20 miles of paths and 80 acres of gardens, Mr Greenwood said there should not be an issue with social distancing and they could welcome up to 2,000 visitors a day. At the last lockdown review in Waleshairdressers, garden centresandsome non-essential retailwere given their dates to open. First Minister Mark Drakeford also announced tourism could start to reopen by Easter if case rates stayed low. This video can not be played ""There's going to be an influx of people,"" said one woman But, he warned a decision would not be made until""the last moment""and tourism openings would come to a halt""if bookings were made from outside Wales"". Plaid Cymru's Adam Price said businesses needed more detail on what they can expect, while the Tories have called for a roadmap out of lockdown. Italian-style village Portmeirion in Gwynedd was designed and built by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis Geoffrey Lyons-Mound, of Lyons Holidays Parks - which has 10 sites across Wales and Cumbria - said it had been a ""long winter"" but there were ""positive signs"". He added: ""About 95% of our customers are from England and 5% are Welsh - but all will be welcomed back. ""You find Welsh people tend to holiday in England and vice versa. But hopefully we will get there in the end."" Catherine Hummel, co-owner of Riverside Camping near Caernarfon, said she was expecting a ""softer reopening"" because of having to decline English bookings - which she said made up about 90% of their business - but they were making preparations to open. Catherine Hummel said different rules across the border made it more ""complicated"" to reopen Could Wales' lockdown begin lifting by Easter? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? She said: ""We have had to cancel around 100 bookings from England for Easter already, some were double cancellations from last year, so that's a double cancellation for some which isn't nice to do. ""Business-wise, I'm sad we can't welcome guests from England back just yet, but as a parent and member of the community I want to keep staff and guests as safe as possible."" Anglesey at one point has some of the lowest case rates in the UK but is currently 35th - Holyhead is now second highest of the Wales localised hotspots Nia Rhys Jones, joint chair of Anglesey Tourism Association and owner of some self-catering accommodation, said for some businesses it was ""just not worth the cost of reopening"". She said: ""It's all good allowing self-contained accommodation to reopen, but a lot of businesses on Anglesey are not opening because the bulk of trade comes from England, so opening is not worth the cost for some. ""There is some nervousness about people from parts of south Wales travelling up here and potentially seeing rates rise again. ""It's a real double-edged sword, businesses need trade from England, but also don't want to be bringing coronavirus back into our communities."" Zip World runs three zip line attractions in North Wales Sean Taylor, founder of the Zip World group of attractions in Snowdonia, said he would be glad to see businesses open but ""the most important thing is notice"". He said: ""We're a well-run business, but we need to be able to plan ahead. Any reopening after lockdown will need some time for staff training to take place and for us to organise things with suppliers. Even the most basic things as tea and coffee need a moment to get sorted before you can open the doors."" Paula Ellis said the last 12 months had been ""the most challenging time of our careers"" Paula Ellis is the group general manager for Retreats Group Ltd, chair of South West Tourism Forum and a member of the Covid Emergency Taskforce Group for Tourism, Hospitality and Events. She said lockdown had been ""the most challenging time of our careers"" and that without government support she did not know how the industry would have survived. She said she hoped the plans could go ahead to open tourism by Easter and preparations had been under way since ministers announced in February it was a possibility, but she said she would understand if it was not the case. ""We understand that if further strains are found or the R number changes in Wales that the Welsh government would have to retract the opening. ""For all our hopes and aspirations, the health of the nation does need to come first."" She added she would feel ""a lot more confident to open safely"" this summer as opposed to last as people have begun to be vaccinated and a lot of her guests tended to be older so would probably have had their jabs already. ""My main concern since last year is how I can look after my colleagues, community and guests, and in that order. ""My team are champing at the bit to be back and you can really feel the camaraderie."" About 350 people lost their jobs at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort during the pandemic. But with the easing of lockdown, chief executive Ian Edwards said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"". He told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he was confident up to 250 furloughed staff and 150 still working would keep their jobs. ""The vaccine rollout has given us hopeâ¦ it has been a very tough 12 months, but there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. People visiting Snowdonia's Pen y Pas will have to book a parking space in advance and use a park and ride service between April and November. Emyr Williams, Snowdonia National Park's chief executive, told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast the change was in response to hundreds of incidences ofdangerous parking in the arealast summer. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called for ""greater transparency between now and the end of June on what's likely to happen to allow businesses room to plan ahead"". ""We're not calling for an arbitrary date for the ending of all restrictions,"" he said. ""To not provide that level of openness means Labour is badly failing Welsh business and the workers and communities that depend on them."" A Welsh Conservative spokesman said: ""Families, workers and businesses in Wales deserve a clear and detailed roadmap out of lockdown.""Whilst Labour are dead against providing our businesses in the tourist sector with such detail, the Welsh Conservatives would deliver a clear and thorough roadmap out of lockdown, providing businesses with significant notice and restoring people with their freedoms."" Fiona Christie lives in Porthcawl and said she was nervous about the influx of people that could come to the town if rules allowed. Fiona Christie lives in Porthcawl and said crowds in the summer can be ""pretty hideous"" She said: ""I am nervous - I think Porthcawl is going to be pretty hideous in the summer to be fair. I think everybody is going to just come. ""It's lovely for people to come, but I think there's going to be an influx of people. ""I think people were more nervous last year and so they were careful, but this year I think everybody's probably had enough."" Carolyn Peers said it can be daunting for people living in tourist towns Carolyn Peers, who also lives in the seaside town, said: ""It happened last year and we couldn't even walk along the prom there was so many people - and whilst I understand people wanting got come out, it's daunting if you live here as well.""

Covid 'widened financial inequality in Wales',"This video can not be played Covid: Jobseekers struggling to find work in the pandemic The pandemic appears to have widened financial inequalities in Wales, according to official statistics. Wages in higher-paying industries, such as public sector office jobs, have hardly been affected by lockdown, with only 1% of jobsfurloughed. But in the low-paid hospitality sector, 78% of jobs have been furloughed with employees on 80% of their usual income. At the end of July, more than 500,000 people in Wales who were still employed were living on less money. According toUK Treasury data,externala total of 400,800 people were furloughed and 108,000 were getting self-employed support - 30.6%  of jobs in Wales. Even before Covid,Office for National Statistics data,externalshowed wide gaps in earnings between different sectors and the pandemic's economic impact has hit lower-paid jobs most heavily. Middle-aged women 'worst affected by long Covid' Poverty 'caused high Covid death rates' Coronavirus 'devastated' poorest communities Average wages in public administration in Wales were Â£680 a week, according to the ONS, compared with Â£360 in hospitality. Furlough was introduced to ""hibernate"" jobs to avoid the mass shedding of workers seen in previous recessions. It has been successful, but unemployment has also risen. There were 68,000 people unemployed and looking for work in Wales at the end of 2020 - 23,000 more than a year earlier. Caitlyn Morgan said the pandemic ""has been terrible for me"" Caitlyn Morgan, 20, from Fochriw, Caerphilly county, worked in Marks & Spencer in Cardiff on a placement arranged by The Prince's Trust before the pandemic, but has been unemployed ever since and misses work. ""I really enjoyed the job, I'm a very people person and this pandemic has been terrible for me. ""It was the face-to-face contact, that pride in being able to help someone, organising different things. ""Since the pandemic hit and you've been stuck inside, it's been really difficult to get that sense of satisfaction and pride again in the stuff that you do."" The Prince's Trust said its research showed 48%  of those not working or in education said they ""can't see an end"" to their unemployment. Women in Wales have been part of theCovid Realities project at University of York,external, sharing online diaries and sharing problems. Dr Ruth Patrick said families were saying: ""I can't afford to heat this house during the day and so I'm going to have to keep the heating off, be cold, know that my children are cold just so I can put a meal on the table this evening."" Dr Ruth Patrick says families have been turning off the heating to feed their children One woman from Wales wrote: ""Before Covid my husband was employed, we were still low income and, with four growing boys, money doesn't stretch far but we were managing. ""Then halfway through Covid my husband was made redundant."" She waited six weeks for her Universal Credit money to arrive. ""It's been horrific from one day to the next worrying if we will make it,"" she said. ""Through all this three of our sons had birthdays. They knew this year would be different because of Covid, but it was so different and sad seeing their faces when they got a little something each instead of what they asked for. ""They didn't even ask for much, what they wanted was only around Â£15 each and we couldn't do it, my heart hurt for them."" Another woman in Wales wrote: ""All our wages go on our bills and food, don't really have any spare... it's hard at the minute, boys need bits for school, paper etc and would like to get some more reading books but prices have rocketed because everyone is at home."" Ffion Thompson: ""I had so many sleepless nights thinking 'how am I going to afford this?"" Ffion Thompson, 25, from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, had been working as a nursery assistant and was saving to set up her own business. When Covid hit she was furloughed and had time to develop her dream - a toddlers' play centre. Little Dino's opened in Usk in November with two staff. Three weeks later, Wales went into lockdown again and the play centre has been closed since. Her boyfriend now works from home and she relies on him to pay the bills. ""I just remember freezing, the thought 'how am I going to survive? I've got staff to pay, bills to pay, the rent to pay'. ""I had so many sleepless nights thinking 'how am I going to afford this?"" She applied for grants, was told she was not eligible, but kept challenging the decision and finally got help. ""The next few months could be a struggle but I've got to be optimistic, I've got to keep smiling to keep the staff happy to keep the business running."" With people doing professional and office jobs generally earning as much as before the pandemic, while shops and restaurants are closed, their savings have increased. A report from the Bank of England found 42% of high-income employed households saved more during the pandemic than usual, compared with 22% of low-income working households. House prices have risen considerably, by 8.5% according to the ONS, unlike during other economic crises, while many owners have redecorated their homes. Carpets firms like Jamie and Richard Price's have benefitted by consumers spending on their homes Jamie and Richard Price's family business, Quality Carpets Direct, has three south Wales stores. Richard Price said customers have ""saved money from going on holidays, saved money not going out as much and happily have spent some of that money on home improvements, paints and carpets"". ""We understand the hard times that pubs and restaurants have had, but I think home industries have been better.

EU and UK try to end row with 'win-win' on vaccines,"Vaccine campaigns across Europe have started slowly, blamed partly on delayed deliveries The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies. In a joint statement, they said they wanted to ""create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all"". The European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that ""blockades"" were not ""sensible"". The joint UK-EU statement said that ""openness and global co-operation"" would be key to tackling the pandemic. ""We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it said. ""We will continue our discussions."" Why is the EU having vaccine problems? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates PM's vaccines comments set tongues wagging But there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular. The tone of the EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as ""slow, cumbersome and difficult"". On both sides. That doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. EU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. With a third wave of the pandemic hitting much of mainland Europe, EU leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the aim was to punish the UK. ""We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,"" she said. Asked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe ""that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines"" would be ""sensible"". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments ""in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed"", he added. Meanwhile, in other developments: Amid continuing anger in Europe at AstraZeneca, aFrenchgovernment spokesman said the UK-Swedish company's failure to deliver on its commitments was ""totally unacceptable"" InItaly, police raided a plant where 29 million AstraZeneca doses had been processed. An EU official told the BBC he asked for the weekend raid to ensure everything was on track Meanwhile inGermany,Chancellor Angela Merkel made a dramatic U-turnand cancelled a planned five-day lockdown over Easter following widespread criticism. ""This mistake is my mistake alone,"" she said EU states are trying to speed up their vaccination campaigns after a sluggish start. Italy's PM said he wanted to increase the country's rate of inoculations per day from 170,000 to half a million Some 19 EU states are recording a rise in infections - these includePoland, SpainandFrance The tougher export controls are most like to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. The key criteria for the proposed regulations are ""reciprocity"" and ""proportionality"": The EU says there is no reciprocity if a country importing vaccines from the EU restricts exports itself either by law or other means, so ""it may be appropriate to consider whether exports to this country are justified"" Member states and the Commission will also consider the epidemiological situation in that non-EU country, its vaccination rate and existing availability of Covid-19 vaccines There will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. Vaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned. In an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. ""I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,"" he said. He said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: ""We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why"". AstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU. This video can not be played Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton says the EU has been ""heavily penalised"" and wants to know why A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout."" Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return. Her colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say. UK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports.

When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK?,"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. However people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. There are still some restrictions in place inNorthern Ireland: 10 people from three households can meet and stay indoors in private dwellings and holiday accommodation Unlimited households can meet outdoors Social distancing of 1m (3ft) remains for many indoors activities, including restaurants, retail and shopping centres No social distancing laws outdoors, or on public transport, but 1m (3ft) recommended The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September. What can you now do across the UK? How are social distancing rules changing now? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. Indoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue tocollect customer contact details,external. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. Nightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.

How many people could lose their jobs?,"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.
