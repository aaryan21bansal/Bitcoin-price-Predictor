G7 leaders promise one billion vaccine doses,"This video can not be played G7 pledge of a billion doses for poorer countries is ""another big step towards vaccinating the world"", says UK PM Leaders of the major industrial nations have pledged one billion Covid vaccine doses to poor countries as a ""big step towards vaccinating the world"", Boris Johnson has said. At the end of the G7 summit in Cornwall, the PM said countries were rejecting ""nationalistic approaches"". He said vaccinating the world would show the benefits of the G7's democratic values. There was also a pledge to wipe out their contribution to climate change. After the first meeting of world leaders in two years, Mr Johnson said ""the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfish, nationalistic approaches that marred the initial global response to the pandemic and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might to defeating Covid for good"". He said the G7 leaders had pledged to supply the vaccines to poor countries - including 100 million from the UK - either directly or through the Covax scheme, which is being co-led by the World Health Organization, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Thecommunique issued by the summit,externalpledges to ""end the pandemic and prepare for the future by driving an intensified international effort, starting immediately, to vaccinate the world by getting as many safe vaccines to as many people as possible as fast as possible"". It also includes steps to tackle climate change, with leaders re-committing to the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest andpledging to eliminate most coal power. What difference could G7 vaccine donations make? In Pictures: World leaders bask in Cornwall sun at G7 summit How significant are G7's climate pledges? Has this been a G7 summit that mattered? Mr Johnson rejected suggestions the vaccines pledge was a moral failure by the G7 as it was not enough to cover the needs of poorer countries. He referred to the the UK's involvement in the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. ""Already of the 1.5 billion vaccines that have been distributed around the world, I think that people in this country should be very proud that half a billion of them are as a result of the actions taken by the UK government in doing that deal with the Oxford scientists and AstraZeneca to distribute it at cost,"" he said. He added that ""we are going flat out and we are producing vaccines as fast as we can, and distributing them as fast as we can"". The target to vaccinate the world by the end of next year would be met ""very largely thanks to the efforts of the countries who have come here today"", Mr Johnson said. The leaders slightly exceeded their target of donating a billion Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, if funding for future doses is included alongside individual jabs. There was also a commitment to build the frameworks to prevent and fight future pandemics. Elsewhere in the 25-page communique, there were several references to China, which President Biden said was a change from previous meetings of the world's advanced economies. Pledges made this time included working together to respond to China's impact on world trade. On the recovery from Covid there was even a reference to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trademark domestic policy - the need to reduce inequalities by ""levelling up"". Charities and campaigners issued statements calling out vague promises and missed opportunities, but Mr Johnson will feel that post-Brexit Britain has staged a diplomatic show that was both competent and confident. Mr Johnson also dismissed the suggestion that patents for vaccines should be waived in order to boost global supply, something whichthe US backed last month. He said he wanted to protect ""incentives for innovation"" while building up manufacturing capacity, especially in Africa. Elsewhere in their communique, G7 leaders also pledged to: improve early warning systems to prepare for future health crises phase out coal-fired power stations without carbon capture technology and raise $100bn (Â£70bn) to help poorer countries cut emissions support a green revolution that creates jobs, cuts emissions and seeks to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees reinvigorate their economies ""with plans that create jobs, invest in infrastructure, drive innovation, support people, and level up so that no place or person, irrespective of age, ethnicity or gender is left behind"" ""build back better"" by establishing a clean, green growth fund for infrastructure developments in developing countries respond to China's impact on world trade and challenge practices which ""undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy"" call on China to respect human rights, especially in relation to Xinjiang, where it has been accused of abuses against Uyghur Muslims get 40 million more girls into education by 2026 The communique calls for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened"" investigation into the origins of Covid-19. US President Joe Biden has previously saidthe US intelligence community is spliton whether coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a lab accident - a theory rejected by China. G7 calls for access to famine-hit Ethiopian region Mr Johnson said ""the advice that we've had is it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab"", but he added: ""Clearly anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the international community needed clarity about the origins of the virus but said it was up to the WHO to investigate. With G7 countries accounting for 20% of carbon emissions, Mr Johnson said: ""We were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us."" But pressed on the lack of binding agreements and timetables, the prime minister says he will not ""pretend our work is done"" and he will be ""on everybody's case"" to make further progress ahead of the COP26 summit in Scotland later this year. Kirsty McNeill from Crack the Crises, a coalition of charities and NGOs including Save the Children and Oxfam, said the G7 summit was a ""historic missed opportunity"" on Covid-19 and climate change. Leaders arrived ""with good intentions but without their cheque books"", she said. Joanna Rea, from Unicef UK, said the G7 pledge on vaccines was ""the beginning of the action required to end this pandemic"" but called for a ""rapid acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months to ensure millions of vaccines get to the people in countries who need them the most"".

"NI part of one great indivisible UK, says Johnson","This video can not be played ""Were you offended by President Macron's comments about Northern Ireland?"", asked the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Boris Johnson says he ""continuously"" makes the point that Northern Ireland is part of ""one great indivisible United Kingdom"" amid a row at the G7. Reports claim French President Emmanuel Macron said at the summit thatNorthern Ireland was not part of the UK,external. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the remark was ""offensive"" and that EU figures characterised Northern Ireland ""as somehow a separate country"". Mr Macron said he never questioned ""the integrity of the British territory"". Earlier, an Elysee source said the French leader was talking about ""geographical territory"" during the meeting, after Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron how he would feel if there were barriers to selling sausages from Toulouse in Paris. They added: ""The president wanted to stress that the situation was quite different and that it was not appropriate to make this kind of comparison."" This video can not be played French President Macron responds to the furore around his reported comments on Northern Ireland The row comes amid ongoing problems with the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. The policy was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement by ensuring a border would not be introduced on the island of Ireland. It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow many of the EU rules on trade. But as a result, it created a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, leading to additional checks on items moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. PM pledges to protect UK integrity amid EU row What is the sausage row about? EU warns UK over Irish Sea border goods checks So-called ""grace periods"" were introduced after the post-Brexit trade deal came into force, allowing goods to continue to move as normal while people adjusted to the new way of working. But as it stands, controls will be introduced from July on chilled meat products like sausages and mince - effectively banning them from entering Northern Ireland unless the UK agrees to match EU standards on its products. The UK has already unilaterally extended some grace periods, leading to legal action from the EU. But Ireland's Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin warned it would be ""very problematic"" if the UK did the same again, telling Sky News it would strain relations. He added: ""It's not about sausages per se, it really is about the fact that an agreement had been entered into not too long ago and if there's consistent, unilateral deviation from that agreement, that clearly undermines the broader relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is in nobody's interest."" This video can not be played Earlier, Dominic Raab said alleged comments by Emmanuel Macron on Northern Ireland were ""offensive"" Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the PM was offended by the alleged comments from the French president, Mr Johnson did not answer - instead saying it was ""the job of the government of the United Kingdom to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"". He also said Brexit had accounted for a ""vanishingly small proportion of our deliberations"" at the G7 summit. But pushed further by reporters about the French president's alleged remarks, Mr Johnson said he and the rest of the government ""make the point continuously that we are all part of one great indivisible United Kingdom"". Earlier, Mr Raab said the sentiment about Northern Ireland being separate from the rest of the UK had been expressed by EU figures for ""years"" and ""that is wrong"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""It is a failure to understand the facts, it is a failure to appreciate what speaking around Northern Ireland in those terms and approaching the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol in those terms does. ""It causes damage to businesses from both communities in Northern Ireland, creates deep consternation, and we wouldn't talk about Catalonia and Barcelona or Corsica in France in those ways."" But President Macron later appealed for ""calm"", saying: ""France has never allowed itself to question British sovereignty, the integrity of the British territory and the respect of the sovereignty.""And it's also true that Brexitâ¦ is the child of British sovereignty and has [created] thousands of hours of work for European leaders so we know very well what British sovereignty is."" He added: ""For a number of years after Brexit we established rules, a protocol agreement and also a commercial treaty for future relations. We just want them to be respected - seriously, calmly, professionally - that's all."" At international summits, it is generally a good rule to keep discussions about sausages confined to the barbecue on the beach. That the UK allowed its row with the EU - over post-Brexit trade across the Irish Sea - to overshadow the G7 raised eyebrows among diplomats. ""We can't understand why Boris is putting more petrol on the fire,"" one official told me. At his news conference, the prime minister sought to dampen the flames, refusing to echo Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said President Macron's suggestion that Northern Ireland was not part of the UK was ""offensive"". But the damage had already been done. Yes, the trade row was not part of the main G7 negotiations, but it was central to discussions in the margins. Even Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had raised the issue in his bilateral meeting with Mr Johnson, emphasising Canada's role in forging the Good Friday Agreement. So instead of using the congenial confines of a highly secure beach in south-west England to engender a bit of trust, both sides seem to have come away from Cornwall with hackles raised. This summit was supposed to be about showing how democracies around the world could co-operate better. That proved something of a challenge closer to home. Ahead of meetings at the G7 - attended by leaders of the EU, France, Germany and Italy - top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the bloc's patience was ""wearing thin"" with the UK, insisting it needed to follow the rules it agreed on the Northern Ireland Protocol. But during the summit, Mr Johnson said he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK. He told the BBC there was ""quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland [and] the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"" and he hoped the two sides would find ""pragmatic solutions"". Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Andrew Marr that the two sides needed to ""stop bickering"" and ""actually find a practical solution"". This video can not be played Labour's Emily Thornberry urges the UK government and the EU to ""stop bickering and find a practical solution"" Edwin Poots, the new leader of the DUP - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - also called the remark by President Macron offensive, saying the French leader ""doesn't understand the basics, let alone the finer details"". Mr Poots, who wants the protocol to be removed, added: ""This also exposes the ignorance which lies at the heart of the EU. They seem blind to the destruction the protocol has caused to the Belfast Agreement."" GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Live: NI row continues as G7 focus on climate targets But a source from the Elysee Palace said Mr Macron had ""recalled that the UK's exit from the EU had been a British decision and that they must now keep their word"" on implementing the protocol. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said he was ""not going to get drawn into the discussions the prime minister had with President Macron"".

Biden: America back at the table after G7 summit,"This video can not be played Biden: US could 'work with Russia' over Covid, cyber crime and conflict US President Joe Biden has declared that ""America is back at the table"" following the G7 summit of world leaders in the UK. At a press conference on Sunday, Mr Biden said the summit had been ""extraordinarily collaborative"". G7 leaders agreed on actionto tackle China's human rights record and climate change after three days of talks. Mr Biden said the organisation was in a ""contest with autocracies"" and welcomed its approach on China and Russia. He also sought to distance himself from his predecessor - Donald Trump - who he said believed climate change was ""not a problem"". ""We had a president, the last [one] who basically said it's not a problem, global warming,"" Mr Biden said. ""It is the existential problem facing humanity and it's being treated that way."" The leaders agreed on action on China's rights record and climate change The world leaders attending the Cornwall summit signed a declaration calling on China to ""respect human rights and fundamental freedoms"", especially in the Xinjiang region, the north-western region that is home to the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. Human rights groups allege China has subjected minorities in the region to mass detention, surveillance, and torture- something China strongly denies. ""We're in a contest, not with China per se... with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,"" Mr Biden said. The G7 adopted a spending planto support lower and middle-income countries in response to a similar Chinese scheme. Chinese officials, meanwhile, warned G7 leaders that the days when ""small"" groups of countries decided the fate of the world were long gone. G7 leaders promise one billion vaccine doses G7 pledges climate action but disappoints activists How significant are G7's climate pledges? The G7 also called for a transparent, expert-led study including in China, organised by the World Health Organization (WHO),amid claims Covid-19 may have leaked from a Chinese laboratory. ""We haven't had access to the laboratories,"" Mr Biden told reporters. He said it was not yet certain whether or not ""a bat interfacing with animals and the environment... caused this COVID-19, or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory"". Mr Biden also said the Russian President Vladimir Putin - who he dubbed an ""autocrat"" - was right to  believe relations were at their lowest point in years. The pair are meeting in Geneva on Wednesday. But he said the US could ""work together with Russia"" on issues such as Covid, cyber crime and conflicts. In terms of the big set-pieces (excluding tea with the Queen) we're only a quarter of the way through Joe Biden's 'America is Back' tour. We're now in Brussels for the Nato and then the EU/US summits, and then the trickiest meeting of all, his tete-a-tete in Geneva with Vladimir Putin. I accompanied Donald Trump when he travelled a similar route this time three years ago. Then Trump predicted that his meeting with the Russian leader might well be the easiest of the lot. Joe Biden is happy to say that it will be the thorniest. American foreign policy is back in a more familiar pre-Trump place. And the other members of the G7, Nato and the EU are breathing a sigh of relief. The US president came to Cornwall determined to show leadership. The agreement on contributing a billion vaccines to the poorest nations the American team view as a success. Biden has also sought to persuade the G7 to focus on the threat posed by China, and to come up with a global ""build back better"" fund to rival the billions China has been pouring into developing countries. But here the G7 has come up with warm words rather than hard cash. And the US administration says it wants to be judged by actions; not words. The G7 leaderspublished a 25-page communique,externalsumming up their ""shared agenda"" in key points. They included: Coronavirus: The headline pledge was to provide an extra one billion vaccine doses to poorer countries over the next year. They also committed to increasing global manufacturing capacity around the world, improving early warning systems for pandemics and supporting science to cut the time it takes to develop vaccines Help economies recover:The G7 countries said they would shift from supporting smaller countries' response to the crisis, to helping them grow and recover with jobs and investment Climate change:The leaders committed to a ""green revolution"" that would limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. They also promised to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, halve emissions by 2030, and to conserve or protect at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030 G7 pledges climate action but disappoints activists G7 leaders promise one billion vaccine doses Queen meets Joe Biden at Windsor Castle Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump sentencing hearing in New York hush-money case begins What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

JD Sports faces backlash over boss's bonus,"JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill JD Sports is facing an investor backlash after handing its boss a Â£4.3m bonus despite benefiting from millions of pounds in Covid support. Executive chairman Peter Cowgill's total pay, including a short-term salary reduction, reached nearly Â£5m. Shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis has urged investors to vote against the ""inappropriate"" pay policy. JD Sports defended its pay policy, saying it reflected the group's ""sustained outstanding performance"". ""The posting of exceptional results during such a challenging climate demonstrates that the remuneration approach and steps taken throughout the pandemic continue to support and drive this performance."" During the pandemic, the retailer has received Â£61m through the UK furlough scheme and an estimated Â£38m in business rates relief. The company has also benefitted from an additional Â£25m in wage support from other countries where it operates, including the US. JD Sports was also granted a Â£300m loan through the Bank of England's Covid Corporate Financing Facility Scheme which was set up to help larger firms through the pandemic. The company said it had not used any of the loan by the time the scheme closed in March. As a non-essential retailer, JD Sports was forced to close during lockdown. However, the company, which has stores across the UK, Europe, the US and Asia Pacific, reported a 0.9% rise in revenues to Â£6.1bn as it shifted sales to online. Pre-tax profit fell by 7% to Â£324m. JD Sports will hold its annual general meeting on 1 July when shareholders will be invited to vote on the company's remuneration report alongside other resolutions. The bulk of Mr Cowgill's bonus for last year came from a special award of Â£6m which was granted to the executive chairman in 2019 to reflect his ""exceptional performance"" and was to be paid in instalments. JD Sports had already paid out Â£3m prior to the Covid pandemic. The company then delayed a Â£1.5m payment that was due in October 2020. As a non-essential retailer, JD Sports had to close its stores during Covid lockdown The company said in its annual report: ""In the light of developments caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, it was agreed that the remaining payments would be deferred and paid when the board and committee were satisfied it is appropriate to do so."" The payment went ahead in January this year ""following a detailed review"". The additional final instalment of Â£1.5m has also since been paid to Mr Cowgill. Stripping out these payments, Mr Cowgill's bonus for the last financial year was Â£1.3m compared to Â£1.7m in the previous 12 months. Mr Cowgill also reduced his basic salary by 75% though this was only between April and August last year, after which it returned to normal levels. According to The Sunday Times,external, Glass Lewis is also recommending that shareholders vote against the re-election of Mr Cowgill due to what it claims is inadequate succession planning. It also said there had been a lack of progress on the board's gender diversity. Mr Cowgill and chief financial officer Neil Greenhalgh are the only members of the executive board. There are five non-executive directors comprising three men and two women, Heather Jackson and Kath Smith.

Renting now cheaper than buying a home,"It is cheaper to rent a property than it is to buy a home for the first time in more than six years, says Hamptons. Research by the estate agency suggests that before the pandemic began in March 2020, people buying with a 10% deposit would have been better off than renters by Â£102 a month. But last month, it found the average private sector tenant was better off, spending Â£71 a month less in rent. There are now only four areas in the UK where it is cheaper to buy than rent. They are the North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber, and Scotland. This is in contrast to May last year, when rental demand dropped as younger adults returned to live with their families during the pandemic and work and leisure restrictions made city living less attractive. In early 2020, it was cheaper to buy instead of renting in every nation or region in the UK. Hamptons says the switch comes despite a 7.1% rise in average rents over the past 12 months, as strong house price growth coupled with increases in higher loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage rates have added to the cost of buying and owning a home. As a result, a typical first-time buyer will now find it cheaper to rent than buy on a monthly basis, with a monthly average of Â£1,054 spent on rent compared with Â£1,125 on mortgage repayments - the first time since December 2014 that renting has been cheaper than buying. London has seen the largest shift since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Falling rents there mean a buyer putting down a 10% deposit on a property in the capital will have gone from being Â£123 a month better off buying in March 2020, to spending Â£251 a month less on rent in May 2021, the report said. There are, of course, a host of other financial and practical factors which potential first-time buyers will consider when deciding to rent rather than buy, or vice versa, which are not captured in this research. Greater London - Â£251 cheaper South East - Â£54 cheaper South West - Â£108 cheaper East - Â£117 cheaper East Midlands - Â£98 cheaper West Midlands, Â£35 cheaper Yorkshire and the Humber - Â£5 more expensive North West - Â£4 more expensive North East - Â£72 more expensive Wales - Â£11 cheaper Scotland - Â£130 more expensive Aneisha Beveridge, Hamptons' head of research, said the pandemic was responsible for reversing this six-year-long trend. ""A year ago, lenders were either increasing their rates or withdrawing higher loan-to-value mortgages altogether,"" she said. ""For first-time buyers in particular this pushed up the cost of paying a mortgage, if they could get one at all, to well above the cost of renting."" Ms Beveridge added that it was likely that the balance would swing back somewhat towards buying, particularly as mortgage rates come down, but this would likely be partly offset by rising house prices. ""And while interest rates are falling, they're still considerably above where they were pre-pandemic on higher LTV (loan-to-value) loans,"" she said. ""Despite this, we expect the gap between renting and buying to close over the remainder of this year, moving back towards longer-term levels in 2022.""

What difference could jabs pledge make?,"A US vaccine donation via Covax arrives in East Timor The G7 group of leading industrial nations have pledged to donate one billion coronavirus vaccine doses to poorer countries. President Joe Biden, in the UK for a G7 summit, said the US contribution of 500 million doses would be ""the largest single...donation of Covid-19 vaccines by any single country ever"". The UK has pledgedmore than 100 million doses over the next year. Over 870 million additional doseswere pledged at the G7 summit,external, bringing total commitments made since February 2021, to one billion. The vaccines will mainly be delivered throughthe Covax vaccine scheme, which aims to reach the most vulnerable 20% of every nation around the world. ""We need more, and we need them faster,"" said the head of the World Health Organization Tedros Ghebreyesus in his response to the G7 pledge.  ""Many other countries are now facing a surge in cases - and they are facing it without vaccines."" South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said: ""Even a billion vaccines, when we talk about two dose vaccines, it basically means 500 million... we need much more than that,"" ""We want to manufacture vaccines on our own, and we don't have the capacity."" Both the US and the UK have pledged to give away vaccine doses to other countries The US has agreed to purchase 500 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at a ""not for profit"" price. Mr Biden vowed the US would be ""the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against Covid"". It is understood that 200 million US doseswill be distributed by the end of this year, and a further 300 million by June 2022.,external The US had already pledgedto give 80 million doses to countries around the world.,external Five million UK vaccines will be donated by the end of September, and another 25 million by the end of 2021. Most of the UK doses (80%) will go via Covax. The scale of the task is huge, and vaccines are needed immediately. At a summit in early June, hosted by the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunisation (Gavi), it was announced that so far,more than 132 million doses had been shared by various countries.,external This included more than 54 million doses available for short-term supply donated by Belgium, Denmark and Japan, as well as additional supplies from Spain and Sweden. ""The challenge is given the variants, given the movement of the virus, to get these vaccines available across the world as soon as possible,"" Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi told the BBC. He said Covax had already ordered more than 2.5 billion doses, but these wouldn't come until the latter part of the year. ""To vaccinate at least 10% of the population in every country by September, we need an additional 250 million... vaccine doses,"" says Tedros Ghebreyesus of the WHO, of which 100 millionare needed in June and July. The original Covax objective was to deliver two billion doses of vaccine worldwide by the end of this year, but the aim now is to get 1.8 billion doses to 92 lower income economies by early 2022. And all these commitments are a long way off the 11 billion doses the WHO estimates are needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly reduced. The Covax scheme has mostly relied so far on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India. However supplies were severely hit in March, April and May after India halted all major exports of the vaccine when it was hit by its own major second wave of the pandemic. AstraZeneca vaccines have been the mainstay of the Covax sharing scheme A total of 1.1bn doses of Covishield (AstraZeneca) were ordered from India's largest manufacturer - the Serum Institute of India (SII). So far, it has supplied just 30 million doses to Covax, with nearly 190 million doses held up as it struggled to ramp up its production. It says exports will only resume by the end of the year and thatthe company is focusing on meeting India's own needs. There has also been an issue in some countries about the slow uptake and distribution of vaccines already delivered,with some African nations unable to use doses before they expire. ""While more vaccines are vital, some African countries must ramp up actions to swiftly roll out the vaccines they have,"" the WHO said.

G7 pledges climate action but disappoints activists,"The G7 summit was held in the resort of Carbis Bay in Cornwall, south-west England The G7 nations have agreed to step up action on climate change and renewed a pledge to raise $100bn a year to help poor countries cut emissions. After a summit in Britain, G7 leaders also promised to help developing countries move away from coal. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the three-day meeting, said on Sunday: ""We were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us."" However some environmental groups said the promises lacked detail. How significant are G7's climate pledges? World at risk of hitting temperature limit soon G7 calls for access to famine-hit Ethiopian region Developed countries agreed in 2009 to contribute $100bn a year in climate finance to poorer countries by 2020. But the target was not met, in part because of the Covid pandemic. While the G7 agreed to raise contributions to meet the target, Teresa Anderson, from Action Aid said: ""The G7's reaffirmation of the previous $100 billion a year target doesn't come close to addressing the urgency and scale of the crisis."" Catherine Pettengell, director at Climate Action Network, told Reuters news agency: ""We had hoped that the leaders of the world's richest nations would come away from this week having put their money their mouth is."" Climate change has been one of the key themes at the summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall. The G7 - which include the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy - committed to keeping the projected global temperature rise to 1.5C. In thefinal statement,externalthey said: ""We reaffirm the collective developed countries goal to jointly mobilise $100bn/year from public and private sources, through to 2025."" The meeting was hosted by UL Prime Minister Boris Johnson The commitment to help nations move away from coal power, which initially came from the White House, includes a plan to phase out coal burning unless it includes carbon capture technology. The G7 will end the funding of new coal generation in developing countries and offer up to Â£2bn ($2.8bn) to stop using the fuel. Coal is the world's dirtiest major fuel and ending its use is seen as a major step by environmentalists, but they also want guarantees rich countries will deliver on previous promises to help poorer nations cope with climate change. In a separate announcement, the UK joined Germany and the US to declare it would spend hundreds of millions of pounds protecting the world's vulnerable communities from climate change. The funding would ""enable quicker responses to extreme weather and climate-linked disasters in countries bearing the brunt of climate change,"" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. By Roger Harrabin, environment analyst Green campaigners say the summit's a flop because it failed to secure the cash previously promised for poor nations to cope with a heating climate on top of the Covid pandemic. Charities warn developing nations won't co-operate with the vital climate summit in Glasgow in November (known as COP26) unless adequate support is offered to tackle both crises. Rich nations previously pledged to hand $100bn a year to developing nations for climate assistance. But although the G7 did offer some extra bilateral funding it's clear that falls short. The G7's commitment to phase out coal at home and stop financing coal overseas is significant - it will heap pressure on China to follow. Details are still lacking, but there are also potentially important developments focusing finance to renewable energy and railways in developing nations to counterbalance China's Belt and Road mega-project. So, some progress has been made. And the aim to strike a global climate-protecting agreement at the COP may still be just about in reach - unless the climate offers surprises of its own. This video can not be played Hundreds of protesters paddled into Carbis Bay to urge actions on climate The G7 leaderspublished a 25-page communique,externalsumming up their ""shared agenda"" in key points. They included: Coronavirus: The headline pledge was to provide an extra one billion vaccine doses to poorer countries over the next year. They also committed to increasing global manufacturing capacity around the world, improving early warning systems for pandemics and supporting science to cut the time it takes to develop vaccines Help economies recover:The G7 countries said they would shift from supporting smaller countries' response to the crisis, to helping them grow and recover with jobs and investment Climate change:The leaders committed to a ""green revolution"" that would limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. They also promised to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, halve emissions by 2030, and to conserve or protect at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030 Sunday's meeting began with video message from the British broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. Speaking beforehand, Sir David said: ""The natural world today is greatly diminished... Our climate is warming fast. That is beyond doubt. Our societies and nations are unequal and that is sadly plain to see. ""But the question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether as a result of these intertwined facts we are on the verge of destabilising the entire planet."" He said the decisions facing the world's richest countries were ""the most important in human history"". The Earth's average temperature is about 15C (59F) but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C (54F) colder and hostile to life. Then and now: How rising temperatures threaten corals âIt is not too lateâ for worldâs wildlife says UN Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. This is known as climate change or global warming. You can read our simple explainerhere.

Netanyahu faces end of term as Israeli MPs to vote,"Mr Netanyahu (right) has held power for longer than any other Israeli leader Israel's parliament is debating the formation of a new government that would end 12 years of rule by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The prospective government - an unprecedented coalition of parties - has a razor-thin majority of one seat. If it is approved in a vote on Sunday, it would bring to an end years of political paralysis in which three elections resulted in stalemate. Right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett is poised to become PM. In a power-sharing deal, Mr Bennett, who heads the Yamina party, will hold office until September 2023, when he will hand over to Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, for a further two years. This video can not be played The coalition that could end ""King"" Bibi's 12-year reign Mr Netanyahu - Israel's longest-serving leader, who has dominated its political landscape for years - would remain head of the right-wing Likud party and become leader of the opposition. He has railed against the likely new government, calling it a ""dangerous coalition of fraud and surrender"" and has vowed to ""overthrow it very quickly"". Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's likely next PM? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Meanwhile, his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - allegations he denies - continues. Speaking in the first minutes of the debate, Mr Bennett thanked Mr Netanyahu for his years of service to Israel. And he said the new coalition would not allow Iran - Israel's bitter enemy - to acquire nuclear weapons. Mr Bennett was heckled by supporters of Mr Netanyahu in some of the other right-wing parties. For his part, Mr Netanyahu promised the opposition would have a ""strong and clear voice"" if he was ousted as PM. ""If it's our destiny to be in the opposition, we'll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government, and return to lead the country our way,"" he said. The new coalition is doing everything to avoid last-minute surprises here in the corridors of the Knesset. Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid are trying to keep the tone calm, despite the political convulsions their pact has unleashed. On Saturday night, the prime minister-designate urged protesters who had gathered outside Mr Netanyahu's home to avoid ""provocations"". And he's continuously held fire despite the flak from Mr Netanyahu, who accuses him of fraud and creating a government of surrender. In return, as he prepares for the vote to finally push his old boss from power, Mr Bennett will reportedly thank Mr Netanyahu for his service. He has already done the deed, so now the words are less important. Mr Netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021. He called an election in April 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government. Two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively. The third election resulted in a government of national unity where Mr Netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader Benny Gantz. But the arrangement collapsed in December, triggering a fourth election. The coalition said it acted to avoid yet another election Although Likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, Mr Netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to Mr Lapid, whose party had emerged as the second largest. Opposition to Mr Netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to Likud, including Yamina. Although Yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament. After weeks of negotiations, Mr Lapid brought Yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove Mr Netanyahu from office. The agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 June, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing Mr Netanyahu's fate. In appearance, Mr Bennett's government would be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel's 73-year history. The alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent Arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, Raam. It is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers. The inclusion of Raam and left-wing non-Arab Israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as Israeli policies towards Palestinians - Yamina and another right-wing party, New Hope, are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for instance. There could also be difficulties over social policies - while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, Raam, an Islamist party, is against this. In addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than Yamina - a national-religious party - will likely allow. Mr Bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters. ""Nobody will have to give up their ideology,"" he recently said, ""but all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams... We'll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot."" Netanyahu seeks block on deal to oust him The coalition that could end 'King' Bibi's 12-year reign.

"Big step towards vaccinating world, says PM","This video can not be played G7 pledge of a billion doses for poorer countries is ""another big step towards vaccinating the world"", says UK PM Leaders of the major industrial nations have pledged one billion Covid vaccine doses to poor countries as a ""big step towards vaccinating the world"", Boris Johnson has said. At the end of the G7 summit in Cornwall, the PM said countries were rejecting ""nationalistic approaches"". He said vaccinating the world would show the benefits of the G7's democratic values. There was also a pledge to wipe out their contribution to climate change. After the first meeting of world leaders in two years, Mr Johnson said ""the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfish, nationalistic approaches that marred the initial global response to the pandemic and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might to defeating Covid for good"". He said the G7 leaders had pledged to supply the vaccines to poor countries - including 100 million from the UK - either directly or through the Covax scheme, which is being co-led by the World Health Organization, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Thecommunique issued by the summit,externalpledges to ""end the pandemic and prepare for the future by driving an intensified international effort, starting immediately, to vaccinate the world by getting as many safe vaccines to as many people as possible as fast as possible"". It also includes steps to tackle climate change, with leaders re-committing to the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest andpledging to eliminate most coal power. What difference could G7 vaccine donations make? In Pictures: World leaders bask in Cornwall sun at G7 summit How significant are G7's climate pledges? Has this been a G7 summit that mattered? Mr Johnson rejected suggestions the vaccines pledge was a moral failure by the G7 as it was not enough to cover the needs of poorer countries. He referred to the the UK's involvement in the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. ""Already of the 1.5 billion vaccines that have been distributed around the world, I think that people in this country should be very proud that half a billion of them are as a result of the actions taken by the UK government in doing that deal with the Oxford scientists and AstraZeneca to distribute it at cost,"" he said. He added that ""we are going flat out and we are producing vaccines as fast as we can, and distributing them as fast as we can"". The target to vaccinate the world by the end of next year would be met ""very largely thanks to the efforts of the countries who have come here today"", Mr Johnson said. The leaders slightly exceeded their target of donating a billion Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, if funding for future doses is included alongside individual jabs. There was also a commitment to build the frameworks to prevent and fight future pandemics. Elsewhere in the 25-page communique, there were several references to China, which President Biden said was a change from previous meetings of the world's advanced economies. Pledges made this time included working together to respond to China's impact on world trade. On the recovery from Covid there was even a reference to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trademark domestic policy - the need to reduce inequalities by ""levelling up"". Charities and campaigners issued statements calling out vague promises and missed opportunities, but Mr Johnson will feel that post-Brexit Britain has staged a diplomatic show that was both competent and confident. Mr Johnson also dismissed the suggestion that patents for vaccines should be waived in order to boost global supply, something whichthe US backed last month. He said he wanted to protect ""incentives for innovation"" while building up manufacturing capacity, especially in Africa. Elsewhere in their communique, G7 leaders also pledged to: improve early warning systems to prepare for future health crises phase out coal-fired power stations without carbon capture technology and raise $100bn (Â£70bn) to help poorer countries cut emissions support a green revolution that creates jobs, cuts emissions and seeks to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees reinvigorate their economies ""with plans that create jobs, invest in infrastructure, drive innovation, support people, and level up so that no place or person, irrespective of age, ethnicity or gender is left behind"" ""build back better"" by establishing a clean, green growth fund for infrastructure developments in developing countries respond to China's impact on world trade and challenge practices which ""undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy"" call on China to respect human rights, especially in relation to Xinjiang, where it has been accused of abuses against Uyghur Muslims get 40 million more girls into education by 2026 The communique calls for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened"" investigation into the origins of Covid-19. US President Joe Biden has previously saidthe US intelligence community is spliton whether coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a lab accident - a theory rejected by China. G7 calls for access to famine-hit Ethiopian region Mr Johnson said ""the advice that we've had is it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab"", but he added: ""Clearly anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the international community needed clarity about the origins of the virus but said it was up to the WHO to investigate. With G7 countries accounting for 20% of carbon emissions, Mr Johnson said: ""We were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us."" But pressed on the lack of binding agreements and timetables, the prime minister says he will not ""pretend our work is done"" and he will be ""on everybody's case"" to make further progress ahead of the COP26 summit in Scotland later this year. Kirsty McNeill from Crack the Crises, a coalition of charities and NGOs including Save the Children and Oxfam, said the G7 summit was a ""historic missed opportunity"" on Covid-19 and climate change. Leaders arrived ""with good intentions but without their cheque books"", she said. Joanna Rea, from Unicef UK, said the G7 pledge on vaccines was ""the beginning of the action required to end this pandemic"" but called for a ""rapid acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months to ensure millions of vaccines get to the people in countries who need them the most"".

Biden: America back at the table after G7 summitThe US president praises the three-day summit and seeks to distance himself from his predecessor.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Biden: US could 'work with Russia' over Covid, cyber crime and conflict US President Joe Biden has declared that ""America is back at the table"" following the G7 summit of world leaders in the UK. At a press conference on Sunday, Mr Biden said the summit had been ""extraordinarily collaborative"". G7 leaders agreed on actionto tackle China's human rights record and climate change after three days of talks. Mr Biden said the organisation was in a ""contest with autocracies"" and welcomed its approach on China and Russia. He also sought to distance himself from his predecessor - Donald Trump - who he said believed climate change was ""not a problem"". ""We had a president, the last [one] who basically said it's not a problem, global warming,"" Mr Biden said. ""It is the existential problem facing humanity and it's being treated that way."" The leaders agreed on action on China's rights record and climate change The world leaders attending the Cornwall summit signed a declaration calling on China to ""respect human rights and fundamental freedoms"", especially in the Xinjiang region, the north-western region that is home to the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. Human rights groups allege China has subjected minorities in the region to mass detention, surveillance, and torture- something China strongly denies. ""We're in a contest, not with China per se... with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,"" Mr Biden said. The G7 adopted a spending planto support lower and middle-income countries in response to a similar Chinese scheme. Chinese officials, meanwhile, warned G7 leaders that the days when ""small"" groups of countries decided the fate of the world were long gone. G7 leaders promise one billion vaccine doses G7 pledges climate action but disappoints activists How significant are G7's climate pledges? The G7 also called for a transparent, expert-led study including in China, organised by the World Health Organization (WHO),amid claims Covid-19 may have leaked from a Chinese laboratory. ""We haven't had access to the laboratories,"" Mr Biden told reporters. He said it was not yet certain whether or not ""a bat interfacing with animals and the environment... caused this COVID-19, or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory"". Mr Biden also said the Russian President Vladimir Putin - who he dubbed an ""autocrat"" - was right to  believe relations were at their lowest point in years. The pair are meeting in Geneva on Wednesday. But he said the US could ""work together with Russia"" on issues such as Covid, cyber crime and conflicts. In terms of the big set-pieces (excluding tea with the Queen) we're only a quarter of the way through Joe Biden's 'America is Back' tour. We're now in Brussels for the Nato and then the EU/US summits, and then the trickiest meeting of all, his tete-a-tete in Geneva with Vladimir Putin. I accompanied Donald Trump when he travelled a similar route this time three years ago. Then Trump predicted that his meeting with the Russian leader might well be the easiest of the lot. Joe Biden is happy to say that it will be the thorniest. American foreign policy is back in a more familiar pre-Trump place. And the other members of the G7, Nato and the EU are breathing a sigh of relief. The US president came to Cornwall determined to show leadership. The agreement on contributing a billion vaccines to the poorest nations the American team view as a success. Biden has also sought to persuade the G7 to focus on the threat posed by China, and to come up with a global ""build back better"" fund to rival the billions China has been pouring into developing countries. But here the G7 has come up with warm words rather than hard cash. And the US administration says it wants to be judged by actions; not words. The G7 leaderspublished a 25-page communique,externalsumming up their ""shared agenda"" in key points.

Rich nations previously pledged to hand $100bn a year to developing nations for climate assistance. But although the G7 did offer some extra bilateral funding it's clear that falls short. The G7's commitment to phase out coal at home and stop financing coal overseas is significant - it will heap pressure on China to follow. Details are still lacking, but there are also potentially important developments focusing finance to renewable energy and railways in developing nations to counterbalance China's Belt and Road mega-project. So, some progress has been made. And the aim to strike a global climate-protecting agreement at the COP may still be just about in reach - unless the climate offers surprises of its own. This video can not be played Hundreds of protesters paddled into Carbis Bay to urge actions on climate The G7 leaderspublished a 25-page communique,externalsumming up their ""shared agenda"" in key points. They included: Coronavirus: The headline pledge was to provide an extra one billion vaccine doses to poorer countries over the next year. They also committed to increasing global manufacturing capacity around the world, improving early warning systems for pandemics and supporting science to cut the time it takes to develop vaccines Help economies recover:The G7 countries said they would shift from supporting smaller countries' response to the crisis, to helping them grow and recover with jobs and investment Climate change:The leaders committed to a ""green revolution"" that would limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. They also promised to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, halve emissions by 2030, and to conserve or protect at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030 Sunday's meeting began with video message from the British broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. Speaking beforehand, Sir David said: ""The natural world today is greatly diminished... Our climate is warming fast. That is beyond doubt. Our societies and nations are unequal and that is sadly plain to see. ""But the question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether as a result of these intertwined facts we are on the verge of destabilising the entire planet."" He said the decisions facing the world's richest countries were ""the most important in human history"". The Earth's average temperature is about 15C (59F) but has been much higher and lower in the past. There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C (54F) colder and hostile to life. Then and now: How rising temperatures threaten corals âIt is not too lateâ for worldâs wildlife says UN Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. This is known as climate change or global warming. You can read our simple explainerhere.

Netanyahu faces end of term as Israeli MPs to voteThe Israeli Knesset debates a proposed new government to replace Mr Netanyahu's administration.Middle East,"Mr Netanyahu (right) has held power for longer than any other Israeli leader Israel's parliament is debating the formation of a new government that would end 12 years of rule by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The prospective government - an unprecedented coalition of parties - has a razor-thin majority of one seat. If it is approved in a vote on Sunday, it would bring to an end years of political paralysis in which three elections resulted in stalemate. Right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett is poised to become PM. In a power-sharing deal, Mr Bennett, who heads the Yamina party, will hold office until September 2023, when he will hand over to Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, for a further two years. This video can not be played The coalition that could end ""King"" Bibi's 12-year reign Mr Netanyahu - Israel's longest-serving leader, who has dominated its political landscape for years - would remain head of the right-wing Likud party and become leader of the opposition. He has railed against the likely new government, calling it a ""dangerous coalition of fraud and surrender"" and has vowed to ""overthrow it very quickly"". Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's likely next PM? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Meanwhile, his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - allegations he denies - continues. Speaking in the first minutes of the debate, Mr Bennett thanked Mr Netanyahu for his years of service to Israel. And he said the new coalition would not allow Iran - Israel's bitter enemy - to acquire nuclear weapons. Mr Bennett was heckled by supporters of Mr Netanyahu in some of the other right-wing parties. For his part, Mr Netanyahu promised the opposition would have a ""strong and clear voice"" if he was ousted as PM. ""If it's our destiny to be in the opposition, we'll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government, and return to lead the country our way,"" he said. The new coalition is doing everything to avoid last-minute surprises here in the corridors of the Knesset. Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid are trying to keep the tone calm, despite the political convulsions their pact has unleashed. On Saturday night, the prime minister-designate urged protesters who had gathered outside Mr Netanyahu's home to avoid ""provocations"". And he's continuously held fire despite the flak from Mr Netanyahu, who accuses him of fraud and creating a government of surrender. In return, as he prepares for the vote to finally push his old boss from power, Mr Bennett will reportedly thank Mr Netanyahu for his service. He has already done the deed, so now the words are less important. Mr Netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021. He called an election in April 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government. Two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively. The third election resulted in a government of national unity where Mr Netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader Benny Gantz. But the arrangement collapsed in December, triggering a fourth election. The coalition said it acted to avoid yet another election Although Likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, Mr Netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to Mr Lapid, whose party had emerged as the second largest. Opposition to Mr Netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to Likud, including Yamina. Although Yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament. After weeks of negotiations, Mr Lapid brought Yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove Mr Netanyahu from office. The agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 June, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing Mr Netanyahu's fate. In appearance, Mr Bennett's government would be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel's 73-year history. The alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent Arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, Raam. It is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers. The inclusion of Raam and left-wing non-Arab Israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as Israeli policies towards Palestinians - Yamina and another right-wing party, New Hope, are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for instance. There could also be difficulties over social policies - while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, Raam, an Islamist party, is against this. In addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than Yamina - a national-religious party - will likely allow. Mr Bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters. ""Nobody will have to give up their ideology,"" he recently said, ""but all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams... We'll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot."" Netanyahu seeks block on deal to oust him The coalition that could end 'King' Bibi's 12-year reign.

Reports claim French President Emmanuel Macron said at the summit thatNorthern Ireland was not part of the UK,external. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the remark was ""offensive"" and that EU figures characterised Northern Ireland ""as somehow a separate country"". Mr Macron said he never questioned ""the integrity of the British territory"". Earlier, an Elysee source said the French leader was talking about ""geographical territory"" during the meeting, after Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron how he would feel if there were barriers to selling sausages from Toulouse in Paris. They added: ""The president wanted to stress that the situation was quite different and that it was not appropriate to make this kind of comparison."" This video can not be played French President Macron responds to the furore around his reported comments on Northern Ireland The row comes amid ongoing problems with the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. The policy was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement by ensuring a border would not be introduced on the island of Ireland. It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow many of the EU rules on trade. But as a result, it created a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, leading to additional checks on items moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. PM pledges to protect UK integrity amid EU row What is the sausage row about? EU warns UK over Irish Sea border goods checks So-called ""grace periods"" were introduced after the post-Brexit trade deal came into force, allowing goods to continue to move as normal while people adjusted to the new way of working. But as it stands, controls will be introduced from July on chilled meat products like sausages and mince - effectively banning them from entering Northern Ireland unless the UK agrees to match EU standards on its products. The UK has already unilaterally extended some grace periods, leading to legal action from the EU. But Ireland's Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin warned it would be ""very problematic"" if the UK did the same again, telling Sky News it would strain relations. He added: ""It's not about sausages per se, it really is about the fact that an agreement had been entered into not too long ago and if there's consistent, unilateral deviation from that agreement, that clearly undermines the broader relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is in nobody's interest."" This video can not be played Earlier, Dominic Raab said alleged comments by Emmanuel Macron on Northern Ireland were ""offensive"" Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the PM was offended by the alleged comments from the French president, Mr Johnson did not answer - instead saying it was ""the job of the government of the United Kingdom to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"". He also said Brexit had accounted for a ""vanishingly small proportion of our deliberations"" at the G7 summit. But pushed further by reporters about the French president's alleged remarks, Mr Johnson said he and the rest of the government ""make the point continuously that we are all part of one great indivisible United Kingdom"". Earlier, Mr Raab said the sentiment about Northern Ireland being separate from the rest of the UK had been expressed by EU figures for ""years"" and ""that is wrong"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""It is a failure to understand the facts, it is a failure to appreciate what speaking around Northern Ireland in those terms and approaching the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol in those terms does. ""It causes damage to businesses from both communities in Northern Ireland, creates deep consternation, and we wouldn't talk about Catalonia and Barcelona or Corsica in France in those ways."" But President Macron later appealed for ""calm"", saying: ""France has never allowed itself to question British sovereignty, the integrity of the British territory and the respect of the sovereignty.""And it's also true that Brexitâ¦ is the child of British sovereignty and has [created] thousands of hours of work for European leaders so we know very well what British sovereignty is."" He added: ""For a number of years after Brexit we established rules, a protocol agreement and also a commercial treaty for future relations. We just want them to be respected - seriously, calmly, professionally - that's all."" At international summits, it is generally a good rule to keep discussions about sausages confined to the barbecue on the beach. That the UK allowed its row with the EU - over post-Brexit trade across the Irish Sea - to overshadow the G7 raised eyebrows among diplomats. ""We can't understand why Boris is putting more petrol on the fire,"" one official told me. At his news conference, the prime minister sought to dampen the flames, refusing to echo Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said President Macron's suggestion that Northern Ireland was not part of the UK was ""offensive"". But the damage had already been done. Yes, the trade row was not part of the main G7 negotiations, but it was central to discussions in the margins. Even Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had raised the issue in his bilateral meeting with Mr Johnson, emphasising Canada's role in forging the Good Friday Agreement. So instead of using the congenial confines of a highly secure beach in south-west England to engender a bit of trust, both sides seem to have come away from Cornwall with hackles raised. This summit was supposed to be about showing how democracies around the world could co-operate better. That proved something of a challenge closer to home. Ahead of meetings at the G7 - attended by leaders of the EU, France, Germany and Italy - top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the bloc's patience was ""wearing thin"" with the UK, insisting it needed to follow the rules it agreed on the Northern Ireland Protocol. But during the summit, Mr Johnson said he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK. He told the BBC there was ""quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland [and] the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"" and he hoped the two sides would find ""pragmatic solutions"".

This video can not be played Labour's Emily Thornberry urges the UK government and the EU to ""stop bickering and find a practical solution"" Edwin Poots, the new leader of the DUP - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - also called the remark by President Macron offensive, saying the French leader ""doesn't understand the basics, let alone the finer details"".

China to G7: Small groups do not rule the world,"The G7 leaders, who are meeting in Cornwall, have a sought a unified position over China's rise China has warned the G7 leaders that the days when a ""small"" group of countries decided the fate of the world were long gone. The comments, by a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London, come as the leaders, who are meeting in England, seek a unified position over China. They adopted a spending plan in response to a massive Chinese scheme. Analysts say US President Joe Biden is determined that Western powers need to act now to counter a resurgent China. On Sunday,the G7 leaders are expected to issue a closing declarationpromising more financial support for developing countries hit by the climate crisis, and funds for infrastructure projects in the developing world, an alternative to a Chinese programme. President Biden said he wanted the US-backed Build Back Better World (B3W) planto be a higher-quality alternative to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The scheme has helped finance trains, roads, and ports in many countries, but has been criticised for saddling some with debt. Why have world leaders come to the English seaside? A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: ""The days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone. ""We always believe that countries, big or small, strong or weak, poor or rich, are equals, and that world affairs should be handled through consultation by all countries."" This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means In a statement on Saturday, the G7 countries - the world's seven wealthiest democracies - said their infrastructure plan would offer a ""values-driven, high-standard and transparent"" partnership. Details of how it will be financed remain unclear. BBC political correspondent Rob Watson, at the summit, says that President Biden is trying to frame the post-pandemic world as a struggle between democracies and autocracies. But there appears to be no consensus yet among the G7 nations over whether China is a partner, a competitor or a security threat, our correspondent adds.

But Ireland's Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin warned it would be ""very problematic"" if the UK did the same again, telling Sky News it would strain relations. He added: ""It's not about sausages per se, it really is about the fact that an agreement had been entered into not too long ago and if there's consistent, unilateral deviation from that agreement, that clearly undermines the broader relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is in nobody's interest."" This video can not be played Earlier, Dominic Raab said alleged comments by Emmanuel Macron on Northern Ireland were ""offensive"" Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the PM was offended by the alleged comments from the French president, Mr Johnson did not answer - instead saying it was ""the job of the government of the United Kingdom to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"". He also said Brexit had accounted for a ""vanishingly small proportion of our deliberations"" at the G7 summit. But pushed further by reporters about the French president's alleged remarks, Mr Johnson said he and the rest of the government ""make the point continuously that we are all part of one great indivisible United Kingdom"". Earlier, Mr Raab said the sentiment about Northern Ireland being separate from the rest of the UK had been expressed by EU figures for ""years"" and ""that is wrong"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""It is a failure to understand the facts, it is a failure to appreciate what speaking around Northern Ireland in those terms and approaching the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol in those terms does. ""It causes damage to businesses from both communities in Northern Ireland, creates deep consternation, and we wouldn't talk about Catalonia and Barcelona or Corsica in France in those ways."" But President Macron later appealed for ""calm"", saying: ""France has never allowed itself to question British sovereignty, the integrity of the British territory and the respect of the sovereignty.""And it's also true that Brexitâ¦ is the child of British sovereignty and has [created] thousands of hours of work for European leaders so we know very well what British sovereignty is."" He added: ""For a number of years after Brexit we established rules, a protocol agreement and also a commercial treaty for future relations. We just want them to be respected - seriously, calmly, professionally - that's all."" At international summits, it is generally a good rule to keep discussions about sausages confined to the barbecue on the beach. That the UK allowed its row with the EU - over post-Brexit trade across the Irish Sea - to overshadow the G7 raised eyebrows among diplomats. ""We can't understand why Boris is putting more petrol on the fire,"" one official told me. At his news conference, the prime minister sought to dampen the flames, refusing to echo Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said President Macron's suggestion that Northern Ireland was not part of the UK was ""offensive"". But the damage had already been done. Yes, the trade row was not part of the main G7 negotiations, but it was central to discussions in the margins. Even Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had raised the issue in his bilateral meeting with Mr Johnson, emphasising Canada's role in forging the Good Friday Agreement. So instead of using the congenial confines of a highly secure beach in south-west England to engender a bit of trust, both sides seem to have come away from Cornwall with hackles raised. This summit was supposed to be about showing how democracies around the world could co-operate better. That proved something of a challenge closer to home. Ahead of meetings at the G7 - attended by leaders of the EU, France, Germany and Italy - top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the bloc's patience was ""wearing thin"" with the UK, insisting it needed to follow the rules it agreed on the Northern Ireland Protocol. But during the summit, Mr Johnson said he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK. He told the BBC there was ""quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland [and] the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"" and he hoped the two sides would find ""pragmatic solutions"". Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Andrew Marr that the two sides needed to ""stop bickering"" and ""actually find a practical solution"". This video can not be played Labour's Emily Thornberry urges the UK government and the EU to ""stop bickering and find a practical solution"" Edwin Poots, the new leader of the DUP - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - also called the remark by President Macron offensive, saying the French leader ""doesn't understand the basics, let alone the finer details"". Mr Poots, who wants the protocol to be removed, added: ""This also exposes the ignorance which lies at the heart of the EU. They seem blind to the destruction the protocol has caused to the Belfast Agreement."" GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Live: NI row continues as G7 focus on climate targets But a source from the Elysee Palace said Mr Macron had ""recalled that the UK's exit from the EU had been a British decision and that they must now keep their word"" on implementing the protocol. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said he was ""not going to get drawn into the discussions the prime minister had with President Macron"".

"Big step towards vaccinating world, says PMBoris Johnson says countries were rejecting nationalistic approaches to come together at G7 summit.UK","This video can not be played G7 pledge of a billion doses for poorer countries is ""another big step towards vaccinating the world"", says UK PM Leaders of the major industrial nations have pledged one billion Covid vaccine doses to poor countries as a ""big step towards vaccinating the world"", Boris Johnson has said. At the end of the G7 summit in Cornwall, the PM said countries were rejecting ""nationalistic approaches"". He said vaccinating the world would show the benefits of the G7's democratic values. There was also a pledge to wipe out their contribution to climate change. After the first meeting of world leaders in two years, Mr Johnson said ""the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfish, nationalistic approaches that marred the initial global response to the pandemic and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might to defeating Covid for good"". He said the G7 leaders had pledged to supply the vaccines to poor countries - including 100 million from the UK - either directly or through the Covax scheme, which is being co-led by the World Health Organization, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Thecommunique issued by the summit,externalpledges to ""end the pandemic and prepare for the future by driving an intensified international effort, starting immediately, to vaccinate the world by getting as many safe vaccines to as many people as possible as fast as possible"". It also includes steps to tackle climate change, with leaders re-committing to the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest andpledging to eliminate most coal power. What difference could G7 vaccine donations make? In Pictures: World leaders bask in Cornwall sun at G7 summit How significant are G7's climate pledges? Has this been a G7 summit that mattered? Mr Johnson rejected suggestions the vaccines pledge was a moral failure by the G7 as it was not enough to cover the needs of poorer countries. He referred to the the UK's involvement in the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. ""Already of the 1.5 billion vaccines that have been distributed around the world, I think that people in this country should be very proud that half a billion of them are as a result of the actions taken by the UK government in doing that deal with the Oxford scientists and AstraZeneca to distribute it at cost,"" he said. He added that ""we are going flat out and we are producing vaccines as fast as we can, and distributing them as fast as we can"". The target to vaccinate the world by the end of next year would be met ""very largely thanks to the efforts of the countries who have come here today"", Mr Johnson said. The leaders slightly exceeded their target of donating a billion Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, if funding for future doses is included alongside individual jabs. There was also a commitment to build the frameworks to prevent and fight future pandemics. Elsewhere in the 25-page communique, there were several references to China, which President Biden said was a change from previous meetings of the world's advanced economies. Pledges made this time included working together to respond to China's impact on world trade. On the recovery from Covid there was even a reference to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trademark domestic policy - the need to reduce inequalities by ""levelling up"". Charities and campaigners issued statements calling out vague promises and missed opportunities, but Mr Johnson will feel that post-Brexit Britain has staged a diplomatic show that was both competent and confident. Mr Johnson also dismissed the suggestion that patents for vaccines should be waived in order to boost global supply, something whichthe US backed last month. He said he wanted to protect ""incentives for innovation"" while building up manufacturing capacity, especially in Africa. Elsewhere in their communique, G7 leaders also pledged to: improve early warning systems to prepare for future health crises phase out coal-fired power stations without carbon capture technology and raise $100bn (Â£70bn) to help poorer countries cut emissions support a green revolution that creates jobs, cuts emissions and seeks to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees reinvigorate their economies ""with plans that create jobs, invest in infrastructure, drive innovation, support people, and level up so that no place or person, irrespective of age, ethnicity or gender is left behind"" ""build back better"" by establishing a clean, green growth fund for infrastructure developments in developing countries respond to China's impact on world trade and challenge practices which ""undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy"" call on China to respect human rights, especially in relation to Xinjiang, where it has been accused of abuses against Uyghur Muslims get 40 million more girls into education by 2026 The communique calls for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened"" investigation into the origins of Covid-19. US President Joe Biden has previously saidthe US intelligence community is spliton whether coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a lab accident - a theory rejected by China. G7 calls for access to famine-hit Ethiopian region Mr Johnson said ""the advice that we've had is it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab"", but he added: ""Clearly anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the international community needed clarity about the origins of the virus but said it was up to the WHO to investigate. With G7 countries accounting for 20% of carbon emissions, Mr Johnson said: ""We were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us."" But pressed on the lack of binding agreements and timetables, the prime minister says he will not ""pretend our work is done"" and he will be ""on everybody's case"" to make further progress ahead of the COP26 summit in Scotland later this year. Kirsty McNeill from Crack the Crises, a coalition of charities and NGOs including Save the Children and Oxfam, said the G7 summit was a ""historic missed opportunity"" on Covid-19 and climate change. Leaders arrived ""with good intentions but without their cheque books"", she said. Joanna Rea, from Unicef UK, said the G7 pledge on vaccines was ""the beginning of the action required to end this pandemic"" but called for a ""rapid acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months to ensure millions of vaccines get to the people in countries who need them the most"".

Netanyahu faces end of rule in new government vote,"Mr Netanyahu (right) has held power for longer than any other Israeli leader Israel's parliament is debating the formation of a new government that would end 12 years of rule by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The prospective government - an unprecedented coalition of parties - has a razor-thin majority of one seat. If it is approved in a vote on Sunday, it would bring to an end years of political paralysis in which three elections resulted in stalemate. Right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett is poised to become PM. In a power-sharing deal, Mr Bennett, who heads the Yamina party, will hold office until September 2023, when he will hand over to Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, for a further two years. This video can not be played The coalition that could end ""King"" Bibi's 12-year reign Mr Netanyahu - Israel's longest-serving leader, who has dominated its political landscape for years - would remain head of the right-wing Likud party and become leader of the opposition. He has railed against the likely new government, calling it a ""dangerous coalition of fraud and surrender"" and has vowed to ""overthrow it very quickly"". Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's likely next PM? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Meanwhile, his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - allegations he denies - continues. Speaking in the first minutes of the debate, Mr Bennett thanked Mr Netanyahu for his years of service to Israel. And he said the new coalition would not allow Iran - Israel's bitter enemy - to acquire nuclear weapons. Mr Bennett was heckled by supporters of Mr Netanyahu in some of the other right-wing parties. For his part, Mr Netanyahu promised the opposition would have a ""strong and clear voice"" if he was ousted as PM. ""If it's our destiny to be in the opposition, we'll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government, and return to lead the country our way,"" he said. The new coalition is doing everything to avoid last-minute surprises here in the corridors of the Knesset. Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid are trying to keep the tone calm, despite the political convulsions their pact has unleashed. On Saturday night, the prime minister-designate urged protesters who had gathered outside Mr Netanyahu's home to avoid ""provocations"". And he's continuously held fire despite the flak from Mr Netanyahu, who accuses him of fraud and creating a government of surrender. In return, as he prepares for the vote to finally push his old boss from power, Mr Bennett will reportedly thank Mr Netanyahu for his service. He has already done the deed, so now the words are less important. Mr Netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021. He called an election in April 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government. Two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively. The third election resulted in a government of national unity where Mr Netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader Benny Gantz. But the arrangement collapsed in December, triggering a fourth election. The coalition said it acted to avoid yet another election Although Likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, Mr Netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to Mr Lapid, whose party had emerged as the second largest. Opposition to Mr Netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to Likud, including Yamina. Although Yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament. After weeks of negotiations, Mr Lapid brought Yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove Mr Netanyahu from office. The agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 June, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing Mr Netanyahu's fate. In appearance, Mr Bennett's government would be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel's 73-year history. The alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent Arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, Raam. It is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers. The inclusion of Raam and left-wing non-Arab Israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as Israeli policies towards Palestinians - Yamina and another right-wing party, New Hope, are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for instance. There could also be difficulties over social policies - while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, Raam, an Islamist party, is against this. In addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than Yamina - a national-religious party - will likely allow. Mr Bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters. ""Nobody will have to give up their ideology,"" he recently said, ""but all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams... We'll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot."" Netanyahu seeks block on deal to oust him The coalition that could end 'King' Bibi's 12-year reign.

EU warns UK over Irish Sea border goods checks,"Intensive talks are taking place on the NI Protocol which created a trade border in the Irish Sea The EU has warned the UK not to take any further unilateral action to delay post-Brexit checks on products entering Northern Ireland from Britain. The warning came from the European Commission's vice president. Maros Sefcovic said the EU ""will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations"". It comes as the two sides prepare to meet to assess possible simplifications of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that created a trade border in the Irish Sea, in order to prevent goods checks along the Irish land border. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? The 2019 deal kept Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are now enforced at its ports. It was agreed that the checks would be phased in through the use of so-called""grace periods"". But earlier this year the UK unilaterally extended and enhanced some of these grace periods. TheEU started legal action as a result. The next phase of new controls, affecting chilled meat products like sausages and mince, are due to begin next month after the grace period overseeing them ends. By 1 July, the products will be prohibited from moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, or the grace period will be extended either by agreement or unilaterally by the UK. Inan article for the Daily Telegraph newspaper,external, Mr Sefcovic writes: 'If the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations."" The sausage and the chicken nugget have long enjoyed the right to roam around the UK; their legal passage from Great Britain to Northern Ireland assured. But this is due to end in a little over three weeks. The Brexit deal included an agreement that some products would be checked within the UK - when moved from Britain to Northern Ireland - as an alternative to a hard border with the Republic. And the movement of some goods, including chilled meats, would be banned, albeit after a grace period - that expires at the end of this month. The government regards the prospect of blocking the free movement of the sausage within the UK as ridiculous and has claimed the European Union is acting with what it called ""legal purism"". The EU is threatening to act ""swiftly, firmly and resolutely"" to ensure the UK abides by its ""obligations under international law"" as Brussels sees them. The British government agreed to the protocol in late 2019 but there have been some problems since it came into operation in January this year, and the UK is now seeking changes. George Eustice, the UK's Agriculture Minister, described the chilled meats issue as ""bonkers"" on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. On Monday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost admitted the UK had ""underestimated"" the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland. In an article in the Financial Times,he accused the EU of ""legal purism""and called for ""pragmatic solutions between friends, not the imposition of one side's rules on the other"". However, in his Daily Telegraph article on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic denied that the EU had been intransigent over the protocol. ""Far from being inflexible, the EU has shown from the very beginning that we are willing to find creative solutions when required,"" the European Commission vice president wrote. Maros Sefcovic said the EU would react swiftly, firmly and resolutely to any UK unilateral changes to the protocol ""The continued availability of medicines to Northern Ireland is among those tailor-made flexible solutions - something I personally take very seriously in this time of pandemic."" Mr Sefcovic added that the EU team was ""working hard to find ways to ensure that the protocol is implemented in a way that both facilitates the everyday life of Northern Ireland's communities and preserves the integrity of the EU's Single Market"". He stressed the need for UK-EU cooperation to implement the existing 2019 deal, saying ""we should not waste time turning the tables and washing our hands of an agreement that we shaped, agreed and signed jointly"". The EU-UK Joint Committee is due to meet in London on Wednesday to review progress on technical talks that have been examining ways to simplify the Northern Ireland Protocol. Officials have been holding intensive talks, but there is little expectation of a major breakthrough at the meeting. It is understood UK officials believe there has been significant progress in only two of about 30 problem areas and each side has accused the other of a lack of real engagement However, the EU is preparing to offer a number of concessions, that would include: Ensuring ""uninterrupted supply"" for medicines destined for Northern Ireland that have been authorised by the UK Flexibility on steel quotas and tariffs which have affected Northern Ireland in a way that was ""not anticipated in the protocol"" A pet passport exemption for guide dogs entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain An easing of livestock rules to avoid ""multiple tagging"" But an EU official said the EU's patience with the UK was ""wearing thin"" and warned that there could be trade sanctions if there is no breakthrough on implementing the protocol by next month. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting, Northern Ireland business groups urged the UK and EU to find ""immediate solutions"" to Irish Sea border trading problems. ""We cannot afford another missed opportunity at the joint committee,"" said the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group - a coalition of organisations and companies. ""We continue to hear that the EU and UK are committed to their assertion in the preamble to the protocol that they are 'determined that the application of this protocol should impact as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland'. ""But it undoubtedly is having an impact and will increasingly do so as more stringent requirements come in from October."" Customs checks are carried out at ports in Northern Ireland as a result of the new trade rules It added: ""We are heartened by the increased level of engagement that we have had in the past few weeks and months, however, we need to see that our faith in this process is justified by the delivery of solutions."" The working group added that there will be opportunities under the protocol, given the access it gives to both the UK and EU markets, but trade frictions need to be removed for the economy as a whole. Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland trade union representative body, NIC ICTU, said ""a space has to be created that acknowledges the practical problems with the protocol while also respecting the integrity of EU single market"". It added that it is ""not acceptable or credible that those who demanded a hard Brexit now say the 'protocol must go!' This simplistic rhetoric misleads and abuses the electorate and encourages division."" But it said: ""The concerns of many within the unionist community around the practical issues with the protocol need to be respected, considered and addressed.""

What is the sausage row about?,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

The updates today have been brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Hugo Bachega, Charley Adams, Jonathan Morris, Francesca Gillett, Jack Hunter, Rob Corp, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. The G7 summit ended with another busy day of news. Here are the latest headlines:  Protests continued throughout Sunday too   You can see some of the best pictures from the packed weekend in Cornwallhere This video can not be played G7: Macron responds to Northern Ireland 'offensive' comments Earlier, Emmanuel Macron responded to the furore around his reported comments on Northern Ireland. Reports claimed the French president said at the summit thatNorthern Ireland was not part of the UK,external- a remark Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said was ""offensive"". The Queen and her guests were photographed in Windsor Castle's Grand Corridor before tea US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden are meeting with the Queenat Windsor Castle. This is not the first time the Queen has met Mr Biden. As well as at the G7 on Friday, the Queen also met him in 1982 when he was the senator for Delaware. Here are some photographs of the visit so far. The couple landed on Marine One shortly before 17:00 BST The US national anthem was played in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle Mr Biden was pictured inspecting a Guard of Honour Like the rest of the weekend, the weather was beautiful for the visit Protesters travelled to Cornwall to urge G7 leaders to act on Tigray Among other pledges in the G7 communique is a call for an ""immediate cessation of hostilities"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region amid deep concern from leaders. Fighting broke out in November 2020 between government forces against local rebels. The G7 called for unimpeded access for aid workers to Tigray, where the UN says some 350,000 people are living in famine conditions. The statement came after protests about the Tigray situation were held in Cornwall yesterday. Andrew SegalBBC South West A sculpture of the G7 leaders,based on Mount Rushmore and made of electronic waste, was still proving popular on the last day of the leadersâ summit in Cornwall. Hundreds of people were still taking in âMount Recyclemore"", erected near Hayle last week, on Sunday. The sculpture, by Joe Rush, bids to highlight the damage caused by the disposal of electronic devices. As the sun set on Saturday at the G7, master of the barbecue Simon Stallards swung into action with an alfresco feast for the distinguished guests. But this was no ordinary barbecue on the beach - Simon has made a name for himself with the Hidden Hut beachside cafe at Porthcurnick in Cornwall. And on the menu for the G7 leaders, guests and their partners was a mouth-watering menu of scallops, crab claws and mackerel with a main course of steak, lobster, chips and purple sprouting broccoli and salt-baked beetroot. For pudding it was a ""Beach Hut Sundae"". All washed down with Cornish sparkling wine, German riesling, Australian shiraz, Cornish beer and Hedge Row Fizz cocktails. As if that wasn't enough, it was then time for baked brie, hot buttered rum and toasted marshmallows around fire pits. No wonder Boris Johnson needed adip in the sea this morning. Devon and Cornwall Police say a number of protests are causing disruption near where the G7 summit has been held in Cornwall. Officers are dealing with aroadblock set up by protesters near Tempest roundabout,externalin St Erth, Hayle, and another in St Ives. Anthony ReubenBBC News The US national anthem was played after the Bidens arrived Is this the oldest meeting of
heads of state? President Biden having tea with
the Queen has got to be a contender for the the highest ages of two meeting
heads of state. The two of them have a combined age of 173 years. (The Queen at 95 and President Biden at 78) Thatâs impressive but it turns
out itâs not even the record for Her Majesty. On 3 April 2014, the Queen had
lunch with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.
They had a combined age of 175 years. Thatâs the best
we can come up with. Can anyone beat it? The Queen has greeted US President Joe Biden and his wife Jill for the first time at Windsor Castle. They met on Friday night at the G7 summit - but now they are in the castle's quadrangle. The US national anthem has been played, followed by a Guard of Honour and then the band played traditional British and American marches. Officials inspect a container of AstraZeneca vaccines donated by the USA through the WHO's Covax programme Oxfam says the G7 summit in Cornwall ""completely failed to meet the challenges of our times"". ""Never in the history of the G7 has there been a bigger
gap between their actions and the needs of the world. In the face of these
challenges the G7 have chosen to cook the books on vaccines and continue to
cook the planet,"" says Max Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam. In a lengthy list of ""failures"", the charity singles out Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel as caring ""more about protecting the monopolies and patents of
pharmaceutical giants"" than protecting millions in poorer nations from the threat of Covid. ""We need all G7 nations to follow the lead of the US,
France and over 100 other nations in backing a waiver on intellectual property."" Oxfam describes the promise of one billion vaccine doses as ""a drop in the bucket"", adding ""but they didn't even manage
that"". The charity calls the G7's pledge on climate change a missed opportunity to make new pledges of climate finance ""ahead of landmark climate talks in Glasgow"" - at November's COP26. ""We need to see a Herculean effort to cut emissions
further and faster, and to hit the long-overdue target of $100 billion per year
in climate finance,"" it says.  Johnny O'SheaBBC News Online Earlier this afternoon there was a festival feel in St Ives. There was a band, Psychadelephant, playing on a stage set up on the beach in the harbour, with about 30 people dancing along. Many more were taking a more passive approach and watching from the sand. The giant globe that was in Falmouth on Saturday made its way here and there were a number of banners that had messages, including âone people one planetâ and âClimate emergency - sound the alarmâ. We've heard from several of the G7 leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also been giving his closing remarks at the end of the summit. ""This pandemic isn't over yet, so through the G7 we are stepping up - again,"" he says about vaccination commitments, adding that Canada will give 100 million doses as part of the latest drive. He also speaks about other pledges made at the summit, including climate change and education access. On Twitter, he says he met with Angela Merkel on the margins of the summit yesterday. Trudeau pays tribute to her ""friendship"" over the years - with the leader set to leave office in September after more than 15 years as German chancellor. Allow Twitter content?

Johnny O'SheaBBC News Online The only road out of St Ives during the G7 summit is currently blocked by XR protesters. About 25 protesters have been banging drums and singing, and are sitting across a pedestrian crossing. It started at about 15:00. No-one has been arrested, but there are about 40 police officers  present. The weekend's G7 summit in Cornwall has finished, and the leaders have now published a 25-page communique - a document outlining what has been agreed. They summed up their ""shared agenda"" into six key points, which are:,external Reality Check French President Emmanuel Macron
said more needs to be done to help poorer countries produce their own Covid
vaccines. He said that 20% of âthe
vaccination needâ is in Africa but it only has 1% of the production. Africa
has a population of about 1.3 billion, which is about 17% of the worldâs
population, so the 20% figure is not far off. A report from the consultants McKinsey,externalsays Africa imports 99% of its
vaccines, which presumably means it manufactures 1% itself. The World Health Organizationsays there are fewer than 10 vaccine manufacturers on the continent,external, located in
five countries: Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. It said they
were all relatively small-scale. You can read more about the slow pace of vaccination in Africa here.  A number of the leaders have been speaking since the G7 summit ended - and some of the campaigners who have been in the area for the summit have been aiming to have their say too. Campaigners against proposed legislation on crime and justice held a protest in Falmouth. They were demonstrating against thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Billas well as social inequality in Cornwall where the G7 leaders have been meeting. The Bill includes major government proposals on crime and justice, including changes to protests legislation in England and Wales. One speaker called it ""draconian and oppressive"" and said it would ""shift the course of our democracy from progression to repression"", to which the crowd booed. About 500 people gathered outside the media centre in Falmouth, holding up posters, placards and a banner which read âResist anti trespass. Kill the billâ. Some of the signs say âIs this a serious annoyance?â, anod to the language which has been put forward in the prospective legislation. More than 20 police officers lined the entrance of the G7 media centre to monitor the peaceful protest. Reality Check Asked about foreign aid, Boris
Johnson said that in spite of the pandemic, âweâre spending Â£10bn supporting
the poorest and neediest around the worldâ¦ weâre still the second biggest aid
contributor in the G7â. The
UKâs foreign aid spending in 2020 was Â£14.5bn, which was 0.7% of GNI, a measure
of the size of the economy. That figure of 0.7% made it thesecond biggest contributor in the G7 behind Germany,external. This year, the UK plans to cut its
contributions to 0.5% of GNI, which means that spending is likely to be around
Â£10bn. We
cannot yet judge whether the UK will remain the second biggest spender on aid â
in terms of the percentage of GNI - in 2021. But
it is likely to be overtaken by France â it spent 0.53% of GNI in 2020 and has
committed to increase spending to 0.7% by 2025. In
terms of the amount of cash spent (as opposed to the proportion of the economy)
the UK was thethird biggest donor in the G7 last year behind the US and Germany,external.  A woman is vaccinated in Ghana, which has received jabs via the Covax scheme Unicef has responded to the pledge by the G7 countries to donate one billion vaccine doses to poorer countries - but says the jabs need to be given sooner. The charity has already warned,before the G7 summit, that there needs to be a steady supply throughout the year rather than countries donating their leftover doses all at the same time in the autumn and winter. If that happens, Unicef says, then millions of doses could be wasted as poorer countries won't have the resources to jab everyone before the doses expire. Boris Johnson didn't specify when exactly the one billion doses - including 100 million from the UK - will be given. Unicef says it welcomes the pledge but says some dose donations will be available immediately - which it was ""particularly pleased"" about. ""However, time is still of the
critical essence,"" says the charity in a statement. âSeveral
forecasts suggest that G7 countries will have enough vaccine supplies to donate one billion doses by as early as the end of 2021."" The charity calls for a clear plan and timeline of when doses will be available, and a ""rapid
acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months"". By Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent Reality Check At the end of a summit in which climate change has been a big issue,
Boris Johnson says âthe G7 countries account for 20% of global carbon
emissions"". There are slightly different ways to calculate percentage shares
of emissions - and it's also much more common to see figures cited for all
greenhouse gases and not just carbon dioxide on its own. A UN-backed report suggests the figure for all greenhouse gases from the G7 is about 25%,external. But most importantly, itâs worth pointing out that the population
of G7 countries is only about 10% of the global total. It stands to reason that rich countries pollute far more than
poorer ones per person, because people consume more when they have higher
disposal incomes. China produces more carbon emissions than the whole G7, but it has
been doing so for a shorter amount of time, and it has a much larger
population. Thatâs one of the reasons why the G7 accepts a special
responsibility for taking a lead on climate change. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"EU attitude to NI offensive, says RaabThe foreign secretary says the EU characterises Northern Ireland ""as somehow a separate country"".","This video can not be played ""Were you offended by President Macron's comments about Northern Ireland?"", asked the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Boris Johnson says he ""continuously"" makes the point that Northern Ireland is part of ""one great indivisible United Kingdom"" amid a row at the G7. Reports claim French President Emmanuel Macron said at the summit thatNorthern Ireland was not part of the UK,external. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the remark was ""offensive"" and that EU figures characterised Northern Ireland ""as somehow a separate country"". Mr Macron said he never questioned ""the integrity of the British territory"". Earlier, an Elysee source said the French leader was talking about ""geographical territory"" during the meeting, after Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron how he would feel if there were barriers to selling sausages from Toulouse in Paris. They added: ""The president wanted to stress that the situation was quite different and that it was not appropriate to make this kind of comparison."" This video can not be played French President Macron responds to the furore around his reported comments on Northern Ireland The row comes amid ongoing problems with the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. The policy was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement by ensuring a border would not be introduced on the island of Ireland. It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow many of the EU rules on trade. But as a result, it created a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, leading to additional checks on items moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. PM pledges to protect UK integrity amid EU row What is the sausage row about? EU warns UK over Irish Sea border goods checks So-called ""grace periods"" were introduced after the post-Brexit trade deal came into force, allowing goods to continue to move as normal while people adjusted to the new way of working. But as it stands, controls will be introduced from July on chilled meat products like sausages and mince - effectively banning them from entering Northern Ireland unless the UK agrees to match EU standards on its products. The UK has already unilaterally extended some grace periods, leading to legal action from the EU. But Ireland's Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin warned it would be ""very problematic"" if the UK did the same again, telling Sky News it would strain relations. He added: ""It's not about sausages per se, it really is about the fact that an agreement had been entered into not too long ago and if there's consistent, unilateral deviation from that agreement, that clearly undermines the broader relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is in nobody's interest."" This video can not be played Earlier, Dominic Raab said alleged comments by Emmanuel Macron on Northern Ireland were ""offensive"" Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the PM was offended by the alleged comments from the French president, Mr Johnson did not answer - instead saying it was ""the job of the government of the United Kingdom to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"". He also said Brexit had accounted for a ""vanishingly small proportion of our deliberations"" at the G7 summit. But pushed further by reporters about the French president's alleged remarks, Mr Johnson said he and the rest of the government ""make the point continuously that we are all part of one great indivisible United Kingdom"". Earlier, Mr Raab said the sentiment about Northern Ireland being separate from the rest of the UK had been expressed by EU figures for ""years"" and ""that is wrong"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""It is a failure to understand the facts, it is a failure to appreciate what speaking around Northern Ireland in those terms and approaching the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol in those terms does. ""It causes damage to businesses from both communities in Northern Ireland, creates deep consternation, and we wouldn't talk about Catalonia and Barcelona or Corsica in France in those ways."" But President Macron later appealed for ""calm"", saying: ""France has never allowed itself to question British sovereignty, the integrity of the British territory and the respect of the sovereignty.""And it's also true that Brexitâ¦ is the child of British sovereignty and has [created] thousands of hours of work for European leaders so we know very well what British sovereignty is."" He added: ""For a number of years after Brexit we established rules, a protocol agreement and also a commercial treaty for future relations. We just want them to be respected - seriously, calmly, professionally - that's all."" At international summits, it is generally a good rule to keep discussions about sausages confined to the barbecue on the beach. That the UK allowed its row with the EU - over post-Brexit trade across the Irish Sea - to overshadow the G7 raised eyebrows among diplomats. ""We can't understand why Boris is putting more petrol on the fire,"" one official told me. At his news conference, the prime minister sought to dampen the flames, refusing to echo Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said President Macron's suggestion that Northern Ireland was not part of the UK was ""offensive"". But the damage had already been done. Yes, the trade row was not part of the main G7 negotiations, but it was central to discussions in the margins. Even Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had raised the issue in his bilateral meeting with Mr Johnson, emphasising Canada's role in forging the Good Friday Agreement. So instead of using the congenial confines of a highly secure beach in south-west England to engender a bit of trust, both sides seem to have come away from Cornwall with hackles raised. This summit was supposed to be about showing how democracies around the world could co-operate better. That proved something of a challenge closer to home. Ahead of meetings at the G7 - attended by leaders of the EU, France, Germany and Italy - top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the bloc's patience was ""wearing thin"" with the UK, insisting it needed to follow the rules it agreed on the Northern Ireland Protocol. But during the summit, Mr Johnson said he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK. He told the BBC there was ""quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland [and] the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"" and he hoped the two sides would find ""pragmatic solutions"". Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Andrew Marr that the two sides needed to ""stop bickering"" and ""actually find a practical solution"". This video can not be played Labour's Emily Thornberry urges the UK government and the EU to ""stop bickering and find a practical solution"" Edwin Poots, the new leader of the DUP - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - also called the remark by President Macron offensive, saying the French leader ""doesn't understand the basics, let alone the finer details"". Mr Poots, who wants the protocol to be removed, added: ""This also exposes the ignorance which lies at the heart of the EU. They seem blind to the destruction the protocol has caused to the Belfast Agreement."" GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Live: NI row continues as G7 focus on climate targets But a source from the Elysee Palace said Mr Macron had ""recalled that the UK's exit from the EU had been a British decision and that they must now keep their word"" on implementing the protocol. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said he was ""not going to get drawn into the discussions the prime minister had with President Macron"".

"Disruption to shipping could last until ChristmasGlobal transport of goods has suffered blockages, delays and bottlenecks and won't be resolved quickly.","Yantian Port is experiencing acute congestion Disruption in the global container shipping industry shows no sign of being resolved quickly and could lead to shortages in the run-up to Christmas, say industry experts. An outbreak of Covid-19 in Guangdong province in southern China has caused acute congestion at the region's ports. As a result, shipments have been delayed, exacerbating tensions within global supply chains. And the knock-on effects could take many months to resolve. The problems in Guangdong are just the latest in a series of severe setbacks for the industry. Shipping firms have been struggling to cope with dramatic fluctuations in demand triggered by the pandemic, as well as the consequences from the recent blockage of the Suez Canal. The global nature of the sector, and the lack of spare capacity within it, means that problems in one region can have ripple effects around the world for several months. Yantian International Container Terminal is one of a number of ports in the Shenzhen region, which collectively form a vital gateway for exports from the Pearl River Delta, a major Chinese centre for manufacturing and technology. Since late May, the terminal has been operating at a fraction of its normal capacity, with operations restricted due to controlling the spread of Covid. This has led to severe congestion, with dozens of ships waiting outside the port for a berth to become available. The Ever Given blocked the Suez Canal in March causing a tailback of container ships ""One of the biggest ports in China has basically closed down for close to three weeks. They have some berths in operation, but nowhere near enough"", says Nils Haupt, communications director at the German shipping line Hapag-Lloyd. Over the past few days, shipping lines have been diverting vessels away from Yantian to other nearby terminals in the Delta area. But, according to Mr Haupt, that has been creating its own problems. ""You can use ports like Shekhou, you can use Nansha, you can use Hong Kong; but what we're seeing right now is that delays are piling up there as well,"" he says. The growing crisis in southern China is just the latest blow to hit the shipping industry, which has been suffering from acute disruption for more than a year. A dramatic slowdown in the early stages of the pandemic was followed by a frenzy of activity, as customers, unable to travel or socialise in their normal ways, ordered more consumer goods. This sudden shift in demand, from famine to feast, threw delicately balanced supply chains out of kilter. Ports in Europe and North America became clogged, with too many vessels arriving at the same time, while the supply of empty containers for new consignments dried up, because too many of them were sitting at quaysides around the world. Then came the blockage of the Suez Canal in March. The closure of one of the world's busiest shipping lanes delayed hundreds of ships. But when it reopened the sudden arrival of the delayed vessels triggered new congestion at European hubs such as Rotterdam and Antwerp. UK shoppers warned of summer products shortage The cost of the Suez Canal blockage ""We were just beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Mr Haupt. ""But then unfortunately we ran into this situation in Yantian."" According to Peter Sands, chief shipping analyst at the industry organisation Bimco, the sector is used to responding to crises. ""On a global network scale, these states of emergency are a permanent situation right now,"" he explains. ""But the issue with Yantian is, we need more transparency and openness from the local authorities. And we aren't getting that, which means there is a lot of uncertainty in developing contingency plans."" The Suez blockage has prompted knock-on delays The hope within the industry is that the situation in Yantian will be resolved as rapidly as possible, although experts warn that when that happens, it will lead to a surge in shipments from the region, which could cause further bottlenecks elsewhere in the supply chain. ""Because the system is so overloaded, every time one of these things happens now, the system is already at breaking point, or past breaking point, so anything else just adds grist to the mill,"" explains James Baker, containers editor at shipping industry publication, Lloyd's List. For this reason he expects the disruption to continue for at least another 12 months, with consumers in Europe and North America continuing to face much longer waits than normal for their goods. For UK retailers, this raises the real prospect of a shortage of goods ahead of the Christmas shopping period. Even under normal circumstances, they begin to acquire seasonal stocks from China months in advance, with the process beginning in the late summer. ""One of the issues at the moment, which is aiding the congestion, is the fact that everyone knows that the lead times are really slow, so retailers are booking their Christmas goods already,"" says Mr Baker. ""Traditionally, the peak season for container shipping starts in the third quarter as everyone stocks up for the holiday season in the west, but this year we're just in a permanent peak season already, and heaven knows what's going to happen come August or September. It could get crazy. It's very hard to tell."" The situation could improve, he says. But, slightly tongue-in-cheek perhaps, he has some advice for consumers: ""If you want to get something for your family for Christmas, start shopping now.""

An update from number 10 now (no, we're not talking about Raheem Sterling)... The
Prime Minister's official spokesperson has said that Mr Boris Johnson was
shocked by Christian Eriksen's collapse in Denmark's Euro 2020 match against
Finland yesterday, and that his thoughts are with Eriksen and his
family. Downing Street say the Prime Minister is thankful for the ""quick
thinking actions"" of officials and paramedics, and believes the
""exemplary"" response of the players and the fans ""showed sport at
its best."" Phil McNultyBBC Sport chief football writer at Wembley The clamour for Jack Grealish to start has cut no ice with England manager Gareth Southgate - and he has once again shown his trust in Raheem Sterling. Sterling has not been at his best in recent months and has even been left out of the Manchester City side, but starts against Croatia. And it looks like Kieran Trippier, a reliable member of Southgate's old guard and another player he trusts implicitly, gets the nod at left-back. #bbcfootball Keith:Modric is playing mind games. Playing at home makes no difference. Switzerland and Austria hosted the 2008 Euro and both got knocked out. It's about who is the better side Some more breaking news for you now... Belgiumâs Timothy Castagne needs to have surgery on a double fracture of his eye socket and will miss the rest of the Euros. The Leicester City defender suffered the injury during a heavy mid-air collision with Daler Kuzyaev in the first half of Saturdayâs 3-0 win over Russia. The 25-year-old is expected to undergo the operation after the team return to Belgium on Sunday. Castagne had been chosen as Belgiumâs first choice right back ahead of Thomas Meunier. England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Modric has high hopes for this England side. The Real Madrid midfielder believes England are one of the favourites for Euro 2020. ""I rate them very highly,"" he added. ""For sure, they are one of the favourites for this tournament. That doesn't mean we are not going there to try to play a great game and try to get a result."" England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Croatia captain Luka Modric says Englandhave an unfair advantage at Euro 2020as all three of their Group D games are at Wembley. ""Everyone would say teams at home with a crowd, that there is a slight advantage. ""It's a shame there won't be a lot of Croatia supporters because we always feel their presence when they are there. ""But it is how it is. We need to focus on the pitch and don't get bothered about the environment,"" he said. England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Mark LawrensonBBC football expert I'm not expecting England to hit the ground running at Wembley but Croatia are not the force they were and Gareth Southgate's side should get something out of the game even if they are not at their best.

An update from number 10 now (no, we're not talking about Raheem Sterling)... The
Prime Minister's official spokesperson has said that Mr Boris Johnson was
shocked by Christian Eriksen's collapse in Denmark's Euro 2020 match against
Finland yesterday, and that his thoughts are with Eriksen and his
family. Downing Street say the Prime Minister is thankful for the ""quick
thinking actions"" of officials and paramedics, and believes the
""exemplary"" response of the players and the fans ""showed sport at
its best."" Phil McNultyBBC Sport chief football writer at Wembley The clamour for Jack Grealish to start has cut no ice with England manager Gareth Southgate - and he has once again shown his trust in Raheem Sterling. Sterling has not been at his best in recent months and has even been left out of the Manchester City side, but starts against Croatia. And it looks like Kieran Trippier, a reliable member of Southgate's old guard and another player he trusts implicitly, gets the nod at left-back. #bbcfootball Keith:Modric is playing mind games. Playing at home makes no difference. Switzerland and Austria hosted the 2008 Euro and both got knocked out. It's about who is the better side Some more breaking news for you now... Belgiumâs Timothy Castagne needs to have surgery on a double fracture of his eye socket and will miss the rest of the Euros. The Leicester City defender suffered the injury during a heavy mid-air collision with Daler Kuzyaev in the first half of Saturdayâs 3-0 win over Russia. The 25-year-old is expected to undergo the operation after the team return to Belgium on Sunday. Castagne had been chosen as Belgiumâs first choice right back ahead of Thomas Meunier. England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Modric has high hopes for this England side. The Real Madrid midfielder believes England are one of the favourites for Euro 2020. ""I rate them very highly,"" he added. ""For sure, they are one of the favourites for this tournament. That doesn't mean we are not going there to try to play a great game and try to get a result."" England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Croatia captain Luka Modric says Englandhave an unfair advantage at Euro 2020as all three of their Group D games are at Wembley. ""Everyone would say teams at home with a crowd, that there is a slight advantage. ""It's a shame there won't be a lot of Croatia supporters because we always feel their presence when they are there. ""But it is how it is. We need to focus on the pitch and don't get bothered about the environment,"" he said. England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Mark LawrensonBBC football expert I'm not expecting England to hit the ground running at Wembley but Croatia are not the force they were and Gareth Southgate's side should get something out of the game even if they are not at their best. Prediction:1-1 England v Croatia (14:00 BST) This current crop of England players are shortly not short of confidence. Chelsea defender Reece James believes Euro 2020 presents the ""best chance"" England have had in many years to win a tournament. This video can not be played Euro 2020: We have the squad to go all the way - James England v Croatia (14:00 BST) The Football Association has asked fansnot to boo England players when they take a kneebefore their game against Croatia later. Premier League players have knelt before matches for the past year as a protest against racism. But England players were booed when they did so intwo warm-up matches in Middlesbroughearlier this month. Some breaking news to bring you now... Manchester City defender Joao Cancelo has tested positive for Covid-19. He has been replaced in the Portugal squad by Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot, who spent last season on loan at AC Milan. Allow Twitter content?

"Macron's NI comment offensive, says Raab","This video can not be played ""Were you offended by President Macron's comments about Northern Ireland?"", asked the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Boris Johnson says he ""continuously"" makes the point that Northern Ireland is part of ""one great indivisible United Kingdom"" amid a row at the G7. Reports claim French President Emmanuel Macron said at the summit thatNorthern Ireland was not part of the UK,external. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the remark was ""offensive"" and that EU figures characterised Northern Ireland ""as somehow a separate country"". Mr Macron said he never questioned ""the integrity of the British territory"". Earlier, an Elysee source said the French leader was talking about ""geographical territory"" during the meeting, after Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron how he would feel if there were barriers to selling sausages from Toulouse in Paris. They added: ""The president wanted to stress that the situation was quite different and that it was not appropriate to make this kind of comparison."" This video can not be played French President Macron responds to the furore around his reported comments on Northern Ireland The row comes amid ongoing problems with the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. The policy was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement by ensuring a border would not be introduced on the island of Ireland. It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow many of the EU rules on trade. But as a result, it created a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, leading to additional checks on items moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. PM pledges to protect UK integrity amid EU row What is the sausage row about? EU warns UK over Irish Sea border goods checks So-called ""grace periods"" were introduced after the post-Brexit trade deal came into force, allowing goods to continue to move as normal while people adjusted to the new way of working. But as it stands, controls will be introduced from July on chilled meat products like sausages and mince - effectively banning them from entering Northern Ireland unless the UK agrees to match EU standards on its products. The UK has already unilaterally extended some grace periods, leading to legal action from the EU. But Ireland's Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin warned it would be ""very problematic"" if the UK did the same again, telling Sky News it would strain relations. He added: ""It's not about sausages per se, it really is about the fact that an agreement had been entered into not too long ago and if there's consistent, unilateral deviation from that agreement, that clearly undermines the broader relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is in nobody's interest."" This video can not be played Earlier, Dominic Raab said alleged comments by Emmanuel Macron on Northern Ireland were ""offensive"" Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the PM was offended by the alleged comments from the French president, Mr Johnson did not answer - instead saying it was ""the job of the government of the United Kingdom to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"". He also said Brexit had accounted for a ""vanishingly small proportion of our deliberations"" at the G7 summit. But pushed further by reporters about the French president's alleged remarks, Mr Johnson said he and the rest of the government ""make the point continuously that we are all part of one great indivisible United Kingdom"". Earlier, Mr Raab said the sentiment about Northern Ireland being separate from the rest of the UK had been expressed by EU figures for ""years"" and ""that is wrong"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""It is a failure to understand the facts, it is a failure to appreciate what speaking around Northern Ireland in those terms and approaching the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol in those terms does. ""It causes damage to businesses from both communities in Northern Ireland, creates deep consternation, and we wouldn't talk about Catalonia and Barcelona or Corsica in France in those ways."" But President Macron later appealed for ""calm"", saying: ""France has never allowed itself to question British sovereignty, the integrity of the British territory and the respect of the sovereignty.""And it's also true that Brexitâ¦ is the child of British sovereignty and has [created] thousands of hours of work for European leaders so we know very well what British sovereignty is."" He added: ""For a number of years after Brexit we established rules, a protocol agreement and also a commercial treaty for future relations. We just want them to be respected - seriously, calmly, professionally - that's all."" At international summits, it is generally a good rule to keep discussions about sausages confined to the barbecue on the beach. That the UK allowed its row with the EU - over post-Brexit trade across the Irish Sea - to overshadow the G7 raised eyebrows among diplomats. ""We can't understand why Boris is putting more petrol on the fire,"" one official told me. At his news conference, the prime minister sought to dampen the flames, refusing to echo Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said President Macron's suggestion that Northern Ireland was not part of the UK was ""offensive"". But the damage had already been done. Yes, the trade row was not part of the main G7 negotiations, but it was central to discussions in the margins. Even Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had raised the issue in his bilateral meeting with Mr Johnson, emphasising Canada's role in forging the Good Friday Agreement. So instead of using the congenial confines of a highly secure beach in south-west England to engender a bit of trust, both sides seem to have come away from Cornwall with hackles raised. This summit was supposed to be about showing how democracies around the world could co-operate better. That proved something of a challenge closer to home. Ahead of meetings at the G7 - attended by leaders of the EU, France, Germany and Italy - top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the bloc's patience was ""wearing thin"" with the UK, insisting it needed to follow the rules it agreed on the Northern Ireland Protocol. But during the summit, Mr Johnson said he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK. He told the BBC there was ""quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland [and] the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"" and he hoped the two sides would find ""pragmatic solutions"". Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Andrew Marr that the two sides needed to ""stop bickering"" and ""actually find a practical solution"". This video can not be played Labour's Emily Thornberry urges the UK government and the EU to ""stop bickering and find a practical solution"" Edwin Poots, the new leader of the DUP - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - also called the remark by President Macron offensive, saying the French leader ""doesn't understand the basics, let alone the finer details"".

Disruption to shipping could last until Christmas,"Yantian Port is experiencing acute congestion Disruption in the global container shipping industry shows no sign of being resolved quickly and could lead to shortages in the run-up to Christmas, say industry experts. An outbreak of Covid-19 in Guangdong province in southern China has caused acute congestion at the region's ports. As a result, shipments have been delayed, exacerbating tensions within global supply chains. And the knock-on effects could take many months to resolve. The problems in Guangdong are just the latest in a series of severe setbacks for the industry. Shipping firms have been struggling to cope with dramatic fluctuations in demand triggered by the pandemic, as well as the consequences from the recent blockage of the Suez Canal. The global nature of the sector, and the lack of spare capacity within it, means that problems in one region can have ripple effects around the world for several months. Yantian International Container Terminal is one of a number of ports in the Shenzhen region, which collectively form a vital gateway for exports from the Pearl River Delta, a major Chinese centre for manufacturing and technology. Since late May, the terminal has been operating at a fraction of its normal capacity, with operations restricted due to controlling the spread of Covid. This has led to severe congestion, with dozens of ships waiting outside the port for a berth to become available. The Ever Given blocked the Suez Canal in March causing a tailback of container ships ""One of the biggest ports in China has basically closed down for close to three weeks. They have some berths in operation, but nowhere near enough"", says Nils Haupt, communications director at the German shipping line Hapag-Lloyd. Over the past few days, shipping lines have been diverting vessels away from Yantian to other nearby terminals in the Delta area. But, according to Mr Haupt, that has been creating its own problems. ""You can use ports like Shekhou, you can use Nansha, you can use Hong Kong; but what we're seeing right now is that delays are piling up there as well,"" he says. The growing crisis in southern China is just the latest blow to hit the shipping industry, which has been suffering from acute disruption for more than a year. A dramatic slowdown in the early stages of the pandemic was followed by a frenzy of activity, as customers, unable to travel or socialise in their normal ways, ordered more consumer goods. This sudden shift in demand, from famine to feast, threw delicately balanced supply chains out of kilter. Ports in Europe and North America became clogged, with too many vessels arriving at the same time, while the supply of empty containers for new consignments dried up, because too many of them were sitting at quaysides around the world. Then came the blockage of the Suez Canal in March. The closure of one of the world's busiest shipping lanes delayed hundreds of ships. But when it reopened the sudden arrival of the delayed vessels triggered new congestion at European hubs such as Rotterdam and Antwerp. UK shoppers warned of summer products shortage The cost of the Suez Canal blockage ""We were just beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Mr Haupt. ""But then unfortunately we ran into this situation in Yantian."" According to Peter Sands, chief shipping analyst at the industry organisation Bimco, the sector is used to responding to crises. ""On a global network scale, these states of emergency are a permanent situation right now,"" he explains. ""But the issue with Yantian is, we need more transparency and openness from the local authorities. And we aren't getting that, which means there is a lot of uncertainty in developing contingency plans."" The Suez blockage has prompted knock-on delays The hope within the industry is that the situation in Yantian will be resolved as rapidly as possible, although experts warn that when that happens, it will lead to a surge in shipments from the region, which could cause further bottlenecks elsewhere in the supply chain. ""Because the system is so overloaded, every time one of these things happens now, the system is already at breaking point, or past breaking point, so anything else just adds grist to the mill,"" explains James Baker, containers editor at shipping industry publication, Lloyd's List. For this reason he expects the disruption to continue for at least another 12 months, with consumers in Europe and North America continuing to face much longer waits than normal for their goods. For UK retailers, this raises the real prospect of a shortage of goods ahead of the Christmas shopping period. Even under normal circumstances, they begin to acquire seasonal stocks from China months in advance, with the process beginning in the late summer. ""One of the issues at the moment, which is aiding the congestion, is the fact that everyone knows that the lead times are really slow, so retailers are booking their Christmas goods already,"" says Mr Baker. ""Traditionally, the peak season for container shipping starts in the third quarter as everyone stocks up for the holiday season in the west, but this year we're just in a permanent peak season already, and heaven knows what's going to happen come August or September. It could get crazy. It's very hard to tell."" The situation could improve, he says. But, slightly tongue-in-cheek perhaps, he has some advice for consumers: ""If you want to get something for your family for Christmas, start shopping now.""

Raab calls Macron's NI comment 'offensive'Reports claim the French president had said Northern Ireland was not a part of the UK.UK Politics,"This video can not be played ""Were you offended by President Macron's comments about Northern Ireland?"", asked the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Boris Johnson says he ""continuously"" makes the point that Northern Ireland is part of ""one great indivisible United Kingdom"" amid a row at the G7. Reports claim French President Emmanuel Macron said at the summit thatNorthern Ireland was not part of the UK,external. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the remark was ""offensive"" and that EU figures characterised Northern Ireland ""as somehow a separate country"". Mr Macron said he never questioned ""the integrity of the British territory"". Earlier, an Elysee source said the French leader was talking about ""geographical territory"" during the meeting, after Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron how he would feel if there were barriers to selling sausages from Toulouse in Paris. They added: ""The president wanted to stress that the situation was quite different and that it was not appropriate to make this kind of comparison."" This video can not be played French President Macron responds to the furore around his reported comments on Northern Ireland The row comes amid ongoing problems with the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. The policy was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement by ensuring a border would not be introduced on the island of Ireland. It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow many of the EU rules on trade. But as a result, it created a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, leading to additional checks on items moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. PM pledges to protect UK integrity amid EU row What is the sausage row about? EU warns UK over Irish Sea border goods checks So-called ""grace periods"" were introduced after the post-Brexit trade deal came into force, allowing goods to continue to move as normal while people adjusted to the new way of working. But as it stands, controls will be introduced from July on chilled meat products like sausages and mince - effectively banning them from entering Northern Ireland unless the UK agrees to match EU standards on its products. The UK has already unilaterally extended some grace periods, leading to legal action from the EU. But Ireland's Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin warned it would be ""very problematic"" if the UK did the same again, telling Sky News it would strain relations. He added: ""It's not about sausages per se, it really is about the fact that an agreement had been entered into not too long ago and if there's consistent, unilateral deviation from that agreement, that clearly undermines the broader relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is in nobody's interest."" This video can not be played Earlier, Dominic Raab said alleged comments by Emmanuel Macron on Northern Ireland were ""offensive"" Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the PM was offended by the alleged comments from the French president, Mr Johnson did not answer - instead saying it was ""the job of the government of the United Kingdom to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"". He also said Brexit had accounted for a ""vanishingly small proportion of our deliberations"" at the G7 summit. But pushed further by reporters about the French president's alleged remarks, Mr Johnson said he and the rest of the government ""make the point continuously that we are all part of one great indivisible United Kingdom"". Earlier, Mr Raab said the sentiment about Northern Ireland being separate from the rest of the UK had been expressed by EU figures for ""years"" and ""that is wrong"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""It is a failure to understand the facts, it is a failure to appreciate what speaking around Northern Ireland in those terms and approaching the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol in those terms does. ""It causes damage to businesses from both communities in Northern Ireland, creates deep consternation, and we wouldn't talk about Catalonia and Barcelona or Corsica in France in those ways."" But President Macron later appealed for ""calm"", saying: ""France has never allowed itself to question British sovereignty, the integrity of the British territory and the respect of the sovereignty.""And it's also true that Brexitâ¦ is the child of British sovereignty and has [created] thousands of hours of work for European leaders so we know very well what British sovereignty is."" He added: ""For a number of years after Brexit we established rules, a protocol agreement and also a commercial treaty for future relations. We just want them to be respected - seriously, calmly, professionally - that's all."" At international summits, it is generally a good rule to keep discussions about sausages confined to the barbecue on the beach. That the UK allowed its row with the EU - over post-Brexit trade across the Irish Sea - to overshadow the G7 raised eyebrows among diplomats. ""We can't understand why Boris is putting more petrol on the fire,"" one official told me. At his news conference, the prime minister sought to dampen the flames, refusing to echo Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said President Macron's suggestion that Northern Ireland was not part of the UK was ""offensive"". But the damage had already been done. Yes, the trade row was not part of the main G7 negotiations, but it was central to discussions in the margins. Even Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that he had raised the issue in his bilateral meeting with Mr Johnson, emphasising Canada's role in forging the Good Friday Agreement. So instead of using the congenial confines of a highly secure beach in south-west England to engender a bit of trust, both sides seem to have come away from Cornwall with hackles raised. This summit was supposed to be about showing how democracies around the world could co-operate better. That proved something of a challenge closer to home. Ahead of meetings at the G7 - attended by leaders of the EU, France, Germany and Italy - top EU official Maros Sefcovic said the bloc's patience was ""wearing thin"" with the UK, insisting it needed to follow the rules it agreed on the Northern Ireland Protocol. But during the summit, Mr Johnson said he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK. He told the BBC there was ""quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland [and] the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"" and he hoped the two sides would find ""pragmatic solutions"". Labour's shadow international trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Andrew Marr that the two sides needed to ""stop bickering"" and ""actually find a practical solution"". This video can not be played Labour's Emily Thornberry urges the UK government and the EU to ""stop bickering and find a practical solution"" Edwin Poots, the new leader of the DUP - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - also called the remark by President Macron offensive, saying the French leader ""doesn't understand the basics, let alone the finer details"". Mr Poots, who wants the protocol to be removed, added: ""This also exposes the ignorance which lies at the heart of the EU. They seem blind to the destruction the protocol has caused to the Belfast Agreement."" GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Live: NI row continues as G7 focus on climate targets But a source from the Elysee Palace said Mr Macron had ""recalled that the UK's exit from the EU had been a British decision and that they must now keep their word"" on implementing the protocol. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said he was ""not going to get drawn into the discussions the prime minister had with President Macron"".

An update from number 10 now (no, we're not talking about Raheem Sterling)... The
Prime Minister's official spokesperson has said that Mr Boris Johnson was
shocked by Christian Eriksen's collapse in Denmark's Euro 2020 match against
Finland yesterday, and that his thoughts are with Eriksen and his
family. Downing Street say the Prime Minister is thankful for the ""quick
thinking actions"" of officials and paramedics, and believes the
""exemplary"" response of the players and the fans ""showed sport at
its best."" Phil McNultyBBC Sport chief football writer at Wembley The clamour for Jack Grealish to start has cut no ice with England manager Gareth Southgate - and he has once again shown his trust in Raheem Sterling. Sterling has not been at his best in recent months and has even been left out of the Manchester City side, but starts against Croatia. And it looks like Kieran Trippier, a reliable member of Southgate's old guard and another player he trusts implicitly, gets the nod at left-back. #bbcfootball Keith:Modric is playing mind games. Playing at home makes no difference. Switzerland and Austria hosted the 2008 Euro and both got knocked out. It's about who is the better side Some more breaking news for you now... Belgiumâs Timothy Castagne needs to have surgery on a double fracture of his eye socket and will miss the rest of the Euros. The Leicester City defender suffered the injury during a heavy mid-air collision with Daler Kuzyaev in the first half of Saturdayâs 3-0 win over Russia. The 25-year-old is expected to undergo the operation after the team return to Belgium on Sunday. Castagne had been chosen as Belgiumâs first choice right back ahead of Thomas Meunier. England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Modric has high hopes for this England side. The Real Madrid midfielder believes England are one of the favourites for Euro 2020. ""I rate them very highly,"" he added. ""For sure, they are one of the favourites for this tournament. That doesn't mean we are not going there to try to play a great game and try to get a result."" England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Croatia captain Luka Modric says Englandhave an unfair advantage at Euro 2020as all three of their Group D games are at Wembley. ""Everyone would say teams at home with a crowd, that there is a slight advantage. ""It's a shame there won't be a lot of Croatia supporters because we always feel their presence when they are there. ""But it is how it is. We need to focus on the pitch and don't get bothered about the environment,"" he said. England v Croatia (14:00 BST) Mark LawrensonBBC football expert I'm not expecting England to hit the ground running at Wembley but Croatia are not the force they were and Gareth Southgate's side should get something out of the game even if they are not at their best.

Chelsea defender Reece James believes Euro 2020 presents the ""best chance"" England have had in many years to win a tournament.

Netanyahu faces end of rule in new government voteIsrael's long-term leader is set to be unseated by a coalition of parties which united against him.,"Mr Netanyahu (right) has held power for longer than any other Israeli leader Israel's parliament is debating the formation of a new government that would end 12 years of rule by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The prospective government - an unprecedented coalition of parties - has a razor-thin majority of one seat. If it is approved in a vote on Sunday, it would bring to an end years of political paralysis in which three elections resulted in stalemate. Right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett is poised to become PM. In a power-sharing deal, Mr Bennett, who heads the Yamina party, will hold office until September 2023, when he will hand over to Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, for a further two years. This video can not be played The coalition that could end ""King"" Bibi's 12-year reign Mr Netanyahu - Israel's longest-serving leader, who has dominated its political landscape for years - would remain head of the right-wing Likud party and become leader of the opposition. He has railed against the likely new government, calling it a ""dangerous coalition of fraud and surrender"" and has vowed to ""overthrow it very quickly"". Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's likely next PM? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Meanwhile, his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - allegations he denies - continues. Speaking in the first minutes of the debate, Mr Bennett thanked Mr Netanyahu for his years of service to Israel. And he said the new coalition would not allow Iran - Israel's bitter enemy - to acquire nuclear weapons. Mr Bennett was heckled by supporters of Mr Netanyahu in some of the other right-wing parties. For his part, Mr Netanyahu promised the opposition would have a ""strong and clear voice"" if he was ousted as PM. ""If it's our destiny to be in the opposition, we'll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government, and return to lead the country our way,"" he said. The new coalition is doing everything to avoid last-minute surprises here in the corridors of the Knesset. Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid are trying to keep the tone calm, despite the political convulsions their pact has unleashed. On Saturday night, the prime minister-designate urged protesters who had gathered outside Mr Netanyahu's home to avoid ""provocations"". And he's continuously held fire despite the flak from Mr Netanyahu, who accuses him of fraud and creating a government of surrender. In return, as he prepares for the vote to finally push his old boss from power, Mr Bennett will reportedly thank Mr Netanyahu for his service. He has already done the deed, so now the words are less important. Mr Netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021. He called an election in April 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government. Two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively. The third election resulted in a government of national unity where Mr Netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader Benny Gantz. But the arrangement collapsed in December, triggering a fourth election. The coalition said it acted to avoid yet another election Although Likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, Mr Netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to Mr Lapid, whose party had emerged as the second largest. Opposition to Mr Netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to Likud, including Yamina. Although Yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament. After weeks of negotiations, Mr Lapid brought Yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove Mr Netanyahu from office. The agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 June, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing Mr Netanyahu's fate. In appearance, Mr Bennett's government would be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel's 73-year history. The alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent Arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, Raam. It is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers. The inclusion of Raam and left-wing non-Arab Israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as Israeli policies towards Palestinians - Yamina and another right-wing party, New Hope, are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for instance. There could also be difficulties over social policies - while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, Raam, an Islamist party, is against this. In addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than Yamina - a national-religious party - will likely allow. Mr Bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters. ""Nobody will have to give up their ideology,"" he recently said, ""but all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams... We'll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot."" Netanyahu seeks block on deal to oust him The coalition that could end 'King' Bibi's 12-year reign.

The updates today have been brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Hugo Bachega, Charley Adams, Jonathan Morris, Francesca Gillett, Jack Hunter, Rob Corp, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. The G7 summit ended with another busy day of news. Here are the latest headlines:  Protests continued throughout Sunday too   You can see some of the best pictures from the packed weekend in Cornwallhere This video can not be played G7: Macron responds to Northern Ireland 'offensive' comments Earlier, Emmanuel Macron responded to the furore around his reported comments on Northern Ireland. Reports claimed the French president said at the summit thatNorthern Ireland was not part of the UK,external- a remark Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said was ""offensive"". The Queen and her guests were photographed in Windsor Castle's Grand Corridor before tea US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden are meeting with the Queenat Windsor Castle. This is not the first time the Queen has met Mr Biden. As well as at the G7 on Friday, the Queen also met him in 1982 when he was the senator for Delaware. Here are some photographs of the visit so far. The couple landed on Marine One shortly before 17:00 BST The US national anthem was played in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle Mr Biden was pictured inspecting a Guard of Honour Like the rest of the weekend, the weather was beautiful for the visit Protesters travelled to Cornwall to urge G7 leaders to act on Tigray Among other pledges in the G7 communique is a call for an ""immediate cessation of hostilities"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region amid deep concern from leaders. Fighting broke out in November 2020 between government forces against local rebels. The G7 called for unimpeded access for aid workers to Tigray, where the UN says some 350,000 people are living in famine conditions. The statement came after protests about the Tigray situation were held in Cornwall yesterday. Andrew SegalBBC South West A sculpture of the G7 leaders,based on Mount Rushmore and made of electronic waste, was still proving popular on the last day of the leadersâ summit in Cornwall. Hundreds of people were still taking in âMount Recyclemore"", erected near Hayle last week, on Sunday. The sculpture, by Joe Rush, bids to highlight the damage caused by the disposal of electronic devices. As the sun set on Saturday at the G7, master of the barbecue Simon Stallards swung into action with an alfresco feast for the distinguished guests. But this was no ordinary barbecue on the beach - Simon has made a name for himself with the Hidden Hut beachside cafe at Porthcurnick in Cornwall. And on the menu for the G7 leaders, guests and their partners was a mouth-watering menu of scallops, crab claws and mackerel with a main course of steak, lobster, chips and purple sprouting broccoli and salt-baked beetroot. For pudding it was a ""Beach Hut Sundae"". All washed down with Cornish sparkling wine, German riesling, Australian shiraz, Cornish beer and Hedge Row Fizz cocktails. As if that wasn't enough, it was then time for baked brie, hot buttered rum and toasted marshmallows around fire pits. No wonder Boris Johnson needed adip in the sea this morning. Devon and Cornwall Police say a number of protests are causing disruption near where the G7 summit has been held in Cornwall. Officers are dealing with aroadblock set up by protesters near Tempest roundabout,externalin St Erth, Hayle, and another in St Ives. Anthony ReubenBBC News The US national anthem was played after the Bidens arrived Is this the oldest meeting of
heads of state? President Biden having tea with
the Queen has got to be a contender for the the highest ages of two meeting
heads of state. The two of them have a combined age of 173 years. (The Queen at 95 and President Biden at 78) Thatâs impressive but it turns
out itâs not even the record for Her Majesty. On 3 April 2014, the Queen had
lunch with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.
They had a combined age of 175 years. Thatâs the best
we can come up with. Can anyone beat it? The Queen has greeted US President Joe Biden and his wife Jill for the first time at Windsor Castle. They met on Friday night at the G7 summit - but now they are in the castle's quadrangle. The US national anthem has been played, followed by a Guard of Honour and then the band played traditional British and American marches. Officials inspect a container of AstraZeneca vaccines donated by the USA through the WHO's Covax programme Oxfam says the G7 summit in Cornwall ""completely failed to meet the challenges of our times"". ""Never in the history of the G7 has there been a bigger
gap between their actions and the needs of the world. In the face of these
challenges the G7 have chosen to cook the books on vaccines and continue to
cook the planet,"" says Max Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam. In a lengthy list of ""failures"", the charity singles out Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel as caring ""more about protecting the monopolies and patents of
pharmaceutical giants"" than protecting millions in poorer nations from the threat of Covid. ""We need all G7 nations to follow the lead of the US,
France and over 100 other nations in backing a waiver on intellectual property."" Oxfam describes the promise of one billion vaccine doses as ""a drop in the bucket"", adding ""but they didn't even manage
that"". The charity calls the G7's pledge on climate change a missed opportunity to make new pledges of climate finance ""ahead of landmark climate talks in Glasgow"" - at November's COP26. ""We need to see a Herculean effort to cut emissions
further and faster, and to hit the long-overdue target of $100 billion per year
in climate finance,"" it says.  Johnny O'SheaBBC News Online Earlier this afternoon there was a festival feel in St Ives. There was a band, Psychadelephant, playing on a stage set up on the beach in the harbour, with about 30 people dancing along. Many more were taking a more passive approach and watching from the sand. The giant globe that was in Falmouth on Saturday made its way here and there were a number of banners that had messages, including âone people one planetâ and âClimate emergency - sound the alarmâ. We've heard from several of the G7 leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also been giving his closing remarks at the end of the summit. ""This pandemic isn't over yet, so through the G7 we are stepping up - again,"" he says about vaccination commitments, adding that Canada will give 100 million doses as part of the latest drive. He also speaks about other pledges made at the summit, including climate change and education access. On Twitter, he says he met with Angela Merkel on the margins of the summit yesterday. Trudeau pays tribute to her ""friendship"" over the years - with the leader set to leave office in September after more than 15 years as German chancellor. Allow Twitter content?

Johnny O'SheaBBC News Online The only road out of St Ives during the G7 summit is currently blocked by XR protesters. About 25 protesters have been banging drums and singing, and are sitting across a pedestrian crossing. It started at about 15:00. No-one has been arrested, but there are about 40 police officers  present. The weekend's G7 summit in Cornwall has finished, and the leaders have now published a 25-page communique - a document outlining what has been agreed. They summed up their ""shared agenda"" into six key points, which are:,external Reality Check French President Emmanuel Macron
said more needs to be done to help poorer countries produce their own Covid
vaccines. He said that 20% of âthe
vaccination needâ is in Africa but it only has 1% of the production. Africa
has a population of about 1.3 billion, which is about 17% of the worldâs
population, so the 20% figure is not far off. A report from the consultants McKinsey,externalsays Africa imports 99% of its
vaccines, which presumably means it manufactures 1% itself. The World Health Organizationsays there are fewer than 10 vaccine manufacturers on the continent,external, located in
five countries: Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. It said they
were all relatively small-scale. You can read more about the slow pace of vaccination in Africa here.  A number of the leaders have been speaking since the G7 summit ended - and some of the campaigners who have been in the area for the summit have been aiming to have their say too. Campaigners against proposed legislation on crime and justice held a protest in Falmouth. They were demonstrating against thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Billas well as social inequality in Cornwall where the G7 leaders have been meeting. The Bill includes major government proposals on crime and justice, including changes to protests legislation in England and Wales. One speaker called it ""draconian and oppressive"" and said it would ""shift the course of our democracy from progression to repression"", to which the crowd booed. About 500 people gathered outside the media centre in Falmouth, holding up posters, placards and a banner which read âResist anti trespass. Kill the billâ. Some of the signs say âIs this a serious annoyance?â, anod to the language which has been put forward in the prospective legislation. More than 20 police officers lined the entrance of the G7 media centre to monitor the peaceful protest. Reality Check Asked about foreign aid, Boris
Johnson said that in spite of the pandemic, âweâre spending Â£10bn supporting
the poorest and neediest around the worldâ¦ weâre still the second biggest aid
contributor in the G7â. The
UKâs foreign aid spending in 2020 was Â£14.5bn, which was 0.7% of GNI, a measure
of the size of the economy. That figure of 0.7% made it thesecond biggest contributor in the G7 behind Germany,external. This year, the UK plans to cut its
contributions to 0.5% of GNI, which means that spending is likely to be around
Â£10bn. We
cannot yet judge whether the UK will remain the second biggest spender on aid â
in terms of the percentage of GNI - in 2021. But
it is likely to be overtaken by France â it spent 0.53% of GNI in 2020 and has
committed to increase spending to 0.7% by 2025. In
terms of the amount of cash spent (as opposed to the proportion of the economy)
the UK was thethird biggest donor in the G7 last year behind the US and Germany,external.  A woman is vaccinated in Ghana, which has received jabs via the Covax scheme Unicef has responded to the pledge by the G7 countries to donate one billion vaccine doses to poorer countries - but says the jabs need to be given sooner. The charity has already warned,before the G7 summit, that there needs to be a steady supply throughout the year rather than countries donating their leftover doses all at the same time in the autumn and winter. If that happens, Unicef says, then millions of doses could be wasted as poorer countries won't have the resources to jab everyone before the doses expire. Boris Johnson didn't specify when exactly the one billion doses - including 100 million from the UK - will be given. Unicef says it welcomes the pledge but says some dose donations will be available immediately - which it was ""particularly pleased"" about. ""However, time is still of the
critical essence,"" says the charity in a statement. âSeveral
forecasts suggest that G7 countries will have enough vaccine supplies to donate one billion doses by as early as the end of 2021."" The charity calls for a clear plan and timeline of when doses will be available, and a ""rapid
acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months"". By Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent Reality Check At the end of a summit in which climate change has been a big issue,
Boris Johnson says âthe G7 countries account for 20% of global carbon
emissions"". There are slightly different ways to calculate percentage shares
of emissions - and it's also much more common to see figures cited for all
greenhouse gases and not just carbon dioxide on its own. A UN-backed report suggests the figure for all greenhouse gases from the G7 is about 25%,external. But most importantly, itâs worth pointing out that the population
of G7 countries is only about 10% of the global total. It stands to reason that rich countries pollute far more than
poorer ones per person, because people consume more when they have higher
disposal incomes. China produces more carbon emissions than the whole G7, but it has
been doing so for a shorter amount of time, and it has a much larger
population. Thatâs one of the reasons why the G7 accepts a special
responsibility for taking a lead on climate change. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

cook the planet,"" says Max Lawson, head of inequality policy at Oxfam. In a lengthy list of ""failures"", the charity singles out Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel as caring ""more about protecting the monopolies and patents of
pharmaceutical giants"" than protecting millions in poorer nations from the threat of Covid. ""We need all G7 nations to follow the lead of the US,
France and over 100 other nations in backing a waiver on intellectual property."" Oxfam describes the promise of one billion vaccine doses as ""a drop in the bucket"", adding ""but they didn't even manage
that"". The charity calls the G7's pledge on climate change a missed opportunity to make new pledges of climate finance ""ahead of landmark climate talks in Glasgow"" - at November's COP26. ""We need to see a Herculean effort to cut emissions
further and faster, and to hit the long-overdue target of $100 billion per year
in climate finance,"" it says.  Johnny O'SheaBBC News Online Earlier this afternoon there was a festival feel in St Ives. There was a band, Psychadelephant, playing on a stage set up on the beach in the harbour, with about 30 people dancing along. Many more were taking a more passive approach and watching from the sand. The giant globe that was in Falmouth on Saturday made its way here and there were a number of banners that had messages, including âone people one planetâ and âClimate emergency - sound the alarmâ. We've heard from several of the G7 leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also been giving his closing remarks at the end of the summit. ""This pandemic isn't over yet, so through the G7 we are stepping up - again,"" he says about vaccination commitments, adding that Canada will give 100 million doses as part of the latest drive. He also speaks about other pledges made at the summit, including climate change and education access. On Twitter, he says he met with Angela Merkel on the margins of the summit yesterday. Trudeau pays tribute to her ""friendship"" over the years - with the leader set to leave office in September after more than 15 years as German chancellor. Allow Twitter content?

Johnny O'SheaBBC News Online The only road out of St Ives during the G7 summit is currently blocked by XR protesters. About 25 protesters have been banging drums and singing, and are sitting across a pedestrian crossing. It started at about 15:00. No-one has been arrested, but there are about 40 police officers  present. The weekend's G7 summit in Cornwall has finished, and the leaders have now published a 25-page communique - a document outlining what has been agreed. They summed up their ""shared agenda"" into six key points, which are:,external Reality Check French President Emmanuel Macron
said more needs to be done to help poorer countries produce their own Covid
vaccines. He said that 20% of âthe
vaccination needâ is in Africa but it only has 1% of the production. Africa
has a population of about 1.3 billion, which is about 17% of the worldâs
population, so the 20% figure is not far off. A report from the consultants McKinsey,externalsays Africa imports 99% of its
vaccines, which presumably means it manufactures 1% itself. The World Health Organizationsays there are fewer than 10 vaccine manufacturers on the continent,external, located in
five countries: Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. It said they
were all relatively small-scale. You can read more about the slow pace of vaccination in Africa here.  A number of the leaders have been speaking since the G7 summit ended - and some of the campaigners who have been in the area for the summit have been aiming to have their say too. Campaigners against proposed legislation on crime and justice held a protest in Falmouth. They were demonstrating against thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Billas well as social inequality in Cornwall where the G7 leaders have been meeting. The Bill includes major government proposals on crime and justice, including changes to protests legislation in England and Wales. One speaker called it ""draconian and oppressive"" and said it would ""shift the course of our democracy from progression to repression"", to which the crowd booed. About 500 people gathered outside the media centre in Falmouth, holding up posters, placards and a banner which read âResist anti trespass. Kill the billâ. Some of the signs say âIs this a serious annoyance?â, anod to the language which has been put forward in the prospective legislation. More than 20 police officers lined the entrance of the G7 media centre to monitor the peaceful protest. Reality Check Asked about foreign aid, Boris
Johnson said that in spite of the pandemic, âweâre spending Â£10bn supporting
the poorest and neediest around the worldâ¦ weâre still the second biggest aid
contributor in the G7â. The
UKâs foreign aid spending in 2020 was Â£14.5bn, which was 0.7% of GNI, a measure
of the size of the economy. That figure of 0.7% made it thesecond biggest contributor in the G7 behind Germany,external. This year, the UK plans to cut its
contributions to 0.5% of GNI, which means that spending is likely to be around
Â£10bn. We
cannot yet judge whether the UK will remain the second biggest spender on aid â
in terms of the percentage of GNI - in 2021. But
it is likely to be overtaken by France â it spent 0.53% of GNI in 2020 and has
committed to increase spending to 0.7% by 2025. In
terms of the amount of cash spent (as opposed to the proportion of the economy)
the UK was thethird biggest donor in the G7 last year behind the US and Germany,external.  A woman is vaccinated in Ghana, which has received jabs via the Covax scheme Unicef has responded to the pledge by the G7 countries to donate one billion vaccine doses to poorer countries - but says the jabs need to be given sooner. The charity has already warned,before the G7 summit, that there needs to be a steady supply throughout the year rather than countries donating their leftover doses all at the same time in the autumn and winter. If that happens, Unicef says, then millions of doses could be wasted as poorer countries won't have the resources to jab everyone before the doses expire. Boris Johnson didn't specify when exactly the one billion doses - including 100 million from the UK - will be given. Unicef says it welcomes the pledge but says some dose donations will be available immediately - which it was ""particularly pleased"" about. ""However, time is still of the
critical essence,"" says the charity in a statement. âSeveral
forecasts suggest that G7 countries will have enough vaccine supplies to donate one billion doses by as early as the end of 2021."" The charity calls for a clear plan and timeline of when doses will be available, and a ""rapid
acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months"". By Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent Reality Check At the end of a summit in which climate change has been a big issue,
Boris Johnson says âthe G7 countries account for 20% of global carbon
emissions"". There are slightly different ways to calculate percentage shares
of emissions - and it's also much more common to see figures cited for all
greenhouse gases and not just carbon dioxide on its own. A UN-backed report suggests the figure for all greenhouse gases from the G7 is about 25%,external. But most importantly, itâs worth pointing out that the population
of G7 countries is only about 10% of the global total. It stands to reason that rich countries pollute far more than
poorer ones per person, because people consume more when they have higher
disposal incomes. China produces more carbon emissions than the whole G7, but it has
been doing so for a shorter amount of time, and it has a much larger
population. Thatâs one of the reasons why the G7 accepts a special
responsibility for taking a lead on climate change. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"PM promises caution over 21 June lockdown endBoris Johnson says it is vital any changes are ""irreversible"", amid rising Delta variant cases.UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In order to have a irreversible road map you got to be cautious"" Boris Johnson has said the government must ""be cautious"" as it decides whether to end all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. Cases are rising as the Delta variant spreads, with details of the next step on the ""roadmap"" due on Monday. The prime minister told the BBC it was important any easing of restrictions was ""irreversible"" and warned that hospital admissions were increasing. The BBC has been told adelay of up to four weeksis being considered. Senior medical advisers have urged a brake to the final easing of lockdown restrictions, which, if it went ahead in full, would mean removing limits on social contact and the number of people allowed into homes. Pubs, clubs, theatres and cinemas would also be allowed to operate without capacity limits, with sports events taking place in full stadiums, nightclubs reopening and limits of the number of wedding guests going. Lockdown lifting - the four key numbers Unvaccinated most at risk from Delta variant What do under 30s need to know about the vaccine? Vaccine passports considered for use at big events Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether all restrictions would now be lifted, Mr Johnson said people would have to wait until Monday to find out. ""What I can certainly say is we are looking at the data, continuing to do that, but what you can certainly take isâ¦ the roadmap was always cautious but irreversible, and in order to have an irreversible roadmap, we've got to be cautious."" A further 7,738 lab-confirmed cases of the virus were reported in the UK on Saturday, and a further 12 people recorded to have died within 28 days of a positive test. Infections continue to rise, with 50% more cases reported in the past seven days than the previous seven. For weeks we've practised modern day kremlinogy - getting our hopes up for an end of restrictions in England at the summer solstice whenever the PM sounds upbeat, then feeling more downhearted when government minister after minister uses the C word: caution. We will get a decision on Monday but it seems clear from Boris Johnson's use of the words ""caution"" and ""irreversible"" in his BBC interview that a delay is inevitable. In order to make his roadmap irreversible, the PM is likely to heed scientific advisers' advice to give himself some more breathing space while the vaccination programme rolls out further. Mr Johnson's mantra has been ""data not dates"" but in truth there may just not be enough data on the extent to which vaccinations are breaking the link between infection and hospitalisation for him to sweep away all remaining restrictions. But sources say the government is looking at a range of options for 21 June. So it's possible that - for example - a four week delay is reviewed after a fortnight when more data is available. Or that some restrictions are eased while most social distancing measures stay in place. The anxious wait for a decision is almost over but it could be that what some describe as 'Freedom Day' - like the horizon - moves further away the closer we appear to get. Answering questions at the G7 summit in Cornwall earlier, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance would not be drawn on the decision about 21 June, but said the ""Delta variant [is] increasing in the UK"". He said there were lessons from the pandemic that could continue to apply in everyday life - such as self-isolating after symptoms of any infectious disease, the importance of ventilation, and hand hygiene. The Delta variant, first identified in India, now accounts for nine in 10 UK coronavirus cases. It is roughly 60% more transmissible than the Alpha - or Kent - variant, Public Health England data suggests. The government put India on the ""red list"" of places to which travel is banned on 23 April, two weeks later than Pakistan and Bangladesh, which had fewer cases per million at the time. Why was India not on the red list sooner? The prime minister defending the timing of the decision, saying: ""Pakistan had about 13 times as many variants of concern or variants of interest as as India at that stage."" ""Yet we put India on the red list on 23 April, which was days before it was even identified as a variant under investigation."" Mr Johnson, who is currently hosting the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, said the government had made ""a massive progress with the vaccination programme"". ""It's done a huge amount of good - but you have got to be cautious to be irreversible,"" he added. ""Again you have hospitalisations up, you've got cases up. There are grounds for caution."" On Friday, the British Medical Associationjoined public health officialsin calling for a delay to ending restrictions. The government said in February that England's restrictions would only be lifted if: the vaccine rollout continues successfully evidence shows vaccines effectively reduce hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS its assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern More than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.9% of the adult population. The R number in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others. The easing of restrictions is happening at different speeds across the other nations of the UK with 21 June being given asan ""indicative date"" for a number of changes,externalin Northern Ireland, including 10 people from two households being allowed to meet in private homes, up to 15 people being able to meet outdoors in a garden and theatres and concerts able to restart. Lockdown measures in Wales,externalwill be reviewed on 21 June, while the whole of Scotland is due tomove to level zeroon 28 June - but the prevalence of the Delta variant may delay that.

"Belgium's Lukaku in goal tribute to EriksenRomelu Lukaku praises Inter Milan team-mate Christian Eriksen, who collapsed, after Belgium beat Russia 3-0.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Lukaku pays tribute to Eriksen after scoring against Russia Uefa Euro 2020 on the BBC Dates:11 June-11 July.Venues:Amsterdam, Baku, Bucharest, Budapest, Copenhagen, Glasgow, London, Munich, Rome, Seville, St Petersburg.Coverage:Live on BBC TV, BBC Radio 5 Live, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.Click here for more details Romelu Lukaku paid tribute to his Inter Milan team-mate Christian Eriksen after scoring against Russia to help world number one side Belgium start Euro 2020 with a win. Denmark midfielder Eriksen collapsed on the pitch earlier on Saturday in the Group B game with Finland and received emergency treatment on the field. There was some doubt as to whether Belgium's game with Russia - Denmark's group rivals - in St Petersburg would go ahead as scheduled because of events in Copenhagen before it was given the all-clear after the Danish Football Associationrevealed Eriksen was ""awake"" in hospital. Lukaku opened the scoring after pouncing on a mistake by Andrey Semenov and celebrated his goal by shouting ""Chris, Chris, I love you"" in front of a television camera. After the game, the former Manchester United forward said he cried when he heard what had happened to Eriksen. ""I was scared. You live strong moments together,"" he told ITV. ""I spent more time with him than with my family. ""It was difficult to play the game. I hope he is healthy and I dedicate this performance to him."" This video can not be played Lukaku and Meunier goals seal Belgium win against Russia After Lukaku's opener, Roberto Martinez's side added a second before half-time after substitute Thomas Meunier - an early replacement for injured Leicester defender Timothy Castagne - slotted home when Anton Shunin failed to hold a cross. In-form Lukaku sealed a comfortable win by scoring his team's third goal with a composed finish in the closing stages. The victory put Belgium, one of the fancied teams at Euro 2020, top of the group, level on points with Finland,who beat Denmarkin a game which was suspended following Eriksen's collapse before being re-started. Relive the action from St Petersburg, plus reaction Injured De Bruyne out of Belgium opener How can I watch Euro 2020 matches? With a number of Eriksen's current and former team-mates in the Belgium side, Martinez was concerned about the impact events in Denmark had on his players. As well as Lukaku, who along with Eriksen helpedInter Milan win Serie A in 2020-21for the first time since 2009-10, Belgium's side included the midfielder's former Tottenham team-mates Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen. Speaking to ITV before the match, the former Everton boss said: ""It was a real shock. We have team-mates in that dressing and players who have shared a lot of time with Eriksen. ""We hope he has a full speed of recovery."" This video can not be played 'I cried a lot' - Lukaku gives his thoughts on Eriksen's recovery To their credit, Belgium silenced the home fans in the 26,264 crowd in St Petersburg with a thoroughly professional performance. Without Kevin de Bruyne, still nursing afractured nose and eye sockethe suffered in Manchester City's Champions League final defeat against Chelsea, the Red Devils controlled the match. It remains to be seen whether they possess the steel required to win a major tournament for the first time. But having scored 40 goals in qualifying - more than any other side - Belgium started this tournament in style as Lukaku continued the form which saw him score 24 to help fire Inter to the title. There was even an a substitute appearance by Eden Hazard but tougher tests lie ahead which will prove whether they are a side approaching the peak of its powers.
