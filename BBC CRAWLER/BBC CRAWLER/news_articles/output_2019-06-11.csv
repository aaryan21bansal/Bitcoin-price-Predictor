Government tells Whirlpool to recall dryers,"The government is to issue an ""unprecedented"" recall notice of up to 500,000 Whirlpool tumble dryers which pose a fire safety risk. It comes four years after Whirlpool issued a warning after it found its Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit dryers had a fault which needed fixing. The fault was blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, according to the government. Whirlpool said safety was its ""number one priority"". It urged anyone still owning an affected dryer to contact the company immediately on0800 151 0905. A spokeswoman added: ""In the meantime, anyone with an affected dryer that has not been modified should unplug it and not use it until the modification has been completed."" An estimated 5.3 million dryers were sold in the UK, but it is thought up to 500,000 could still be in use. Last year, the BBC's Watchdog Live consumer programme uncovered cases in which machines had caught fire even after being fixed. Whirlpool 'must step up fire-risk warnings' Safety flaws 'exposed by danger dryers' Fresh fears over danger tumble dryers And in April, the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) published a report, urging Whirlpool to improve its risk management, and""reach affected consumers in more creative ways""to minimise the risk of faulty machines still being in people's homes. Business minister Kelly Tolhurst told the Commons that the recall notice was ""unprecedented action"". She was responding to Conservative minister Andrew Griffiths, who told MPs that he was still concerned about whether people still had ""unsafe products"" in their homes. Mark Studley said the dryer caught fire in a room in which his children, then aged two and four, regularly used to play Mark Studley, 40, said his family came home one day in July last year to find their house ""full of smoke"" after their Whirlpool tumble dryer caught fire. He said the dryer - which was stored near his children's play room - ""could have killed"" them if it had caught ablaze overnight. Mr Studley, from Bridgwater in Somerset, told the BBC: ""The fire report states that it's an internal wiring fault in the machine, and all of this was caused - approximately Â£8,000 worth of damage - when the machine was turned off. ""If this had happened 12 hours earlier or later than it did, myself and my family risked death as it would've been in the early hours and we would've been asleep."" Rachel Reeves, Labour chairwoman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the move was ""long overdue"". ""Finally, over a year since we called for a recall of defective machines and 18 months since the Beis Committee reported on Whirlpool's inadequate response to safety flaws, the government is at last showing some teeth,"" she said. This video can not be played Are tumble dryers still a fire risk? David Chaplin, a spokesman for consumer group Which? said there were still ""serious questions"" about the 500,000 unmodified machines that ""Whirlpool has already struggled to locate"". He said: ""People's lives have been put at risk for far too long, so it's a hugely significant step that these machines are set to be recalled. ""The government must urgently explain what it is going to do about the millions of modified machines still in people's homes, following serious concerns that have been raised by people who have experienced fires, smoke and burning despite the so-called fix."" A Whirlpool Corporation spokeswoman said: ""We remain committed to resolving any affected tumble dryers that have not yet been modified. ""To this end, we are in ongoing discussions with the Office for Product Safety and Standards to agree additional measures we have proposed to reach consumers who have not yet engaged with this safety programme. ""We have co-operated with OPSS throughout its recent review of the programme and welcome its findings that consumers whose tumble dryers have been modified can continue to use them safely.""

"Leadership rivals split over Brexit deadlineAndrea Leadsom says the UK must leave in October, but Mark Harper and Rory Stewart demand ""realism"".UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom: ""Labour governments always destroy incentives to work hard and prosper"" Leaving the EU by the end of October is a ""hard red line"" and will happen in ""all circumstances"", Andrea Leadsom has said in her pitch for leadership. The ex-Commons leader said she had a plan for a ""managed exit"", adding that Parliament could ""not stop us leaving"". But her rival Mark Harper said it was ""not possible"" to leave by 31 October, and Rory Stewart said talk of a better deal on the table was a ""fairy story"". Ten Conservative candidates are in the race to be leader - and the next PM. The deadline for Brexit was pushed back to October after MPs rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with Brussels three times. Where do the candidates stand on Brexit? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? Latest updates: The race for Number 10 The European Union has repeatedly said the agreement will not be re-opened, and on Tuesday, president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that once again. ""This is not a treaty between Theresa May and Juncker, this is a treaty between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he told a Politico event in Brussels. ""It has to be respected by whomsoever will be the next British prime minister."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saidit was a ""terrible political miscalculation"" for UK politicians to believe they can get a better deal. This video can not be played Rory Stewart: We have a choice between fairy stories and realism ""In all circumstances we are leaving the European Union on 31 October,"" Mrs Leadsom told her official campaign launch. ""Our country and our party cannot afford any more indecisiveness."" The Brexiteer MP set out her plan for what she calls a ""managed exit"" from the EU, which includes striking a ""temporary trade agreement"" and a plan to negotiate contingency arrangements with Brussels over the summer recess. She said these could be discussed at a summit with the new incoming EU commissioners and heads of government in September. This video can not be played Mark Harper says the UK needs more time to sort a Brexit deal But at his official campaign launch, Mr Harper - an outsider in the race - said it was ""not possible or credible"" to leave on the terms of a new deal by the existing deadline of 31 October. Renegotiating and getting a deal past MPs would take longer, he said. He said there could be a majority in the Commons to leave without a deal, but only if ministers demonstrated they had ""strained every sinew"" to get a new one. Raab reaching over 55s on Facebook Leadsom would 'never say never' to indyref2 Meanwhile, Health Secretary Mr Hancock - who is also competing for the top job - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme his plan was ""eminently deliverable"" by 31 October, as the EU was open to changingthe political declaration part of the agreement. ""We need to solve Brexit and we cannot do it by threatening no deal,"" he said, adding: ""Parliament will not allow a no-deal Brexit to happen."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid reiterated that although he wanted a revised deal, ""if we got to end of October and the choice was between no deal or no Brexit, I'd pick no deal."" Later in the day, launching his campaign in a circus tent in London, Rory Stewart - another outsider - said he wanted to ""take the politics out"" of the situation and find a way to get Mrs May's deal through Parliament. He said he would ramp up pressure on MPs to back it by promising that otherwise, he would convene a ""grand jury"" of citizens to make recommendations on how to proceed which politicians would have to stick to. Vowing to hold the UK together and reconcile ""extreme Remain and extreme Brexit"" arguments, he added: ""My project is about one thing - it is about moderation and compromise."" At her official launch, Mrs Leadsom introduced several policies away from Brexit, including using overseas development aid to help poorer countries to decarbonise and helping young people to save for a house deposit with a new scheme. When questioned on taxes -prompted by Boris Johnson's pledge to cut income taxfor those who earn more than Â£50,000 a year - she said she believed in low taxes. But tax reform could not get through a hung Parliament, so that ""needs to wait"". Taking a swipe at Mr Johnson's idea, Mr Harper said he would focus his tax cuts ""at the lower end of the spectrum"", adding: ""I don't think we should be promising more money to higher rate taxpayers."" He also said the lack of a majority meant certain things would not be deliverable and as Brexit showed, it was ""toxic"" to make promises and not fulfil them. The winner of the leadership contest will become next Conservative leader and prime minister. They're due to be in place by the week beginning 22 July. Find out about all the candidates BBC to host Tory leader TV debates Mr Javid, who launches his campaign on Wednesday,released a campaign video,externalwhich BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described as the first big attempt by a candidate to communicate a personal story, introducing viewers to his family and background. He also told the Evening Standard,externalhe was ""very open minded"" about having different immigration rules for regions such as London after Brexit, and could scrap Mrs May's policy that EU migrants should earn at least Â£30,000 to be considered for admission. Mr Johnson - accused by Michael Gove and other candidates of ""hiding in his bunker"" because he is yet to a do a major event or TV interview - is also launching his campaign on Wednesday. It's day two of the official campaign to be the next prime minister. Andrea Leadsom cheerily launched her campaign, promising she would never utter the phrase ""as a mother"" that did for her chances last time. As promised, the former chief whip Mark Harper was jacket off, sleeves rolled up, answering any question that journalists were willing to put. That included - because the early stages of this campaign are this surreal - predicting in a fight between a lion and a bear that the lion, patriotically, would win. (yes, you read that right). And TV presenter Lorraine Kelly was back - this time with a slapdown of the whole lot of the political class. But the hard reality bites today too.Labour has just announcedthat they are leading another cross-party attempt to grab control of the Commons. Just in case the candidates needed a reminder of what they'll inherit, the politician who wins this race might find that MPs have changed the law to kill off their solution to Brexit before they even call the removal vans to move their stuff to Number 10. Read more from Laura. Ten Conservative candidates will contest Thursday's first round of voting after nominations closed in the contest to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister. Over the next two weeks, Tory MPs will take part in a series of secret ballots to whittle the candidates down to the final two. The party's 160,000 or so members will then pick a winner in a postal ballot, with the result announced in the penultimate week of July.

Sturgeon holds talks with EU leadersThe Scottish first minister meets Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier during a visit to Brussels.Scotland politicsComments,"Nicola Sturgeon met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has held talks with European leaders as part of a visit to Brussels. Ms Sturgeon met EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier before making a speech on European policy. She said the speech would restate her government's backing for continued EU membership and shared European values. The SNP leader also said the Foreign Office had been ""childish"" for cutting off diplomatic support for the trip. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - one of the candidates for the Conservative leadership - had asked that the Scottish government provide its own logistical support for the visit, due to concerns Ms Sturgeon was using the trip to undermine UK policies on Brexit and promote Scottish independence. Talks over the UK's exit from the EU have been deadlocked for months, and have now taken a back seat to the leadership contest which will decide who replaces Theresa May as prime minister. All 10 candidates in the running have pledged to deliver Brexit,but are divided on how and when to do so. Ahead of her speech at the European Policy Centre, Ms Sturgeon said people in Scotland had ""shown that they comprehensively reject Brexit and want to remain as a European nation"". She added: ""Membership of the EU not only has huge economic benefits for Scotland, but is the basis of the core values we share around democracy, equality, co-operation and human rights. ""My engagements in Brussels are an opportunity to outline the Scottish government's support for those values and how they contribute to a better Scotland, Europe and wider world. ""On issues such as climate change and tackling inequality we can all work together to ensure the wellbeing of our citizens, as well as the wealth of member states."" Analysis by BBC Scotland chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is open to Europe - is the feeling mutual? During the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the EU was not exactly neutral. The then European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barosso, suggested it would be ""extremely difficult"" for Scotland to become an independent member of the EU. But Brexit - and the possibility of a no deal departure by the UK - appears to be changing some minds in Brussels. One EU official told me there had been a ""paradigm shift"" in attitudes to Scottish independence in Brussels since the EU referendum. That is to say that if Scotland voted to leave the UK after Brexit, the EU might be more accommodating. It doesn't mean an independent Scotland could choose its own terms or avoid either an application process or hard choices over its border arrangements with England. But it is, as the first minister put it, a different ""vibe"". That may be of concern to the UK government, which has decided to withhold practical support, such as an official car, for Nicola Sturgeon on this visit. The first minister said that was ""petty"" but the UK insisted its effort and resources must be focussed on its own objectives. Those do not include reversing Brexit or independence for Scotland, for which Ms Sturgeon is actively campaigning. Ms Sturgeon is making the visit without diplomatic support from the Foreign Office, which is customarily offered for trips abroad. A spokesman for the UK government said that ""a balance must be struck to avoid supporting activities intended to campaign for policies contrary to the government's position"". He said that Mr Hunt had ""requested that the Scottish government provide its own logistical support, adding: ""As a responsible government, we must be certain that our effort and resources overseas are focused on furthering the objectives of Her Majesty's Government."" Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that the move was ""pretty childish and pathetic"". She said: ""It's not causing me to lose any sleep, it's not making any real practical difference to my meetings here today, but I think it offers a bit of a window into what's going on in the Tory party right now. ""Not only are they ignoring Scotland's interests, they're trying to undermine the Scottish government in trying to stand up for those interests. It's quite a remarkable and extraordinary state of affairs.""

Dominic Raab says leadership candidates should be able to ""hold their nerve"" in a TV debate. The former Brexit secretary made it through the first round of the Tory leadership contest in fourth place with 27 votes and said he had a ""strong base to build on"". But he said the candidates needed to have a ""proper debate on the vision for the country"". He told the BBC: ""There are a lot of candidates with a lot to offer but we are
right at the beginning of this race. ""We havenât really tested the visions, the
ideas, the policies of all of the candidates, and I think the debates coming upâ¦
are a great opportunity to test the views. ""There is many a slip between a cup and the lip."" Mr Raab said the last leadership contest, that saw Theresa May take power, was a ""very quick coronation"", but ""once the adrenaline of the first froth and frenzy of this contest ebbs a little bit [you can] have a proper contest on the substance and the vision"". And what would he say to anyone considering not taking part in the TV debates? ""If you can't hold your nerve and take the heat of a
leadership contest, what chance [do you have] under the glare of the light in Brussels?"" Press Association photographer tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Theresa May and Jo Brand In other news, Prime Minister Theresa May has weighed into a row about Jo Brand. The comedian made a joke on BBC Radio 4 about the recent spate of milkshakes being thrown at politicians. ""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" she asked, adding: ""I'm not going to do it. It's purely a fantasy."" Ms Brand was accused by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who hashad milkshakes thrown at himby protesters, of ""inciting violence"". Mrs May said the BBC should explain why the joke was deemed ""appropriate content"" for broadcast. Read more here. When it comes to Brexit, one key phrase that people keep using is ""kicking the can down the road"". But where does it come from? It started with a yard game played by children in the US called ""kicking the can"". A player was tagged ""it"" and had to guard an old can while seeking out others hiding. If the other players could kick the can before being caught, they freed everyone. The game seemed to disappear by the 1960s, but the 1980s ""kicking the can down the road"" became common parlance - signifying postponement - in the US Congress. It soon came to the attention of journalists and well, the rest is history... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Oxfam criticised over Haiti sex claims,"This video can not be played Oxfam whistleblower says change will take years Oxfam has been severely criticised by the Charity Commission for the way it dealt with claims of serious sexual misconduct by its staff in Haiti. The commission,externalsaid there was a ""culture of poor behaviour"" at the charity, and issued it with an official warning over its ""mismanagement"". Last year Oxfam was accused of covering up claims staff sexually exploited victims of the 2010 earthquake. Oxfam accepted the findings, saying what happened in Haiti was ""shameful"". How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Claims first emerged in The Times last year that Oxfam employees, including former country director Roland van Hauwermeiren, used young prostitutes while based in Haiti after the earthquake. An internal Oxfam investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr Van Hauwermeiren. But a report published by Oxfam after the investigation failed to mention sexual exploitation. The charity commission said the incidents in Haiti identified in 2011 were not ""one-offs"", with evidence of behavioural issues as early as June 2010. There were also issues at some of the charity's UK shops - the report highlighted 16 serious incidents involving volunteers under the age of 18. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 Tuesday's report, which followed an 18-month investigation, found the charity failed to listen to warnings - including from its own staff, that it repeatedly fell below standards expected on safeguarding, and did not meet promises it made. Its findings included: Oxfam failed to adequately investigate allegations that children as young as 12 or 13 were victims of sexual misconduct by an unnamed charity ""boss"" It was not as full and frank as it should have been about Haiti, and did not report the allegations of child abuse by staff It treated some senior staff more leniently than junior staff over Haiti The impact on victims and the risk they faced appeared to take second place and was not taken seriously enough ""What went wrong in Haiti did not happen in isolation,"" Charity Commission chief executive Helen Stephenson said. ""Over a period of years, Oxfam's internal culture tolerated poor behaviour, and at times lost sight of the values it stands for."" Oxfam's internal investigation into Haiti, following allegations by a whistleblower in 2011, could not conclude whether minors were involved in some of the incidents. Two allegations of physical abuse, made by email from a 12-year-old and a 13-year-old girl, were ""suspected"" not to be genuine by Oxfam at the time. The Charity Commission said Oxfam should have tried harder to substantiate the claims at the time, despite the lack of evidence. Oxfam's chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity accepted the findings, describing them as ""uncomfortable"". ""What happened in Haiti was shameful and we are deeply sorry,"" she said. ""It was a terrible abuse of power and an affront to the values that Oxfam holds dear."" She added: ""We now know that the 2011 investigation and reporting of what happened in Haiti was flawed; more should have been done to establish whether minors were involved."" The decision to allow Mr Hauwermeiren to resign without a fuller investigation into his conduct would not be permitted under current policies and practices, she said. The Times had reported that Oxfam was aware of concerns about the conduct of Mr Van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Ms Thomson added that every member of staff was being put through basic safeguarding training and 95% of them had already completed it. It's rare to see such strong criticism of a charity. The most stinging criticism was reserved for the way Oxfam was seen to be placing its own reputation - and its relationships with donors - above the need to protect victims.

Do leadership tax plans add up?,"In the race to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative party and prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are setting out how they want to run the UK. They have both announced taxation and spending plans. So, what are the details and do their sums add up? People would only start to pay the higher rate of income tax when they earn at least Â£80,000, under Boris Johnson's plans The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan, the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not affect Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the ceiling for NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and it is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost due to national insurance increases). Is there a Brexit war chest? Hammond calls for honesty on spending pledges Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay national insurance to begin with. So if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only will they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also won't be affected by the national insurance rise. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost around Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from the Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been ear-marked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can only be spent once. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson will need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Raise public sector pay and increase school funding What it means:A leading supporter of Mr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, told the Times that the days of public sector pay freezes under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and rises were capped at 1% in 2013. The government announced an end to the pay cap in 2017, and some public sector workers have negotiated increases above 1% since then. The candidate himself has declined to specify by how much he would increase pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He has also pledged to fund increased investment in special needs education, as part of a Â£4.6bn boost to overall school funding. The cost:We don't know by how much Mr Johnson wants to increase public sector pay, butthe IFS says,externalthat each 1% increase in pay for the public sector workforce costs the government about Â£1.8bn a year. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022 What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson plans to reverse almost all of those cuts on the basis that ""more people on our streets means more people are kept safe"". There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson gave a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas around Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year, but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes around two years. Typically, after four years, the pay would increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m, but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be around Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers, but again, this will differ from force to force. Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says that they would recruit special constables, who are trained as police officers but work part time, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Cut corporation tax to 12.5% What it means:From April 2020, instead of paying 17% tax on their profits, companies would pay 12.5%. The foreign secretary is in favour of cutting the rate of corporation tax - the tax that companies pay on their profits - to 12.5%, which is the same rate as in the Republic of Ireland. The government is already planning a series of cuts to corporation tax, which was cut from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017, and is scheduled to fall to 17% next year. The idea of cutting it by another 4.5 percentage pointscame in a report,externalby another Conservative MP at the end of May. The cost:The government estimates the policy would cost about Â£14bn a year. That cost would be reduced if future tax takes were to be boosted by companies being attracted to move to the UK to take advantage of the lower tax rate, or if companies use the money saved to pay higher wages or invest it in improving their productivity. How much that would reduce the cost is very hard to predict. The plan:Take 90% of businesses out of business rates What it means:Business rates are a local tax paid on the use of buildings for non-domestic purposes. The cost:We haven't seen any formal costings of this policy, but in the2018 Budget, Philip Hammonddecided to give a one-third discount on business rates to high street retail businesses with a rateable value below Â£51,000 in 2019-20 and 2020-21. The Treasury said that would benefit 90% of high street retail businesses. The Office for Budget Responsibility said,externalthe discount would cost Â£490m this year and Â£450m next year. It means we can estimate that a 100% cut for those businesses would cost an extra Â£900m next year and about Â£1.35bn a year after that. Business rates are currently collected by local authorities, which retain half of the money. Central government is reimbursing them for the one-third cut and would presumably also reimburse them for the 100% cut. The plan:Increase annual investment allowance to Â£5m What it means:If you are running a business and you buy equipment such as computers or machinery, you can deduct the amount you spend on it from your profits to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. There is a limit,externalto the amount you can deduct, which is called the annual investment allowance. At the start of this year it was raised from Â£200,000 to Â£1m for two years. The cost:We do not have a costing for this measure either, but to get an idea of the amounts of money involved,the OBR said,externalthe temporary increase to Â£1m would cost Â£600m this year. The plan:Money for fishing, farming and defence What it means:Jeremy Hunt would increase spending on defence from its current level of 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP - the sum of everything the UK produces each year) to 2.5% of GDP by 2023-4. He has also said he would have a ""relief programme"" for the fishing and farming sectors to help them deal with the effects of a possible no-deal Brexit. The cost:The boost to defence spending would cost Â£15bn a year by 2023-4. The relief for fishing and farming would cost Â£6bn. Mr Hunt says his overall plans would ""kick-start the economy and create extra growth"", which would mean the government had extra money to spend. But the disruption involved in leaving the EU with no deal is widely expected to reduce growth - at least initially - which would mean that increased taxes or borrowing or reduced spending in other areas would be required to fund the extra spending.

"Leadership rivals split over Brexit deadlineAndrea Leadsom says the UK will leave in October, but rival Mark Harper says that is ""not credible"".UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom: ""Labour governments always destroy incentives to work hard and prosper"" Leaving the EU by the end of October is a ""hard red line"" and will happen in ""all circumstances"", Andrea Leadsom has said in her pitch for leadership. The ex-Commons leader said she had a plan for a ""managed exit"", adding that Parliament could ""not stop us leaving"". But her rival Mark Harper said it was ""not possible"" to leave by 31 October, and Rory Stewart said talk of a better deal on the table was a ""fairy story"". Ten Conservative candidates are in the race to be leader - and the next PM. The deadline for Brexit was pushed back to October after MPs rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with Brussels three times. Where do the candidates stand on Brexit? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? Latest updates: The race for Number 10 The European Union has repeatedly said the agreement will not be re-opened, and on Tuesday, president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that once again. ""This is not a treaty between Theresa May and Juncker, this is a treaty between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he told a Politico event in Brussels. ""It has to be respected by whomsoever will be the next British prime minister."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saidit was a ""terrible political miscalculation"" for UK politicians to believe they can get a better deal. This video can not be played Rory Stewart: We have a choice between fairy stories and realism ""In all circumstances we are leaving the European Union on 31 October,"" Mrs Leadsom told her official campaign launch. ""Our country and our party cannot afford any more indecisiveness."" The Brexiteer MP set out her plan for what she calls a ""managed exit"" from the EU, which includes striking a ""temporary trade agreement"" and a plan to negotiate contingency arrangements with Brussels over the summer recess. She said these could be discussed at a summit with the new incoming EU commissioners and heads of government in September. This video can not be played Mark Harper says the UK needs more time to sort a Brexit deal But at his official campaign launch, Mr Harper - an outsider in the race - said it was ""not possible or credible"" to leave on the terms of a new deal by the existing deadline of 31 October. Renegotiating and getting a deal past MPs would take longer, he said. He said there could be a majority in the Commons to leave without a deal, but only if ministers demonstrated they had ""strained every sinew"" to get a new one. Raab reaching over 55s on Facebook Leadsom would 'never say never' to indyref2 Meanwhile, Health Secretary Mr Hancock - who is also competing for the top job - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme his plan was ""eminently deliverable"" by 31 October, as the EU was open to changingthe political declaration part of the agreement. ""We need to solve Brexit and we cannot do it by threatening no deal,"" he said, adding: ""Parliament will not allow a no-deal Brexit to happen."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid reiterated that although he wanted a revised deal, ""if we got to end of October and the choice was between no deal or no Brexit, I'd pick no deal."" Later in the day, launching his campaign in a circus tent in London, Rory Stewart - another outsider - said he wanted to ""take the politics out"" of the situation and find a way to get Mrs May's deal through Parliament. He said he would ramp up pressure on MPs to back it by promising that otherwise, he would convene a ""grand jury"" of citizens to make recommendations on how to proceed which politicians would have to stick to. Vowing to hold the UK together and reconcile ""extreme Remain and extreme Brexit"" arguments, he added: ""My project is about one thing - it is about moderation and compromise."" At her official launch, Mrs Leadsom introduced several policies away from Brexit, including using overseas development aid to help poorer countries to decarbonise and helping young people to save for a house deposit with a new scheme. When questioned on taxes -prompted by Boris Johnson's pledge to cut income taxfor those who earn more than Â£50,000 a year - she said she believed in low taxes. But tax reform could not get through a hung Parliament, so that ""needs to wait"". Taking a swipe at Mr Johnson's idea, Mr Harper said he would focus his tax cuts ""at the lower end of the spectrum"", adding: ""I don't think we should be promising more money to higher rate taxpayers."" He also said the lack of a majority meant certain things would not be deliverable and as Brexit showed, it was ""toxic"" to make promises and not fulfil them. The winner of the leadership contest will become next Conservative leader and prime minister. They're due to be in place by the week beginning 22 July. Find out about all the candidates BBC to host Tory leader TV debates Mr Javid, who launches his campaign on Wednesday,released a campaign video,externalwhich BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described as the first big attempt by a candidate to communicate a personal story, introducing viewers to his family and background. He also told the Evening Standard,externalhe was ""very open minded"" about having different immigration rules for regions such as London after Brexit, and could scrap Mrs May's policy that EU migrants should earn at least Â£30,000 to be considered for admission. Mr Johnson - accused by Michael Gove and other candidates of ""hiding in his bunker"" because he is yet to a do a major event or TV interview - is also launching his campaign on Wednesday. It's day two of the official campaign to be the next prime minister. Andrea Leadsom cheerily launched her campaign, promising she would never utter the phrase ""as a mother"" that did for her chances last time. As promised, the former chief whip Mark Harper was jacket off, sleeves rolled up, answering any question that journalists were willing to put. That included - because the early stages of this campaign are this surreal - predicting in a fight between a lion and a bear that the lion, patriotically, would win. (yes, you read that right). And TV presenter Lorraine Kelly was back - this time with a slapdown of the whole lot of the political class. But the hard reality bites today too.Labour has just announcedthat they are leading another cross-party attempt to grab control of the Commons. Just in case the candidates needed a reminder of what they'll inherit, the politician who wins this race might find that MPs have changed the law to kill off their solution to Brexit before they even call the removal vans to move their stuff to Number 10. Read more from Laura. Ten Conservative candidates will contest Thursday's first round of voting after nominations closed in the contest to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister. Over the next two weeks, Tory MPs will take part in a series of secret ballots to whittle the candidates down to the final two. The party's 160,000 or so members will then pick a winner in a postal ballot, with the result announced in the penultimate week of July.

"Oxfam criticised over Haiti sex claimsThe charity failed to spot a ""culture of poor behaviour"" and did not report claims of child abuse.UK","This video can not be played Oxfam whistleblower says change will take years Oxfam has been severely criticised by the Charity Commission for the way it dealt with claims of serious sexual misconduct by its staff in Haiti. The commission,externalsaid there was a ""culture of poor behaviour"" at the charity, and issued it with an official warning over its ""mismanagement"". Last year Oxfam was accused of covering up claims staff sexually exploited victims of the 2010 earthquake. Oxfam accepted the findings, saying what happened in Haiti was ""shameful"". How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Claims first emerged in The Times last year that Oxfam employees, including former country director Roland van Hauwermeiren, used young prostitutes while based in Haiti after the earthquake. An internal Oxfam investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr Van Hauwermeiren. But a report published by Oxfam after the investigation failed to mention sexual exploitation. The charity commission said the incidents in Haiti identified in 2011 were not ""one-offs"", with evidence of behavioural issues as early as June 2010. There were also issues at some of the charity's UK shops - the report highlighted 16 serious incidents involving volunteers under the age of 18. Mr Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 Tuesday's report, which followed an 18-month investigation, found the charity failed to listen to warnings - including from its own staff, that it repeatedly fell below standards expected on safeguarding, and did not meet promises it made. Its findings included: Oxfam failed to adequately investigate allegations that children as young as 12 or 13 were victims of sexual misconduct by an unnamed charity ""boss"" It was not as full and frank as it should have been about Haiti, and did not report the allegations of child abuse by staff It treated some senior staff more leniently than junior staff over Haiti The impact on victims and the risk they faced appeared to take second place and was not taken seriously enough ""What went wrong in Haiti did not happen in isolation,"" Charity Commission chief executive Helen Stephenson said. ""Over a period of years, Oxfam's internal culture tolerated poor behaviour, and at times lost sight of the values it stands for."" Oxfam's internal investigation into Haiti, following allegations by a whistleblower in 2011, could not conclude whether minors were involved in some of the incidents. Two allegations of physical abuse, made by email from a 12-year-old and a 13-year-old girl, were ""suspected"" not to be genuine by Oxfam at the time. The Charity Commission said Oxfam should have tried harder to substantiate the claims at the time, despite the lack of evidence. Oxfam's chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity accepted the findings, describing them as ""uncomfortable"". ""What happened in Haiti was shameful and we are deeply sorry,"" she said. ""It was a terrible abuse of power and an affront to the values that Oxfam holds dear."" She added: ""We now know that the 2011 investigation and reporting of what happened in Haiti was flawed; more should have been done to establish whether minors were involved."" The decision to allow Mr Hauwermeiren to resign without a fuller investigation into his conduct would not be permitted under current policies and practices, she said. The Times had reported that Oxfam was aware of concerns about the conduct of Mr Van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Ms Thomson added that every member of staff was being put through basic safeguarding training and 95% of them had already completed it. It's rare to see such strong criticism of a charity. The most stinging criticism was reserved for the way Oxfam was seen to be placing its own reputation - and its relationships with donors - above the need to protect victims. The charity has been bleeding financial support since the story broke, losing 7,000 regular donors worth Â£14m. It has also lost almost Â£20m in government funding over the last 18 months, and today's findings won't have done much to rebuild trust.

UK wage growth faster than expected,"Wage growth beat market and economist expectations in the three months from February to April. Pay rose by 3.4% compared with a year ago. After taking inflation into account, wage growth was 1.4%,official figures show,external. The unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, and has not been lower since the October to December 1974 period, the Office for National Statistics said. The employment rate for women was 72%, the highest on record. This is after changes to the state pension age leading to fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. Matt Hughes, deputy head of labour market statistics at the ONS, said: ""With employment growth among women coming from full-timers, the overall gap between men and women in hours worked is now the lowest ever - women now average about three-quarters of men's weekly hours, compared with around two-thirds 25 years ago."" Sterling rose from five-month lows against the euro after wages rose faster than expected, beating some economists predictions of a 3% rise. While employment growth slowed, the jobless rate held at 3.8%. John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, said it was ""interesting"" that female employment rose by 60,000 compared with the previous quarter, while male employment fell by 27,000. ""This is consistent with a longer-term trend towards a narrowing gender employment gap. ""Male employment is still higher at around 80%, but this is well below its historical highs of over 90% back in the 1970s."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""The buoyant labour market is still going strong for the UK economy, even as it weathers widespread political uncertainty."" ""However, the employment boom cannot last forever, and is certainly showing signs of softening."" How is it that employment has reached record levels yet people aren't feeling that in their pockets? It's a question that has confounded labour market experts. But with 357,000 jobs having been created over the last year, overwhelmingly full-time, companies are now having to pay a higher price to attract staff. Wages across the economy grew by 3.4% in the three months to April, compared with a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics, with the biggest increases in the construction and financial services industries. Strip out inflation, however, and real wages remain on average a touch below pre-financial crisis levels. What happens next? The rate of job creation is slowing, and economists are divided over whether this represents more caution on the part of employers or a lack of suitable candidates. If it's the former, then the rate of pay growth could moderate. But if it's the latter, then salaries may rise faster as firms compete for the best talent. But bumper pay rises could come at a cost. The Bank of England is known to be concerned that faster pay growth could equal higher inflation, which could mean it's more inclined to raise interest rates. Meanwhile, data for a separate time period out on Tuesday showed the scale of job losses in the retail sector after tough conditions on the High Street. From the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019, retail lost 79,000 jobs. In total, 54,000 employee jobs went, and 25,000 self-employed retail jobs. Kyle Monk, head of retail insight and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""It has been a turbulent year, with many well-known brands disappearing from our High Streets, as has been evidenced by the substantial loss in retail jobs this quarter. ""Political and economic uncertainty has compounded many of the challenges created by the pace of technological change.""

Dominic Raab says leadership candidates should be able to ""hold their nerve"" in a TV debate. The former Brexit secretary made it through the first round of the Tory leadership contest in fourth place with 27 votes and said he had a ""strong base to build on"". But he said the candidates needed to have a ""proper debate on the vision for the country"". He told the BBC: ""There are a lot of candidates with a lot to offer but we are
right at the beginning of this race. ""We havenât really tested the visions, the
ideas, the policies of all of the candidates, and I think the debates coming upâ¦
are a great opportunity to test the views. ""There is many a slip between a cup and the lip."" Mr Raab said the last leadership contest, that saw Theresa May take power, was a ""very quick coronation"", but ""once the adrenaline of the first froth and frenzy of this contest ebbs a little bit [you can] have a proper contest on the substance and the vision"". And what would he say to anyone considering not taking part in the TV debates? ""If you can't hold your nerve and take the heat of a
leadership contest, what chance [do you have] under the glare of the light in Brussels?"" Press Association photographer tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, we suggested the phrase ""kicking the can"" - used by Boris Johnson to warn against delaying Brexit and heard frequently thereafter - had its origins in the US. But the earliest written example of a similar phrase quoted in the Oxford English Dictionary is ""kick the tinnie"", which is described as a game played by children in Orkney. The source for that example is a 1909 article in the lexicography journal Notes and Queries. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theresa May and Jo Brand In other news, Prime Minister Theresa May has weighed into a row about Jo Brand. The comedian made a joke on BBC Radio 4 about the recent spate of milkshakes being thrown at politicians. ""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" she asked, adding: ""I'm not going to do it. It's purely a fantasy."" Ms Brand was accused by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who hashad milkshakes thrown at himby protesters, of ""inciting violence"". Mrs May said the BBC should explain why the joke was deemed ""appropriate content"" for broadcast. Read more here. When it comes to Brexit, one key phrase that people keep using is ""kicking the can down the road"". But where does it come from? It started with a yard game played by children in the US called ""kicking the can"". A player was tagged ""it"" and had to guard an old can while seeking out others hiding. If the other players could kick the can before being caught, they freed everyone. The game seemed to disappear by the 1960s, but the 1980s ""kicking the can down the road"" became common parlance - signifying postponement - in the US Congress. It soon came to the attention of journalists and well, the rest is history... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News Channel Former minister George Eustice - who is backing Michael Gove - says today's ballot was a âgood result for usâ after a week of ""difficult headlines"" over his past cocaine use. He says his candidate is ""within touching distance"" of second-placed Jeremy Hunt, but there is more ""scope"" for him to win votes from those who backed the three eliminated candidates. He also says that Boris Johnson is âguaranteedâ a place in the run-off ballot between the final two contenders, but the other choice should be ""another committed Brexiteerâ.

Michael Gove has posted a video on Twitter, celebrating getting through the first round of the Tory leadership contest. The environment secretary came third with 37 votes, behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. But now he is looking forward to a ""proper"" debate ""about ideas"", he said. âI believe I have policies that can transform this country for
the better,"" Mr Gove added. ""Iâve got the experience of delivery that can make sure that we have a brighter future, and
Iâve got the range of support to enable all of us in this country to come together. âIâm ready to unite, ready to deliver, ready to lead.â BBC Radio 5 Live Former Conservative Party
chairwoman Baroness Warsi tells BBC Radio 5 Live that the prime minister âshould
have insistedâ Home Secretary Sajid Javid be given a seat at the state banquet
held in honour of US President Donald Trump. She says the fact
Mr Javid was not at Buckingham Palace showed âa lack of leadershipâ in No 10. Leadership hopeful Mr Javid has called his
exclusion from the banquet ""odd"". A Downing Street
spokesman said neither Mr Javidâs ethnicity nor Mr Trump had anything to
do with the home secretary not being invited. Instead he cited the huge demand for seats, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that âpriority was given to trade and defence secretaries, given the themes of the state visitâ. But Baroness Warsi says: âI suspect there has been a lack of leadership
from No 10, where they have not been clear enough to say that, in Britain, our values are that we believe in equality and meritocracy and that we will not
make our decisions based upon your values. ""What we needed to do as a country was clearly show that our values were different and that weâre prepared to
assert those values, even if those values were being questioned and pushed by
the US.â BBC News Channel Ken Clarke, who backed seventh-placed Rory Stewart, says most of the candidates apart from Boris Johnson will feel disappointed, but he is ""very pleased"" with the result today. He says his candidate was ""very little known"" to the public before the contest but has ""fought the best campaign so far"". He says Mr Johnson is a ""Marmite politician"" and ""not a shoo-in"" to win, with ""quite a lot"" of Conservative MPs ""extremely fearful"" about the idea of him becoming PM. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sturgeon holds talks with EU leaders,"Nicola Sturgeon met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has held talks with European leaders as part of a visit to Brussels. Ms Sturgeon met EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier before making a speech on European policy. She said the speech would restate her government's backing for continued EU membership and shared European values. The SNP leader also said the Foreign Office had been ""childish"" for cutting off diplomatic support for the trip. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - one of the candidates for the Conservative leadership - had asked that the Scottish government provide its own logistical support for the visit, due to concerns Ms Sturgeon was using the trip to undermine UK policies on Brexit and promote Scottish independence. Talks over the UK's exit from the EU have been deadlocked for months, and have now taken a back seat to the leadership contest which will decide who replaces Theresa May as prime minister. All 10 candidates in the running have pledged to deliver Brexit,but are divided on how and when to do so. Ahead of her speech at the European Policy Centre, Ms Sturgeon said people in Scotland had ""shown that they comprehensively reject Brexit and want to remain as a European nation"". She added: ""Membership of the EU not only has huge economic benefits for Scotland, but is the basis of the core values we share around democracy, equality, co-operation and human rights. ""My engagements in Brussels are an opportunity to outline the Scottish government's support for those values and how they contribute to a better Scotland, Europe and wider world. ""On issues such as climate change and tackling inequality we can all work together to ensure the wellbeing of our citizens, as well as the wealth of member states."" Analysis by BBC Scotland chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is open to Europe - is the feeling mutual? During the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the EU was not exactly neutral. The then European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barosso, suggested it would be ""extremely difficult"" for Scotland to become an independent member of the EU. But Brexit - and the possibility of a no deal departure by the UK - appears to be changing some minds in Brussels. One EU official told me there had been a ""paradigm shift"" in attitudes to Scottish independence in Brussels since the EU referendum. That is to say that if Scotland voted to leave the UK after Brexit, the EU might be more accommodating. It doesn't mean an independent Scotland could choose its own terms or avoid either an application process or hard choices over its border arrangements with England. But it is, as the first minister put it, a different ""vibe"". That may be of concern to the UK government, which has decided to withhold practical support, such as an official car, for Nicola Sturgeon on this visit. The first minister said that was ""petty"" but the UK insisted its effort and resources must be focussed on its own objectives. Those do not include reversing Brexit or independence for Scotland, for which Ms Sturgeon is actively campaigning. Ms Sturgeon is making the visit without diplomatic support from the Foreign Office, which is customarily offered for trips abroad. A spokesman for the UK government said that ""a balance must be struck to avoid supporting activities intended to campaign for policies contrary to the government's position"". He said that Mr Hunt had ""requested that the Scottish government provide its own logistical support, adding: ""As a responsible government, we must be certain that our effort and resources overseas are focused on furthering the objectives of Her Majesty's Government."" Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that the move was ""pretty childish and pathetic"". She said: ""It's not causing me to lose any sleep, it's not making any real practical difference to my meetings here today, but I think it offers a bit of a window into what's going on in the Tory party right now. ""Not only are they ignoring Scotland's interests, they're trying to undermine the Scottish government in trying to stand up for those interests. It's quite a remarkable and extraordinary state of affairs.""

MPs call for ban on 'gagging clauses',"Hannah Martin said she had been forced out of her job and made to sign a gagging clause after having a baby MPs have called for a ban on ""gagging clauses"" used by employers to silence allegations of unlawful discrimination and harassment. Maria Miller, chairwoman of the Women and Equalities committee, said non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were having a ""destructive effect on people's lives"". NDAs were designed to stop staff sharing secrets if they changed jobs. But MPs say they are now used to ""cover up unlawful and criminal behaviour"". The Women and Equalities Committee says the government needs to clarify the rules on whistleblowing and tackle the financial barriers employees face when trying to take cases to employment tribunals. It comes asdozens of academics told the BBC they were ""harassed"" out of their jobsand made to sign NDAs after raising complaints about discrimination, bullying and sexual misconduct. What are non-disclosure agreements? Orders gagging workers to be curbed Sacked and silenced for being pregnant Sir Philip Green, other famous faces and why NDAs matter More than 90 people wrote to the committee sharing their experiences. Hannah Martin, a mother-of-two from West Sussex, told MPs she was forced to leave her job at an advertising agency after having a baby. ""They said if I did not sign an NDA within 24 hours I would not get a payout,"" she told the BBC in a separate interview. ""NDAs are a bullying tactic that forces you into silence. I felt like I had no other choice but to sign. I felt like I was being abused."" She said that by signing an NDA, she not only lost her job and income, but also her self-confidence. ""All the power is with the person with the money,"" she said. This video can not be played Miller: ""A long-term mission to get rid of NDAs altogether"" Mrs Miller said it was ""worrying"" that gagging clauses were being traded by employers for job references. ""After signing an NDA, many individuals find it difficult to work in the same sector again,"" she said. ""Some suffer emotional and psychological damage as a result of their experiences, which can affect their ability to work and move on."" The committee said any use of confidentiality clauses needed to be clear and specific in scope and that employers should be made to investigate all allegations properly. A senior manager should be appointed to oversee discrimination cases so that someone was held accountable, the committee said. It also renewed calls for the three-month time limit for tribunal cases about sexual harassment and discrimination to be doubled, and added new laws should be introduced so that NDAs could not prevent people from sharing information which might support the claims of other victims. Astrophysicist Dr Emma Chapman won a payout after being sexually harassed by a man at University College London but refused to sign an NDA in favour of a confidentiality waiver. She said this was a positive first step towards ""breaking the cycle of abuse and silencing in sexual misconduct"" at universities in particular. She told MPs she knew of two cases in London in the last five years where settlements totalling more than Â£100,000 in each institution were given to multiple victims of individual harassers. But she said she was ""concerned that even with the clearest terms alongside an NDA, the power imbalance between employer and employee will still serve to silence without explicit confidentiality waivers"". UCL said it welcomed the committee's findings, adding that it ""no longer uses NDAs in settlement agreements with individuals who have complained of sexual misconduct, harassment or bullying as a matter of course"".

UK phone firms demand clarity over HuaweiMobile operators have written a letter asking the government to decide the role Huawei can play in 5G.,"The UK risks losing its position as a world leader in mobile connectivity, Britain's mobile operators are warning. In a draft letter to Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill, seen by the BBC, operators will urge the government to clarify its position over Huawei. The letter asks for an urgent meeting between industry leaders and the government to discuss their concerns. Operators say they can't invest in infrastructure while uncertainty over the use of Chinese technology persists. The companies are planning to send the letter to government as soon as this week. Huawei: 'We stand naked in front of the world' China warns of investment blow to UK over 5G ban Huawei: US blacklist will harm billions of consumers They are concerned at the government's inability to decide whether Huawei technology will be approved for use in new 5G networks. A government spokesperson said: ""The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance. We have robust procedures in place to manage risks to national security and are committed to the highest possible security standards. ""The Telecoms Supply Chain Review will be announced in due course. We have been clear throughout the process that all network operators will need to comply with the government's decision."" Huawei is the world's leading supplier of next generation connectivity equipment, but it has faced a backlash from the US. The US government has alreadybanned the use of Huawei technologyafter citing concerns that the company may present a security threat by allowing the Chinese government a way to snoop on critical infrastructure. The US has also threatened to limit intelligence co-operation with any country that allows Huawei equipment to be used in its own networks. Earlier this year there were unconfirmed reports that the government was considering allowing Huawei equipment into the periphery of new mobile networks, but not into the ""core"" of systems that could end up managing crucial services such as hospitals, police forces and the energy network. EE recently launched its 5G services in six UK cities BT-owned mobile operator EE said it had delayed the launch of Huawei's 5G phones ""until we get the information and confidence and the long-term security that our customers â¦ are going to be supported"". Vodafone has also announced it is suspending orders of Huawei 5G handsets. In perhaps the biggest blow to Huawei, British firm ARM, which designs processors used in most mobile devices worldwide, has also saidit may suspend ties with Huawei. Huawei has found itself on the front line of the trade war between the US and China. The company insists that it poses no security threat to any of its customers. Huawei says suggestions to the contrary are a smokescreen for frustrating China's attempts to emerge as a leading designer and provider of high tech equipment, rather than assembling the nuts and bolts of technology designed in the US and Europe.

Plant extinction 'bad news for all species',"Deforestation in Sumatra Almost 600 plant species have been lost from the wild in the last 250 years, according to a comprehensive study. The number is based on actual extinctions rather than estimates, and is twice that of all bird, mammal and amphibian extinctions combined. Scientists say plant extinction is occurring up to 500 times faster than what would be expected naturally. In May, a UN report estimated that one million animal and plant species were threatened with extinction. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Nature's emergency in five graphics What does a biodiversity emergency mean for humans. Researchers say their analysis of all documented plant extinctions in the world shows what lessons can be learned to stop future extinctions. Most people can name a mammal or bird that has become extinct in recent centuries, but few could name an extinct plant, said Dr Aelys Humphreys of Stockholm University. ""This study is the first time we have an overview of what plants have already become extinct, where they have disappeared from and how quickly this is happening,"" she added. St Helena Olive: The tree went extinct in 2003 The lost plants include the Chile sandalwood, which was exploited for essential oils, the banded trinity plant, which spent much of its life underground, and the pink-flowered St Helena olive tree. The biggest losses are on islands and in the tropics, which are home to highly valued timber trees and tend to be particularly rich in plant diversity. Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Stockholm University found that 571 plant species had disappeared in the last two and a half centuries, a number that is more than twice the number of birds, mammals and amphibians recorded as extinct (a combined total of 217 species). This data suggests plant extinction is happening as much as 500 times faster than what would be expected normally, if humans weren't around. The researchers believe even these numbers underestimate the true levels of ongoing plant extinction. One positive, though, was evidence that some plants once thought extinct have been rediscovered, such as the Chilean crocus. The Chilean crocus: Rediscovered in 2001 after years of searching All life on Earth depends on plants, which provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat. Plant extinctions can lead to a whole cascade of extinctions in other organisms that rely on them, for instance insects that use plants for food and for laying their eggs. This video can not be played ""Species are going extinct at a faster rate than we've seen for millions of years"" - Laura Foster reports Plant extinction is bad news for all species, said Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha, co-researcher and conservation scientist at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Herbaria preserve specimens of extinct plants ""Millions of other species depend on plants for their survival, humans included, so knowing which plants we are losing and from where, will feed back into conservation programmes targeting other organisms as well,"" she explained. The researchers are calling for a number of measures to stop plant extinction: Record all the plants across the world Support herbaria, which preserve plant specimens for posterity Support botanists who carry out vital research Teach our children to see and recognise local plants. Dr Rob Salguero-GÃ³mez, of the University of Oxford, who was not part of the study, said understanding the how, where, and why of plant loss was of paramount importance, not only for ecologists but also for human societies. ""We depend on plants directly for food, shade and construction materials, and indirectly for 'ecosystem services' such as carbon fixation, oxygen creation, and even improvement in human mental health through enjoying green spaces,"" he commented.

Nurseries 'face closure over funding gap'Some nurseries say they have cut back on learning resources and the quality of the children's food.England,"The manager of a Bradford nursery said it could be forced to close if government funding did not increase Nurseries in England's poorest areas are facing closure because of a shortfall in government funding, a charity has said. A report by the Early Years Alliance (EYA) found 17% of childcare providers surveyed in the most deprived areas of the country ""anticipate closure in the next twelve months"". Some nurseries said they had lowered the quality of food given to children. The Department for Education said it spent Â£3.5bn a year on early education. Since September 2017, most working parents in England have been entitled to a scheme offering 30 hours of free care for children aged three to four during term time. The government pays a national average of Â£4.98 per hour for places to local authorities but childcare providers have said this does not cover their costs. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the EYA, said the nursery sector was ""in crisis"". ""How much bigger does the early years funding shortfall have to grow before the government acts?"" he asked. ""Thousands of providers have closed, many more are charging for things that were previously free and now we see the impact this is likely to have on the poorest children in the country."" Paula Williams said 80% of her Bradford nursery's budget went on staff costs The survey of more than 350 nurseries and childminders found 43% of providers had been forced to cut back on learning resources and 19% said they had lowered the quality of food they gave to children. Paula Williams, who runs a nursery in Bradford, said it could be forced to close if government funding did not increase. All of the 48 children at the centre are supported by the government's scheme, with no fee-paying students. Ms Williams said 80% of the budget went on staff costs. ""Our funding went down yet our costs have all increased because national living and minimum wage is going up year on year and also we had to start paying pensions for all staff. ""Further forward it's getting tighter because next year the minimum wage will go up again and our funding is stagnant, it's not increasing,"" she said.

Production in major North Sea field starts,"The gas field is 140 miles (225km) off Aberdeen Production has started on the massive Culzean gas field in the North Sea. Operator Total said the field, 140 miles (225km) off Aberdeen, will be responsible for 5% of the UK's gas needs when it reaches peak production. Culzean was discovered in 2008 when it was described as the largest gas find in a decade. It contains gas reserves equal to about 250-300 million barrels of oil. The find was made by the Danish firm Maersk Oil. Maersk was subsequently bought by Total. Major gas field given green light The French firm owns a 49.99% stake, with the remainder shared between BP and JX Nippon. Total's president of exploration and production, Arnaud Breuillac, said: ""Culzean is a good example of our efforts to upgrade our portfolio in the North Sea over the last years, notably by bringing Total and Maersk Oil together. ""The Culzean field is located in the Central Graben area, close to the Elgin-Franklin fields, also operated by Total. ""The Culzean project is delivered ahead of schedule and more than 10% below the initial budget, which represents capex (capital expenditure) savings of more than 500 million dollars."" About 100,000 barrels of oil-equivalent gas per day will come from Culzean via a pipeline to Teesside. It consists of three bridge-linked installations and a floating storage facility.

Leaders have 'a moral duty' to act on slavery,"Theresa May will tell world leaders at a conference they have ""a moral duty"" to speak for victims of modern slavery. ""No leader worthy of the name can look the other way while men, women and children are held against their will,"" the prime minister is expected to say. Mrs May will announce Â£10m to reduce exploitation of children in Africa's agricultural industries. She will also say big businesses should produce transparency statements on modern slavery. The prime minister - who is due to step down in July - will be addressing the United Nations' International Labour Organisation in Geneva. Ministers 'must act quickly' on modern slavery Modern slavery cases 'rise by a third' She is expected to say: ""Modern slavery reaches into every corner of our lives - in the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the services we pay for. ""Yet for many years it seldom captured the world's attention or outrage - allowing those who trade in human misery to quietly continue their work, and allowing all of us to look the other way as we benefitted from the forced labour of this growing underclass."" Modern slaves in the UK, often said to be hiding in plain sight, are working in our nail bars, on construction sites, in brothels, on cannabis farms and in agriculture. Traffickers are using the internet to lure their victims with hollow promises of jobs, education and even love. Albania, Nigeria, Vietnam, Romania and Poland are the most likely countries of origin, but some victims are from the UK itself. There is no typical victim. They can be men, women or children of all ages but it is normally more prevalent among the most vulnerable, minorities or socially-excluded groups. Many believe they are escaping poverty, limited opportunities at home, a lack of education, unstable social and political conditions or war. But their slave masters are usually out to make financial gain. Sexual exploitation is the most common form of modern slavery reported in the UK, followed by labour exploitation, forced criminal exploitation and domestic servitude. In 2014, the Home Office estimated there were between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims in the UK - just 2,340 of those were officially reported and recorded. Sources:Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner Strategic Plan 2015-2017,externalandModernslavery.co.uk,external Mrs May will announce plans to create a new international modern slavery and migration envoy to help co-ordinate the UK's efforts with other nations. As Home Secretary, Theresa May introduced the Modern Slavery bill which became law in 2015. The legislation included tougher sentences and more help for people forced into labouring, domestic servitude, sex work and other coercive tasks. MP Frank Field, who led a recent review into the impact of the Modern Slavery Act, said there had been ""too few convictions"" and called for the laws to be strengthened. Mrs May is making a series of policy announcements in her final weeks as she seeks to return to the ""burning injustices"" agenda she set out when she first entered Downing Street in 2016.

"Human staff will always be needed, Amazon insists","This video can not be played ""You need both"" - Amazon's Tye Brady on robotics replacing humans Amazonâs warehouses will always need human staff, the firmâs chief robotics technologist has told the BBC. The company said it had deployed more than 200,000 warehouse robots working in around 50 of its locations. But despite Amazon investing heavily in advanced robotics, Tye Brady said the firmâs centres would never reach the point where they could be fully automated. âNot at all. One ounce of my body just doesnât see that,â he said. âThe way that I think about this is a symphony of humans and machines working together, you need both. âThe challenge that we have in front of us is how do we smartly design our machines to extend human capability.â Mr Brady was speaking to the BBC at Re:Mars, an Amazon event intended to showcase the firmâs latest work in machine learning, automation, robotics and space. He told the BBC the suggestion that robotics and AI would replace humans was a âmythâ. âIt's a reframing of your relationship with machines, right? âYou extend human capability. And when you gain productivity, then you have the ability to create new jobs that were unimaginable five years ago.â âStop BEZOS Actâ But the nature of those jobs has been harshly criticised. The UK-based GMB trade union organised a worker strike last November, describing conditions for employees at Amazonâs warehouses as âinhumanâ. âThey are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,â said GMB General Secretary Tim Roache in a statement. âWeâre standing up and saying enough is enough, these are people making Amazon its money. People with kids, homes, bills to pay - theyâre not robots.â In response, Amazon at the time said: âAll of our sites are safe places to work and reports to the contrary are simply wrong.â But the firm is making changes in response to pressure. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its minimum wage for warehouse workers to $15 (Â£12) after considerable pressure from, among others, potential Democratic presidential nominee, Bernie Sanders. He, along with Californian Congressman Ro Khanna, introduced legislation that would add an additional tax on corporations if their lowest paid employees relied on government programmes, such as food stamps, to make ends meet. The measure was titled Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies, or Stop BEZOS, for short  - a reference to Amazonâs founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. âOrange nightstand on wheelsâ One of the companyâs announcements was Pegasus, a new robot that is being used in the firmâs âsortation centresâ - the last step before a package is handed off to a delivery company. âResembling an orange nightstand on wheels, the two-feet-high, 3-feet-wide Pegasus drive is Amazon's newest robot designed to create greater efficiency in its sortation process so customers can receive their orders even faster,â thefirm said in a blog post,external. An accompanying video showed humans placing packages on to the robot, which then carried it, autonomously, to another location ready to be taken out for delivery. The system is able to work out the quickest route for the robots to take, taking into account the hundreds of other robots moving around at the same time. A âflow control specialistâ monitors the movements of up to 800 Pegasus robots at once. The company also announced it had made Xanthus, an updated version of its pallet-moving robot used in fulfilment centres. The firm said its robots had to date stacked more than 2 billion plastic storage boxes, known as totes. But one task robots still struggle greatly with is picking up individual objects of varying shapes and standards - which is still a key job of the human worker, particularly in the areas of Amazonâs business that deal with food handling. âIt's not humans versus machines at all,â Mr Brady told the BBC. âIt's humans and machines working together to achieve a task.â _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Michael Gove has posted a video on Twitter, celebrating getting through the first round of the Tory leadership contest. The environment secretary came third with 37 votes, behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. But now he is looking forward to a ""proper"" debate ""about ideas"", he said. âI believe I have policies that can transform this country for
the better,"" Mr Gove added. ""Iâve got the experience of delivery that can make sure that we have a brighter future, and
Iâve got the range of support to enable all of us in this country to come together. âIâm ready to unite, ready to deliver, ready to lead.â BBC Radio 5 Live Former Conservative Party
chairwoman Baroness Warsi tells BBC Radio 5 Live that the prime minister âshould
have insistedâ Home Secretary Sajid Javid be given a seat at the state banquet
held in honour of US President Donald Trump. She says the fact
Mr Javid was not at Buckingham Palace showed âa lack of leadershipâ in No 10. Leadership hopeful Mr Javid has called his
exclusion from the banquet ""odd"". A Downing Street
spokesman said neither Mr Javidâs ethnicity nor Mr Trump had anything to
do with the home secretary not being invited. Instead he cited the huge demand for seats, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that âpriority was given to trade and defence secretaries, given the themes of the state visitâ. But Baroness Warsi says: âI suspect there has been a lack of leadership
from No 10, where they have not been clear enough to say that, in Britain, our values are that we believe in equality and meritocracy and that we will not
make our decisions based upon your values. ""What we needed to do as a country was clearly show that our values were different and that weâre prepared to
assert those values, even if those values were being questioned and pushed by
the US.â BBC News Channel Ken Clarke, who backed seventh-placed Rory Stewart, says most of the candidates apart from Boris Johnson will feel disappointed, but he is ""very pleased"" with the result today. He says his candidate was ""very little known"" to the public before the contest but has ""fought the best campaign so far"". He says Mr Johnson is a ""Marmite politician"" and ""not a shoo-in"" to win, with ""quite a lot"" of Conservative MPs ""extremely fearful"" about the idea of him becoming PM. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Human staff will always be needed, Amazon insistsRobots cannot do everything, Amazon tells the BBC, but there is concern over the jobs that remain.","This video can not be played ""You need both"" - Amazon's Tye Brady on robotics replacing humans Amazonâs warehouses will always need human staff, the firmâs chief robotics technologist has told the BBC. The company said it had deployed more than 200,000 warehouse robots working in around 50 of its locations. But despite Amazon investing heavily in advanced robotics, Tye Brady said the firmâs centres would never reach the point where they could be fully automated. âNot at all. One ounce of my body just doesnât see that,â he said. âThe way that I think about this is a symphony of humans and machines working together, you need both. âThe challenge that we have in front of us is how do we smartly design our machines to extend human capability.â Mr Brady was speaking to the BBC at Re:Mars, an Amazon event intended to showcase the firmâs latest work in machine learning, automation, robotics and space. He told the BBC the suggestion that robotics and AI would replace humans was a âmythâ. âIt's a reframing of your relationship with machines, right? âYou extend human capability. And when you gain productivity, then you have the ability to create new jobs that were unimaginable five years ago.â âStop BEZOS Actâ But the nature of those jobs has been harshly criticised. The UK-based GMB trade union organised a worker strike last November, describing conditions for employees at Amazonâs warehouses as âinhumanâ. âThey are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,â said GMB General Secretary Tim Roache in a statement. âWeâre standing up and saying enough is enough, these are people making Amazon its money. People with kids, homes, bills to pay - theyâre not robots.â In response, Amazon at the time said: âAll of our sites are safe places to work and reports to the contrary are simply wrong.â But the firm is making changes in response to pressure. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its minimum wage for warehouse workers to $15 (Â£12) after considerable pressure from, among others, potential Democratic presidential nominee, Bernie Sanders. He, along with Californian Congressman Ro Khanna, introduced legislation that would add an additional tax on corporations if their lowest paid employees relied on government programmes, such as food stamps, to make ends meet. The measure was titled Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies, or Stop BEZOS, for short  - a reference to Amazonâs founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. âOrange nightstand on wheelsâ One of the companyâs announcements was Pegasus, a new robot that is being used in the firmâs âsortation centresâ - the last step before a package is handed off to a delivery company. âResembling an orange nightstand on wheels, the two-feet-high, 3-feet-wide Pegasus drive is Amazon's newest robot designed to create greater efficiency in its sortation process so customers can receive their orders even faster,â thefirm said in a blog post,external. An accompanying video showed humans placing packages on to the robot, which then carried it, autonomously, to another location ready to be taken out for delivery. The system is able to work out the quickest route for the robots to take, taking into account the hundreds of other robots moving around at the same time. A âflow control specialistâ monitors the movements of up to 800 Pegasus robots at once. The company also announced it had made Xanthus, an updated version of its pallet-moving robot used in fulfilment centres. The firm said its robots had to date stacked more than 2 billion plastic storage boxes, known as totes. But one task robots still struggle greatly with is picking up individual objects of varying shapes and standards - which is still a key job of the human worker, particularly in the areas of Amazonâs business that deal with food handling. âIt's not humans versus machines at all,â Mr Brady told the BBC. âIt's humans and machines working together to achieve a task.â _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Tibor Nagy, the US assistant secretary for Africa, will ""call for a cessation of attacks against civilians"".

The state department said Mr Nagy would ""urge parties to work towards creating an enabling environment"" for talks between the two sides to resume.

Monday remained quiet in Khartoum, although some businesses started to reopen and a few buses were running.

"Plant extinction 'bad news for all species'Almost 600 plant species have been lost from the wild in the last 250 years, according to a study.Science & EnvironmentComments","Deforestation in Sumatra Almost 600 plant species have been lost from the wild in the last 250 years, according to a comprehensive study. The number is based on actual extinctions rather than estimates, and is twice that of all bird, mammal and amphibian extinctions combined. Scientists say plant extinction is occurring up to 500 times faster than what would be expected naturally. In May, a UN report estimated that one million animal and plant species were threatened with extinction. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Nature's emergency in five graphics What does a biodiversity emergency mean for humans. Researchers say their analysis of all documented plant extinctions in the world shows what lessons can be learned to stop future extinctions. Most people can name a mammal or bird that has become extinct in recent centuries, but few could name an extinct plant, said Dr Aelys Humphreys of Stockholm University. ""This study is the first time we have an overview of what plants have already become extinct, where they have disappeared from and how quickly this is happening,"" she added. St Helena Olive: The tree went extinct in 2003 The lost plants include the Chile sandalwood, which was exploited for essential oils, the banded trinity plant, which spent much of its life underground, and the pink-flowered St Helena olive tree. The biggest losses are on islands and in the tropics, which are home to highly valued timber trees and tend to be particularly rich in plant diversity. Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Stockholm University found that 571 plant species had disappeared in the last two and a half centuries, a number that is more than twice the number of birds, mammals and amphibians recorded as extinct (a combined total of 217 species). This data suggests plant extinction is happening as much as 500 times faster than what would be expected normally, if humans weren't around. The researchers believe even these numbers underestimate the true levels of ongoing plant extinction. One positive, though, was evidence that some plants once thought extinct have been rediscovered, such as the Chilean crocus. The Chilean crocus: Rediscovered in 2001 after years of searching All life on Earth depends on plants, which provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat. Plant extinctions can lead to a whole cascade of extinctions in other organisms that rely on them, for instance insects that use plants for food and for laying their eggs. This video can not be played ""Species are going extinct at a faster rate than we've seen for millions of years"" - Laura Foster reports Plant extinction is bad news for all species, said Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha, co-researcher and conservation scientist at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Herbaria preserve specimens of extinct plants ""Millions of other species depend on plants for their survival, humans included, so knowing which plants we are losing and from where, will feed back into conservation programmes targeting other organisms as well,"" she explained. The researchers are calling for a number of measures to stop plant extinction: Record all the plants across the world Support herbaria, which preserve plant specimens for posterity Support botanists who carry out vital research Teach our children to see and recognise local plants. Dr Rob Salguero-GÃ³mez, of the University of Oxford, who was not part of the study, said understanding the how, where, and why of plant loss was of paramount importance, not only for ecologists but also for human societies. ""We depend on plants directly for food, shade and construction materials, and indirectly for 'ecosystem services' such as carbon fixation, oxygen creation, and even improvement in human mental health through enjoying green spaces,"" he commented.

Sturgeon to hold talks with EU leaders,"Nicola Sturgeon met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has held talks with European leaders as part of a visit to Brussels. Ms Sturgeon met EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier before making a speech on European policy. She said the speech would restate her government's backing for continued EU membership and shared European values. The SNP leader also said the Foreign Office had been ""childish"" for cutting off diplomatic support for the trip. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - one of the candidates for the Conservative leadership - had asked that the Scottish government provide its own logistical support for the visit, due to concerns Ms Sturgeon was using the trip to undermine UK policies on Brexit and promote Scottish independence. Talks over the UK's exit from the EU have been deadlocked for months, and have now taken a back seat to the leadership contest which will decide who replaces Theresa May as prime minister. All 10 candidates in the running have pledged to deliver Brexit,but are divided on how and when to do so. Ahead of her speech at the European Policy Centre, Ms Sturgeon said people in Scotland had ""shown that they comprehensively reject Brexit and want to remain as a European nation"". She added: ""Membership of the EU not only has huge economic benefits for Scotland, but is the basis of the core values we share around democracy, equality, co-operation and human rights. ""My engagements in Brussels are an opportunity to outline the Scottish government's support for those values and how they contribute to a better Scotland, Europe and wider world. ""On issues such as climate change and tackling inequality we can all work together to ensure the wellbeing of our citizens, as well as the wealth of member states."" Analysis by BBC Scotland chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland is open to Europe - is the feeling mutual? During the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the EU was not exactly neutral. The then European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barosso, suggested it would be ""extremely difficult"" for Scotland to become an independent member of the EU. But Brexit - and the possibility of a no deal departure by the UK - appears to be changing some minds in Brussels. One EU official told me there had been a ""paradigm shift"" in attitudes to Scottish independence in Brussels since the EU referendum. That is to say that if Scotland voted to leave the UK after Brexit, the EU might be more accommodating. It doesn't mean an independent Scotland could choose its own terms or avoid either an application process or hard choices over its border arrangements with England. But it is, as the first minister put it, a different ""vibe"". That may be of concern to the UK government, which has decided to withhold practical support, such as an official car, for Nicola Sturgeon on this visit. The first minister said that was ""petty"" but the UK insisted its effort and resources must be focussed on its own objectives. Those do not include reversing Brexit or independence for Scotland, for which Ms Sturgeon is actively campaigning. Ms Sturgeon is making the visit without diplomatic support from the Foreign Office, which is customarily offered for trips abroad. A spokesman for the UK government said that ""a balance must be struck to avoid supporting activities intended to campaign for policies contrary to the government's position"". He said that Mr Hunt had ""requested that the Scottish government provide its own logistical support, adding: ""As a responsible government, we must be certain that our effort and resources overseas are focused on furthering the objectives of Her Majesty's Government."" Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that the move was ""pretty childish and pathetic"". She said: ""It's not causing me to lose any sleep, it's not making any real practical difference to my meetings here today, but I think it offers a bit of a window into what's going on in the Tory party right now. ""Not only are they ignoring Scotland's interests, they're trying to undermine the Scottish government in trying to stand up for those interests. It's quite a remarkable and extraordinary state of affairs.""

"Human staff will always be needed, Amazon insistsRobots cannot do everything, Amazon tells the BBC, but there is concern over the jobs that remain.Technology","This video can not be played ""You need both"" - Amazon's Tye Brady on robotics replacing humans Amazonâs warehouses will always need human staff, the firmâs chief robotics technologist has told the BBC. The company said it had deployed more than 200,000 warehouse robots working in around 50 of its locations. But despite Amazon investing heavily in advanced robotics, Tye Brady said the firmâs centres would never reach the point where they could be fully automated. âNot at all. One ounce of my body just doesnât see that,â he said. âThe way that I think about this is a symphony of humans and machines working together, you need both. âThe challenge that we have in front of us is how do we smartly design our machines to extend human capability.â Mr Brady was speaking to the BBC at Re:Mars, an Amazon event intended to showcase the firmâs latest work in machine learning, automation, robotics and space. He told the BBC the suggestion that robotics and AI would replace humans was a âmythâ. âIt's a reframing of your relationship with machines, right? âYou extend human capability. And when you gain productivity, then you have the ability to create new jobs that were unimaginable five years ago.â âStop BEZOS Actâ But the nature of those jobs has been harshly criticised. The UK-based GMB trade union organised a worker strike last November, describing conditions for employees at Amazonâs warehouses as âinhumanâ. âThey are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,â said GMB General Secretary Tim Roache in a statement. âWeâre standing up and saying enough is enough, these are people making Amazon its money. People with kids, homes, bills to pay - theyâre not robots.â In response, Amazon at the time said: âAll of our sites are safe places to work and reports to the contrary are simply wrong.â But the firm is making changes in response to pressure. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its minimum wage for warehouse workers to $15 (Â£12) after considerable pressure from, among others, potential Democratic presidential nominee, Bernie Sanders. He, along with Californian Congressman Ro Khanna, introduced legislation that would add an additional tax on corporations if their lowest paid employees relied on government programmes, such as food stamps, to make ends meet. The measure was titled Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies, or Stop BEZOS, for short  - a reference to Amazonâs founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. âOrange nightstand on wheelsâ One of the companyâs announcements was Pegasus, a new robot that is being used in the firmâs âsortation centresâ - the last step before a package is handed off to a delivery company. âResembling an orange nightstand on wheels, the two-feet-high, 3-feet-wide Pegasus drive is Amazon's newest robot designed to create greater efficiency in its sortation process so customers can receive their orders even faster,â thefirm said in a blog post,external. An accompanying video showed humans placing packages on to the robot, which then carried it, autonomously, to another location ready to be taken out for delivery. The system is able to work out the quickest route for the robots to take, taking into account the hundreds of other robots moving around at the same time. A âflow control specialistâ monitors the movements of up to 800 Pegasus robots at once. The company also announced it had made Xanthus, an updated version of its pallet-moving robot used in fulfilment centres. The firm said its robots had to date stacked more than 2 billion plastic storage boxes, known as totes. But one task robots still struggle greatly with is picking up individual objects of varying shapes and standards - which is still a key job of the human worker, particularly in the areas of Amazonâs business that deal with food handling. âIt's not humans versus machines at all,â Mr Brady told the BBC. âIt's humans and machines working together to achieve a task.â _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Operators urge UK to clarify position over HuaweiMobile operators have written a letter asking the government to decide the role Huawei can play in 5G.Business,"The UK risks losing its position as a world leader in mobile connectivity, Britain's mobile operators are warning. In a draft letter to Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill, seen by the BBC, operators will urge the government to clarify its position over Huawei. The letter asks for an urgent meeting between industry leaders and the government to discuss their concerns. Operators say they can't invest in infrastructure while uncertainty over the use of Chinese technology persists. The companies are planning to send the letter to government as soon as this week. Huawei: 'We stand naked in front of the world' China warns of investment blow to UK over 5G ban Huawei: US blacklist will harm billions of consumers They are concerned at the government's inability to decide whether Huawei technology will be approved for use in new 5G networks. A government spokesperson said: ""The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance.

""The Telecoms Supply Chain Review will be announced in due course. We have been clear throughout the process that all network operators will need to comply with the government's decision."" Huawei is the world's leading supplier of next generation connectivity equipment, but it has faced a backlash from the US. The US government has alreadybanned the use of Huawei technologyafter citing concerns that the company may present a security threat by allowing the Chinese government a way to snoop on critical infrastructure. The US has also threatened to limit intelligence co-operation with any country that allows Huawei equipment to be used in its own networks. Earlier this year there were unconfirmed reports that the government was considering allowing Huawei equipment into the periphery of new mobile networks, but not into the ""core"" of systems that could end up managing crucial services such as hospitals, police forces and the energy network.

Stewart warns Tory rivals over 'electoral bribes',"This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom: ""Labour governments always destroy incentives to work hard and prosper"" Leaving the EU by the end of October is a ""hard red line"" and will happen in ""all circumstances"", Andrea Leadsom has said in her pitch for leadership. The ex-Commons leader said she had a plan for a ""managed exit"", adding that Parliament could ""not stop us leaving"". But her rival Mark Harper said it was ""not possible"" to leave by 31 October, and Rory Stewart said talk of a better deal on the table was a ""fairy story"". Ten Conservative candidates are in the race to be leader - and the next PM. The deadline for Brexit was pushed back to October after MPs rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with Brussels three times. Where do the candidates stand on Brexit? Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? Latest updates: The race for Number 10 The European Union has repeatedly said the agreement will not be re-opened, and on Tuesday, president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that once again. ""This is not a treaty between Theresa May and Juncker, this is a treaty between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he told a Politico event in Brussels. ""It has to be respected by whomsoever will be the next British prime minister."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saidit was a ""terrible political miscalculation"" for UK politicians to believe they can get a better deal. This video can not be played Rory Stewart: We have a choice between fairy stories and realism ""In all circumstances we are leaving the European Union on 31 October,"" Mrs Leadsom told her official campaign launch. ""Our country and our party cannot afford any more indecisiveness."" The Brexiteer MP set out her plan for what she calls a ""managed exit"" from the EU, which includes striking a ""temporary trade agreement"" and a plan to negotiate contingency arrangements with Brussels over the summer recess. She said these could be discussed at a summit with the new incoming EU commissioners and heads of government in September. This video can not be played Mark Harper says the UK needs more time to sort a Brexit deal But at his official campaign launch, Mr Harper - an outsider in the race - said it was ""not possible or credible"" to leave on the terms of a new deal by the existing deadline of 31 October. Renegotiating and getting a deal past MPs would take longer, he said. He said there could be a majority in the Commons to leave without a deal, but only if ministers demonstrated they had ""strained every sinew"" to get a new one. Raab reaching over 55s on Facebook Leadsom would 'never say never' to indyref2 Meanwhile, Health Secretary Mr Hancock - who is also competing for the top job - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme his plan was ""eminently deliverable"" by 31 October, as the EU was open to changingthe political declaration part of the agreement. ""We need to solve Brexit and we cannot do it by threatening no deal,"" he said, adding: ""Parliament will not allow a no-deal Brexit to happen."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid reiterated that although he wanted a revised deal, ""if we got to end of October and the choice was between no deal or no Brexit, I'd pick no deal."" Later in the day, launching his campaign in a circus tent in London, Rory Stewart - another outsider - said he wanted to ""take the politics out"" of the situation and find a way to get Mrs May's deal through Parliament. He said he would ramp up pressure on MPs to back it by promising that otherwise, he would convene a ""grand jury"" of citizens to make recommendations on how to proceed which politicians would have to stick to. Vowing to hold the UK together and reconcile ""extreme Remain and extreme Brexit"" arguments, he added: ""My project is about one thing - it is about moderation and compromise."" At her official launch, Mrs Leadsom introduced several policies away from Brexit, including using overseas development aid to help poorer countries to decarbonise and helping young people to save for a house deposit with a new scheme. When questioned on taxes -prompted by Boris Johnson's pledge to cut income taxfor those who earn more than Â£50,000 a year - she said she believed in low taxes. But tax reform could not get through a hung Parliament, so that ""needs to wait"". Taking a swipe at Mr Johnson's idea, Mr Harper said he would focus his tax cuts ""at the lower end of the spectrum"", adding: ""I don't think we should be promising more money to higher rate taxpayers."" He also said the lack of a majority meant certain things would not be deliverable and as Brexit showed, it was ""toxic"" to make promises and not fulfil them. The winner of the leadership contest will become next Conservative leader and prime minister. They're due to be in place by the week beginning 22 July. Find out about all the candidates BBC to host Tory leader TV debates Mr Javid, who launches his campaign on Wednesday,released a campaign video,externalwhich BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described as the first big attempt by a candidate to communicate a personal story, introducing viewers to his family and background. He also told the Evening Standard,externalhe was ""very open minded"" about having different immigration rules for regions such as London after Brexit, and could scrap Mrs May's policy that EU migrants should earn at least Â£30,000 to be considered for admission. Mr Johnson - accused by Michael Gove and other candidates of ""hiding in his bunker"" because he is yet to a do a major event or TV interview - is also launching his campaign on Wednesday. It's day two of the official campaign to be the next prime minister. Andrea Leadsom cheerily launched her campaign, promising she would never utter the phrase ""as a mother"" that did for her chances last time. As promised, the former chief whip Mark Harper was jacket off, sleeves rolled up, answering any question that journalists were willing to put. That included - because the early stages of this campaign are this surreal - predicting in a fight between a lion and a bear that the lion, patriotically, would win. (yes, you read that right). And TV presenter Lorraine Kelly was back - this time with a slapdown of the whole lot of the political class. But the hard reality bites today too.Labour has just announcedthat they are leading another cross-party attempt to grab control of the Commons. Just in case the candidates needed a reminder of what they'll inherit, the politician who wins this race might find that MPs have changed the law to kill off their solution to Brexit before they even call the removal vans to move their stuff to Number 10. Read more from Laura. Ten Conservative candidates will contest Thursday's first round of voting after nominations closed in the contest to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader and prime minister. Over the next two weeks, Tory MPs will take part in a series of secret ballots to whittle the candidates down to the final two. The party's 160,000 or so members will then pick a winner in a postal ballot, with the result announced in the penultimate week of July.

Do Tory leadership tax plans add up?,"In the race to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative party and prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are setting out how they want to run the UK. They have both announced taxation and spending plans. So, what are the details and do their sums add up? People would only start to pay the higher rate of income tax when they earn at least Â£80,000, under Boris Johnson's plans The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan, the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not affect Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the ceiling for NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and it is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost due to national insurance increases). Is there a Brexit war chest? Hammond calls for honesty on spending pledges Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay national insurance to begin with. So if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only will they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also won't be affected by the national insurance rise. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost around Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from the Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been ear-marked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can only be spent once. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson will need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Raise public sector pay and increase school funding What it means:A leading supporter of Mr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, told the Times that the days of public sector pay freezes under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and rises were capped at 1% in 2013. The government announced an end to the pay cap in 2017, and some public sector workers have negotiated increases above 1% since then. The candidate himself has declined to specify by how much he would increase pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He has also pledged to fund increased investment in special needs education, as part of a Â£4.6bn boost to overall school funding. The cost:We don't know by how much Mr Johnson wants to increase public sector pay, butthe IFS says,externalthat each 1% increase in pay for the public sector workforce costs the government about Â£1.8bn a year. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022 What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson plans to reverse almost all of those cuts on the basis that ""more people on our streets means more people are kept safe"". There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson gave a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas around Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year, but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes around two years. Typically, after four years, the pay would increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m, but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be around Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers, but again, this will differ from force to force. Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says that they would recruit special constables, who are trained as police officers but work part time, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Cut corporation tax to 12.5% What it means:From April 2020, instead of paying 17% tax on their profits, companies would pay 12.5%. The foreign secretary is in favour of cutting the rate of corporation tax - the tax that companies pay on their profits - to 12.5%, which is the same rate as in the Republic of Ireland. The government is already planning a series of cuts to corporation tax, which was cut from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017, and is scheduled to fall to 17% next year. The idea of cutting it by another 4.5 percentage pointscame in a report,externalby another Conservative MP at the end of May. The cost:The government estimates the policy would cost about Â£14bn a year. That cost would be reduced if future tax takes were to be boosted by companies being attracted to move to the UK to take advantage of the lower tax rate, or if companies use the money saved to pay higher wages or invest it in improving their productivity. How much that would reduce the cost is very hard to predict. The plan:Take 90% of businesses out of business rates What it means:Business rates are a local tax paid on the use of buildings for non-domestic purposes. The cost:We haven't seen any formal costings of this policy, but in the2018 Budget, Philip Hammonddecided to give a one-third discount on business rates to high street retail businesses with a rateable value below Â£51,000 in 2019-20 and 2020-21. The Treasury said that would benefit 90% of high street retail businesses. The Office for Budget Responsibility said,externalthe discount would cost Â£490m this year and Â£450m next year. It means we can estimate that a 100% cut for those businesses would cost an extra Â£900m next year and about Â£1.35bn a year after that. Business rates are currently collected by local authorities, which retain half of the money. Central government is reimbursing them for the one-third cut and would presumably also reimburse them for the 100% cut. The plan:Increase annual investment allowance to Â£5m What it means:If you are running a business and you buy equipment such as computers or machinery, you can deduct the amount you spend on it from your profits to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. There is a limit,externalto the amount you can deduct, which is called the annual investment allowance. At the start of this year it was raised from Â£200,000 to Â£1m for two years. The cost:We do not have a costing for this measure either, but to get an idea of the amounts of money involved,the OBR said,externalthe temporary increase to Â£1m would cost Â£600m this year. The plan:Money for fishing, farming and defence What it means:Jeremy Hunt would increase spending on defence from its current level of 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP - the sum of everything the UK produces each year) to 2.5% of GDP by 2023-4. He has also said he would have a ""relief programme"" for the fishing and farming sectors to help them deal with the effects of a possible no-deal Brexit. The cost:The boost to defence spending would cost Â£15bn a year by 2023-4. The relief for fishing and farming would cost Â£6bn. Mr Hunt says his overall plans would ""kick-start the economy and create extra growth"", which would mean the government had extra money to spend. But the disruption involved in leaving the EU with no deal is widely expected to reduce growth - at least initially - which would mean that increased taxes or borrowing or reduced spending in other areas would be required to fund the extra spending.

"Human staff will always be needed, Amazon insistsRobots cannot do everything, Amazon tells the BBC, though there is concern over the jobs which remain.Technology","This video can not be played ""You need both"" - Amazon's Tye Brady on robotics replacing humans Amazonâs warehouses will always need human staff, the firmâs chief robotics technologist has told the BBC. The company said it had deployed more than 200,000 warehouse robots working in around 50 of its locations. But despite Amazon investing heavily in advanced robotics, Tye Brady said the firmâs centres would never reach the point where they could be fully automated. âNot at all. One ounce of my body just doesnât see that,â he said. âThe way that I think about this is a symphony of humans and machines working together, you need both. âThe challenge that we have in front of us is how do we smartly design our machines to extend human capability.â Mr Brady was speaking to the BBC at Re:Mars, an Amazon event intended to showcase the firmâs latest work in machine learning, automation, robotics and space. He told the BBC the suggestion that robotics and AI would replace humans was a âmythâ. âIt's a reframing of your relationship with machines, right? âYou extend human capability. And when you gain productivity, then you have the ability to create new jobs that were unimaginable five years ago.â âStop BEZOS Actâ But the nature of those jobs has been harshly criticised. The UK-based GMB trade union organised a worker strike last November, describing conditions for employees at Amazonâs warehouses as âinhumanâ. âThey are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,â said GMB General Secretary Tim Roache in a statement. âWeâre standing up and saying enough is enough, these are people making Amazon its money. People with kids, homes, bills to pay - theyâre not robots.â In response, Amazon at the time said: âAll of our sites are safe places to work and reports to the contrary are simply wrong.â But the firm is making changes in response to pressure. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its minimum wage for warehouse workers to $15 (Â£12) after considerable pressure from, among others, potential Democratic presidential nominee, Bernie Sanders. He, along with Californian Congressman Ro Khanna, introduced legislation that would add an additional tax on corporations if their lowest paid employees relied on government programmes, such as food stamps, to make ends meet. The measure was titled Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies, or Stop BEZOS, for short  - a reference to Amazonâs founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. âOrange nightstand on wheelsâ One of the companyâs announcements was Pegasus, a new robot that is being used in the firmâs âsortation centresâ - the last step before a package is handed off to a delivery company. âResembling an orange nightstand on wheels, the two-feet-high, 3-feet-wide Pegasus drive is Amazon's newest robot designed to create greater efficiency in its sortation process so customers can receive their orders even faster,â thefirm said in a blog post,external. An accompanying video showed humans placing packages on to the robot, which then carried it, autonomously, to another location ready to be taken out for delivery. The system is able to work out the quickest route for the robots to take, taking into account the hundreds of other robots moving around at the same time. A âflow control specialistâ monitors the movements of up to 800 Pegasus robots at once. The company also announced it had made Xanthus, an updated version of its pallet-moving robot used in fulfilment centres. The firm said its robots had to date stacked more than 2 billion plastic storage boxes, known as totes. But one task robots still struggle greatly with is picking up individual objects of varying shapes and standards - which is still a key job of the human worker, particularly in the areas of Amazonâs business that deal with food handling. âIt's not humans versus machines at all,â Mr Brady told the BBC. âIt's humans and machines working together to achieve a task.â _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?
