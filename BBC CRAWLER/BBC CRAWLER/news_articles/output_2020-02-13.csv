Space probe 'transforms planet formation theory',"The Kuiper belt object Arrokoth is a pristine remnant of planet formation in action Scientists say they have ""decisively"" overturned the prevailing theory for how planets in our Solar System formed. The established view is that material violently crashed together to form ever larger clumps until they became worlds. New results suggest the process was less catastrophic - with matter gently clumping together instead. The study appears in Science journal and has been presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle. The study's lead researcher, Dr Alan Stern, said that the discovery was of ""stupendous magnitude"". 'Snowman' shape of distant Ultima revealed Distant object 'like nothing seen before' The moment Alan Stern (L) had confirmation that New Horizons had flown by the Kuiper Belt object ""There was the prevailing theory from the late 1960s of violent collisions and a more recent emerging theory of gentle accumulation. One is dust and the other is the only one standing. This rarely happens in planetary science, but today we have settled the matter,"" he told BBC News. The claim arises from detailed study of an object in the outer reaches of the Solar System. Named Arrokoth, the object is more than six billion km from the Sun in a region called the Kuiper belt. It is a pristine remnant of planet formation in action as the Solar System emerged 4.6 billion years ago, with two bodies combining to form a larger one. Scientists obtained high-resolution pictures of Arrokoth when Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft flew close to it just over a year ago. It gave scientists their first opportunity to test which of the two competing theories was correct: did the two components crash together or was there gentle contact? The analysis by Dr Stern and his team could find no evidence of violent impact. The researchers found no stress fractures, nor was there any flattening, indicating that the objects were squashed together gently. ""This is completely decisive,"" said Dr Stern. ""In one fell swoop, the flyby of Arrokoth was able to decide between the two theories."" The newer gentle clumping theory was developed 15 years ago by Prof Anders Johansen He is bullish because these so-called Kuiper belt objects have largely remained the same since the formation of the Solar System. They are, in effect, perfectly preserved fossils from this distant time. The newer gentle clumping theory was developed 15 years ago by Prof Anders Johansen at Lund Observatory in Sweden. At the time he was a young PhD student. The idea emerged from computer simulations. After speaking to Dr Stern, I broke the news to Prof Johansen that his theory had been confirmed. There was a pause on the line before he replied that he ""felt great"". He added: ""It is a special moment. I remember when I was a PhD student and feeling very nervous about these new results because they were very different to the ones before. I was worried that there was an error in my code or that I had made a calculation error. ""And then when you see these results confirmed from actual observations it is a real relief."" Anders Johansen marks the confirmation of his theory with his daughter Laura Prof Johansen commemorated the occasion with a pizza and coke with his family. Engineer Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, who co-presents the BBC's Sky at Night programme, cautioned against toppling a theory based on the observation of one object, but said that Dr Stern's interpretation ""makes a lot of sense"". ""It is nice to have this evidence because the crashing together theory was a nice theory, but there were some challenges to it. Why did the objects stick together and not bounce apart. There was a lot that didn't add up."" When Arrokoth was discovered six years ago, it was known only by its designation 2014 MU69. At the time of the New Horizons flyby, it had been given the informal name Ultima Thule. While that name came from a classical and medieval term for a far-off place at the borders of the known world, its use by Nazi occultists as the mythical homeland of the Aryan race caused controversy. The official name Arrokoth is a Native American term meaning ""sky"" in the Powhatan/Algonquian language.

'Organised crime' behind rise in large fly-tipping,"This video can not be played Tackling the fly-tippers who dump by the truckload Organised criminal gangs are being blamed for the continued rise of large fly-tipping incidents across England. Experts said fake companies hired out buildings to dump clients' waste, costing local authorities almost Â£60m in clean-up costs since 2012. Parts of London and Manchester have been hardest hit by a growing ""crisis"" in illegal waste removal services. The government says the rise in incidents could be down to better recording. Countryside Alliance head of policy Sarah Lee said tougher sentences were needed to address the crisis. Thousands of tonnes of illegal waste have been dumped in a warehouse in Staffordshire She said: ""You are now getting fake waste companies hiring out buildings, dumping waste in them, doing a runner and leaving it for landowners to dispose of the waste at huge cost to them."" Gangs will pose as legitimate waste disposal businesses, advertising their services on the internet for a cost, she added. The BBC Shared Data Unit found: Large-scale fly-tipping - defined as tipper lorry load or more in size - has more than doubled in six years Last year, councils faced a Â£12.8m bill to clear more than 36,200 large tips That accounted for more than a fifth of the overall cost of clearing fly-tips Marc Lidderth, an area manager for the Environment Agency, said fly-tipping crime was ""the new narcotics"". The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said new figures highlighted a ""nightmare"" situation that continued to ""spiral out of control"". Allow Twitter content?

It said criminals were using lock-cutting tools to break into private land and tip vast quantities of waste that can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to clear. Bogus waste companies also try to rent buildings or land and dump lorry loads of rubbish. In some instances, they go to great lengths to disguise their activities,compacting the waste into plastic wrapping, then taking it to open land and building it into haystack shapes. Keep Britain Tidy's Allison Ogden-Newton called on the government to do more Local authorities need to be properly resourced to tackle large-scale crime, according to Keep Britain Tidy chief executive Allison Ogden-Newton. ""It's time for the new government to get serious on mass fly-tipping, make it harder for criminals to trade, and give local authorities the resources they need,"" she added. Mountain of rubbish dumped by railway Fake firm dumped tonnes of waste But some, including the Country, Land and Business Association (CLA) director general Sarah Hendry, say the introduction of fees at many recycling centres had brought about the rise of organised criminal fly-tipping. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said waste crime was becoming more organised, involving ""networks of career criminals"", and tackling this type of illegal activity was complex. In 2019, local authorities were given the power to issue penalties of up to Â£400 to householders who pass waste to an unlicensed carrier and whose waste is then found fly-tipped. More than half of all local authorities in England posted an increase in the number of large fly-tipping incidents recorded between 2011-12 and 2018-19. Manchester City Council recorded the most large incidents in five out of the eight years where data was available, averaging 1,672 clean-ups a year. In response, the local authority said it had a dedicated environmental crimes team and had recently invested an extra Â£500,000 into fly-tipping prevention and enforcement. It also disputed the figures, saying they relate to reports rather than recorded offences. Many incidents could have also been double counted, it said. A spokesman for the authority said: ""Given that Manchester offers a free annual bulky waste collection service, there are no excuses for using a 'man with a van'."" Croydon, in south London, had the highest average annual number of large incidents per capita, according toofficial data published by the government.,external The area also saw the biggest increase in large fly-tip across the eight-year period, recording five such incidents in 2011-12, but 3,948 in 2018-19. Croydon Council said the majority of those incidents were reported by residents on its waste app.  It said its waste contractor collected 50 major fly-tips last year. A spokesman said it was proactive in its work to reduce fly-tipping and was tough on those who commit environmental crime. It said new powers to seize vehicles had been an excellent tool and the council had confiscated 42 over the last four years. In contrast, Wales, where a national awareness campaign called Fly-tipping Action Wales is in place, has seen large fly-tipping decrease since 2012. Data for Northern Ireland and Scotland was not publically available. One Croydon resident told the BBC that large-scale tipping was a major issue there. Elizabeth Ash, of Croydon Communities Consortium, said: ""You get into the car, start driving and, after a while, you know you've left Croydon just by looking out of the window. ""You think, 'Oh - we're in Lambeth now. There's no rubbish on the streets anymore'."" Mrs Ash said she had had rubbish tipped outside her house during the night. ""It was rubble and electrical appliances - another authority's bins full of builders' waste - tipped from the back of a lorry, presumably driving at speed. ""I awoke to the noise, looked out of the window and there was a huge plume of dust filling the air."" Initiatives being used by some local authorities in a bid to tackle the problem include landscaping to block access to hotspots and 'wall of shame' web pages, which share images of local fly-tippers with the public. In 2018-19, for the first time, two local authorities each issued a fine of more than Â£50,000 for fly-tipping. A business and its director were caught by Harrow Council dumping seven-and-a-half tonnes of waste on Hatch End playing fields. Triangle Care and Maintenance was ordered to pay more than Â£51,000 for the criminal venture. Persistent fly-tipping on the fields - where on each occasion a mound of household and refurbishment waste was dumped - led to the council installing hidden cameras and tracing the vehicle by its registration number. Council enforcement officers planted several items - one of them a marked can - among the rubbish in the back of the van after later spotting it parked on the street. Triangle Care and Maintenance was fined Â£50,000 for dumping building waste in Harrow. The cameras then captured the offenders in action, clearly identifying their faces and the van as the waste was dumped late at night. The marked can was found to be among the dumped waste. Earlier this year, Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said organised crime gangs linked to slavery, drugs and firearms were exploiting the waste industry in massive fraud and fly-tipping schemes. The agency is responsible for clearing larger scale fly-tips on public land, though it bills the cost to the local authority. An agency spokesman told the BBC: ""Waste crime is an unacceptable blight on our environment, estimated to cost the UK economy at least Â£600m a year and put communities at risk. ""We are determined to bring waste criminals to justice, which is why anyone found guilty could face jail time or a hefty fine. In the last year, we closed down over 900 illegal waste sites, brought forward 113 prosecutions and launched a Joint Unit on Waste Crime to bring down the most serious and organised criminal groups."" The joint unit brings together police forces, the National Crime Agency, the Environment Agency, HMRC and Natural Resources Wales. The agency encourages anyone who has witnessed waste crime to report it to the incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60. Tonnes of waste were found dumped on the Nottinghamshire border The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.

"Labour calls for probe into Johnson's Â£15,000 holiday","Boris Johnson took a holiday on the island of Mustique with partner Carrie Symonds after Christmas Labour has called for an investigation into who funded Boris Johnson's Caribbean holiday over the New Year. TheMPs' register of interests,externalstated the accommodation had a ""value"" of Â£15,000 and was covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross. Mr Ross initially said he had not paid for the holiday, but in a clarification insisted the register ""is correct"" and he had ""facilitated accommodation"". Downing Street said the trip had been properly registered. The prime minister took the holiday to Mustique, a private island that is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines, with girlfriend Carrie Symonds between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. Labour's Jon Trickett has now asked the parliamentary commissioner for standards to investigate who paid for it. In a letter to the watchdog, the shadow Cabinet Office minister said: ""The code of conduct requires members to provide the name of the person or organisation that actually funded a donation."" He said that the ""evidence suggests it was not David Ross"" who funded the donation and that the entry made by the prime minister in the MPs' register of interests ""appears to be incorrect"". David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, at a photography exhibition in 2011 Mr Trickett said a number of questions needed ""urgently answering"", including ""the true source of the Â£15,000 donation"" and ""did the PM knowingly make a false entry into the register"". ""Transparency is crucial to ensuring that the public have confidence that elected Members of this House have not been unduly influence by any donations or gifts that they may receive,"" he added. Mr Johnson's entry in the register of interests says Mr Ross donated accommodation ""for a private holiday for my partner and me, value Â£15,000"". But a spokesman for Mr Rosstold the Daily Mail:,external""Boris wanted some help to find somewhere in Mustique, David called the company who run all the villas and somebody had dropped out. ""So Boris got the use of a villa that was worth Â£15,000, but David Ross did not pay any monies whatsoever for this."" A later statement from the spokesman added: ""Mr Ross facilitated accommodation for Mr Johnson on Mustique valued at Â£15,000. ""Therefore this is a benefit in kind from Mr Ross to Mr Johnson, and Mr Johnson's declaration to the House of Commons is correct."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""All transparency requirements have been followed, as set out in the Register of Members' Financial Interests"". A spokeswoman for the standards commissioner said the office could not confirm whether an investigation had been opened into the prime minister. She explained this was due to a decision by MPs in 2018 to allow colleagues being investigated to remain anonymous. Mr Ross has not provided any further details as to what he means, in this context, by a 'benefit in kind.' But sources in Westminster have suggested to me that this could refer to some sort of swap whereby David Ross agreed to give up his own property - at a later date - in order to facilitate the prime minister's stay elsewhere on the island. And, I'm told, that there was no kind of cash donation. But until there's total clarity, from Downing Street, the questions will keep coming. Such as, whose villa did Boris Johnson stay at? And opposition parties may not wish to miss the chance of pointing out that the PM didn't pay for at least part of his own holiday. Mr Ross was one of Mr Johnson's aides in City Hall and was appointed to the Olympics organising committee. But he resigned from the roles, and his company, over a share scandal in 2008. It emerged Mr Ross had used millions of pounds' worth of Carphone Warehouse shares as collateral against personal loans without informing the company's other directors - a potential breach of City rules at the time. Mr Ross has been a long-standing donor to the Conservative Party, pledging Â£250,000 in the last election campaign. Mr Johnson faced criticism over his holiday for not returning sooner,after the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimaniraised tensions in the Middle East. In April 2019 Mr Johnson was rebukedby the parliamentary commissioner for standards for failing to register a share of a Somerset property within 28 days of acquiring it.

Number of women killed at highest level since 2006,"Mary Annie Sowerby, Aliny Godinho, Elize Stevens, Alison Hunt, Asma Begum and Dorothy Bowyer were among the women killed last year The number of female homicide victims in England and Wales has risen to the highest level since 2006. There were 241 female victims of murder, manslaughter and infanticide in the 12 months to the end of March 2019, up 10% on the previous year. The number of separate homicide incidents rose to 662, up from 644 the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, the overall number of victims fell to 671. This was 33, or 5%, fewer than the previous year. It represents the first fall since 2015, although this was partly due to those killed in the London and Manchester terror attacks and the Shoreham air crash being included in the 2018 figures. The ONS said the year-on-year decline was driven by a fall in male victims - down 11%, from 484 to 429. The number of black homicide victims was the highest in 17 years - totalling 97 in 2018/19. Domestic killings reach five-year high The faces of 2019's 100 knife crime victims The murders of women giving Europe a wake-up call The majority of homicide victims (64%) were male, while just over a third (36%) were female. Almost half (48%) of female victims were killed in a domestic homicide, with the suspect a partner or ex-partner in 38% of cases. One of these was Kay Richardson, 49, who was beaten and strangled to death by her estranged husband Alan Martin, 53, in September 2018, just days after he had been arrested for allegedly raping her. He had been released under investigation by police, without any restrictions. This video can not be played ""We are haunted by what happened to Kay' The number of baby girls and toddlers killed in the period also reached a decade high, with homicide victims including 14 females under the age of one and 13 toddlers aged between one and four. These are the highest numbers since the earliest available figures, when six female babies and eight children aged between one and four were killed in the year to March 2009. Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has campaigned on domestic violence, said the figures were ""horrendous"" but an ""inevitability"" in light of cuts to public services. The ""degradation of police resources"", a ""crumbling criminal justice system"" and cuts to council services which have affected routes out of danger for women trying to escape abusive relationships have all played a factor, she said. Ms Phillips added that the number of suspects being released under investigation with no restrictions on their movements by police, rather than with stricter bail conditions, was of particular concern. The Victims' Commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, said the number of women killed by a partner or ex-partner was ""not surprising"" but ""deeply troubling"". ""In the name of these women we need urgently to take more action on early intervention,"" she said. Crime Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was recruiting 20,000 new police officers and ensuring violent and sexual offenders spent longer behind bars to help protect the public. He said the figures were a ""stark reminder of the devastating impact of domestic abuse"" andthe Domestic Abuse Bill, which the government plans to reintroduce to Parliament, would also provide greater protections for victims. The bill would place a legal duty on councils to offer secure homes to those fleeing violence, as well as introducing a government definition of domestic abuse, including emotional and financial abuse, and a commissioner to hold government to account.

Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election. There was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Who's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places. Boris Johnson's election win in December secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. While his election campaign promised to ""get Brexit done"", Mr Johnson has said his ""one nation government"" will also ""massively increase investment in the NHS"". Mr Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, having served as foreign secretary since 2016 in what was only his first cabinet post. His views on how to deliver Brexit brought him into conflict with Mrs May, and led to his resignation in 2018. Rishi Sunak replaces Sajid Javid, who resigned as Chancellor during the reshuffle on Thursday. Appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July, Rishi Sunakâs status as a rising star was highlighted when he was sent to stand in for Boris Johnson at the BBCâs seven-party election debate. He was previously a successful businessman, co-founding a large investment firm. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy daughter of an Indian billionaire. The couple lived in California for a number of years before coming back to the UK. They now have two daughters. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Dominic Raab was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet in July and remains in post. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. He is married with two sons. Michael Gove is the cabinet minister with the most experience - but his aspirations for the top job are well known. He lost out to Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership campaign in summer 2019. Mr Gove became environment secretary in June 2017 and proved a key advocate of Theresa Mayâs Brexit deal, while other Brexiteer cabinet ministers resigned. In 2016, he famously scuppered the leadership hopes of his friend Boris Johnson, by announcing his own candidature on the morning of Johnson's own campaign launch. Mr Gove was a key ally of former Prime Minister David Cameron and has served as MP for Surrey Heath since 2005. He made his name as a radical education secretary, bringing in major changes to exams and the curriculum and battling teaching unions during his four years in the role. Appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson last July, Ben Wallace previously served as security minister. Mr Wallace backed Remain in 2016 and has warned that leaving the EU without a deal would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public. After training at Sandhurst, Mr Wallace joined the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. He spent eight years in the Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. Liz Truss was made international trade secretary and also women and equalities minister when Boris Johnson took office and remains in that role. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Mr Hancock remains in post as health secretary. At 40, he was youngest contender in the Tory leadership race in the summer of 2019. He quit the contest a day after he came sixth in the first ballot and later endorsed Boris Johnson. The ambitious MP for West Suffolk was promoted to health secretary in 2018 after only a few months as culture secretary. He campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum but backed both Theresa May's and Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. The former Bank of England economist likes to see himself as one of the most technology-savvy politicians at Westminster - he was the first MP to have his own smartphone app. Gavin Williamson made a swift return to the cabinet last July following his sacking by Theresa May two months earlier after row over the leaking of information from the National Security Council. Mr Williamson is influential within the Tory party, having served as a ministerial aide to David Cameron and then as chief whip, in charge of party discipline. At that time, he famously kept a tarantula named Cronus on his desk in the House of Commons. Mr Williamson, who backed remain in the EU referendum, also helped to run Boris Johnsonâs campaign in the first phase of the Tory leadership contest last summer. The 41-year old MP for Hertsmere is a rising star in the Conservative ranks and replaces Nicky Morgan as Culture Secretary. Since last summer, he has been a minister in the Cabinet Office â playing a key role working with No 10 in implementing government policy. Before becoming an MP, the Cambridge-educated law graduate worked in public relations and cut his teeth in the Conservative Research Department. He then worked as an adviser to David Cameron, becoming his deputy chief of staff in Downing Street. He subsequently received a CBE for his services. In his maiden speech, he told the House of Commons he could make a legitimate claim to be the MP for TV soap Eastendersâ Albert Square, as it was filmed in his constituency. During his five years in the Commons, he has campaigned on greater legal protection for the Green Belt, more money for education and simplification of the tax system. The former International Development Secretary replaces Andrea Leadsom. The MP for Reading West backed Boris Johnson for prime minister and joined the cabinet in July 2019. Mr Sharma will also be the minister responsible for the Glasgow COP26 climate summit in November. Prior to being elected in 2010, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked in banking. He is married with two daughters. Former Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick represented the Conservatives on the under 30s Question Time debate during the general election campaign. In the summer he joined other rising stars Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden in saying Boris Johnson was the only one who could save the Tory party from an ""existential threat"". He drew criticism in 2017 when, as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international trade, he attended US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Mr Jenrick was elected as MP for Newark in a by-election in June 2014 after Patrick Mercer resigned in disgrace, and won the seat with an increased majority at the general election of 2015. He voted Remain in the EU referendum. Former environment minister Therese Coffey was appointed after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and later voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she has since spoken about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department in May 2019. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". Mr Buckland campaigned to remain in the EU, but has said it is important to deliver on the result of the referendum. He has, however, previously spoken out against a no-deal Brexit and of the need for compromise. He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He had previously practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaces Alok Sharma as International Development Secretary. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. The former international development minister Grant Shapps became transport secretary in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. A former remainer, he has since said he is backing Brexit ""as hard as you like"". He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps, a father-of-three, was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice replaces Theresa Villiers as environment secretary. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Brandon Lewis replaces Julian Smith as Northern Ireland Secretary. The former Conservative Party chairman rejoined cabinet under Boris Johnson as home office minister in July 2019. Previous positions include minister without portfolio, minister for housing and and minister for immigration. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood Borough Council, Essex, Mr Lewis has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Simon Hart was appointed as Welsh secretary to replace Alun Cairns last November. Mr Cairns resigned at the start of the general election campaign amid a row over what he knew about an aide's role in the collapse of a rape trial. The job was a promotion for Mr Hart, who has represented Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire since 2010. He previously served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also director of the New Schools Network, the organisation set up by Rachel Wolf, which runs the free schools programme. Amanda Milling replaces James Cleverly as Conservative Party chairman and will attend Cabinet as minister without portfolio. She was previously deputy chief whip, and was elected to Parliament as member for Cannock Chase in 2015. Amanda Milling is known as a key ally of Boris Johnson and worked on his leadership campaign. Jacob Rees Mogg is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit, and has long argued that the UK would be best to leave the EU with no deal. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it is his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. During the election campaign, he was criticised for saying it would have been ""common sense"" to flee the Grenfell Tower fire, ignoring fire brigade advice. Boris Johnson's chief enforcer, in theory, has an easier job now the party has a large majority. But Mr Spencer is no stranger to the role, having served in the whips' office since 2016. He has also been given the role of parliamentary secretary to the Treasury. From farming family, Mr Spencer did not attend Oxbridge, unlike many of his colleagues. He attended Shuttleworth Agricultural College before joining the family farming business. He started his political career as a local councillor and won the Sherwood seat from Labour in the 2010 general election. Suella Braverman replaces Geoffrey Cox as attorney general. A strong Brexit supporter, Ms Braverman chaired the European Research Group from June 2017 to January 2018 and became a minister at the Department for Leaving the EU under Theresa May. She resigned in November 2018 in protest at Mrs May's draft EU withdrawal deal Suella Braverman has served as MP for Fareham since 2015. Stephen Barclay will attend Cabinet in a new role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Barclay previously served as Brexit secretary under Theresa May and Boris Johnson - a position which became defunct at 11.01pm on 31 January as the UK left the EU. He was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. Note:BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations. This is the second reshuffle for Mr Johnson, who became prime minister last July after winning a Conservative leadership election. Big names to have left cabinet on Thursday includedChancellor Sajid Javid, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The make-up of the cabinet has also changed. The proportion of women in it has increased - but the actual number has fallen from eight to seven because some positions were closed. Members of the cabinet are more than 10 times more likely to have gone to a private school than members of the public. Under Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, 70% of cabinet had not been privately educated, whereas almost 70% of Mr Johnson's new cabinet have. According to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Gordon Brown.  Half of Mr Johnson's cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 27% of all Conservative MPs and 18% of Labour MPs. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said December's election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape and Conservative MPs now represent a more diverse range of constituencies than before. ""Yet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson's cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools,"" he said. ""Today's findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address."" Michael Gove is by far the most experienced of Mr Johnson's new top team.

Johnson chooses power over personnel,"Boris Johnson promised not so long ago that Sajid Javid would be his chancellor, in front of an audience and the TV cameras. In characteristically bombastic style, before he could be completely sure he would be back as PM, he said: ""I'm going to give you an absolutely categorical assurance I will keep Sajid Javid as my chancellor. I think he's a great guy, and I think he is doing a fantastic job."" So what on earth has just then happened? As one cabinet minister suggested, it seems Sajid Javid's departure is ""a little bit of accident and a little bit of design"". Two weeks ago, if the now former chancellor had been fired it might not have seemed that surprising. There were well-known tensions between the two teams, not necessarily between the two men themselves. Sajid Javid quits as chancellor Cabinet reshuffle: Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Shock resignation means test for new chancellor And there was plenty of briefing around that the relationship was strained between Mr Javid and the prime minister's top adviser, Dominic Cummings. There were not profound policy clashes perhaps, but there was certainly some of the traditional friction - No 10 that wants to be able to spend, No 11 that wants to hold the cheque book tightly. But in recent days, there had been plenty of warm noises that Mr Javid was safe in government. Even though No 10 has bold ideas for reform, they had concluded it seemed there wasn't much point ripping up the relationship at the top. What however they were determined to change was the atmosphere and the balance between the wider institutions - the political machine of Downing Street and the wider Treasury team. This video can not be played Sajid Javid: I had no option but to resign For a deeply motivated group inside No 10, that meant forcing changes on the chancellor as noted by the well plugged-in Conservative blogger Paul Goodman earlier this month. The possibility of that had not gone unnoticed by the Treasury team, and I understand that Mr Javid had discussed with friends what to do in that circumstance. If he were presented with a fait accompli, he had considered that he might have to quit. Walking in front of the cameras at Downing Street this morning therefore, he was aware of what might have been about to happen. I'm told the meeting between the two powerful men started cordially, with Mr Johnson praising Mr Javid's time in the job, before hitting him with the demand that he'd love him to stay, but without his team. Whispers suggest the chancellor (still in the job at that point) asked the prime minister for what precisely his advisers had actually done wrong, but he was short on evidence. After the pair went ""round in circles"", they took a break, at which point in a series of ""side meetings"" senior figures like the chief whip and Eddie Lister, another senior No 10 adviser, tried to persuade Mr Javid to stay. He did not back down though, and then it's said in another one-on-one meeting with the PM, he tendered his resignation. Mr Javid was appointed chancellor by the prime minister last July In the coming days, the blow-by-blow accounts of what exactly happened will be the subject of spin in plenty of different directions. Sajid Javid may decide to give a fuller account. But right now, his departure seems not therefore to have been a dastardly, and deliberate plan to force him out. No 10 hoped he would go for it, but must have gamed the possibility that he might not accept, just as Mr Javid had gamed the possibility that he might be asked to choose between his job and his team. Losing a chancellor is no small event, and it wasn't what Boris Johnson set out to do. But today shows that No 10's priority was political control rather than keeping personnel they valued. When Mr Javid refused, they chose instead to see him leave. This begs a wider question - is it stronger to share power or hoard it? Boris Johnson and his team have made the choice today to do the latter - to lose a chancellor rather than allow a rival faction offering different political advice to the next door neighbour. Of course, any prime minister is entitled to do this. And there is nothing written in scripture that says the occupant of No 11 must be forever considered a near equal competitor to the PM next door. Stalwarts of the department believe it is a vital check on prime ministers who would otherwise simply splash the cash. But one former minister, no fan of the current administration, suggested there is a very good case to be made for cutting back the political power of the Treasury, rethinking its role as a rival centre of power to No 10. And Javid is, by nature, unlikely to become a deliberate pain on the backbenches. Maybe then, as a minister told me tonight, the ultimate effect of this confusing cock-up will be ""benign"". But the manner of Sajid Javid's exit may really counts - a symbol of a government that wants, if you are diplomatic, a smooth and complete focus on its agenda at the very top. Put that less kindly, a group that wants to grab control of everything it sees. For now, it may make it easier for Boris Johnson to push through his desires. But centralising power in one building centralises risk too. If and when things go well, credit may flow in one direction. If and when things go wrong, there may be only one target for the blame.

"Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet?The prime minister reshuffles his cabinet, two months after winning the general election. Who's in?","Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election. There was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Who's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places. Boris Johnson's election win in December secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. While his election campaign promised to ""get Brexit done"", Mr Johnson has said his ""one nation government"" will also ""massively increase investment in the NHS"". Mr Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, having served as foreign secretary since 2016 in what was only his first cabinet post. His views on how to deliver Brexit brought him into conflict with Mrs May, and led to his resignation in 2018. Rishi Sunak replaces Sajid Javid, who resigned as Chancellor during the reshuffle on Thursday. Appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July, Rishi Sunakâs status as a rising star was highlighted when he was sent to stand in for Boris Johnson at the BBCâs seven-party election debate. He was previously a successful businessman, co-founding a large investment firm. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy daughter of an Indian billionaire. The couple lived in California for a number of years before coming back to the UK. They now have two daughters. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Dominic Raab was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet in July and remains in post. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. He is married with two sons. Michael Gove is the cabinet minister with the most experience - but his aspirations for the top job are well known. He lost out to Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership campaign in summer 2019. Mr Gove became environment secretary in June 2017 and proved a key advocate of Theresa Mayâs Brexit deal, while other Brexiteer cabinet ministers resigned. In 2016, he famously scuppered the leadership hopes of his friend Boris Johnson, by announcing his own candidature on the morning of Johnson's own campaign launch. Mr Gove was a key ally of former Prime Minister David Cameron and has served as MP for Surrey Heath since 2005. He made his name as a radical education secretary, bringing in major changes to exams and the curriculum and battling teaching unions during his four years in the role. Appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson last July, Ben Wallace previously served as security minister. Mr Wallace backed Remain in 2016 and has warned that leaving the EU without a deal would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public. After training at Sandhurst, Mr Wallace joined the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. He spent eight years in the Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. Liz Truss was made international trade secretary and also women and equalities minister when Boris Johnson took office and remains in that role. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Mr Hancock remains in post as health secretary. At 40, he was youngest contender in the Tory leadership race in the summer of 2019. He quit the contest a day after he came sixth in the first ballot and later endorsed Boris Johnson. The ambitious MP for West Suffolk was promoted to health secretary in 2018 after only a few months as culture secretary. He campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum but backed both Theresa May's and Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. The former Bank of England economist likes to see himself as one of the most technology-savvy politicians at Westminster - he was the first MP to have his own smartphone app. Gavin Williamson made a swift return to the cabinet last July following his sacking by Theresa May two months earlier after row over the leaking of information from the National Security Council. Mr Williamson is influential within the Tory party, having served as a ministerial aide to David Cameron and then as chief whip, in charge of party discipline. At that time, he famously kept a tarantula named Cronus on his desk in the House of Commons. Mr Williamson, who backed remain in the EU referendum, also helped to run Boris Johnsonâs campaign in the first phase of the Tory leadership contest last summer. The 41-year old MP for Hertsmere is a rising star in the Conservative ranks and replaces Nicky Morgan as Culture Secretary. Since last summer, he has been a minister in the Cabinet Office â playing a key role working with No 10 in implementing government policy. Before becoming an MP, the Cambridge-educated law graduate worked in public relations and cut his teeth in the Conservative Research Department. He then worked as an adviser to David Cameron, becoming his deputy chief of staff in Downing Street. He subsequently received a CBE for his services. In his maiden speech, he told the House of Commons he could make a legitimate claim to be the MP for TV soap Eastendersâ Albert Square, as it was filmed in his constituency. During his five years in the Commons, he has campaigned on greater legal protection for the Green Belt, more money for education and simplification of the tax system. The former International Development Secretary replaces Andrea Leadsom. The MP for Reading West backed Boris Johnson for prime minister and joined the cabinet in July 2019. Mr Sharma will also be the minister responsible for the Glasgow COP26 climate summit in November. Prior to being elected in 2010, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked in banking. He is married with two daughters. Former Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick represented the Conservatives on the under 30s Question Time debate during the general election campaign. In the summer he joined other rising stars Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden in saying Boris Johnson was the only one who could save the Tory party from an ""existential threat"". He drew criticism in 2017 when, as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international trade, he attended US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Mr Jenrick was elected as MP for Newark in a by-election in June 2014 after Patrick Mercer resigned in disgrace, and won the seat with an increased majority at the general election of 2015. He voted Remain in the EU referendum. Former environment minister Therese Coffey was appointed after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and later voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she has since spoken about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department in May 2019. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". Mr Buckland campaigned to remain in the EU, but has said it is important to deliver on the result of the referendum. He has, however, previously spoken out against a no-deal Brexit and of the need for compromise. He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He had previously practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaces Alok Sharma as International Development Secretary.

Space probe transforms theory of how planets form,"The Kuiper belt object Arrokoth is a pristine remnant of planet formation in action Scientists say they have ""decisively"" overturned the prevailing theory for how planets in our Solar System formed. The established view is that material violently crashed together to form ever larger clumps until they became worlds. New results suggest the process was less catastrophic - with matter gently clumping together instead. The study appears in Science journal and has been presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle. The study's lead researcher, Dr Alan Stern, said that the discovery was of ""stupendous magnitude"". 'Snowman' shape of distant Ultima revealed Distant object 'like nothing seen before' The moment Alan Stern (L) had confirmation that New Horizons had flown by the Kuiper Belt object ""There was the prevailing theory from the late 1960s of violent collisions and a more recent emerging theory of gentle accumulation. One is dust and the other is the only one standing. This rarely happens in planetary science, but today we have settled the matter,"" he told BBC News. The claim arises from detailed study of an object in the outer reaches of the Solar System. Named Arrokoth, the object is more than six billion km from the Sun in a region called the Kuiper belt. It is a pristine remnant of planet formation in action as the Solar System emerged 4.6 billion years ago, with two bodies combining to form a larger one. Scientists obtained high-resolution pictures of Arrokoth when Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft flew close to it just over a year ago. It gave scientists their first opportunity to test which of the two competing theories was correct: did the two components crash together or was there gentle contact? The analysis by Dr Stern and his team could find no evidence of violent impact. The researchers found no stress fractures, nor was there any flattening, indicating that the objects were squashed together gently. ""This is completely decisive,"" said Dr Stern. ""In one fell swoop, the flyby of Arrokoth was able to decide between the two theories."" The newer gentle clumping theory was developed 15 years ago by Prof Anders Johansen He is bullish because these so-called Kuiper belt objects have largely remained the same since the formation of the Solar System. They are, in effect, perfectly preserved fossils from this distant time. The newer gentle clumping theory was developed 15 years ago by Prof Anders Johansen at Lund Observatory in Sweden. At the time he was a young PhD student. The idea emerged from computer simulations. After speaking to Dr Stern, I broke the news to Prof Johansen that his theory had been confirmed. There was a pause on the line before he replied that he ""felt great"". He added: ""It is a special moment. I remember when I was a PhD student and feeling very nervous about these new results because they were very different to the ones before. I was worried that there was an error in my code or that I had made a calculation error. ""And then when you see these results confirmed from actual observations it is a real relief."" Anders Johansen marks the confirmation of his theory with his daughter Laura Prof Johansen commemorated the occasion with a pizza and coke with his family. Engineer Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, who co-presents the BBC's Sky at Night programme, cautioned against toppling a theory based on the observation of one object, but said that Dr Stern's interpretation ""makes a lot of sense"". ""It is nice to have this evidence because the crashing together theory was a nice theory, but there were some challenges to it. Why did the objects stick together and not bounce apart.

Cannabis goods âcould be off the shelves in a yearâ,"Oils, snacks and drinks containing the cannabis extract cannabidiol (CBD) will be ""taken off the shelves"" next year if they do not gain regulatory approval. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said products had to be registered by March 2021 or they would be pulled. Despite rising sales of CBD goods, not one product has been approved in the UK yet, raising safety concerns. The FSA has also issued new advice on CBD use, saying it should not be used alongside other medication. Cannabidiol is derived from cannabis but does not have any psychoactive properties. It is sold in some pharmacies and health food shops as a supplement and used to treat conditions such as pain or insomnia. However, the FSA only began regulating the market in January last year and some argue it has dragged its feet. Are CBD health claims stretching the truth? Trials have found CBD products on sale that contain unlisted and potentially hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Many may contain little or none of the extract itself, contrary to their marketing claims and despite their high prices. The FSA said producers had been slow to submit their products for approval, forcing it to impose the deadline. ""The CBD industry must provide more information about the safety and contents of these products to the regulator by March 2021, or the products will be taken off the shelves,"" boss Emily Miles said. CBD products have been on sale in the UK for years, so the FSA has not been quick out of the blocks to act. But the stance it has now taken is a strong one. It had been hoping individual companies would come forward with product information. But as none provided enough documentation, the regulator is now forcing them to - or threatening to take them off the shelves. For companies hoping for a slice of the UK's multi-million pound CBD industry, that's a big incentive to comply. The new advice to consumers, that CBD oil should not be taken alongside any other medication, will come as shock to many who have turned to these new oils, drops, foods and supplements to help them with medical problems. Although CBD products are not allowed to make any health claims, many people say they help with everything from mental health problems to coping with cancer treatments - so they are likely to be taking them alongside other medicines. The FSA also told healthy adults to ""think carefully"" before taking CBD, and then not to take more than 70mg a day. That equates to about 28 drops of 5% strength CBD oil. Those who are pregnant, breastfeeding or taking any medication are advised not to use CBD products at all. The regulator based its recommendations on advice from the government's Committee on Toxicity (COT), which has found evidence of ""potential adverse health effects"" from CBD. But COT said it ""still does not know enough to be sure about such a risk"". Steve Moore, from the Association for the Cannabinoid Industry (ACI), said CBD producers welcomed the new guidance. ""We believe that this will elicit the safety studies that are vital to build consumer confidence and help develop a socially responsible and sustainable industry."" The FSA's advice will apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but not Scotland which is covered by a separate regulator. It does not cover CBD cosmetics and vaping products, or cannabis used for medicinal purposes, which are also subject to different rules. Are CBD health claims stretching the truth?

Shock resignation is test for new chancellor,"There was no hint of what was to come from the lips of Chancellor Sajid Javid. He had been reassured of his future in post, when I spoke to him 48 hours ago. He was planning not just the Budget, but also a Spending Review, and a finance white paper involving negotiations with the EU over the ongoing access of UK finance to the EU. His team had signalled the Budget was going to be a significant new chapter in UK economic policy. The first Budget of this government and its healthy majority, able to plan its own long term strategy. However, there had been a strange series of last minute reorganisations regarding the chancellor's traditional round of interviews on the GDP figures. This was on the same day and in the same place as the Prime Minister's HS2 announcement. Mr Javid had crossed swords with the prime minister's top adviser Dominic Cummings, and had won those key battles. First and foremost the chancellor won the argument over manifesto costings and looser but still binding limits on public spending ahead of the election. He also won the argument on HS2. He had begun to establish his credibility as chancellor after an early few months where he was nicknamed ""chancellor in name only"", after Mr Cummings summarily fired the chancellor's press aide, having earlier boosted spending to health and police. But he had also made the argument that now was the time to invest more, as the borrowing rates faced by the government were at historic lows. The question was - just how much. Relations between Number 10 and Number 11 are the foundation of any stable government. There should be tensions. The Treasury's role as keeper of the purse strings does not always accord with the short-term political needs of Number 10. But the roots of this are a clash over long term strategy - that austerity was over - and that the Conservatives needed to pour money into the regions where their majority was won, and change politics in the UK forever. The Prime Minister has the title of ""First Lord of the Treasury"", but it has not always felt that way in recent history. Demanding the firing of his aides is a rather drastic way to assert that power. Mr Javid's replacement, the well-regarded chief secretary Rishi Sunak, begins his role with a problem. He arrives as a thirty-something Chancellor of the Exchequer, appointed in part because of a vacancy caused by Number 10 trying to assert itself over Number 11. Will he stick to Sajid Javid's recently announced new fiscal rules? Or does he open the chequebooks further? The first Budget of any parliament is traditionally the moment to get the bad news out of the way, on for example tax rises. But it is difficult not to see this development as an attempt to loosen the fiscal straitjacket further, ahead of that Budget. Chicken or fish?

Who is Rishi Sunak?,"Nineteen months after he first entered Downing Street as PM, Rishi Sunak faces the fight of his political life to hang on to the job. Four Conservative prime ministers had already come and gone when, at the age of 42, just seven years an MP, he was tasked with keeping the Tory show on the road. The MPs who put him there hoped he would steady the ship after turbulent times under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, before mounting a comeback for the party trailing a long way behind Labour in the opinion polls. So farthat comeback has yet to materialise. With a general election having to be called by January 2025, the assumption was that Mr Sunak would play it long and go to the country in the autumn, in the hope his political fortunes would eventually pick up. His surprise calling of an election on 4 July has left some some Conservative MPs scratching their heads but his allies insist it was a smart move. The youngest occupant of No 10 in modern times, Mr Sunak is also the first British-Indian to be prime minister. A son of first generation immigrants, who worked hard to send him to one of the country's top fee-paying schools, Winchester College, where he was head boy. He spent time in California and worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs - and two multibillion dollar hedge funds - before entering politics. Akshata Murty: Who is Rishi Sunak's wife? A self-confessed ""huge Star Wars fan"" with a sizeable collection of lightsabers, he is sometimes portrayed as a ""geek"". He generally swears off alcohol in favour of Mexican Coca-Cola, which, he says, is made with ""cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup"". Colleagues describe him as a details man, who is always the best-briefed person in any meeting. He became prime minister in extraordinary circumstances after his predecessor Liz Truss - whom he lost to in a leadership contest after the collapse of Boris Johnson's premiership - quitafter just 45 days in the job. Age:44 Place of birth:Southampton, Hampshire Home:London and Yorkshire Education:Winchester College, Oxford University, Stanford University Family:Married to businesswoman Akshata Murty with two daughters Parliamentary constituency:Richmond (Yorkshire) This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says that when it comes to helping the most vulnerable ""that's what I did"". Mr Sunak's parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. He was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP, and his mother ran her own pharmacy. ""In terms of cultural upbringing, I'd be at the temple at the weekend - I'm a Hindu - but I'd also be at [Southampton Football Club] the Saints game as well on a Saturday - you do everything, you do both."" In the interview he said he had been fortunate not to have endured a lot of racism growing up, but that there was one incident that had stayed with him. ""I was just out with my younger brother and younger sister, and I think, probably pretty young, I was probably a mid-teenager, and we were out at a fast food restaurant and I was just looking after them. There were people sitting nearby, it was the first time I'd experienced it, just saying some very unpleasant things. The 'P' word. ""And it stung. I still remember it. It seared in my memory. You can be insulted in many different ways."" However, he said he ""can't conceive of that happening today"" in the UK. He attended Winchester College and worked as a waiter at a Southampton curry house during his summer holidays. After finishing school he went on to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics, before studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California. There he met his wife, and the couple have two daughters. His rise to the top of British politics has been rapid - he only became an MP in 2015, in the rock solid Conservative seat of Richmond, in North Yorkshire. His political opponents have made much of his personal wealth, claiming he is out touch with the lives of most voters. Together, he and hiswife Akshata Murty- daughter of Indian billionaire Narayana Murthy, who co-founder of IT services giant Infosys - havean estimated worth of more than Â£650m. In 2022, Ms Murty announced she wouldstart paying UK tax on her incometo relieve political pressure on her husband. He was arguing for Britain's departure from the EU from his earliest days in politics and supported the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But he first came to wider public attention during the coronavirus pandemic, when as the recently-appointed chancellor he spent eye-watering sums on the furlough scheme and other support measures, as well as launching the controversial Eat Out to Help Out scheme. His personal popularity soared but he also got caught up in the Partygate controversies that rocked Downing Street, being fined, in June 2020, for attending one of the now infamous gatherings. And he found himself increasingly at odds with his boss Boris Johnson over the economy - pushing for lower taxes and spending cuts. In July 2022, he resigned from the cabinet, a move that was instrumental in ousting Mr Johnson, which some of the former PM's allies have not forgotten. He was not elected leader by Conservative Party members. He was, in effect, crowned by Tory grandees desperate for some stability after the chaos presided over by Liz Truss and latterly by Boris Johnson. He inherited a financial crisis and a party in disarray but also a near 70-seat majority - which has since been significantly eroded by a series of by-election defeats featuring big swings against his party. At the start of 2023, Mr Sunak set out five promises to voters, he wanted to be judged by: Halving inflation Growing the economy Reducing debt Cutting NHS waiting times Stopping small boat crossings Progress on thesehas been slow. The overall number of patients waiting for treatment on the NHS is higher than when Mr Sunak came to office, but inflation has dropped sharply in recent months. The headline rate for the year to April was 2.3%, hailed by the prime minister as a ""major moment"" - and a clear sign that his economic plan is working. On small boats, the government passed legislation allowing it to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda - but this was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court. The government responded by signing a new treaty with Rwanda, declaring it a safe country. This became law in April and the prime minister argues it will deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats. Critics have dismissed it as a hugely expensive gimmick. Mr Sunakhas now said no asylum seekers will be flown to Rwanda before the election - and will go there only if he is re-elected. He has delayed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars in a major change to the government's approach to achieving net zero by 2050. seeking to portray himself as the friend of the motorist and voters who are unhappy about the personal sacrifices required to reach the net zero target. He also scaled back the HS2 high speed rail link. Mr Sunak has pledged to create a ""smoke-free generation"" by phasing out the sale of tobacco products. The billcould fall by the wayside with Parliament shutting down on Fridaybut it is likely to be in the Conservative manifesto. The prime minister's personal ratings have suffered as series of resets has not had the desired effect on Tory fortunes, but he insists he can defy the odds and retain the keys to Downing Street on 4 July.

"Plug pulled on 5,000 post-GCSE qualifications","A qualification in dry-stone walling was on the hit list More than 5,000 qualifications in England studied by few or, in some cases, no students are being scrapped. The Department for Education is pulling funding from about 40% of the 12,000 post-16 qualifications as it prepares to introduce new T-levels in September. T-levels are post-GCSE courses, equivalent to three A-levels, developed in collaboration with businesses. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said finding the right course was like looking for a needle in a haystack. He added: ""Removing funding for qualifications that have no or low numbers of enrolments will help make sure students have a clearer choice of the qualifications on offer, and ensure they get the skills they need to progress."" The move is the latest step in the government's wider review of post-16 qualifications at Level 3 - A-level standard - and below. What are T-levels and who is going to study them? But the head of the well respected qualification provider City and Guilds said the move would be ""disastrous for social mobility"". The qualifications purge will move closer to a system where teenagers choose at age 16 from one of three routes - A-levels, apprenticeships or T-levels. But Tom Bewick, the head of the trade association for examining bodies the Federation of Awarding Bodies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are 50,000 degree courses in this country, and you haven't had a vice-chancellor sitting here in front of you having to explain why there is so many."" He questioned whether Whitehall officials were the people best placed, to make ""really important life chance decisions about qualifications"". ""This is clearly a very top down review... vocational technical qualifications have been a great idea but they're for other people's children - and they certainly aren't for the people that are in the senior levels within the Department for Education."" T-levels will offer students a mixture of classroom learning and ""on-the-job"" experience during an industry placement. The first three will be available in some qualifications from September, but only 2,000 places will be on offer initially. The qualifications - in subjects such as accountancy, catering, finance, hair and beauty and manufacturing - have been developed in collaboration with employers and businesses to meet the needs of industry and prepare students for work. Candidates will be awarded one of four overall grades after their two years of study, ranging from distinction* to a pass. They will also get a nationally recognised certificate which will show their overall grade and a breakdown of what they have achieved across the T-level programme. The aim of Thursday's announcement was to ensure all qualifications on offer were high-quality, necessary, and supported students to progress into employment or further study, the DfE said. The kind of qualifications being scrapped are certificates for specific businesses or jobs, such as dry-stone walling, nail art and warehouse management, but they also include entry-level qualifications and one designed to boost the confidence of pupils who struggle with learning. T-levels will include qualifications in hairdressing Some qualifications aimed at pupils with learning and physical disabilities are being axed, too. The move is also intended to ensure funding goes towards more popular qualifications that help students learn skills they need to go on to have successful careers. The government is seeking views on whether any of the 5,000 qualifications on the list should continue to attract public funding Mr Bewick said not everyone would feel one of the three routes was suitable for them. He said: ""Clearly where there are qualifications where they are no longer in demand, they will discontinue."" But he gave the example of one of the qualifications which could be at risk - Level 3 in aromatherapy, used by the Royal National College for the Blind. ""It's actually a qualification that helps learners who have visual impairment gain access employment in the therapeutic and spa industries,"" he said. ""It enrols very few numbers but nevertheless that's an example of a very niche qualification that helps people into the labour market."" He said: ""We have got young people, who are leaving school who are turned off by classroom learning. They need opportunities for learning by doing, to get practical vocational qualifications."" City and Guilds chief executive Kirstie Donnelly said many students were simply not ready to make the jump from GCSEs to T-levels. The introduction of T-levels is the biggest shake-up in vocational education in a generation. They will be tough and are meant to help more people to attain the higher-level skills businesses say they need. Each year, about 70,000 teenagers in England do not pass a single GCSE at Grade 4 or above. A further 136,000 do not get a single GCSE at the strong pass, Grade 5. For those expected to then go on to study T-levels, a transition year will try to help them prepare - but not all will be able to make the leap. And some of the qualifications being scrapped were aimed at these very teenagers, who may be disengaged and lacking in basic employability skills. ""Removing that vital rung on the skills ladder towards Level 3 and above will be disastrous for social mobility and leave more and more people stranded with no route into work,"" she said. ""We urge the government to think carefully before removing this lifeline for people and leaving employers unable to access the skilled workforces they need.""

China coronavirus deaths and cases spike,"The WHO has said a vaccine will likely be found but it will take time Some 242 deaths from the new coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei on Wednesday, the deadliest day of the outbreak. There was also a huge increase in the number of cases, with 14,840 people diagnosed withCovid-19. Hubei has started using a broader definition to diagnose people, which accounts for most of the rise in cases. China sacked two top officials in Hubei province hours after the new figures were revealed. Until Wednesday's increases, the number of people with the virus in Hubei, where the outbreak emerged, was stabilising. But the new cases and deaths in the province have pushed the national death toll above 1,350 with almost 60,000 infections in total. Meanwhile Japan has announced its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s who lived in Kanagawa, south-west of Tokyo. It is the third death outside mainland China, following one each in the Philippines and Hong Kong. The woman's diagnosis was confirmed after her death and she had no obvious link to China's Hubei province, Japanese media reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is seeking ""further clarity"" from China about the changes to how cases of the virus are being confirmed. China has been accused of suppressing the full extent of the outbreak in the past, says the BBC's Nick Beake in Hong Kong. David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""What has happened in China is that they have changed the definition of what the disease really is - now they are taking people who have lesser symptoms. ""The deaths are quite worrisome, there is an increased number of deaths reported, but if you look overall at the total number of deaths and the total number of cases, the fatality ratio is about the same as it has been - but it is still high, as high as the death rate in influenza."" Only Hubei province - which accounts for more than 80% of overall Chinese infections - is using the new definition to diagnose new cases. Just about everyone who's been following China's official coronavirus numbers has been able to see that they have been incomplete. Government officials know this too. There's no way they've accounted for everybody infected. How could they? But at least we had what appeared to be a trend. We could observe the pattern to try and estimate the trajectory of outbreak. Now that's gone too. You can understand why it has been decided that people who have virus symptoms, plus a CT scan showing chest infection, are now being counted in the ""definitely infected"" column. However, this has thrown the trend mapping into chaos. Over the past 24 hours in Hubei alone, nearly 15,000 people were moved into the infected column. This would have sent shockwaves around the world, but actually, if you consider Wednesday's cases by the old definition, the rate could well mean another day of decline: a completely different picture. So now, we're scratching our heads: do we start looking at the pattern all over again from Thursday onwards? This has also left many wondering what the real death rate must have been over recent weeks and the extent to which we should be treating the overall figures seriously anyway. Meanwhile, the Communist Party secretary in Hubei, Jiang Chaoliang, has been replaced by the Shanghai party chief, Ying Yong, according to state media. The party chief of the capital city, Wuhan, has also been relieved of his duties. It is the first major change of Hubei party officials since the outbreak began. Earlier this week, a number of health officials were""removed"" from their jobs. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Why a global city is so vulnerable to virus spread The Valentine messages to coronavirus medics The province now includes ""clinically diagnosed cases"" in the number of confirmed cases. This means it includes those showing symptoms, and having a CT scan showing an infected lung, rather than relying only on the standard nucleic acid tests. Of the 242 new deaths in Wuhan, 135 are such ""clinically diagnosed"" cases. That means, even without the new definition, the number of deaths in Hubei on Wednesday was 107 - a new high for the province. The province's 14,840 new infections include 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases. Overall, the province now has 48,206 confirmed infections. A cruise ship carrying more than 2,000 people has docked in Cambodia after it was turned away by five ports over fears that some passengers might be infected with the virus. The MS Westerdam arrived on Thursday morning after Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand had all refused to accept the ship despite having no sick patients on board. Cruise ship rejected by five ports docks at last Are cruise ships really 'floating petri dishes'? Meanwhile, another 44 cases have been confirmed on the Diamond Princess, which is in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan. The increase means 218 people of the 3,700 people on board the ship have caught the virus. Not everyone has been tested yet. People with the virus are taken to hospitals on land to be treated, while those on board are largely confined to their cabins. However on Thursday Japan said it would allow those aged 80 or over who have tested negative for the coronavirus to disembark. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said they could be allowed off the ship as early as Friday but would have to stay in accommodation provided by the government, the Japan Times reported.

'No change' in virus outbreak despite China spike,"Vietnam has put 10,000 people in quarantine after six cases were found in villages north of Hanoi Coronavirus cases are not rising dramatically outside China despite a spike in Hubei province, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The only exception was on a cruise liner docked in Japan, where 44 new cases were reported, bringing the total there to 218. There was also no major shift in the coronavirus's pattern of mortality or severity, according to the WHO. The latest figures show 121 new deaths in China, bringing the total to 1,380. The total infections jumped by 5,090 to 63,851 cases on 13 February, the National Health Commission said on Friday. Health officials said six health workers were among those who had died, and that 1,716 health workers had been infected. The fatalities include Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to alert authorities to the virus early on but was accused by police of ""spreading rumours. His death on 7 February provoked a burst of public anger and grief. The latest figures from Hubei recorded 116 deaths and 4,823 new cases. That is a smaller increase than the previous day when there was a spike with 240 new deaths and nearly 15,000 new cases. However, most of this was down to Hubei using a broader definition to diagnose people, said Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme. ""This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,"" he said. Are coronavirus tests flawed? What are the symptoms of coronavirus? The Valentine messages to coronavirus medics Outside China there had been two deaths and 447 cases in 24 countries, he said. On Thursday Japan announced its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s who lived in Kanagawa, south-west of Tokyo. The woman's diagnosis was confirmed after her death and she had no obvious link to China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, Japanese media reported. On Thursday, the US state department said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the possible effect of an outbreak in North Korea, which has so far not reported any cases. The vessel is in quarantine in Yokohama. Not all the 3,700 people on board have been tested yet. People with the virus are taken to hospitals on land to be treated, while those on board are largely confined to their cabins. The Diamond Princess has 3,700 people on board - not all of whom have been tested However on Thursday Japan said it would allow those aged 80 or over who have tested negative for the coronavirus to disembark. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said they could be allowed off the ship as early as Friday but would have to stay in accommodation provided by the government, the Japan Times reported.

The new cases and deaths in the province have pushed the national death toll above 1,350 with almost 60,000 infections in total. Briton says quarantine breakers being arrested White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said there had been ""surprise"" in the US at the new cases. ""We're a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around,"" he said. China sacked two top officials in Hubei province hours after the new figures were revealed. This video can not be played Medics in Wuhan resort to shaving their heads in a bid to prevent cross-infection of the coronavirus Mr Ryan, from the WHO, said the spike reflected a change in the way cases were diagnosed and many were days or weeks old. Only Hubei province - which accounts for more than 80% of overall Chinese infections - is using the new definition to diagnose new cases. In the UK, officials are attempting to trace the contacts of the latest person to be diagnosed with coronavirus. The woman, who flew into London Heathrow from China a few days ago, is the ninth case to be confirmed Australia has extended its ban on people coming from mainland China for another week, to 22 February China said it would stagger the return of children to school - several provinces have closed schools until the end of February In Vietnam, which borders China, thousands of people in villages near the capital, Hanoi, have been put under quarantine after several cases were discovered.

Who's in Johnson's new cabinet?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election. There was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Who's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places. Boris Johnson's election win in December secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. While his election campaign promised to ""get Brexit done"", Mr Johnson has said his ""one nation government"" will also ""massively increase investment in the NHS"". Mr Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, having served as foreign secretary since 2016 in what was only his first cabinet post. His views on how to deliver Brexit brought him into conflict with Mrs May, and led to his resignation in 2018. Rishi Sunak replaces Sajid Javid, who resigned as Chancellor during the reshuffle on Thursday. Appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July, Rishi Sunakâs status as a rising star was highlighted when he was sent to stand in for Boris Johnson at the BBCâs seven-party election debate. He was previously a successful businessman, co-founding a large investment firm. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy daughter of an Indian billionaire. The couple lived in California for a number of years before coming back to the UK. They now have two daughters. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Dominic Raab was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet in July and remains in post. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. He is married with two sons. Michael Gove is the cabinet minister with the most experience - but his aspirations for the top job are well known. He lost out to Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership campaign in summer 2019. Mr Gove became environment secretary in June 2017 and proved a key advocate of Theresa Mayâs Brexit deal, while other Brexiteer cabinet ministers resigned. In 2016, he famously scuppered the leadership hopes of his friend Boris Johnson, by announcing his own candidature on the morning of Johnson's own campaign launch. Mr Gove was a key ally of former Prime Minister David Cameron and has served as MP for Surrey Heath since 2005. He made his name as a radical education secretary, bringing in major changes to exams and the curriculum and battling teaching unions during his four years in the role. Appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson last July, Ben Wallace previously served as security minister. Mr Wallace backed Remain in 2016 and has warned that leaving the EU without a deal would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public. After training at Sandhurst, Mr Wallace joined the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. He spent eight years in the Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. Liz Truss was made international trade secretary and also women and equalities minister when Boris Johnson took office and remains in that role. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Mr Hancock remains in post as health secretary. At 40, he was youngest contender in the Tory leadership race in the summer of 2019. He quit the contest a day after he came sixth in the first ballot and later endorsed Boris Johnson. The ambitious MP for West Suffolk was promoted to health secretary in 2018 after only a few months as culture secretary. He campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum but backed both Theresa May's and Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. The former Bank of England economist likes to see himself as one of the most technology-savvy politicians at Westminster - he was the first MP to have his own smartphone app. Gavin Williamson made a swift return to the cabinet last July following his sacking by Theresa May two months earlier after row over the leaking of information from the National Security Council. Mr Williamson is influential within the Tory party, having served as a ministerial aide to David Cameron and then as chief whip, in charge of party discipline. At that time, he famously kept a tarantula named Cronus on his desk in the House of Commons. Mr Williamson, who backed remain in the EU referendum, also helped to run Boris Johnsonâs campaign in the first phase of the Tory leadership contest last summer. The 41-year old MP for Hertsmere is a rising star in the Conservative ranks and replaces Nicky Morgan as Culture Secretary. Since last summer, he has been a minister in the Cabinet Office â playing a key role working with No 10 in implementing government policy. Before becoming an MP, the Cambridge-educated law graduate worked in public relations and cut his teeth in the Conservative Research Department. He then worked as an adviser to David Cameron, becoming his deputy chief of staff in Downing Street. He subsequently received a CBE for his services. In his maiden speech, he told the House of Commons he could make a legitimate claim to be the MP for TV soap Eastendersâ Albert Square, as it was filmed in his constituency. During his five years in the Commons, he has campaigned on greater legal protection for the Green Belt, more money for education and simplification of the tax system. The former International Development Secretary replaces Andrea Leadsom. The MP for Reading West backed Boris Johnson for prime minister and joined the cabinet in July 2019. Mr Sharma will also be the minister responsible for the Glasgow COP26 climate summit in November. Prior to being elected in 2010, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked in banking. He is married with two daughters. Former Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick represented the Conservatives on the under 30s Question Time debate during the general election campaign. In the summer he joined other rising stars Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden in saying Boris Johnson was the only one who could save the Tory party from an ""existential threat"". He drew criticism in 2017 when, as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international trade, he attended US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Mr Jenrick was elected as MP for Newark in a by-election in June 2014 after Patrick Mercer resigned in disgrace, and won the seat with an increased majority at the general election of 2015. He voted Remain in the EU referendum. Former environment minister Therese Coffey was appointed after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and later voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she has since spoken about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department in May 2019. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". Mr Buckland campaigned to remain in the EU, but has said it is important to deliver on the result of the referendum. He has, however, previously spoken out against a no-deal Brexit and of the need for compromise. He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He had previously practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaces Alok Sharma as International Development Secretary. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. The former international development minister Grant Shapps became transport secretary in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. A former remainer, he has since said he is backing Brexit ""as hard as you like"". He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps, a father-of-three, was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice replaces Theresa Villiers as environment secretary. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Brandon Lewis replaces Julian Smith as Northern Ireland Secretary. The former Conservative Party chairman rejoined cabinet under Boris Johnson as home office minister in July 2019. Previous positions include minister without portfolio, minister for housing and and minister for immigration. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood Borough Council, Essex, Mr Lewis has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Simon Hart was appointed as Welsh secretary to replace Alun Cairns last November. Mr Cairns resigned at the start of the general election campaign amid a row over what he knew about an aide's role in the collapse of a rape trial. The job was a promotion for Mr Hart, who has represented Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire since 2010. He previously served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also director of the New Schools Network, the organisation set up by Rachel Wolf, which runs the free schools programme. Amanda Milling replaces James Cleverly as Conservative Party chairman and will attend Cabinet as minister without portfolio. She was previously deputy chief whip, and was elected to Parliament as member for Cannock Chase in 2015. Amanda Milling is known as a key ally of Boris Johnson and worked on his leadership campaign. Jacob Rees Mogg is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit, and has long argued that the UK would be best to leave the EU with no deal. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it is his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. During the election campaign, he was criticised for saying it would have been ""common sense"" to flee the Grenfell Tower fire, ignoring fire brigade advice. Boris Johnson's chief enforcer, in theory, has an easier job now the party has a large majority. But Mr Spencer is no stranger to the role, having served in the whips' office since 2016. He has also been given the role of parliamentary secretary to the Treasury. From farming family, Mr Spencer did not attend Oxbridge, unlike many of his colleagues. He attended Shuttleworth Agricultural College before joining the family farming business. He started his political career as a local councillor and won the Sherwood seat from Labour in the 2010 general election. Suella Braverman replaces Geoffrey Cox as attorney general. A strong Brexit supporter, Ms Braverman chaired the European Research Group from June 2017 to January 2018 and became a minister at the Department for Leaving the EU under Theresa May. She resigned in November 2018 in protest at Mrs May's draft EU withdrawal deal Suella Braverman has served as MP for Fareham since 2015. Stephen Barclay will attend Cabinet in a new role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Barclay previously served as Brexit secretary under Theresa May and Boris Johnson - a position which became defunct at 11.01pm on 31 January as the UK left the EU. He was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. Note:BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations. This is the second reshuffle for Mr Johnson, who became prime minister last July after winning a Conservative leadership election. Big names to have left cabinet on Thursday includedChancellor Sajid Javid, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The make-up of the cabinet has also changed. The proportion of women in it has increased - but the actual number has fallen from eight to seven because some positions were closed. Members of the cabinet are more than 10 times more likely to have gone to a private school than members of the public. Under Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, 70% of cabinet had not been privately educated, whereas almost 70% of Mr Johnson's new cabinet have. According to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Gordon Brown.  Half of Mr Johnson's cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 27% of all Conservative MPs and 18% of Labour MPs. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said December's election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape and Conservative MPs now represent a more diverse range of constituencies than before. ""Yet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson's cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools,"" he said. ""Today's findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address."" Michael Gove is by far the most experienced of Mr Johnson's new top team. The ministers who have had 204 days of cabinet experience are new faces appointed by the PM when he took power in July last year. Click here,externalif you cannot see the Cabinet Guide.

Profile: Sajid Javid,"Sajid Javid has been appointed health secretary following the resignation of Matt Hancock who stepped down for breaking social distancing guidelines. Mr Javid previously served as home secretary under former Prime Minister Theresa May, and in 2019 was promoted to chancellor by Boris Johnson. However he only lasted in that role for six months, resigning in February 2020 following tensions with the prime minister's then-advisor Dominic Cummings. Mr Javid was told he would have to sack his own advisors, but he rejected the order saying it was something ""no self-respecting minister"" could accept. Following his resignation as chancellor, Mr Javid returned to life as a backbench MP, but also took up a job with JP Morgan. Since becoming health secretary, Mr Javid has given up his role at the US bank. Matt Hancock resigns after breaking Covid guidance Sajid Javid resigns as chancellor Listen: BBC Radio 4's Profile of Sajid Javid The MP for Bromsgrove since 2010 was born in Rochdale in 1969, one of five sons of parents who had moved to the UK from Pakistan. Mr Javid, a 50-year-old father of four,told the Evening Standard in 2012,external: ""My dad was from a tiny village in Pakistan and came here when he was 17 to look for work. ""He settled in Rochdale and became a cotton-mill worker for Courtaulds. But he was quite ambitious, and saw that bus drivers were better paid. His nickname was Mr Night and Day because he used to work every hour God sent his way."" Mr Javid's father's job was the same as the father of another high-profile politician, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and he congratulated the Labour politician ""from one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another"" after his City Hall victory in 2016. Mr Javid spent his school years in Bristol after his parents took over a ladieswear shop there, with the family living in a two-bed flat above it. Hetold the Daily Mail,externalin 2014 that the school, a local comprehensive, was tough and ""I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework."" But, he said, things changed when his dad read the riot act. ""He said 'this is what I went through, don't let me down'. I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed."" He said that his school did not want to pay for him to do maths O-Level - his dad ended paying for it instead. Sajid Javid previously served in Boris Johnson's cabinet as chancellor He had also developed an interest in financial markets, sparked by the Thatcher government's privatisations. At the age of 14 he went to see his father's bank manager and arranged to borrow Â£500 to invest in shares, becoming a regular reader of the Financial Times. His goal became to work in the City so he passed that maths O-Level and, rejecting his school's suggestion he become a TV repair man, headed off to sixth form college and then to Exeter University to study economics and politics - giving a clear hint of his future career direction. He also met his future wife, Laura, while doing a summer job at Commercial Union. They sat opposite each other and shared a stapler, he told the Daily Mail. Their four children are privately educated: ""We do what's best for them,"" Mr Javid, who has described himself as a non-practising Muslim, told the newspaper. After university, he set his sights on a job in the City. As he told the Standard: ""Some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations. ""They often tell you that unless you wear an old school tie or have the family contacts, you just won't get a chance to work in the City. But they were wrong."" His career move worked out well, although he had to move across the Atlantic to succeed. And by the age of 25, he had become a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank, later moving to Singapore for a period with Deutsche Bank. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in the summer of 2009 to concentrate on a political career. A Conservative Party supporter from the early 1980s, he had attended his first conference towards the end of the Thatcher years, with Conservative friends from university such as fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon. They got into a bit of trouble at the 1990 conference, handing out leaflets against the then prime minister's decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, opposing the policy despite being diehard fans of Mrs Thatcher's. According to aConservativeHome profile,,externalMr Javid, Mr Halfon, another future Tory MP David Burrowes and Tim Montgomerie - founder of ConservativeHome - got up at 07:00 so they could get front-row seats for what turned out to be Mrs Thatcher's final party conference speech. Two decades on and, in 2010, he was elected for the first time, and made swift progress. He began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury, before becoming the first cabinet minister of Asian descent when he was appointed culture, media and sport secretary in 2014. He did that for a year before moving to business secretary for a year and then moving on to be communities and local government secretary. Sajid Javid (third from left) with the 2014 Budget team Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. That meant, of course, that like then-Home Secretary Theresa May and his one-time mentor, then Chancellor George Osborne, he was on the losing side. There was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader after the referendum, on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb. (He would have been chancellor to Mr Crabb's prime minister.) He also ran in the 2019 leadership election but was eliminated in the fourth round before Mr Johnson went on to become prime minister. Mr Javid was appointed home secretary in April 2018, following the resignation of Amber Rudd during the fallout fromthe Windrush scandal. At the time, Mr Javidtold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthe scandal ""immediately impacted him"". Mr Javid told the newspaper: ""When I heard about the Windrush issue, I thought that could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle, it could be me."" In 2019 he took a hardline stance towardsShamima Begum, who left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15, revoking her British citizenship when she asked to return. The move boosted his popularity amongst some Tories but provoked criticism from others - particularly after her newborn son died in a Syrian refugee camp. Mr Javid talking to Tata Steel workers in 2016 In his previous cabinet roles he avoided major calamity, although he faced questions as business secretaryover Tata steel, and as communities secretary over the government response to theGrenfell disaster,external. However, he had not been afraid to ruffle feathers, with uncompromising messages to some in the business community and local government.

'Many more' may self-isolate over UK coronavirus,"This video can not be played Coronavirus in the UK: Five things you need to know about Covid-19 Many more people may be forced to self-isolate as part of efforts to stop the coronavirus spreading in Britain, the head of NHS England has warned. Sir Simon Stevens said more than 80 people discharged from quarantine on Thursday set an ""important example"". Meanwhile, officials are tracing the contacts of the ninth person in the UK to test positive for the virus. The woman went to hospital in an Uber, but Public Health England (PHE) said the driver is not at ""high risk"". The new case - announced on Wednesday evening - is the first to be identified in London after she contracted the virus in China. She ""self-presented"" at the A&E department of University Hospital Lewisham on Sunday 9 February, hospital chief executive Ben Travis said. PHE said the Uber driver is ""not considered high risk"" because the journey was less than 15 minutes and there was not ""close sustained contact"". Uber said it had temporarily suspended the driver's account ""out of an abundance of caution"". Asked if it would be compensating the driver for lost income, the company said: ""We will be providing support to this driver."" GMB legal director Susan Harris said: ""If Uber is genuinely concerned for his well-being - or for that of the public -  they must make sure he receives payment during this enforced period of unemployment."" Britain's race to contain the coronavirus Coronavirus: How worried should we be? 'If someone coughs, it makes me nervous' Mr Travis said the patient was immediately given a mask and escorted to be tested in a dedicated area outside the A&E building. After that, she was assessed further in an isolation room in the emergency department. She was later discharged and taken home by ambulance. All staff who had contact with the patient have been contacted, and two are undergoing ""active surveillance"" at home for 14 days on the advice of PHE, Mr Travis said. On Wednesday, the test came back positive and she was taken for treatment at a specialist unit at St Thomas' Hospital that evening. Meanwhile, a nurse who went into self-isolation after showing symptoms after sustained contact with someone who was being tested for the virus, has criticised the lack of advice she was given by PHE. The unnamed nursetold Brighton newspaper the Argus,externalshe was sent home in a taxi in which she wore a medical mask but the driver did not. She said she called NHS 111 but had to wait 15 hours to get advice from PHE on how to get tested - and felt she was given little guidance on how to stop the spread of the virus. In other developments: Tests for the virus have been carried out on 2,521 people in the UK as of 14:00 GMT on Thursday - an increase of 763 from Wednesday - with all but nine being negative Dental surgeries in the UK are facing a shortage of face masks due to supply problems in China following the outbreak,the British Dental Association has warned,external Heavy machinery manufacturerJCB cut the hours of 4,000 company and agency shop floor staff because of a shortage of components from China The Church of England has recommended thatparishioners with coughs and sneezes are encouraged to receive only the bread and not to share the wine at Holy Communion,external. The Roman Catholic Church has said there is no need for special measures Grime star Stormzy postponed the Asian leg of his tour because of the coronavirus outbreak,cancelling dates in China, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea and Singapore There was a sharp spike in the number of cases in Hubei province, the origin of the outbreak, after a new diagnostic definition was introduced, butthe World Health Organization says cases are not rising outside China Meanwhile, more than 80 people who stayed in accommodation at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for two weeks have left after testing negative for the new strain of coronavirus. They are one of two groups of British nationals evacuated from Wuhan, with the second quarantined near Milton Keynes. Repatriated UK citizen Matt Raw punched the air in celebration as he left quarantine Sir Simon said: ""They have set an important example, recognising that over the coming weeks many more of us may need to self-isolate at home for a period to reduce this virus's spread,"" he said. Matt Raw, one of those quarantined on the Wirral, said as he left the accommodation block: ""It is absolutely lovely to be out and I'll no doubt be going out for a pint a little bit later."" The ninth UK case illustrates the challenge the authorities face in trying to contain the coronavirus. The guidance is clear about what to do if you suspect you might be infected. Phone NHS 111 and self-isolate yourself. Jumping into an Uber and heading into a busy A&E unit - where there will be lots of people with potentially weakened immune systems - is the last thing someone should be doing. We don't know why the ninth case did this. They could have been unaware of the advice. They may have been scared. Or they may have had trouble getting through to 111 or have been unhappy with the response. I have heard from people who have self-isolated themselves after becoming ill after returning from one of the at-risk countries, but then complained they were frustrated about the slow response from the NHS. Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was hoped China ""gets on top of the epidemic"". He said: ""We basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain; the second of these is to delay; the third of these is to do the science and the research; and the fourth is to mitigate so we can brace the NHS."" This video can not be played Change in seasons 'could slow down spread' - England's chief medical officer In addition to the patient being treated in London, the UK's nine coronavirus cases include two Chinese nationals who tested positive in York. Another cluster of cases began with British businessman Steve Walsh - now recovered - who contracted the virus in Singapore and passed it to 11 people at a ski resort in France. Five of these returned to the UK. The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service.

Barclays boss 'deeply regrets' sex offender link,"Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has the full confidence of the board, the bank said Barclays boss Jes Staley said he ""deeply regrets"" his connection with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. His comments come after Barclays revealed that UK regulators are investigating the chief executive's links with the disgraced financier. Mr Staley admitted he maintained contact with Epstein, who died in New York prison cell last year, for seven years after his conviction. Barclays said Mr Staley has the ""full confidence"" of the board. ""It has been very well known I had a professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Mr Staley told reporters on Thursday. ""It goes back to 2000 when I was asked to run the JP Morgan private bank and he was already a client when I joined the private bank. ""The relationship was maintained during my time at JP Morgan but as I left JP Morgan the relationship tapered off quite significantly. Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" Epstein died in his prison last August after being charged with sex trafficking underage girls. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. Why Barclays did not fire Staley in December The probe by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority will focus on Mr Staley's ""characterisation to the company of his relationship"" with Epstein. The Financial Conduct Authority oversees bad behaviour in the City, while the Prudential Regulation Authority looks into financial stability. In a statement to the stock market, Barclays said: ""As has been widely reported, earlier in his career Mr Staley developed a professional relationship with Mr Epstein. In the summer of 2019, in light of the renewed media interest in the relationship, Mr Staley volunteered and gave to certain executives, and the chairman, an explanation of his relationship with Mr Epstein."" Barclays added that Mr Staley said he had had no contact with Epstein since joining his current employer in December 2015. The bank added: ""The relationship between Mr Staley and Mr Epstein was the subject of an inquiry from the Financial Conduct Authority, to which the company responded. ""The FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority subsequently commenced an investigation, which is ongoing, into Mr Staley's characterisation to the company of his relationship with Mr Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in the company's response to the FCA."" Separately, in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Mr Staley said that he feels he has been transparent with how he characterised his relationship with Epstein. ""The board has done its own review, and they've looked back at my transparency and they concluded indeed that I have been transparent and open with the bank and with the board all along this process,"" he said. ""But there is a regulatory process that is ongoing, and we'll let that run its course."" The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, saidBarclays conducted an internal inquiry last year, and was satisfied with Mr Staley explanation. Nevertheless, the news will be a fresh blow to Mr Staley, who is trying to rebuild his image after being sanctioned for attempting to unmask the identity of a whistleblower at Barclays. Epstein was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges when he was found dead in his cell on 10 August The bank was fined $15m (Â£11.6m) in the US and Mr Staley was fined Â£642,430 in the UK for breaching rules by attempting to find whoever raised concerns over an executive Mr Staley hired. The bank received two letters in 2016 criticising the decision and raising concerns about the executive's experience. Instead of being handed to the bank's investigations team, one of the letters was distributed among senior managers, including Mr Staley. Barclays also cut his bonus by Â£500,000. In another embarrassing episode in 2017, Mr Staley fell for an email prank when a disgruntled customer pretended to be his boss at the time, former chairman John McFarlane. Mr Staley exchanged several emails with the imposter, who used a Gmail email address, theFinancial Times reported,external. Under his stewardship, the bank's shares have lost about 25% of their value. The shares were down more than 3% in early trading on Thursday as the bank reported that pre-tax profits for the year jumped 25% to Â£4.4bn. Higher revenue and lower costs helped profits advance, the bank said, particularly at its international business. It's hardly surprising that Jes Staley had business links to Jeffrey Epstein - Mr Staley ran the private wealth division of JP Morgan, one of America's biggest banks for several years, looking after the private investments of wealthy Americans. That's exactly the business in which Mr Epstein was a big player, and the New York Times has reported that Mr Staley was one of his key contacts, with several of the deceased financier's big clients being referred to JP Morgan. This morning Barclays said in an announcement to the Stock Exchange that Mr Staley had volunteered information about that relationship to the Barclays board - but that the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Prudential Regulation Authority, Britain's two largest financial watchdogs, were now looking at exactly what he said. The key word in Barclays' statement is that investigation is into how the relationship was ""characterised"" - which infers that the investigators want to work out whether Mr Staley and Barclays gave a completely accurate picture. This does not necessarily mean big trouble for Mr Staley, and the Barclays board has given him a vote of confidence. Regulators, however, take a dim view of bank bosses who don't play ball from the start, and Mr Staley has blotted his copybook before.

"Labour calls for clarity over PM's Â£15,000 holiday","Mr Johnson took a holiday on the island of Mustique with partner Carrie Symonds after Christmas Labour has called on Boris Johnson to clarify who paid for his Caribbean holiday over the New Year. According to theMPs' register of interests,,externalthe accommodation - has a ""value"" of Â£15,000 - and was covered by David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse. A spokesman for Mr Ross said the register ""is correct"" and he ""facilitated accommodation"" for the PM. Downing Street said the trip had been properly registered. The register also shows earnings Mr Johnson received last year before becoming PM, including more than Â£327,000 for seven speaking engagements, one of which was a three-hour speech where he was paid Â£122,899.74. The prime minister took the holiday to St Vincent and the Grenadines with girlfriend Carrie Symonds between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. Labour's shadow minister for the cabinet office, Jon Trickett, said Mr Johnson ""must come clean"" about the holiday accommodation, adding that if he does not, Parliament's standards watchdog ""should step in"". ""The public deserves to know who is paying for their prime minister's jaunts,"" Mr Trickett added. The entry in Mr Johnson's register of interests says Mr Ross donated accommodation ""for a private holiday for my partner and me, value Â£15,000"". But a spokesman for Mr Rosstold the Daily Mail:,external""Boris wanted some help to find somewhere in Mustique, David called the company who run all the villas and somebody had dropped out. ""So Boris got the use of a villa that was worth Â£15,000, but David Ross did not pay any monies whatsoever for this."" A later statement from the spokesman added: ""Mr Ross facilitated accommodation for Mr Johnson on Mustique valued at Â£15,000. ""Therefore this is a benefit in kind from Mr Ross to Mr Johnson, and Mr Johnson's declaration to the House of Commons is correct."" Mr Ross has not provided any further details as to what he means, in this context, by a 'benefit in kind.' But sources in Westminster have suggested to me that this could refer to some sort of swap whereby David Ross agreed to give up his property - at a later date - in order to facilitate the prime minister's stay elsewhere on the island. And that there was no kind of cash donation. David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, at a photography exhibition in 2011 Mr Ross was one of Mr Johnson's aides in City Hall and was appointed to the Olympics organising committee. But he resigned from the roles, and his company, over a share scandal in 2008. It emerged Mr Ross had used millions of pounds' worth of Carphone Warehouse shares as collateral against personal loans without informing the company's other directors - a potential breach of City rules at the time. Mr Ross has been a long-standing donor to the Conservative Party, pledging Â£250,000 in the last election campaign. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""All transparency requirements have been followed, as set out in the Register of Members' Financial Interests"". Brexit will mark 'new chapter' for UK, says PM Conservatives ahead in race for donations Carphone's Ross quits Olympic role,external Mr Johnson faced criticism over his holiday for not returning sooner,after the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimaniraised tensions in the Middle East. It is the first trip abroad that Mr Johnson has declared since going to Saudi Arabia in September 2018. Only one other MP has declared a free holiday in the last year. Mr Johnson also declared payments he had received prior to becoming prime minister, including book royalties and hundreds of thousands of pounds for speaking engagements. In the first six months of 2019, Mr Johnson earned more than Â£327,000 for the seven speaking engagements, which lasted a total of 17.5 hours. He was also paid Â£22,916.66 a month for his column in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which was published weekly.

Julian Smith sacked as NI Secretary,"Julian Smith said serving the people of Northern Ireland ""has been the biggest privilege"" Julian Smith has been sacked as Northern Ireland Secretary as part of the prime minister's cabinet reshuffle. Mr Smith was appointed in July 2019 and lasted 204 days in the role. He took over from Karen Bradley who was sacked by the new prime minister Boris Johnson after 562 days as NI secretary. Mr Smith oversaw a talks process that led to theNorthern Ireland parties agreeing a deal to restore a power-sharing government at Stormont last month. He was also praised for his role inhelping legislation to provide compensation to historical abuse victimspass through Parliament. Allow Twitter content?

He said serving the people of Northern Ireland ""has been the biggest privilege"". He added: ""The warmth and support from people across NI has been incredible. Thank you so much."" So it's farewell Julian Smith and we'll be getting a fourth NI Secretary in under four years. This will be a hugely unpopular decision in both Belfast and Dublin, and will leave some wondering why the prime minister would sack a secretary of state who actually managed to do what seemed impossible - get devolution restored. But remember, Julian Smith and Boris Johnson had never seen eye to eye - on Brexit and other NI matters. Mr Smith had also been known for fighting his corner in cabinet, rather than being quietly loyal. In his short-lived time in this complicated place, Julian Smith not only stopped the ship from sinking but was helping to chart a new course. He will surely be a tough act to follow.

He added: ""Without your leadership I don't believe NI would have a government today. ""Thank you Julian Smith for your trust, friendship and courage; the UK and Ireland can look to the future with more confidence because of it."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said she had spoken to Mr Smith on Thursday morning to thank him for his help in getting devolution restored.

Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said she was writing to the government for an urgent meeting with the incoming secretary of state. ""In that meeting, Sinn FÃ©in will take the opportunity to raise the financial commitments made by the British government in the New Decade New Approach agreement only weeks ago,"" she said. ""Reports from London that Julian Smith was sacked as a result of commitments made to bring forward legislation to implement the legacy bodies agreed at Stormont House are very concerning for victims of the conflict and their families.""

While Mr Smith's effectiveness has been widely praised, more critical voices argue he became secretary of state at a more opportune time than his immediate predecessors, with both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in eager to return to government at Stormont. People Before Profit assembly member Gerry Carroll said that no Conservative NI Secretary had ever been good for Northern Ireland, and accused Mr Smith's party of ""launching economic war on working class communities"". Mr Smith, who has been an MP for Skipton and Ripon since 2010, served Theresa May as chief whip, a job in which he was unable to guide her proposed EU Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons.

Number of female homicide victims up 10%,"Mary Annie Sowerby, Aliny Godinho, Elize Stevens, Alison Hunt, Asma Begum and Dorothy Bowyer were among the women killed last year The number of female homicide victims in England and Wales has risen to the highest level since 2006. There were 241 female victims of murder, manslaughter and infanticide in the 12 months to the end of March 2019, up 10% on the previous year. The number of separate homicide incidents rose to 662, up from 644 the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, the overall number of victims fell to 671. This was 33, or 5%, fewer than the previous year. It represents the first fall since 2015, although this was partly due to those killed in the London and Manchester terror attacks and the Shoreham air crash being included in the 2018 figures. The ONS said the year-on-year decline was driven by a fall in male victims - down 11%, from 484 to 429. The number of black homicide victims was the highest in 17 years - totalling 97 in 2018/19. Domestic killings reach five-year high The faces of 2019's 100 knife crime victims The murders of women giving Europe a wake-up call The majority of homicide victims (64%) were male, while just over a third (36%) were female. Almost half (48%) of female victims were killed in a domestic homicide, with the suspect a partner or ex-partner in 38% of cases. One of these was Kay Richardson, 49, who was beaten and strangled to death by her estranged husband Alan Martin, 53, in September 2018, just days after he had been arrested for allegedly raping her. He had been released under investigation by police, without any restrictions. This video can not be played ""We are haunted by what happened to Kay' The number of baby girls and toddlers killed in the period also reached a decade high, with homicide victims including 14 females under the age of one and 13 toddlers aged between one and four. These are the highest numbers since the earliest available figures, when six female babies and eight children aged between one and four were killed in the year to March 2009. Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has campaigned on domestic violence, said the figures were ""horrendous"" but an ""inevitability"" in light of cuts to public services. The ""degradation of police resources"", a ""crumbling criminal justice system"" and cuts to council services which have affected routes out of danger for women trying to escape abusive relationships have all played a factor, she said. Ms Phillips added that the number of suspects being released under investigation with no restrictions on their movements by police, rather than with stricter bail conditions, was of particular concern. The Victims' Commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, said the number of women killed by a partner or ex-partner was ""not surprising"" but ""deeply troubling"". ""In the name of these women we need urgently to take more action on early intervention,"" she said. Crime Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was recruiting 20,000 new police officers and ensuring violent and sexual offenders spent longer behind bars to help protect the public. He said the figures were a ""stark reminder of the devastating impact of domestic abuse"" andthe Domestic Abuse Bill, which the government plans to reintroduce to Parliament, would also provide greater protections for victims. The bill would place a legal duty on councils to offer secure homes to those fleeing violence, as well as introducing a government definition of domestic abuse, including emotional and financial abuse, and a commissioner to hold government to account.

Ms Phillips added that the number of suspects being released under investigation with no restrictions on their movements by police, rather than with stricter bail conditions, was of particular concern. The Victims' Commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, said the number of women killed by a partner or ex-partner was ""not surprising"" but ""deeply troubling"". ""In the name of these women we need urgently to take more action on early intervention,"" she said. Crime Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was recruiting 20,000 new police officers and ensuring violent and sexual offenders spent longer behind bars to help protect the public. He said the figures were a ""stark reminder of the devastating impact of domestic abuse"" andthe Domestic Abuse Bill, which the government plans to reintroduce to Parliament, would also provide greater protections for victims. The bill would place a legal duty on councils to offer secure homes to those fleeing violence, as well as introducing a government definition of domestic abuse, including emotional and financial abuse, and a commissioner to hold government to account.

We are drawing our live page to a close, but here are some of the highlights from a busy day:  You can check out Boris Johnson's new cabinet in detail here. Thanks for reading and have a good evening. Lord Goldmsith adds to his existing roles in the government In a new run of appointments from No 10, Lord Goldsmith stays on as a minister for the environment and international development, but adds minister for the Foreign Office as another string to his bow. Nigel Adams moves from the culture department to become a joint minister for the Foreign Office and international development. Baroness Sugg will now split her time between her existing role as a joint parliamentary under secretary at international development to take up the same position in the Foreign Office. The announcement from Downing Street also confirms Kit Malthouse will stay as a Home Office minister, and Conor Burns will remain an international trade minister. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Sajid Javid was presented with an offer that, you could say, he had to refuse. Now, whether Downing Street knew or not is another matter. Did they want this all along? It is hard to say. But there is no doubt that trouble had been brewing for quite a while. It was not just about personalities. Yes, there were briefings going back and forth, appearing in the newspapers, some from those in No 11, some from those in No 10, and there was clearly a problem in relations. But obviously this restructuring, this idea you will have a central pool of advisors so that No 10 and 11 work more closely together, that isn't just about the characters. It is about power and where power resides. Of course, there have been tensions between prime ministers and chancellors for a very long time. We have seen it numerous times in the last few decades. But this was of a different level and, in the end, Sajid Javid realised he couldn't carry on in those circumstances. So we now have the meteoric rise of Rishi Sunak, who is taking over as chancellor just four weeks before a Budget. The new chancellor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has echoed the words of his shadow chancellor when commenting on today's government reshuffle. Speaking in Manchester, he said it had been a ""record
collapse of a government"". He added: ""Boris Johnson became prime minister in July. At that
time, as far as I can remember, Philip Hammond was Chancellor of the Exchequer. ""We then had Sajid Javid [and] we've now got the third Chancellor of the Exchequer in
less than six months. ""This is a government in chaos.â Rosena Allin-Khan is running to be deputy leader of the Labour Party One of the candidates for Labour's deputy leadership is calling for the race to be postponed. Rosena Allin-Khan says those running for leader and deputy were supposed to get data on members tomorrow so they could contact them before voting starts. However, the contenders have now been told they won't get the lists until Saturday - despite paying Â£5,000 for them - and they won't include all members. The MP for Tooting says she was told it was possible some people might be given their online ballot before the candidates can get in touch with them, which she calls ""unfair and ridiculous"". She adds: ""Every candidateâs team raised concerns about this today. ""It is my belief that the ballot should be postponed until all the data is processed and each campaign has had a decent amount of time to access it. ""Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There was no hint of what was to come from the lips of Chancellor Sajid Javid. He had been reassured of his future in post, when I spoke to him 48 hours ago. He was planning not just the Budget, but also a Spending Review, and a finance white paper involving negotiations with the EU over the ongoing access of UK finance to the EU. His team had signalled the Budget was going to be a significant new chapter in UK economic policy. The first Budget of this government and its healthy majority, able to plan its own long term strategy. However, there had been a strange series of last minute reorganisations regarding the chancellor's traditional round of interviews on the GDP figures. Read more from our economics editor here. There have been lots of ins and outs in today's reshuffle. But who are the new, and returning, faces of Boris Johnson's top team? Take a look at our guide to who's who in the cabinet here. Robin Walker has been promoted to become a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, having served as a parliamentary under secretary. But in a tweet celebrating his new role, he also praises former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, who was sacked earlier today and replaced with Brandon Lewis. Allow Twitter content?

James Brokenshire comes back into government as a Home Office minister Another raft of reshuffle appointments have come through from No 10. James Brokenshire returns to government after being ousted as housing secretary last summer, to serve as a minister in the Home Office. Chloe Smith gets a promotion from a parliamentary secretary in the Cabinet Office to a full blown minister. Jeremy Quin moves from the Cabinet Office to become a minister in Defence, while Helen Whately moves from the cutlure department to become a health minister. Robin Walker stays in the Northern Ireland Office, but has been promoted from parliamentary under secretary to minister. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor It is no secret that there have been - as there so often are in government - tensions between those powerful next door neighbours in Downing Street. There was some bad blood between No 10 and No 11 over briefings, and the expectation management of the day-to-day politics between the two sides has not always gone smoothly in recent weeks. But when the day of this reshuffle began - always an important moment in any government - few would have expected or predicted it would have turned out quite like it did. And as with any reshuffle, when moving the furniture of government around, it is sometimes wise to expect the unexpected. In case you struggle to read the small print, here is the letter in full: Dear prime minister, It has been a privilege to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since being elected as the MP for Bromsgrove 10 years ago, I have had the huge honour of holding several ministerial roles - running five departments, including two of the great offices of state. While I am grateful for your continued trust and offer to continue this role, I regret that I could not accept the conditions attached to the reappointment. It is crucial for the effectiveness of the government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice, as I have always sought to do. I also believe that it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with. The government you lead has an enormous opportunity in the coming years to transform our country. Millions of people have given their renewed trust in a Conservative government to move on from the divisions and distractions of recent years, and lead us forward into a decade of social and economic renewal. We must not waste a moment in delivering on that promise. As you know, the agenda we have been developing over the last seven months is one that I have long supported. From maintaining strong public finances, investing in infrastructure, protecting our environment, recruiting 20,000 police officers, and boosting housing and skills so the next generation can have the opportunities they deserve. I would urge you to ensure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible. The team there has impressed me with the energy and intellect they have brought to delivering the shifts in policy that I have led. They are among the very best public servants we have and I hope they can continue to play a central role in driving an economic agenda that puts people and place at its heart. My biggest hope is that this government will bring the country together, and help to level the playing field so that stories like mine are not exceptional or lucky. While it is of course disappointing that I will no longer be in the position to see this vision through as one of your cabinet ministers, I am very optimistic about our country's future. You and the government you lead will continue to have my full support from the backbenches. I am very much looking forward to spending more time with my family, and to continuing to serve the people of Bromsgrove. Yours ever, Sajid Javid BBC political correspondent tweets...

Penny Mordaunt makes a return to government A string of new appointments for more junior roles has just been announced by Downing Street. Former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt has made a return to government, becoming the Paymaster General in the Cabinet Office. She was sacked by Boris Johnson when he took over in July 2019, after just three months at defence. Former party chairman James Cleverly has also been shifted into a new role as a minister for both the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. Christopher Pincher has taken over as a minister in the housing, communities and local government department. And Andrew Stephenson has been appointed transport minister for the government. David Cameron's former deputy chief of staff says she does not believe No 10 knew Sajid Javid would resign when they told him their plans this morning. Speaking to BBC News, Baroness Fall says reshuffle days are ""all about a fresh face for government"" but the chancellor stepping down is ""now the central story"". She says: ""I find it strange this wasn't ironed out in the couple of days before and the choice wasn't made then as it has blown up a day that should be about the new cabinet."" Baroness Fall does say there was a ""possibility"" that Rishi Sunak was not promoted in the rest of the reshuffle ""just in case something went wrong"". But she does not follow others in Westminster in blaming the PM's chief adviser. ""Dominic Cummings works for Boris Johnson,"" she says. ""He is the prime minister, he calls the shots.""

Our correspondent, Nick Eardley, has been in a briefing with No 10 after all of today's twists and turns. The spokesman thanked Sajid Javid for his work as chancellor, and said his successor, Rishi Sunak, will carry on with the preparations for the Budget. However, he would not confirm if it will still go ahead as planned on 11 March, saying: ""Preparations have been carried out already and will continue
at a pace."" The PM's spokesman also confirmed reports that the two separate teams of special advisers at No 10 and the Treasury will merge into one to jointly advise the new chancellor and the prime minister. The new unit will ultimately be accountable to the PM. But Downing Street said the Budget will be written by Mr Sunak and he had already been involved in his former job as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Â© 2025 BBC.

Breaking|Breaking newsSajid Javid resigns as chancellor,"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: I had no option but to resign Sajid Javid has shocked Westminster by quitting as chancellor in the middle of Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle. Mr Javid rejected the prime minister's order to fire his team of aides, saying ""no self-respecting minister"" could accept such a condition. He has been replaced as chancellor by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak - who just seven months ago was a junior housing minister. Mr Javid had been due to deliver his first Budget in four weeks' time. The former home secretary was appointed chancellor by Mr Johnson when he became prime minister in July. His resignation follows rumours of tensions between Mr Javid and the prime minister's senior adviser Dominic Cummings. Kuenssberg: Johnson chooses power over personnel Cabinet reshuffle: Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Who is new Chancellor Rishi Sunak? Analysis: Shock resignation means test for new chancellor Mr Javid said his advisers had worked ""incredibly hard"" and he could not agree to them being replaced. ""I felt I was left with no option but to resign,"" he said, adding that Mr Sunak and the rest of the government retained his ""full support"". In his resignation letter, Mr Javid explained that he could not accept the PM's conditions saying: ""I believe it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with."" Downing Street said there would now be a joint team of economic advisers for both the chancellor and prime minister.

This video can not be played Leila Nathoo looks back at the day in politics, as the PM's reshuffle went further than even he perhaps expected He is being replaced at the international development department by Armed Forces minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan. There is a return to government for former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who becomes paymaster general. Meanwhile, Mr Cleverly is made a joint minister in the Foreign Office and Department for International Development. Mordaunt back as PM reshuffles ministers Who is Dominic Cummings? Cabinet members remaining in place include Home Secretary Priti Patel; Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab; Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove; Health Secretary Matt Hancock; International Trade Secretary Liz Truss; Transport Secretary Grant Shapps; Defence Secretary Ben Wallace; Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg; and Chief Whip Mark Spencer. The reshuffle reduces the number of women in the full cabinet from seven to six. Mr Johnson is expected to appoint a new minister to oversee the building of the HS2 rail line, final approval for which was given this week. Meanwhile, a former adviser to Mr Javid said Downing Street had misjudged the reshuffle and that the Budget could be delayed as a result. Salma Shah told BBC Newscast she thought No 10 estimated Mr Javid would take up an offer to remain in his post, despite a request to fire his team of aides. This video can not be played A former advisor to Mr Javid says Downing Street misjudged the reshuffle. Earlier Mr Sunak tweeted that he felt ""honoured"" to become chancellor, adding that Mr Javid had done a ""fantastic job"" and been ""a pleasure to work with"". Commenting on Mr Javid's resignation, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""This must be a historical record with the government in crisis after just over two months in power. ""Dominic Cummings has clearly won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury and install his stooge as chancellor."" Losing a chancellor is no small event, and it wasn't what Boris Johnson set out to do. But today shows that No 10's priority was political control rather than keeping personnel they valued. When Mr Javid refused, they chose instead to see him leave. This begs a wider question - is it stronger to share power or hoard it? Boris Johnson and his team have made the choice today to do the latter - to lose a chancellor rather than allow a rival faction offering different political advice to the next door neighbour. Read more from Laura. Julian Smith's sacking -  weeks after he brokered the deal which restored the power-sharing administration in Stormont - was greeted with shock in Northern Ireland. The former minister said on Twitter that doing the job had been ""the biggest privilege"" and he was ""extremely grateful"" to have been given the chance to serve ""this amazing part of our country"".

Smith sacked as NI Secretary,"Julian Smith said serving the people of Northern Ireland ""has been the biggest privilege"" Julian Smith has been sacked as Northern Ireland Secretary as part of the prime minister's cabinet reshuffle. Mr Smith was appointed in July 2019 and lasted 204 days in the role. He took over from Karen Bradley who was sacked by the new prime minister Boris Johnson after 562 days as NI secretary. Mr Smith oversaw a talks process that led to theNorthern Ireland parties agreeing a deal to restore a power-sharing government at Stormont last month. He was also praised for his role inhelping legislation to provide compensation to historical abuse victimspass through Parliament. Allow Twitter content?

He said serving the people of Northern Ireland ""has been the biggest privilege"". He added: ""The warmth and support from people across NI has been incredible. Thank you so much."" So it's farewell Julian Smith and we'll be getting a fourth NI Secretary in under four years. This will be a hugely unpopular decision in both Belfast and Dublin, and will leave some wondering why the prime minister would sack a secretary of state who actually managed to do what seemed impossible - get devolution restored. But remember, Julian Smith and Boris Johnson had never seen eye to eye - on Brexit and other NI matters. Mr Smith had also been known for fighting his corner in cabinet, rather than being quietly loyal. In his short-lived time in this complicated place, Julian Smith not only stopped the ship from sinking but was helping to chart a new course. He will surely be a tough act to follow.

Mr Smith, who has been an MP for Skipton and Ripon since 2010, served Theresa May as chief whip, a job in which he was unable to guide her proposed EU Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons.

""It is my belief that the ballot should be postponed until all the data is processed and each campaign has had a decent amount of time to access it. ""Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There was no hint of what was to come from the lips of Chancellor Sajid Javid. He had been reassured of his future in post, when I spoke to him 48 hours ago. He was planning not just the Budget, but also a Spending Review, and a finance white paper involving negotiations with the EU over the ongoing access of UK finance to the EU. His team had signalled the Budget was going to be a significant new chapter in UK economic policy. The first Budget of this government and its healthy majority, able to plan its own long term strategy. However, there had been a strange series of last minute reorganisations regarding the chancellor's traditional round of interviews on the GDP figures. Read more from our economics editor here. There have been lots of ins and outs in today's reshuffle. But who are the new, and returning, faces of Boris Johnson's top team? Take a look at our guide to who's who in the cabinet here. Robin Walker has been promoted to become a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, having served as a parliamentary under secretary. But in a tweet celebrating his new role, he also praises former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, who was sacked earlier today and replaced with Brandon Lewis. Allow Twitter content?

James Brokenshire comes back into government as a Home Office minister Another raft of reshuffle appointments have come through from No 10. James Brokenshire returns to government after being ousted as housing secretary last summer, to serve as a minister in the Home Office. Chloe Smith gets a promotion from a parliamentary secretary in the Cabinet Office to a full blown minister. Jeremy Quin moves from the Cabinet Office to become a minister in Defence, while Helen Whately moves from the cutlure department to become a health minister. Robin Walker stays in the Northern Ireland Office, but has been promoted from parliamentary under secretary to minister. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor It is no secret that there have been - as there so often are in government - tensions between those powerful next door neighbours in Downing Street. There was some bad blood between No 10 and No 11 over briefings, and the expectation management of the day-to-day politics between the two sides has not always gone smoothly in recent weeks. But when the day of this reshuffle began - always an important moment in any government - few would have expected or predicted it would have turned out quite like it did. And as with any reshuffle, when moving the furniture of government around, it is sometimes wise to expect the unexpected. In case you struggle to read the small print, here is the letter in full: Dear prime minister, It has been a privilege to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since being elected as the MP for Bromsgrove 10 years ago, I have had the huge honour of holding several ministerial roles - running five departments, including two of the great offices of state. While I am grateful for your continued trust and offer to continue this role, I regret that I could not accept the conditions attached to the reappointment. It is crucial for the effectiveness of the government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice, as I have always sought to do. I also believe that it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with. The government you lead has an enormous opportunity in the coming years to transform our country. Millions of people have given their renewed trust in a Conservative government to move on from the divisions and distractions of recent years, and lead us forward into a decade of social and economic renewal. We must not waste a moment in delivering on that promise. As you know, the agenda we have been developing over the last seven months is one that I have long supported. From maintaining strong public finances, investing in infrastructure, protecting our environment, recruiting 20,000 police officers, and boosting housing and skills so the next generation can have the opportunities they deserve. I would urge you to ensure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible. The team there has impressed me with the energy and intellect they have brought to delivering the shifts in policy that I have led. They are among the very best public servants we have and I hope they can continue to play a central role in driving an economic agenda that puts people and place at its heart. My biggest hope is that this government will bring the country together, and help to level the playing field so that stories like mine are not exceptional or lucky. While it is of course disappointing that I will no longer be in the position to see this vision through as one of your cabinet ministers, I am very optimistic about our country's future. You and the government you lead will continue to have my full support from the backbenches. I am very much looking forward to spending more time with my family, and to continuing to serve the people of Bromsgrove. Yours ever, Sajid Javid BBC political correspondent tweets...

Penny Mordaunt makes a return to government A string of new appointments for more junior roles has just been announced by Downing Street. Former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt has made a return to government, becoming the Paymaster General in the Cabinet Office. She was sacked by Boris Johnson when he took over in July 2019, after just three months at defence. Former party chairman James Cleverly has also been shifted into a new role as a minister for both the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. Christopher Pincher has taken over as a minister in the housing, communities and local government department. And Andrew Stephenson has been appointed transport minister for the government. David Cameron's former deputy chief of staff says she does not believe No 10 knew Sajid Javid would resign when they told him their plans this morning. Speaking to BBC News, Baroness Fall says reshuffle days are ""all about a fresh face for government"" but the chancellor stepping down is ""now the central story"". She says: ""I find it strange this wasn't ironed out in the couple of days before and the choice wasn't made then as it has blown up a day that should be about the new cabinet."" Baroness Fall does say there was a ""possibility"" that Rishi Sunak was not promoted in the rest of the reshuffle ""just in case something went wrong"". But she does not follow others in Westminster in blaming the PM's chief adviser. ""Dominic Cummings works for Boris Johnson,"" she says. ""He is the prime minister, he calls the shots.""

Our correspondent, Nick Eardley, has been in a briefing with No 10 after all of today's twists and turns. The spokesman thanked Sajid Javid for his work as chancellor, and said his successor, Rishi Sunak, will carry on with the preparations for the Budget. However, he would not confirm if it will still go ahead as planned on 11 March, saying: ""Preparations have been carried out already and will continue
at a pace."" The PM's spokesman also confirmed reports that the two separate teams of special advisers at No 10 and the Treasury will merge into one to jointly advise the new chancellor and the prime minister. The new unit will ultimately be accountable to the PM. But Downing Street said the Budget will be written by Mr Sunak and he had already been involved in his former job as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Â© 2025 BBC.

'My court record only emerged when I got a job',"Claudia almost lost her job because of a county court judgement Receiving a county court judgement (CCJ) can have damaging consequences. So, not even knowing there is a ruling against you can come as a shock. Claudia only discovered the CCJ against her when she got her first job. ""If it hadn't been for my job I would never have known,"" says the 23-year-old. The number of people in their 20s with court orders for unpaid debt has risen sharply in the last year, according to figures seen by Radio 4's Money Box. Court records from theRegistry Trust,externalshow that last year 160,000 were given CCJs, up 30% from the year before. Zero hour contracts, payday loans, unstable jobs, mobile phone bills, subscription services and increasing rent prices are thought to be partly behind the rise, the Registry Trust says. Claudia's CCJ was for Â£270, for two weeks' outstanding rent when she was in student accommodation at university. ""I [had] moved out from my family home into a different home, so I never received any correspondence from the court,"" she said. ""The CCJ was filed in April 2017. I found out about it in July 2018 with my first job. It came about again with my second job in 2019. ""I didn't understand the severity until I got my latest job. It was insinuated that 'it needs to come off [be paid off]' or else I could lose my job,"" she said. Claudia disputes the Â£270 her ex-landlord says she owed him, and said she had faced problems applying for credit because of her CCJ. So she sought legal advice to challenge it and it's now been resolved, an outcome she's happy with. Claudia disputes the claim against her ""I tried to change my phone contract from my parents' name to my name. That didn't work. My car broke and I tried to finance a new car in my name. That didn't work."" Most judgements in the last year for Claudia's age group were for amounts between Â£100 and Â£500. The second largest proportion was for amounts between Â£500 and Â£1,000. A CCJ is a court order in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that can be issued to an individual if they fail to repay money they owe. It's an action creditors can take as part of the debt collection process. If the debt is not paid, the CCJ can be filed on an individual's credit report and remain on it for six years. That can lead to problems getting things like a mortgage, credit card, a lease on a rental property and a mobile phone contract. The file can be removed from a credit report if the debt is paid within one month of receiving the judgement. If it's settled later, it remains on an individual's credit report with a note marking that it's been paid. In Scotland, county court judgements are called decrees. Like CCJs, they can remain on a credit file for six years. The Registry Trust, a not-for-profit group which manages court records on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, said the rise in CCJs for low amounts can be explained by banks and phone companies selling off smaller debts to specialist debt collection agencies. ""We've seen a massive rise in the number of judgements but a fall in the average value of judgements, which means that more and more creditors are using the courts to recover smaller debts,"" said Mick McAteer, chairman of the Registry Trust. He said that for some people, they only find out there is a CCJ on their credit record when they apply for a loan. ""Younger people tend to move house more often than their older counterparts, so they might miss letters about CCJs,"" he said. ""However, the purpose of a CCJ is to get someone to pay the money they owe."" Sir Bob Neill, chairman of the House of Commons Justice Committee, said the rise is ""very troubling and it's part of an underlying problem of a lack of financial education that we have"". He added that the next stage after a CCJ is when bailiffs are used to enforce a payment. But by then, he added, ""a lot of the harm of the CCJ has already been done to people's credit rating"". The Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for the Courts and Tribunals service which issues CCJs, said it ""doesn't routinely comment on rises in statistics"".

Nestle axes low sugar chocolate due to poor sales,"Nestle has axed its range of chocolate that used a new low-sugar technique, less than two years after it was launched. The Swiss food giant said demand for its Milkybar Wowsomes had been ""underwhelming"". The bars used what Nestle described as ""hollow"" sugar crystals to cut the amount of sugar by almost a third. Confectionery makers have come under pressure from health authorities to cut the amount of sugar in their products. Nestle's Milkybar Wowsomes was the first product to use technology developed by the company that creates sugar with a more porous structure, which it likened to hollowing out the sugar crystals. Some industry experts had seen the discovery as a breakthrough that would help Nestle take a leading position in a growing market for low-sugar products. At the time of the launch Stefano Agostini, Nestle's chief executive for UK and Ireland, said: ""A new product like Milkybar Wowsomes introduces greater choice and allows parents to treat their children with chocolate that tastes great but has less sugar. ""We are demonstrating how we can, and will, contribute to a healthier future and that we take our public health responsibilities very seriously,"" he added. Nestle 'restructures' Milkybar to cut sugar Food giant to stop advertising ice cream to kids Child obesity: Will we see radical action? Last year, reduced sugar versions of Mars and Snickers were launched by Mars Wrigley UK, while Mondelez Â­followed suit with low-sugar Cadbury Dairy Milk. Nestle said it is now working on new sugar reduction technology that it aims to introduce next year. The announcement highlights a major issue facing the world's big processed food producers. While governments and many consumers have called for lower-sugar products, most people have yet to warm to less sweet alternatives. Attempts to cut obesity rates have seen processed food giant Unilever this week promise to stop marketing its products to children. The maker of Twister ice cream and Popsicle ice lollies, said it would limit the use of cartoon characters in its advertising.

Who's who in Johnson's cabinet,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election. There was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Who's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places. Boris Johnson's election win in December secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. While his election campaign promised to ""get Brexit done"", Mr Johnson has said his ""one nation government"" will also ""massively increase investment in the NHS"". Mr Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, having served as foreign secretary since 2016 in what was only his first cabinet post. His views on how to deliver Brexit brought him into conflict with Mrs May, and led to his resignation in 2018. Rishi Sunak replaces Sajid Javid, who resigned as Chancellor during the reshuffle on Thursday. Appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July, Rishi Sunakâs status as a rising star was highlighted when he was sent to stand in for Boris Johnson at the BBCâs seven-party election debate. He was previously a successful businessman, co-founding a large investment firm. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy daughter of an Indian billionaire. The couple lived in California for a number of years before coming back to the UK. They now have two daughters. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Dominic Raab was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet in July and remains in post. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. He is married with two sons. Michael Gove is the cabinet minister with the most experience - but his aspirations for the top job are well known. He lost out to Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership campaign in summer 2019. Mr Gove became environment secretary in June 2017 and proved a key advocate of Theresa Mayâs Brexit deal, while other Brexiteer cabinet ministers resigned. In 2016, he famously scuppered the leadership hopes of his friend Boris Johnson, by announcing his own candidature on the morning of Johnson's own campaign launch. Mr Gove was a key ally of former Prime Minister David Cameron and has served as MP for Surrey Heath since 2005. He made his name as a radical education secretary, bringing in major changes to exams and the curriculum and battling teaching unions during his four years in the role. Appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson last July, Ben Wallace previously served as security minister. Mr Wallace backed Remain in 2016 and has warned that leaving the EU without a deal would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public. After training at Sandhurst, Mr Wallace joined the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. He spent eight years in the Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. Liz Truss was made international trade secretary and also women and equalities minister when Boris Johnson took office and remains in that role. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Mr Hancock remains in post as health secretary. At 40, he was youngest contender in the Tory leadership race in the summer of 2019. He quit the contest a day after he came sixth in the first ballot and later endorsed Boris Johnson. The ambitious MP for West Suffolk was promoted to health secretary in 2018 after only a few months as culture secretary. He campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum but backed both Theresa May's and Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. The former Bank of England economist likes to see himself as one of the most technology-savvy politicians at Westminster - he was the first MP to have his own smartphone app. Gavin Williamson made a swift return to the cabinet last July following his sacking by Theresa May two months earlier after row over the leaking of information from the National Security Council. Mr Williamson is influential within the Tory party, having served as a ministerial aide to David Cameron and then as chief whip, in charge of party discipline. At that time, he famously kept a tarantula named Cronus on his desk in the House of Commons. Mr Williamson, who backed remain in the EU referendum, also helped to run Boris Johnsonâs campaign in the first phase of the Tory leadership contest last summer. The 41-year old MP for Hertsmere is a rising star in the Conservative ranks and replaces Nicky Morgan as Culture Secretary. Since last summer, he has been a minister in the Cabinet Office â playing a key role working with No 10 in implementing government policy. Before becoming an MP, the Cambridge-educated law graduate worked in public relations and cut his teeth in the Conservative Research Department. He then worked as an adviser to David Cameron, becoming his deputy chief of staff in Downing Street. He subsequently received a CBE for his services. In his maiden speech, he told the House of Commons he could make a legitimate claim to be the MP for TV soap Eastendersâ Albert Square, as it was filmed in his constituency. During his five years in the Commons, he has campaigned on greater legal protection for the Green Belt, more money for education and simplification of the tax system. The former International Development Secretary replaces Andrea Leadsom. The MP for Reading West backed Boris Johnson for prime minister and joined the cabinet in July 2019. Mr Sharma will also be the minister responsible for the Glasgow COP26 climate summit in November. Prior to being elected in 2010, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked in banking. He is married with two daughters. Former Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick represented the Conservatives on the under 30s Question Time debate during the general election campaign. In the summer he joined other rising stars Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden in saying Boris Johnson was the only one who could save the Tory party from an ""existential threat"". He drew criticism in 2017 when, as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international trade, he attended US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Mr Jenrick was elected as MP for Newark in a by-election in June 2014 after Patrick Mercer resigned in disgrace, and won the seat with an increased majority at the general election of 2015. He voted Remain in the EU referendum. Former environment minister Therese Coffey was appointed after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and later voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she has since spoken about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department in May 2019. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". Mr Buckland campaigned to remain in the EU, but has said it is important to deliver on the result of the referendum. He has, however, previously spoken out against a no-deal Brexit and of the need for compromise. He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He had previously practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaces Alok Sharma as International Development Secretary. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. The former international development minister Grant Shapps became transport secretary in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. A former remainer, he has since said he is backing Brexit ""as hard as you like"". He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps, a father-of-three, was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice replaces Theresa Villiers as environment secretary. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Brandon Lewis replaces Julian Smith as Northern Ireland Secretary. The former Conservative Party chairman rejoined cabinet under Boris Johnson as home office minister in July 2019. Previous positions include minister without portfolio, minister for housing and and minister for immigration. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood Borough Council, Essex, Mr Lewis has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Simon Hart was appointed as Welsh secretary to replace Alun Cairns last November. Mr Cairns resigned at the start of the general election campaign amid a row over what he knew about an aide's role in the collapse of a rape trial. The job was a promotion for Mr Hart, who has represented Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire since 2010. He previously served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also director of the New Schools Network, the organisation set up by Rachel Wolf, which runs the free schools programme. Amanda Milling replaces James Cleverly as Conservative Party chairman and will attend Cabinet as minister without portfolio. She was previously deputy chief whip, and was elected to Parliament as member for Cannock Chase in 2015. Amanda Milling is known as a key ally of Boris Johnson and worked on his leadership campaign. Jacob Rees Mogg is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit, and has long argued that the UK would be best to leave the EU with no deal. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it is his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. During the election campaign, he was criticised for saying it would have been ""common sense"" to flee the Grenfell Tower fire, ignoring fire brigade advice. Boris Johnson's chief enforcer, in theory, has an easier job now the party has a large majority. But Mr Spencer is no stranger to the role, having served in the whips' office since 2016. He has also been given the role of parliamentary secretary to the Treasury. From farming family, Mr Spencer did not attend Oxbridge, unlike many of his colleagues. He attended Shuttleworth Agricultural College before joining the family farming business. He started his political career as a local councillor and won the Sherwood seat from Labour in the 2010 general election. Suella Braverman replaces Geoffrey Cox as attorney general. A strong Brexit supporter, Ms Braverman chaired the European Research Group from June 2017 to January 2018 and became a minister at the Department for Leaving the EU under Theresa May. She resigned in November 2018 in protest at Mrs May's draft EU withdrawal deal Suella Braverman has served as MP for Fareham since 2015. Stephen Barclay will attend Cabinet in a new role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Barclay previously served as Brexit secretary under Theresa May and Boris Johnson - a position which became defunct at 11.01pm on 31 January as the UK left the EU. He was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. Note:BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations. This is the second reshuffle for Mr Johnson, who became prime minister last July after winning a Conservative leadership election. Big names to have left cabinet on Thursday includedChancellor Sajid Javid, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The make-up of the cabinet has also changed. The proportion of women in it has increased - but the actual number has fallen from eight to seven because some positions were closed. Members of the cabinet are more than 10 times more likely to have gone to a private school than members of the public. Under Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, 70% of cabinet had not been privately educated, whereas almost 70% of Mr Johnson's new cabinet have. According to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Gordon Brown.  Half of Mr Johnson's cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 27% of all Conservative MPs and 18% of Labour MPs. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said December's election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape and Conservative MPs now represent a more diverse range of constituencies than before. ""Yet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson's cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools,"" he said. ""Today's findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address.""

Sharp rise in coronavirus deaths and cases,"The WHO has said a vaccine will likely be found but it will take time Some 242 deaths from the new coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei on Wednesday, the deadliest day of the outbreak. There was also a huge increase in the number of cases, with 14,840 people diagnosed withCovid-19. Hubei has started using a broader definition to diagnose people, which accounts for most of the rise in cases. China sacked two top officials in Hubei province hours after the new figures were revealed. Until Wednesday's increases, the number of people with the virus in Hubei, where the outbreak emerged, was stabilising. But the new cases and deaths in the province have pushed the national death toll above 1,350 with almost 60,000 infections in total. Meanwhile Japan has announced its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s who lived in Kanagawa, south-west of Tokyo. It is the third death outside mainland China, following one each in the Philippines and Hong Kong. The woman's diagnosis was confirmed after her death and she had no obvious link to China's Hubei province, Japanese media reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is seeking ""further clarity"" from China about the changes to how cases of the virus are being confirmed. China has been accused of suppressing the full extent of the outbreak in the past, says the BBC's Nick Beake in Hong Kong. David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""What has happened in China is that they have changed the definition of what the disease really is - now they are taking people who have lesser symptoms. ""The deaths are quite worrisome, there is an increased number of deaths reported, but if you look overall at the total number of deaths and the total number of cases, the fatality ratio is about the same as it has been - but it is still high, as high as the death rate in influenza."" Only Hubei province - which accounts for more than 80% of overall Chinese infections - is using the new definition to diagnose new cases. Just about everyone who's been following China's official coronavirus numbers has been able to see that they have been incomplete. Government officials know this too. There's no way they've accounted for everybody infected. How could they? But at least we had what appeared to be a trend. We could observe the pattern to try and estimate the trajectory of outbreak. Now that's gone too. You can understand why it has been decided that people who have virus symptoms, plus a CT scan showing chest infection, are now being counted in the ""definitely infected"" column. However, this has thrown the trend mapping into chaos. Over the past 24 hours in Hubei alone, nearly 15,000 people were moved into the infected column. This would have sent shockwaves around the world, but actually, if you consider Wednesday's cases by the old definition, the rate could well mean another day of decline: a completely different picture. So now, we're scratching our heads: do we start looking at the pattern all over again from Thursday onwards? This has also left many wondering what the real death rate must have been over recent weeks and the extent to which we should be treating the overall figures seriously anyway. Meanwhile, the Communist Party secretary in Hubei, Jiang Chaoliang, has been replaced by the Shanghai party chief, Ying Yong, according to state media. The party chief of the capital city, Wuhan, has also been relieved of his duties. It is the first major change of Hubei party officials since the outbreak began. Earlier this week, a number of health officials were""removed"" from their jobs. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Why a global city is so vulnerable to virus spread The Valentine messages to coronavirus medics The province now includes ""clinically diagnosed cases"" in the number of confirmed cases. This means it includes those showing symptoms, and having a CT scan showing an infected lung, rather than relying only on the standard nucleic acid tests. Of the 242 new deaths in Wuhan, 135 are such ""clinically diagnosed"" cases. That means, even without the new definition, the number of deaths in Hubei on Wednesday was 107 - a new high for the province. The province's 14,840 new infections include 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases. Overall, the province now has 48,206 confirmed infections. A cruise ship carrying more than 2,000 people has docked in Cambodia after it was turned away by five ports over fears that some passengers might be infected with the virus. The MS Westerdam arrived on Thursday morning after Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand had all refused to accept the ship despite having no sick patients on board. Cruise ship rejected by five ports docks at last Are cruise ships really 'floating petri dishes'? Meanwhile, another 44 cases have been confirmed on the Diamond Princess, which is in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan. The increase means 218 people of the 3,700 people on board the ship have caught the virus. Not everyone has been tested yet. People with the virus are taken to hospitals on land to be treated, while those on board are largely confined to their cabins. However on Thursday Japan said it would allow those aged 80 or over who have tested negative for the coronavirus to disembark. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said they could be allowed off the ship as early as Friday but would have to stay in accommodation provided by the government, the Japan Times reported.

A global city vulnerable to spread,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Singapore minister says the country is 'vulnerable' Several international cases of the coronavirus from the UK to South Korea can be traced back to Singapore and some countries are now advising against travel to the international hub. But while Singapore has been commended for its management of the crisis, the tiny city-state faces unique challenges. Changi airport in Singapore is one of the most interconnected hubs in the world. In fact, there'sa flight taking off and arriving every 80 seconds here,external, making it more connected than JFK and San Francisco in the US and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. But the scenes there these days are very different. Dozens of thermal scanners dot the terminals, automatically taking the temperature of passengers as they enter and exit Singapore. Travellers are checked for fever, cold and cough symptoms - airport staff on the lookout for any sign of the coronavirus. The country's open borders and interconnectedness as well as its pro-active approach to testing means it has reported one of the highest tallies outside mainland China - 50. ""We are vulnerable, but we have to do everything that we can to contain that spread of the virus,"" says Lawrence Wong, co-chair of Singapore's task force on the coronavirus. But when a virus comes to Singapore it won't just affect this city. It can and has spread through Singapore to other countries around the world. This became painfully obvious when one meeting held in a luxury hotel in mid-January spawned several coronavirus cases around the world. More than 100 people attended the sales conference, including some from China. About a week after that meeting, stories of confirmed coronavirus cases began popping up all over the world - from South Korea to Malaysia, the UK and even Spain. Thefirst Malaysian to catch the virus,externalwas a 41-year-old man who had attended the conference along with colleagues from China. Subsequently, his sister and mother-in-law caught it from him. Singapore bank evacuated after worker falls ill Why are super-spreaders important? A visual guide to the outbreak Then,South Korea confirmed two infected cases,externalof South Korean nationals who had also attended the meeting. Singapore reported three cases,external: two Singaporean nationals and a permanent resident. British national and super-spreader Steve Walsh was also at the Singapore conference. After his meetings in the tropical city-state he flew to a French ski resort for a holiday, on his way back home. He is thought to have infected 11 others while he was there - people who eventually flew elsewhere - leading to five cases in England, five in France, and one in Majorca, Spain. This one meeting demonstrates how Singapore became a super-conductor for the virus. China and the virus that threatens everything How worried should we be? And the worry is it's not just one conference. Singapore is at risk of spreading the virus precisely because it is a top destination for business meetings and international travellers. The city-state is a big draw for Chinese businesses too, given the close economic links between the two countries -3.62m Chinese visitors came to Singapore in 2019,external, making up the largest group. Singapore learnt lessons from the Sars crisis in 2002-3 With Chinese tourists shunning Hong Kong because of the anti-government protests there, many chose to come to Singapore over the Lunar New Year holidays - which coincided with the coronavirus outbreak. ""We are very mindful that we are indeed an open economy, we are an international travel hub,"" Mr Wong says. ""So we are doing all we can to contain that spread. We are putting out information in a very transparent manner and we continue to work with all health authorities overseas."" At home, Singapore is stepping up its coronavirus response by taking extreme measures. It immediately understood the implications of spread in a densely-populated city. Indeed, eight of the 50 cases reported so far have no known links to clusters that had been in contact with Chinese travellers from Wuhan. That is likely to be of concern because it means the linking cases out there could yet pass on the illness to others. That's why Singapore has put in place a highly sophisticated contact tracing mechanism to hunt down every known possible contact of those infected so they can be quarantined or monitored. This video can not be played Coronavirus quarantine in US: 'I haven't had freedom for a month' It was the first country after North Korea and Russia toshut its borders to China,externaland has enforced astrict 14-day leave of absence for Chinese nationals,externalreturning from the mainland who are permanent residents or have work permits It has a zero tolerance approach to any breaches of the measures it has put in - and this is of comfort to many Singaporeans. Employees caught breaking isolation rules saw their work permits revoked and were barred from working in Singapore permanently. Meanwhile, theiremployers have been banned from hiring foreigners,externalfor two years. Singapore also distributed masks to more than a million households and has started a government-run WhatsApp group that provides daily updates to subscribers on the number of infected. It's even cleared out university dorms to make room for quarantined patients, a move that was executed so quickly it took students by surprise. But while the measures have been applauded by international health experts, Singaporeans themselves have not always bought the government's messaging. Social media comments show many Singaporeans don't believe the government's advice to wear masks only when you're unwell, suspecting a shortage of masks instead. Many also complained Singapore didn't close borders to China soon enough. Anti-fake news laws are being used to combat misinformation And when authorities raised the health alert level last week, indicating the spread of the disease was severe, scores of Singaporeans rushed to the supermarkets to stock up on rice, instant noodles and toilet paper, worried the country was going into lockdown. The panic abated only when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong released a recorded message assuring his citizens there were more than enough supplies. This level of control is only achievable in Singapore because of its centralised form of decision-making and the massive parliamentary majority the ruling party enjoys. There are also strict restrictions on what you can say in the public domain about the coronavirus, with thecountry's anti-fake news law being usedto curtail the spread of misinformation. Still, the main reason Singapore can move fast and quickly to fight the coronavirus is because it's so small, and it is clear that there is a plan in place - one that has been crafted from the harsh lessons of the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2002-2003. ""You would see your colleagues one day at lunch, and then a few days later, you would hear that they are in the ICU, or worse - dead,"" says Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist. A Sars survivor, he was on the frontline treating people with the illness in a period that, he says, ""scarred and traumatised Singaporeans"". Some238 people were infected and 33 lost their lives,external. ""We are such a vulnerable country, so small and well connected,"" Dr Leong says. ""You could have a disease one day in China, or anywhere else in the world, and the next minute it could be in Singapore. Containment is actually unrealistic, I don't think China will be able to control it. ""I think a weakened form of the virus will emerge, like a common cold. That will be the eventuality of this virus."" Singapore has no choice but to be extra vigilant and transparent in its fight against this deadly disease. This country is dependent on the rest of the world for its economy, for its food, for its lifeline. Its strict containment methods managed to stamp out Sars but in the last 10 years Singapore has become more - not less - integrated into the global economy, and more closely tied to China.

Barclays boss probed over link to sex offender Epstein,"Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has the full confidence of the board, the bank said Barclays boss Jes Staley said he ""deeply regrets"" his connection with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. His comments come after Barclays revealed that UK regulators are investigating the chief executive's links with the disgraced financier. Mr Staley admitted he maintained contact with Epstein, who died in New York prison cell last year, for seven years after his conviction. Barclays said Mr Staley has the ""full confidence"" of the board. ""It has been very well known I had a professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Mr Staley told reporters on Thursday. ""It goes back to 2000 when I was asked to run the JP Morgan private bank and he was already a client when I joined the private bank. ""The relationship was maintained during my time at JP Morgan but as I left JP Morgan the relationship tapered off quite significantly. Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" Epstein died in his prison last August after being charged with sex trafficking underage girls. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. Why Barclays did not fire Staley in December The probe by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority will focus on Mr Staley's ""characterisation to the company of his relationship"" with Epstein. The Financial Conduct Authority oversees bad behaviour in the City, while the Prudential Regulation Authority looks into financial stability. In a statement to the stock market, Barclays said: ""As has been widely reported, earlier in his career Mr Staley developed a professional relationship with Mr Epstein. In the summer of 2019, in light of the renewed media interest in the relationship, Mr Staley volunteered and gave to certain executives, and the chairman, an explanation of his relationship with Mr Epstein."" Barclays added that Mr Staley said he had had no contact with Epstein since joining his current employer in December 2015. The bank added: ""The relationship between Mr Staley and Mr Epstein was the subject of an inquiry from the Financial Conduct Authority, to which the company responded. ""The FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority subsequently commenced an investigation, which is ongoing, into Mr Staley's characterisation to the company of his relationship with Mr Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in the company's response to the FCA."" Separately, in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Mr Staley said that he feels he has been transparent with how he characterised his relationship with Epstein. ""The board has done its own review, and they've looked back at my transparency and they concluded indeed that I have been transparent and open with the bank and with the board all along this process,"" he said. ""But there is a regulatory process that is ongoing, and we'll let that run its course."" The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, saidBarclays conducted an internal inquiry last year, and was satisfied with Mr Staley explanation. Nevertheless, the news will be a fresh blow to Mr Staley, who is trying to rebuild his image after being sanctioned for attempting to unmask the identity of a whistleblower at Barclays. Epstein was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges when he was found dead in his cell on 10 August The bank was fined $15m (Â£11.6m) in the US and Mr Staley was fined Â£642,430 in the UK for breaching rules by attempting to find whoever raised concerns over an executive Mr Staley hired. The bank received two letters in 2016 criticising the decision and raising concerns about the executive's experience. Instead of being handed to the bank's investigations team, one of the letters was distributed among senior managers, including Mr Staley. Barclays also cut his bonus by Â£500,000. In another embarrassing episode in 2017, Mr Staley fell for an email prank when a disgruntled customer pretended to be his boss at the time, former chairman John McFarlane. Mr Staley exchanged several emails with the imposter, who used a Gmail email address, theFinancial Times reported,external. Under his stewardship, the bank's shares have lost about 25% of their value. The shares were down more than 3% in early trading on Thursday as the bank reported that pre-tax profits for the year jumped 25% to Â£4.4bn. Higher revenue and lower costs helped profits advance, the bank said, particularly at its international business. It's hardly surprising that Jes Staley had business links to Jeffrey Epstein - Mr Staley ran the private wealth division of JP Morgan, one of America's biggest banks for several years, looking after the private investments of wealthy Americans. That's exactly the business in which Mr Epstein was a big player, and the New York Times has reported that Mr Staley was one of his key contacts, with several of the deceased financier's big clients being referred to JP Morgan. This morning Barclays said in an announcement to the Stock Exchange that Mr Staley had volunteered information about that relationship to the Barclays board - but that the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Prudential Regulation Authority, Britain's two largest financial watchdogs, were now looking at exactly what he said. The key word in Barclays' statement is that investigation is into how the relationship was ""characterised"" - which infers that the investigators want to work out whether Mr Staley and Barclays gave a completely accurate picture. This does not necessarily mean big trouble for Mr Staley, and the Barclays board has given him a vote of confidence. Regulators, however, take a dim view of bank bosses who don't play ball from the start, and Mr Staley has blotted his copybook before.

Nestle axes low sugar chocolate due to weak sales,"Nestle has axed its range of chocolate that used a new low-sugar technique, less than two years after it was launched. The Swiss food giant said demand for its Milkybar Wowsomes had been ""underwhelming"". The bars used what Nestle described as ""hollow"" sugar crystals to cut the amount of sugar by almost a third. Confectionery makers have come under pressure from health authorities to cut the amount of sugar in their products. Nestle's Milkybar Wowsomes was the first product to use technology developed by the company that creates sugar with a more porous structure, which it likened to hollowing out the sugar crystals. Some industry experts had seen the discovery as a breakthrough that would help Nestle take a leading position in a growing market for low-sugar products. At the time of the launch Stefano Agostini, Nestle's chief executive for UK and Ireland, said: ""A new product like Milkybar Wowsomes introduces greater choice and allows parents to treat their children with chocolate that tastes great but has less sugar. ""We are demonstrating how we can, and will, contribute to a healthier future and that we take our public health responsibilities very seriously,"" he added. Nestle 'restructures' Milkybar to cut sugar Food giant to stop advertising ice cream to kids Child obesity: Will we see radical action? Last year, reduced sugar versions of Mars and Snickers were launched by Mars Wrigley UK, while Mondelez Â­followed suit with low-sugar Cadbury Dairy Milk. Nestle said it is now working on new sugar reduction technology that it aims to introduce next year. The announcement highlights a major issue facing the world's big processed food producers. While governments and many consumers have called for lower-sugar products, most people have yet to warm to less sweet alternatives. Attempts to cut obesity rates have seen processed food giant Unilever this week promise to stop marketing its products to children. The maker of Twister ice cream and Popsicle ice lollies, said it would limit the use of cartoon characters in its advertising.

A rather straightforward cabinet reshuffle turned into a day of surprises in Westminster. We are drawing our live page to a close, but here are some of the highlights from a busy day:  You can check out Boris Johnson's new cabinet in detail here. Thanks for reading and have a good evening. Lord Goldmsith adds to his existing roles in the government In a new run of appointments from No 10, Lord Goldsmith stays on as a minister for the environment and international development, but adds minister for the Foreign Office as another string to his bow. Nigel Adams moves from the culture department to become a joint minister for the Foreign Office and international development. Baroness Sugg will now split her time between her existing role as a joint parliamentary under secretary at international development to take up the same position in the Foreign Office. The announcement from Downing Street also confirms Kit Malthouse will stay as a Home Office minister, and Conor Burns will remain an international trade minister. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Sajid Javid was presented with an offer that, you could say, he had to refuse. Now, whether Downing Street knew or not is another matter. Did they want this all along? It is hard to say. But there is no doubt that trouble had been brewing for quite a while. It was not just about personalities. Yes, there were briefings going back and forth, appearing in the newspapers, some from those in No 11, some from those in No 10, and there was clearly a problem in relations. But obviously this restructuring, this idea you will have a central pool of advisors so that No 10 and 11 work more closely together, that isn't just about the characters. It is about power and where power resides. Of course, there have been tensions between prime ministers and chancellors for a very long time. We have seen it numerous times in the last few decades. But this was of a different level and, in the end, Sajid Javid realised he couldn't carry on in those circumstances. So we now have the meteoric rise of Rishi Sunak, who is taking over as chancellor just four weeks before a Budget. The new chancellor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has echoed the words of his shadow chancellor when commenting on today's government reshuffle. Speaking in Manchester, he said it had been a ""record
collapse of a government"". He added: ""Boris Johnson became prime minister in July. At that
time, as far as I can remember, Philip Hammond was Chancellor of the Exchequer. ""We then had Sajid Javid [and] we've now got the third Chancellor of the Exchequer in
less than six months. ""This is a government in chaos.â Rosena Allin-Khan is running to be deputy leader of the Labour Party One of the candidates for Labour's deputy leadership is calling for the race to be postponed. Rosena Allin-Khan says those running for leader and deputy were supposed to get data on members tomorrow so they could contact them before voting starts. However, the contenders have now been told they won't get the lists until Saturday - despite paying Â£5,000 for them - and they won't include all members. The MP for Tooting says she was told it was possible some people might be given their online ballot before the candidates can get in touch with them, which she calls ""unfair and ridiculous"". She adds: ""Every candidateâs team raised concerns about this today. ""It is my belief that the ballot should be postponed until all the data is processed and each campaign has had a decent amount of time to access it. ""Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There was no hint of what was to come from the lips of Chancellor Sajid Javid. He had been reassured of his future in post, when I spoke to him 48 hours ago. He was planning not just the Budget, but also a Spending Review, and a finance white paper involving negotiations with the EU over the ongoing access of UK finance to the EU. His team had signalled the Budget was going to be a significant new chapter in UK economic policy. The first Budget of this government and its healthy majority, able to plan its own long term strategy. However, there had been a strange series of last minute reorganisations regarding the chancellor's traditional round of interviews on the GDP figures. Read more from our economics editor here. There have been lots of ins and outs in today's reshuffle. But who are the new, and returning, faces of Boris Johnson's top team? Take a look at our guide to who's who in the cabinet here. Robin Walker has been promoted to become a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, having served as a parliamentary under secretary.

James Brokenshire comes back into government as a Home Office minister Another raft of reshuffle appointments have come through from No 10. James Brokenshire returns to government after being ousted as housing secretary last summer, to serve as a minister in the Home Office. Chloe Smith gets a promotion from a parliamentary secretary in the Cabinet Office to a full blown minister. Jeremy Quin moves from the Cabinet Office to become a minister in Defence, while Helen Whately moves from the cutlure department to become a health minister. Robin Walker stays in the Northern Ireland Office, but has been promoted from parliamentary under secretary to minister. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor It is no secret that there have been - as there so often are in government - tensions between those powerful next door neighbours in Downing Street. There was some bad blood between No 10 and No 11 over briefings, and the expectation management of the day-to-day politics between the two sides has not always gone smoothly in recent weeks. But when the day of this reshuffle began - always an important moment in any government - few would have expected or predicted it would have turned out quite like it did. And as with any reshuffle, when moving the furniture of government around, it is sometimes wise to expect the unexpected. In case you struggle to read the small print, here is the letter in full: Dear prime minister, It has been a privilege to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since being elected as the MP for Bromsgrove 10 years ago, I have had the huge honour of holding several ministerial roles - running five departments, including two of the great offices of state. While I am grateful for your continued trust and offer to continue this role, I regret that I could not accept the conditions attached to the reappointment. It is crucial for the effectiveness of the government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice, as I have always sought to do. I also believe that it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with. The government you lead has an enormous opportunity in the coming years to transform our country. Millions of people have given their renewed trust in a Conservative government to move on from the divisions and distractions of recent years, and lead us forward into a decade of social and economic renewal. We must not waste a moment in delivering on that promise. As you know, the agenda we have been developing over the last seven months is one that I have long supported. From maintaining strong public finances, investing in infrastructure, protecting our environment, recruiting 20,000 police officers, and boosting housing and skills so the next generation can have the opportunities they deserve. I would urge you to ensure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible. The team there has impressed me with the energy and intellect they have brought to delivering the shifts in policy that I have led. They are among the very best public servants we have and I hope they can continue to play a central role in driving an economic agenda that puts people and place at its heart. My biggest hope is that this government will bring the country together, and help to level the playing field so that stories like mine are not exceptional or lucky. While it is of course disappointing that I will no longer be in the position to see this vision through as one of your cabinet ministers, I am very optimistic about our country's future. You and the government you lead will continue to have my full support from the backbenches. I am very much looking forward to spending more time with my family, and to continuing to serve the people of Bromsgrove. Yours ever, Sajid Javid BBC political correspondent tweets...

Penny Mordaunt makes a return to government A string of new appointments for more junior roles has just been announced by Downing Street. Former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt has made a return to government, becoming the Paymaster General in the Cabinet Office. She was sacked by Boris Johnson when he took over in July 2019, after just three months at defence. Former party chairman James Cleverly has also been shifted into a new role as a minister for both the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. Christopher Pincher has taken over as a minister in the housing, communities and local government department. And Andrew Stephenson has been appointed transport minister for the government. David Cameron's former deputy chief of staff says she does not believe No 10 knew Sajid Javid would resign when they told him their plans this morning. Speaking to BBC News, Baroness Fall says reshuffle days are ""all about a fresh face for government"" but the chancellor stepping down is ""now the central story"". She says: ""I find it strange this wasn't ironed out in the couple of days before and the choice wasn't made then as it has blown up a day that should be about the new cabinet."" Baroness Fall does say there was a ""possibility"" that Rishi Sunak was not promoted in the rest of the reshuffle ""just in case something went wrong"". But she does not follow others in Westminster in blaming the PM's chief adviser. ""Dominic Cummings works for Boris Johnson,"" she says. ""He is the prime minister, he calls the shots.""

Thanks for reading and have a good evening. Lord Goldmsith adds to his existing roles in the government In a new run of appointments from No 10, Lord Goldsmith stays on as a minister for the environment and international development, but adds minister for the Foreign Office as another string to his bow. Nigel Adams moves from the culture department to become a joint minister for the Foreign Office and international development. Baroness Sugg will now split her time between her existing role as a joint parliamentary under secretary at international development to take up the same position in the Foreign Office. The announcement from Downing Street also confirms Kit Malthouse will stay as a Home Office minister, and Conor Burns will remain an international trade minister. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Sajid Javid was presented with an offer that, you could say, he had to refuse. Now, whether Downing Street knew or not is another matter. Did they want this all along? It is hard to say. But there is no doubt that trouble had been brewing for quite a while. It was not just about personalities. Yes, there were briefings going back and forth, appearing in the newspapers, some from those in No 11, some from those in No 10, and there was clearly a problem in relations. But obviously this restructuring, this idea you will have a central pool of advisors so that No 10 and 11 work more closely together, that isn't just about the characters. It is about power and where power resides. Of course, there have been tensions between prime ministers and chancellors for a very long time. We have seen it numerous times in the last few decades. But this was of a different level and, in the end, Sajid Javid realised he couldn't carry on in those circumstances. So we now have the meteoric rise of Rishi Sunak, who is taking over as chancellor just four weeks before a Budget. The new chancellor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has echoed the words of his shadow chancellor when commenting on today's government reshuffle. Speaking in Manchester, he said it had been a ""record
collapse of a government"". He added: ""Boris Johnson became prime minister in July. At that
time, as far as I can remember, Philip Hammond was Chancellor of the Exchequer. ""We then had Sajid Javid [and] we've now got the third Chancellor of the Exchequer in

""This is a government in chaos.â Rosena Allin-Khan is running to be deputy leader of the Labour Party One of the candidates for Labour's deputy leadership is calling for the race to be postponed. Rosena Allin-Khan says those running for leader and deputy were supposed to get data on members tomorrow so they could contact them before voting starts. However, the contenders have now been told they won't get the lists until Saturday - despite paying Â£5,000 for them - and they won't include all members. The MP for Tooting says she was told it was possible some people might be given their online ballot before the candidates can get in touch with them, which she calls ""unfair and ridiculous"". She adds: ""Every candidateâs team raised concerns about this today. ""It is my belief that the ballot should be postponed until all the data is processed and each campaign has had a decent amount of time to access it. ""Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There was no hint of what was to come from the lips of Chancellor Sajid Javid. He had been reassured of his future in post, when I spoke to him 48 hours ago. He was planning not just the Budget, but also a Spending Review, and a finance white paper involving negotiations with the EU over the ongoing access of UK finance to the EU. His team had signalled the Budget was going to be a significant new chapter in UK economic policy. The first Budget of this government and its healthy majority, able to plan its own long term strategy. However, there had been a strange series of last minute reorganisations regarding the chancellor's traditional round of interviews on the GDP figures. Read more from our economics editor here.

According to theMPs' register of interests,,externalthe accommodation - has a ""value"" of Â£15,000 - and was covered by David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse. A spokesman for Mr Ross said the register ""is correct"" and he ""facilitated accommodation"" for the PM. Downing Street said the trip had been properly registered. The register also shows earnings Mr Johnson received last year before becoming PM, including more than Â£327,000 for seven speaking engagements, one of which was a three-hour speech where he was paid Â£122,899.74. The prime minister took the holiday to St Vincent and the Grenadines with girlfriend Carrie Symonds between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. Labour's shadow minister for the cabinet office, Jon Trickett, said Mr Johnson ""must come clean"" about the holiday accommodation, adding that if he does not, Parliament's standards watchdog ""should step in"". ""The public deserves to know who is paying for their prime minister's jaunts,"" Mr Trickett added. The entry in Mr Johnson's register of interests says Mr Ross donated accommodation ""for a private holiday for my partner and me, value Â£15,000"". But a spokesman for Mr Rosstold the Daily Mail:,external""Boris wanted some help to find somewhere in Mustique, David called the company who run all the villas and somebody had dropped out. ""So Boris got the use of a villa that was worth Â£15,000, but David Ross did not pay any monies whatsoever for this."" A later statement from the spokesman added: ""Mr Ross facilitated accommodation for Mr Johnson on Mustique valued at Â£15,000. ""Therefore this is a benefit in kind from Mr Ross to Mr Johnson, and Mr Johnson's declaration to the House of Commons is correct."" Mr Ross has not provided any further details as to what he means, in this context, by a 'benefit in kind.' But sources in Westminster have suggested to me that this could refer to some sort of swap whereby David Ross agreed to give up his property - at a later date - in order to facilitate the prime minister's stay elsewhere on the island. And that there was no kind of cash donation. David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, at a photography exhibition in 2011 Mr Ross was one of Mr Johnson's aides in City Hall and was appointed to the Olympics organising committee. But he resigned from the roles, and his company, over a share scandal in 2008. It emerged Mr Ross had used millions of pounds' worth of Carphone Warehouse shares as collateral against personal loans without informing the company's other directors - a potential breach of City rules at the time. Mr Ross has been a long-standing donor to the Conservative Party, pledging Â£250,000 in the last election campaign. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""All transparency requirements have been followed, as set out in the Register of Members' Financial Interests"". Brexit will mark 'new chapter' for UK, says PM Conservatives ahead in race for donations Carphone's Ross quits Olympic role,external Mr Johnson faced criticism over his holiday for not returning sooner,after the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimaniraised tensions in the Middle East. It is the first trip abroad that Mr Johnson has declared since going to Saudi Arabia in September 2018. Only one other MP has declared a free holiday in the last year. Mr Johnson also declared payments he had received prior to becoming prime minister, including book royalties and hundreds of thousands of pounds for speaking engagements. In the first six months of 2019, Mr Johnson earned more than Â£327,000 for the seven speaking engagements, which lasted a total of 17.5 hours. He was also paid Â£22,916.66 a month for his column in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which was published weekly.

The 'floating Petri dishes',"This video can not be played David Abel, one of 3,700 people in quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess, speaking soon after the quarantine began The largest coronavirus outbreak outside mainland China is not in a country, but on a cruise ship. It's been more than a week since the Diamond Princess went into lockdown, after a previous passenger tested positive for the virus after disembarking. With almost 500 out of 3,700 people on board tested, 174 people have now tested positive for coronavirus. Those still on board are in quarantine for another week. But it's not just the Diamond Princess. Dozens more catch virus on quarantined cruise ship On another cruise ship in Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers people were quarantined because of fears that people on board might have the virus. They were only allowed to disembark after tests came back negative. And a cruise ship carrying more than 1,450 passengers, which left Hong Kong on 1 February, was turned away from ports in Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, despite having no infections on board. It has now been told it can dock in Cambodia. Cruise ships have for years been referred to as ""floating Petri dishes"" - places ripe for the exchange of germs, and the spreading of illness. But is the accusation true? A passenger peers out from the Diamond Princess. The company is providing extra TV, films, games, and newspapers for quarantined passengers, plus room service food There is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on ships, says Prof Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases specialist at the Australian National University. ""In general, you've got passengers and crew members from different parts of the world mixing intimately and intensely for a short period of time,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""They've all got varying levels of immunity and so that does set things up for an infection outbreak."" With coronavirus, which is believed to spread through droplets - such as from mucus or saliva - people could be infected without direct contact with a carrier. ""Say if someone sneezed on to a table, and then someone else immediately touches that table, that could lead to infection,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""People might not all be talking to each other - but they are in shared spaces like swimming pools, spas, dining rooms and auditoriums."" However, Stewart Chiron, a cruise expert, says ""the reality onboard a cruise is very different to the perception of it"". ""So for example, people think that when you're queuing up at buffet lines that there's a lot of interaction and contact between passengers,"" says Mr Chiron, who has been on board more than 250 cruise ships. ""For the major cruise lines, that's not true. There are stations - if you want eggs you go to the egg station, a gloved crew member will do that for you. ""The point is that you're rarely waiting in a line, and not everyone passes by every piece of food - what that does is minimise the interaction between people."" This video can not be played Sea urchins and Swiss rolls: Quarantine around the world If passenger interaction is minimised, crew interaction is another story. On the Diamond Princess, at least 10 crew members are among the infected. According to the New York Times, more than 1,000 crew members ""live and work elbow-to-elbow"". ""It's likely crew members will be in very close contact with each other, perhaps even sharing facilities,"" says Dr Senanayake. ""People will disembark the ship but the crew members often may not change. So if there is ongoing transmission from the crew, when the next set of passengers come on that may continue."" According to Mr Chiron, cruises have extremely stringent cleaning and screening processes. ""Cruises are always taking thorough readings of passengers. If you look ill then you are subject to a secondary medical screening."" Probably the disease most associated with cruise ships is norovirus, a vomiting illness caught via contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. ""Cruises have various protocols that are enabled when a norovirus case is reported,"" says Mr Chiron. ""There's extensive scrubbing that goes on, all the surfaces are continuously cleaned. During the buffets there will be no food like bread baskets. The crew are specially trained for this."" Infected passengers are taken off the ship to be treated in hospitals He adds that things have become more stringent since the outbreak of the coronavirus. ""You can tell now they're much more observant of passengers' appearances. If you look at how well ships are cleaned and maintained - they are extremely thorough."" According to Dr Senanayake, there is an official Vessel Sanitation Program at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that advises ships on how to prevent and control the spread of illnesses. ""I believe cruise ships now have got a lot of disinfection stations, and are also advising patients or crew members who are sick not to come on board,"" he says. ""There is that risk of going on a cruise ship but everything in life comes with risks. [People just have to] practice simple [precautionary] measures."" China and the virus that threatens everything Singapore bank evacuated over coronavirus case For the Diamond Princess, Dr Senanayake says the ship is employing ""good isolation measures"" by keeping people in their rooms (passengers are allowed onto the outdoor decks at certain times). However, he adds: ""[The ship] needs to make sure people understand why this is happening and understand their concerns. ""You've gone from having the time of your life to being isolated in your room feeling very scared. The quarantine should always be done in a very humane and compassionate way."" The cruise industry will definitely take a ""financial hit"" - but these cases aren't going to stop people from taking cruises, says Mr Chiron. ""The damage they're going to take specifically is from the cruises around China and South East Asia. The lines themselves are cancelling routes. ""Cruise Norwegian, for example, are cancelling all their Asia sailings. They are going to have to issue refunds, credits - we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. ""But when you look at the rest of the world, Europe, Alaska, the US - people are still travelling. Royal Caribbean revealed that just 1.5% of enquiries they received were about people asking the virus. ""People are concerned, yes, but they are still travelling. Elsewhere in the world the ships are full and they are going to continue to be full."" SHOULD WE WORRY?Our health correspondent explains YOUR QUESTIONS:Can you get it more than once?

Domestic abuse 'affects everybody' - Camilla,"The Duchess of Cornwall has said domestic abuse ""affects everybody"" and urged people to ""get up and talk about their experiences"". ""No one knows what goes on behind any front door. It doesn't matter who you are,""she told the Daily Mail,external. The interview comes after she hosted an event for the charity SafeLives at Clarence House in London on Wednesday. The duchess told guests the ""taboo"" around domestic abuse ""weakens"" every time somebody shares their story. She said she had had nightmares after hearing women's accounts of abuse at a SafeLives event in 2016. ""I had the privilege of hearing incredibly brave women... standing up to tell their stories. Harrowing stories that reduced many of us listeners to tears,"" Camilla said in a speech to guests at Clarence House. ""That memorable day fired my interest in domestic abuse. I did know of people who had suffered from it, but I was both shocked and horrified by just how many thousands of people across the world live with it."" Since then the duchess, 72, said she has been championing the issue by hosting events to bring together various organisations. Last year she wrote a letter of support for asurvivor-led conference on domestic violence,externalin Wales. The duchess held a reception in Clarence House to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the charity, SafeLives In the Daily Mail interview, Camilla described the 2016 event as one of her ""most harrowing experiences"". ""I thought to myself, this is going on, what are we doing about it?,"" she said. ""You know people, I know people that it has happened to. But I don't think we ever believed it was that bad."" ""Whoever you are, wherever you are from, there are organisations that can help you,"" she added. ""Talk to them, just get up and talk about your experiences. They will help."" The duchess began speaking out against domestic abuse after hearing survivors' stories at a SafeLives event in 2016 (pictured) SafeLives provides various services for people affected by domestic abuse as well as working with other organisation to tackle the issue. Office of National Statistics figures for 2018 suggest 4.2% of men and 7.9% of women suffered domestic abuse, which equates to about 685,000 men and 1.3 million women. Murders related to domestic violence are at a five-year high, with an average of two women murdered every week. If you or someone you know has been affected by domestic abuse or violence,these organisationsmay be able to help.

"Plug pulled on 5,000 post-GCSE qualificationsMany courses with few or no students will be scrapped as ministers prepare for T-levels in England.Family & Education","A qualification in dry-stone walling was on the hit list More than 5,000 qualifications in England studied by few or, in some cases, no students are being scrapped. The Department for Education is pulling funding from about 40% of the 12,000 post-16 qualifications as it prepares to introduce new T-levels in September. T-levels are post-GCSE courses, equivalent to three A-levels, developed in collaboration with businesses. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said finding the right course was like looking for a needle in a haystack. He added: ""Removing funding for qualifications that have no or low numbers of enrolments will help make sure students have a clearer choice of the qualifications on offer, and ensure they get the skills they need to progress."" The move is the latest step in the government's wider review of post-16 qualifications at Level 3 - A-level standard - and below. What are T-levels and who is going to study them? But the head of the well respected qualification provider City and Guilds said the move would be ""disastrous for social mobility"". The qualifications purge will move closer to a system where teenagers choose at age 16 from one of three routes - A-levels, apprenticeships or T-levels. But Tom Bewick, the head of the trade association for examining bodies the Federation of Awarding Bodies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are 50,000 degree courses in this country, and you haven't had a vice-chancellor sitting here in front of you having to explain why there is so many."" He questioned whether Whitehall officials were the people best placed, to make ""really important life chance decisions about qualifications"". ""This is clearly a very top down review... vocational technical qualifications have been a great idea but they're for other people's children - and they certainly aren't for the people that are in the senior levels within the Department for Education."" T-levels will offer students a mixture of classroom learning and ""on-the-job"" experience during an industry placement. The first three will be available in some qualifications from September, but only 2,000 places will be on offer initially. The qualifications - in subjects such as accountancy, catering, finance, hair and beauty and manufacturing - have been developed in collaboration with employers and businesses to meet the needs of industry and prepare students for work. Candidates will be awarded one of four overall grades after their two years of study, ranging from distinction* to a pass. They will also get a nationally recognised certificate which will show their overall grade and a breakdown of what they have achieved across the T-level programme. The aim of Thursday's announcement was to ensure all qualifications on offer were high-quality, necessary, and supported students to progress into employment or further study, the DfE said. The kind of qualifications being scrapped are certificates for specific businesses or jobs, such as dry-stone walling, nail art and warehouse management, but they also include entry-level qualifications and one designed to boost the confidence of pupils who struggle with learning. T-levels will include qualifications in hairdressing Some qualifications aimed at pupils with learning and physical disabilities are being axed, too. The move is also intended to ensure funding goes towards more popular qualifications that help students learn skills they need to go on to have successful careers. The government is seeking views on whether any of the 5,000 qualifications on the list should continue to attract public funding Mr Bewick said not everyone would feel one of the three routes was suitable for them. He said: ""Clearly where there are qualifications where they are no longer in demand, they will discontinue."" But he gave the example of one of the qualifications which could be at risk - Level 3 in aromatherapy, used by the Royal National College for the Blind. ""It's actually a qualification that helps learners who have visual impairment gain access employment in the therapeutic and spa industries,"" he said. ""It enrols very few numbers but nevertheless that's an example of a very niche qualification that helps people into the labour market."" He said: ""We have got young people, who are leaving school who are turned off by classroom learning. They need opportunities for learning by doing, to get practical vocational qualifications."" City and Guilds chief executive Kirstie Donnelly said many students were simply not ready to make the jump from GCSEs to T-levels. The introduction of T-levels is the biggest shake-up in vocational education in a generation. They will be tough and are meant to help more people to attain the higher-level skills businesses say they need. Each year, about 70,000 teenagers in England do not pass a single GCSE at Grade 4 or above. A further 136,000 do not get a single GCSE at the strong pass, Grade 5. For those expected to then go on to study T-levels, a transition year will try to help them prepare - but not all will be able to make the leap. And some of the qualifications being scrapped were aimed at these very teenagers, who may be disengaged and lacking in basic employability skills. ""Removing that vital rung on the skills ladder towards Level 3 and above will be disastrous for social mobility and leave more and more people stranded with no route into work,"" she said. ""We urge the government to think carefully before removing this lifeline for people and leaving employers unable to access the skilled workforces they need.""

A rather straightforward cabinet reshuffle turned into a day of surprises in Westminster. We are drawing our live page to a close, but here are some of the highlights from a busy day:  You can check out Boris Johnson's new cabinet in detail here. Thanks for reading and have a good evening. Lord Goldmsith adds to his existing roles in the government In a new run of appointments from No 10, Lord Goldsmith stays on as a minister for the environment and international development, but adds minister for the Foreign Office as another string to his bow. Nigel Adams moves from the culture department to become a joint minister for the Foreign Office and international development. Baroness Sugg will now split her time between her existing role as a joint parliamentary under secretary at international development to take up the same position in the Foreign Office. The announcement from Downing Street also confirms Kit Malthouse will stay as a Home Office minister, and Conor Burns will remain an international trade minister. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Sajid Javid was presented with an offer that, you could say, he had to refuse. Now, whether Downing Street knew or not is another matter. Did they want this all along? It is hard to say. But there is no doubt that trouble had been brewing for quite a while. It was not just about personalities. Yes, there were briefings going back and forth, appearing in the newspapers, some from those in No 11, some from those in No 10, and there was clearly a problem in relations. But obviously this restructuring, this idea you will have a central pool of advisors so that No 10 and 11 work more closely together, that isn't just about the characters. It is about power and where power resides. Of course, there have been tensions between prime ministers and chancellors for a very long time. We have seen it numerous times in the last few decades. But this was of a different level and, in the end, Sajid Javid realised he couldn't carry on in those circumstances. So we now have the meteoric rise of Rishi Sunak, who is taking over as chancellor just four weeks before a Budget. The new chancellor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has echoed the words of his shadow chancellor when commenting on today's government reshuffle. Speaking in Manchester, he said it had been a ""record
collapse of a government"". He added: ""Boris Johnson became prime minister in July. At that
time, as far as I can remember, Philip Hammond was Chancellor of the Exchequer. ""We then had Sajid Javid [and] we've now got the third Chancellor of the Exchequer in
less than six months. ""This is a government in chaos.â Rosena Allin-Khan is running to be deputy leader of the Labour Party One of the candidates for Labour's deputy leadership is calling for the race to be postponed. Rosena Allin-Khan says those running for leader and deputy were supposed to get data on members tomorrow so they could contact them before voting starts. However, the contenders have now been told they won't get the lists until Saturday - despite paying Â£5,000 for them - and they won't include all members. The MP for Tooting says she was told it was possible some people might be given their online ballot before the candidates can get in touch with them, which she calls ""unfair and ridiculous"". She adds: ""Every candidateâs team raised concerns about this today. ""It is my belief that the ballot should be postponed until all the data is processed and each campaign has had a decent amount of time to access it. ""Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There was no hint of what was to come from the lips of Chancellor Sajid Javid. He had been reassured of his future in post, when I spoke to him 48 hours ago. He was planning not just the Budget, but also a Spending Review, and a finance white paper involving negotiations with the EU over the ongoing access of UK finance to the EU. His team had signalled the Budget was going to be a significant new chapter in UK economic policy. The first Budget of this government and its healthy majority, able to plan its own long term strategy. However, there had been a strange series of last minute reorganisations regarding the chancellor's traditional round of interviews on the GDP figures. Read more from our economics editor here. There have been lots of ins and outs in today's reshuffle. But who are the new, and returning, faces of Boris Johnson's top team? Take a look at our guide to who's who in the cabinet here. Robin Walker has been promoted to become a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, having served as a parliamentary under secretary. But in a tweet celebrating his new role, he also praises former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, who was sacked earlier today and replaced with Brandon Lewis. Allow Twitter content?

James Brokenshire comes back into government as a Home Office minister Another raft of reshuffle appointments have come through from No 10. James Brokenshire returns to government after being ousted as housing secretary last summer, to serve as a minister in the Home Office. Chloe Smith gets a promotion from a parliamentary secretary in the Cabinet Office to a full blown minister. Jeremy Quin moves from the Cabinet Office to become a minister in Defence, while Helen Whately moves from the cutlure department to become a health minister. Robin Walker stays in the Northern Ireland Office, but has been promoted from parliamentary under secretary to minister. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor It is no secret that there have been - as there so often are in government - tensions between those powerful next door neighbours in Downing Street. There was some bad blood between No 10 and No 11 over briefings, and the expectation management of the day-to-day politics between the two sides has not always gone smoothly in recent weeks. But when the day of this reshuffle began - always an important moment in any government - few would have expected or predicted it would have turned out quite like it did. And as with any reshuffle, when moving the furniture of government around, it is sometimes wise to expect the unexpected. In case you struggle to read the small print, here is the letter in full: Dear prime minister, It has been a privilege to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since being elected as the MP for Bromsgrove 10 years ago, I have had the huge honour of holding several ministerial roles - running five departments, including two of the great offices of state. While I am grateful for your continued trust and offer to continue this role, I regret that I could not accept the conditions attached to the reappointment. It is crucial for the effectiveness of the government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice, as I have always sought to do. I also believe that it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with. The government you lead has an enormous opportunity in the coming years to transform our country. Millions of people have given their renewed trust in a Conservative government to move on from the divisions and distractions of recent years, and lead us forward into a decade of social and economic renewal. We must not waste a moment in delivering on that promise. As you know, the agenda we have been developing over the last seven months is one that I have long supported. From maintaining strong public finances, investing in infrastructure, protecting our environment, recruiting 20,000 police officers, and boosting housing and skills so the next generation can have the opportunities they deserve. I would urge you to ensure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible. The team there has impressed me with the energy and intellect they have brought to delivering the shifts in policy that I have led. They are among the very best public servants we have and I hope they can continue to play a central role in driving an economic agenda that puts people and place at its heart. My biggest hope is that this government will bring the country together, and help to level the playing field so that stories like mine are not exceptional or lucky. While it is of course disappointing that I will no longer be in the position to see this vision through as one of your cabinet ministers, I am very optimistic about our country's future. You and the government you lead will continue to have my full support from the backbenches. I am very much looking forward to spending more time with my family, and to continuing to serve the people of Bromsgrove. Yours ever, Sajid Javid BBC political correspondent tweets...

Penny Mordaunt makes a return to government A string of new appointments for more junior roles has just been announced by Downing Street. Former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt has made a return to government, becoming the Paymaster General in the Cabinet Office. She was sacked by Boris Johnson when he took over in July 2019, after just three months at defence. Former party chairman James Cleverly has also been shifted into a new role as a minister for both the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. Christopher Pincher has taken over as a minister in the housing, communities and local government department. And Andrew Stephenson has been appointed transport minister for the government. David Cameron's former deputy chief of staff says she does not believe No 10 knew Sajid Javid would resign when they told him their plans this morning. Speaking to BBC News, Baroness Fall says reshuffle days are ""all about a fresh face for government"" but the chancellor stepping down is ""now the central story"". She says: ""I find it strange this wasn't ironed out in the couple of days before and the choice wasn't made then as it has blown up a day that should be about the new cabinet."" Baroness Fall does say there was a ""possibility"" that Rishi Sunak was not promoted in the rest of the reshuffle ""just in case something went wrong"". But she does not follow others in Westminster in blaming the PM's chief adviser. ""Dominic Cummings works for Boris Johnson,"" she says. ""He is the prime minister, he calls the shots.""

Our correspondent, Nick Eardley, has been in a briefing with No 10 after all of today's twists and turns. The spokesman thanked Sajid Javid for his work as chancellor, and said his successor, Rishi Sunak, will carry on with the preparations for the Budget. However, he would not confirm if it will still go ahead as planned on 11 March, saying: ""Preparations have been carried out already and will continue
at a pace."" The PM's spokesman also confirmed reports that the two separate teams of special advisers at No 10 and the Treasury will merge into one to jointly advise the new chancellor and the prime minister. The new unit will ultimately be accountable to the PM.

"Domestic abuse 'affects everybody' - CamillaThe Duchess of Cornwall says the ""taboo"" of domestic abuse ""weakens"" each time a victim speaks out.UK","The Duchess of Cornwall has said domestic abuse ""affects everybody"" and urged people to ""get up and talk about their experiences"". ""No one knows what goes on behind any front door. It doesn't matter who you are,""she told the Daily Mail,external. The interview comes after she hosted an event for the charity SafeLives at Clarence House in London on Wednesday. The duchess told guests the ""taboo"" around domestic abuse ""weakens"" every time somebody shares their story. She said she had had nightmares after hearing women's accounts of abuse at a SafeLives event in 2016. ""I had the privilege of hearing incredibly brave women... standing up to tell their stories. Harrowing stories that reduced many of us listeners to tears,"" Camilla said in a speech to guests at Clarence House. ""That memorable day fired my interest in domestic abuse. I did know of people who had suffered from it, but I was both shocked and horrified by just how many thousands of people across the world live with it."" Since then the duchess, 72, said she has been championing the issue by hosting events to bring together various organisations. Last year she wrote a letter of support for asurvivor-led conference on domestic violence,externalin Wales. The duchess held a reception in Clarence House to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the charity, SafeLives In the Daily Mail interview, Camilla described the 2016 event as one of her ""most harrowing experiences"". ""I thought to myself, this is going on, what are we doing about it?,"" she said. ""You know people, I know people that it has happened to. But I don't think we ever believed it was that bad."" ""Whoever you are, wherever you are from, there are organisations that can help you,"" she added. ""Talk to them, just get up and talk about your experiences. They will help."" The duchess began speaking out against domestic abuse after hearing survivors' stories at a SafeLives event in 2016 (pictured) SafeLives provides various services for people affected by domestic abuse as well as working with other organisation to tackle the issue. Office of National Statistics figures for 2018 suggest 4.2% of men and 7.9% of women suffered domestic abuse, which equates to about 685,000 men and 1.3 million women. Murders related to domestic violence are at a five-year high, with an average of two women murdered every week. If you or someone you know has been affected by domestic abuse or violence,these organisationsmay be able to help.

A rather straightforward cabinet reshuffle turned into a day of surprises in Westminster. We are drawing our live page to a close, but here are some of the highlights from a busy day:  You can check out Boris Johnson's new cabinet in detail here. Thanks for reading and have a good evening. Lord Goldmsith adds to his existing roles in the government In a new run of appointments from No 10, Lord Goldsmith stays on as a minister for the environment and international development, but adds minister for the Foreign Office as another string to his bow. Nigel Adams moves from the culture department to become a joint minister for the Foreign Office and international development. Baroness Sugg will now split her time between her existing role as a joint parliamentary under secretary at international development to take up the same position in the Foreign Office. The announcement from Downing Street also confirms Kit Malthouse will stay as a Home Office minister, and Conor Burns will remain an international trade minister. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Sajid Javid was presented with an offer that, you could say, he had to refuse. Now, whether Downing Street knew or not is another matter. Did they want this all along? It is hard to say. But there is no doubt that trouble had been brewing for quite a while. It was not just about personalities. Yes, there were briefings going back and forth, appearing in the newspapers, some from those in No 11, some from those in No 10, and there was clearly a problem in relations. But obviously this restructuring, this idea you will have a central pool of advisors so that No 10 and 11 work more closely together, that isn't just about the characters. It is about power and where power resides. Of course, there have been tensions between prime ministers and chancellors for a very long time. We have seen it numerous times in the last few decades. But this was of a different level and, in the end, Sajid Javid realised he couldn't carry on in those circumstances. So we now have the meteoric rise of Rishi Sunak, who is taking over as chancellor just four weeks before a Budget. The new chancellor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has echoed the words of his shadow chancellor when commenting on today's government reshuffle. Speaking in Manchester, he said it had been a ""record
collapse of a government"". He added: ""Boris Johnson became prime minister in July. At that
time, as far as I can remember, Philip Hammond was Chancellor of the Exchequer. ""We then had Sajid Javid [and] we've now got the third Chancellor of the Exchequer in
less than six months. ""This is a government in chaos.â Rosena Allin-Khan is running to be deputy leader of the Labour Party One of the candidates for Labour's deputy leadership is calling for the race to be postponed. Rosena Allin-Khan says those running for leader and deputy were supposed to get data on members tomorrow so they could contact them before voting starts. However, the contenders have now been told they won't get the lists until Saturday - despite paying Â£5,000 for them - and they won't include all members. The MP for Tooting says she was told it was possible some people might be given their online ballot before the candidates can get in touch with them, which she calls ""unfair and ridiculous"". She adds: ""Every candidateâs team raised concerns about this today. ""It is my belief that the ballot should be postponed until all the data is processed and each campaign has had a decent amount of time to access it. ""Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage."" Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There was no hint of what was to come from the lips of Chancellor Sajid Javid. He had been reassured of his future in post, when I spoke to him 48 hours ago. He was planning not just the Budget, but also a Spending Review, and a finance white paper involving negotiations with the EU over the ongoing access of UK finance to the EU. His team had signalled the Budget was going to be a significant new chapter in UK economic policy. The first Budget of this government and its healthy majority, able to plan its own long term strategy. However, there had been a strange series of last minute reorganisations regarding the chancellor's traditional round of interviews on the GDP figures. Read more from our economics editor here. There have been lots of ins and outs in today's reshuffle. But who are the new, and returning, faces of Boris Johnson's top team? Take a look at our guide to who's who in the cabinet here. Robin Walker has been promoted to become a minister in the Northern Ireland Office, having served as a parliamentary under secretary. But in a tweet celebrating his new role, he also praises former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, who was sacked earlier today and replaced with Brandon Lewis. Allow Twitter content?

James Brokenshire comes back into government as a Home Office minister Another raft of reshuffle appointments have come through from No 10. James Brokenshire returns to government after being ousted as housing secretary last summer, to serve as a minister in the Home Office. Chloe Smith gets a promotion from a parliamentary secretary in the Cabinet Office to a full blown minister. Jeremy Quin moves from the Cabinet Office to become a minister in Defence, while Helen Whately moves from the cutlure department to become a health minister. Robin Walker stays in the Northern Ireland Office, but has been promoted from parliamentary under secretary to minister. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor It is no secret that there have been - as there so often are in government - tensions between those powerful next door neighbours in Downing Street. There was some bad blood between No 10 and No 11 over briefings, and the expectation management of the day-to-day politics between the two sides has not always gone smoothly in recent weeks. But when the day of this reshuffle began - always an important moment in any government - few would have expected or predicted it would have turned out quite like it did. And as with any reshuffle, when moving the furniture of government around, it is sometimes wise to expect the unexpected. In case you struggle to read the small print, here is the letter in full: Dear prime minister, It has been a privilege to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since being elected as the MP for Bromsgrove 10 years ago, I have had the huge honour of holding several ministerial roles - running five departments, including two of the great offices of state. While I am grateful for your continued trust and offer to continue this role, I regret that I could not accept the conditions attached to the reappointment. It is crucial for the effectiveness of the government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice, as I have always sought to do. I also believe that it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with. The government you lead has an enormous opportunity in the coming years to transform our country. Millions of people have given their renewed trust in a Conservative government to move on from the divisions and distractions of recent years, and lead us forward into a decade of social and economic renewal. We must not waste a moment in delivering on that promise. As you know, the agenda we have been developing over the last seven months is one that I have long supported. From maintaining strong public finances, investing in infrastructure, protecting our environment, recruiting 20,000 police officers, and boosting housing and skills so the next generation can have the opportunities they deserve. I would urge you to ensure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible. The team there has impressed me with the energy and intellect they have brought to delivering the shifts in policy that I have led. They are among the very best public servants we have and I hope they can continue to play a central role in driving an economic agenda that puts people and place at its heart. My biggest hope is that this government will bring the country together, and help to level the playing field so that stories like mine are not exceptional or lucky. While it is of course disappointing that I will no longer be in the position to see this vision through as one of your cabinet ministers, I am very optimistic about our country's future. You and the government you lead will continue to have my full support from the backbenches. I am very much looking forward to spending more time with my family, and to continuing to serve the people of Bromsgrove. Yours ever, Sajid Javid BBC political correspondent tweets...

Penny Mordaunt makes a return to government A string of new appointments for more junior roles has just been announced by Downing Street. Former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt has made a return to government, becoming the Paymaster General in the Cabinet Office. She was sacked by Boris Johnson when he took over in July 2019, after just three months at defence. Former party chairman James Cleverly has also been shifted into a new role as a minister for both the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. Christopher Pincher has taken over as a minister in the housing, communities and local government department. And Andrew Stephenson has been appointed transport minister for the government. David Cameron's former deputy chief of staff says she does not believe No 10 knew Sajid Javid would resign when they told him their plans this morning. Speaking to BBC News, Baroness Fall says reshuffle days are ""all about a fresh face for government"" but the chancellor stepping down is ""now the central story"". She says: ""I find it strange this wasn't ironed out in the couple of days before and the choice wasn't made then as it has blown up a day that should be about the new cabinet."" Baroness Fall does say there was a ""possibility"" that Rishi Sunak was not promoted in the rest of the reshuffle ""just in case something went wrong"". But she does not follow others in Westminster in blaming the PM's chief adviser. ""Dominic Cummings works for Boris Johnson,"" she says. ""He is the prime minister, he calls the shots.""

"Help us or you'll kill the High Street, warn jewellers","Andrew Hinds fears for the future of smaller town centres if there is no change For one national chain of jewellers, the government's business rates system is having a devastating effect on retail outside big cities and shopping malls. Andrew Hinds, a director at family-run firm F Hinds, says business rates place an unfair burden on shops and are leading to more store closures. ""In a smaller town, if you lose a few retailers, you lose critical mass and there's less reason for people to go into town,"" he told the BBC. ""We have stores in various different locations - cities, towns, out-of-town shopping centres. But we fear for the future of smaller towns in more rural locations. ""If we don't reduce the cost of doing business in these towns to a sustainable level, we will kill their High Streets."" For that reason, F Hinds has joined forces with more than 50 other retailers to write a letter to Chancellor Sajid Javid calling for business rates reform. The signatories include the bosses of leading supermarkets, department stores and other big High Street names. Marks & Spencer, Superdrug, Morrisons, Debenhams, Boots and Greggs are among those involved. The letter notes that the ""burden of business rates has become unsustainable for many retailers"" and that the system is broken. Among other changes, they want businesses to be able to appeal against excessive business rates. Business rates: My bill went from Â£560 to Â£7,760 The system is a complex one, but businesses complain that changes in the rateable value of their properties can lead to their being unfairly clobbered. Mr Hinds says the burden of the system falls disproportionately on retailers, who make up 5% of the economy but pay 25% of all business rates. ""For more than a decade, we've been opening new shops in larger places rather than smaller ones,"" he says. ""The smaller towns that we're in already are becoming less vibrant. Eventually, older people and poorer people will have less access to shopping, because they can't drive 50 miles to the nearest supermall."" F Hinds says it opens more stores in big shopping centres because of the business rates system F Hinds has 127 shops across the UK, which makes it too big to qualify for business rates relief from the government. Mr Hinds jokes that they would fare better if they could relaunch as 127 small businesses. He says that if business rates are not reformed, many town centres will change radically. ""I think we will end up with a very different social fabric,"" he says. ""You can have other things in town centres apart from shopping, but if you lose shopping, will people go into the town to do the other things?"" The campaign has the backing of the British Retail Consortium, whose chief executive, Helen Dickinson, called on Mr Javid to address retailers' concerns in next month's Budget. She said: ""Every year, retail faces higher and higher business rates bills, holding back much needed investment in an industry that is transforming at a dramatic pace. ""Swift action at the upcoming Budget would show the chancellor was serious about levelling up all parts of the UK and supporting a retail industry towards realising a brighter future.""

Regulators probe Barclays boss over Epstein links,"Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has the full confidence of the board, the bank said Barclays boss Jes Staley said he ""deeply regrets"" his connection with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. His comments come after Barclays revealed that UK regulators are investigating the chief executive's links with the disgraced financier. Mr Staley admitted he maintained contact with Epstein, who died in New York prison cell last year, for seven years after his conviction. Barclays said Mr Staley has the ""full confidence"" of the board. ""It has been very well known I had a professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Mr Staley told reporters on Thursday. ""It goes back to 2000 when I was asked to run the JP Morgan private bank and he was already a client when I joined the private bank. ""The relationship was maintained during my time at JP Morgan but as I left JP Morgan the relationship tapered off quite significantly. Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" Epstein died in his prison last August after being charged with sex trafficking underage girls. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. Why Barclays did not fire Staley in December The probe by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority will focus on Mr Staley's ""characterisation to the company of his relationship"" with Epstein. The Financial Conduct Authority oversees bad behaviour in the City, while the Prudential Regulation Authority looks into financial stability. In a statement to the stock market, Barclays said: ""As has been widely reported, earlier in his career Mr Staley developed a professional relationship with Mr Epstein. In the summer of 2019, in light of the renewed media interest in the relationship, Mr Staley volunteered and gave to certain executives, and the chairman, an explanation of his relationship with Mr Epstein."" Barclays added that Mr Staley said he had had no contact with Epstein since joining his current employer in December 2015. The bank added: ""The relationship between Mr Staley and Mr Epstein was the subject of an inquiry from the Financial Conduct Authority, to which the company responded. ""The FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority subsequently commenced an investigation, which is ongoing, into Mr Staley's characterisation to the company of his relationship with Mr Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in the company's response to the FCA."" Separately, in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Mr Staley said that he feels he has been transparent with how he characterised his relationship with Epstein. ""The board has done its own review, and they've looked back at my transparency and they concluded indeed that I have been transparent and open with the bank and with the board all along this process,"" he said. ""But there is a regulatory process that is ongoing, and we'll let that run its course."" The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, saidBarclays conducted an internal inquiry last year, and was satisfied with Mr Staley explanation. Nevertheless, the news will be a fresh blow to Mr Staley, who is trying to rebuild his image after being sanctioned for attempting to unmask the identity of a whistleblower at Barclays. Epstein was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges when he was found dead in his cell on 10 August The bank was fined $15m (Â£11.6m) in the US and Mr Staley was fined Â£642,430 in the UK for breaching rules by attempting to find whoever raised concerns over an executive Mr Staley hired. The bank received two letters in 2016 criticising the decision and raising concerns about the executive's experience. Instead of being handed to the bank's investigations team, one of the letters was distributed among senior managers, including Mr Staley. Barclays also cut his bonus by Â£500,000. In another embarrassing episode in 2017, Mr Staley fell for an email prank when a disgruntled customer pretended to be his boss at the time, former chairman John McFarlane. Mr Staley exchanged several emails with the imposter, who used a Gmail email address, theFinancial Times reported,external. Under his stewardship, the bank's shares have lost about 25% of their value. The shares were down more than 3% in early trading on Thursday as the bank reported that pre-tax profits for the year jumped 25% to Â£4.4bn. Higher revenue and lower costs helped profits advance, the bank said, particularly at its international business. It's hardly surprising that Jes Staley had business links to Jeffrey Epstein - Mr Staley ran the private wealth division of JP Morgan, one of America's biggest banks for several years, looking after the private investments of wealthy Americans. That's exactly the business in which Mr Epstein was a big player, and the New York Times has reported that Mr Staley was one of his key contacts, with several of the deceased financier's big clients being referred to JP Morgan. This morning Barclays said in an announcement to the Stock Exchange that Mr Staley had volunteered information about that relationship to the Barclays board - but that the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Prudential Regulation Authority, Britain's two largest financial watchdogs, were now looking at exactly what he said. The key word in Barclays' statement is that investigation is into how the relationship was ""characterised"" - which infers that the investigators want to work out whether Mr Staley and Barclays gave a completely accurate picture. This does not necessarily mean big trouble for Mr Staley, and the Barclays board has given him a vote of confidence. Regulators, however, take a dim view of bank bosses who don't play ball from the start, and Mr Staley has blotted his copybook before.

Organised crime 'behind rise in large fly-tipping',"This video can not be played Tackling the fly-tippers who dump by the truckload Organised criminal gangs are being blamed for the continued rise of large fly-tipping incidents across England. Experts said fake companies hired out buildings to dump clients' waste, costing local authorities almost Â£60m in clean-up costs since 2012. Parts of London and Manchester have been hardest hit by a growing ""crisis"" in illegal waste removal services. The government says the rise in incidents could be down to better recording. Countryside Alliance head of policy Sarah Lee said tougher sentences were needed to address the crisis. Thousands of tonnes of illegal waste have been dumped in a warehouse in Staffordshire She said: ""You are now getting fake waste companies hiring out buildings, dumping waste in them, doing a runner and leaving it for landowners to dispose of the waste at huge cost to them."" Gangs will pose as legitimate waste disposal businesses, advertising their services on the internet for a cost, she added. The BBC Shared Data Unit found: Large-scale fly-tipping - defined as tipper lorry load or more in size - has more than doubled in six years Last year, councils faced a Â£12.8m bill to clear more than 36,200 large tips That accounted for more than a fifth of the overall cost of clearing fly-tips Marc Lidderth, an area manager for the Environment Agency, said fly-tipping crime was ""the new narcotics"". The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said new figures highlighted a ""nightmare"" situation that continued to ""spiral out of control"". Allow Twitter content?

It said criminals were using lock-cutting tools to break into private land and tip vast quantities of waste that can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to clear. Bogus waste companies also try to rent buildings or land and dump lorry loads of rubbish. In some instances, they go to great lengths to disguise their activities,compacting the waste into plastic wrapping, then taking it to open land and building it into haystack shapes. Keep Britain Tidy's Allison Ogden-Newton called on the government to do more Local authorities need to be properly resourced to tackle large-scale crime, according to Keep Britain Tidy chief executive Allison Ogden-Newton. ""It's time for the new government to get serious on mass fly-tipping, make it harder for criminals to trade, and give local authorities the resources they need,"" she added. Mountain of rubbish dumped by railway Fake firm dumped tonnes of waste But some, including the Country, Land and Business Association (CLA) director general Sarah Hendry, say the introduction of fees at many recycling centres had brought about the rise of organised criminal fly-tipping. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said waste crime was becoming more organised, involving ""networks of career criminals"", and tackling this type of illegal activity was complex. In 2019, local authorities were given the power to issue penalties of up to Â£400 to householders who pass waste to an unlicensed carrier and whose waste is then found fly-tipped. More than half of all local authorities in England posted an increase in the number of large fly-tipping incidents recorded between 2011-12 and 2018-19. Manchester City Council recorded the most large incidents in five out of the eight years where data was available, averaging 1,672 clean-ups a year. In response, the local authority said it had a dedicated environmental crimes team and had recently invested an extra Â£500,000 into fly-tipping prevention and enforcement. It also disputed the figures, saying they relate to reports rather than recorded offences. Many incidents could have also been double counted, it said. A spokesman for the authority said: ""Given that Manchester offers a free annual bulky waste collection service, there are no excuses for using a 'man with a van'."" Croydon, in south London, had the highest average annual number of large incidents per capita, according toofficial data published by the government.,external The area also saw the biggest increase in large fly-tip across the eight-year period, recording five such incidents in 2011-12, but 3,948 in 2018-19. Croydon Council said the majority of those incidents were reported by residents on its waste app.  It said its waste contractor collected 50 major fly-tips last year. A spokesman said it was proactive in its work to reduce fly-tipping and was tough on those who commit environmental crime. It said new powers to seize vehicles had been an excellent tool and the council had confiscated 42 over the last four years. In contrast, Wales, where a national awareness campaign called Fly-tipping Action Wales is in place, has seen large fly-tipping decrease since 2012. Data for Northern Ireland and Scotland was not publically available. One Croydon resident told the BBC that large-scale tipping was a major issue there. Elizabeth Ash, of Croydon Communities Consortium, said: ""You get into the car, start driving and, after a while, you know you've left Croydon just by looking out of the window. ""You think, 'Oh - we're in Lambeth now. There's no rubbish on the streets anymore'."" Mrs Ash said she had had rubbish tipped outside her house during the night. ""It was rubble and electrical appliances - another authority's bins full of builders' waste - tipped from the back of a lorry, presumably driving at speed. ""I awoke to the noise, looked out of the window and there was a huge plume of dust filling the air."" Initiatives being used by some local authorities in a bid to tackle the problem include landscaping to block access to hotspots and 'wall of shame' web pages, which share images of local fly-tippers with the public. In 2018-19, for the first time, two local authorities each issued a fine of more than Â£50,000 for fly-tipping. A business and its director were caught by Harrow Council dumping seven-and-a-half tonnes of waste on Hatch End playing fields. Triangle Care and Maintenance was ordered to pay more than Â£51,000 for the criminal venture. Persistent fly-tipping on the fields - where on each occasion a mound of household and refurbishment waste was dumped - led to the council installing hidden cameras and tracing the vehicle by its registration number. Council enforcement officers planted several items - one of them a marked can - among the rubbish in the back of the van after later spotting it parked on the street. Triangle Care and Maintenance was fined Â£50,000 for dumping building waste in Harrow. The cameras then captured the offenders in action, clearly identifying their faces and the van as the waste was dumped late at night. The marked can was found to be among the dumped waste. Earlier this year, Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said organised crime gangs linked to slavery, drugs and firearms were exploiting the waste industry in massive fraud and fly-tipping schemes. The agency is responsible for clearing larger scale fly-tips on public land, though it bills the cost to the local authority. An agency spokesman told the BBC: ""Waste crime is an unacceptable blight on our environment, estimated to cost the UK economy at least Â£600m a year and put communities at risk. ""We are determined to bring waste criminals to justice, which is why anyone found guilty could face jail time or a hefty fine. In the last year, we closed down over 900 illegal waste sites, brought forward 113 prosecutions and launched a Joint Unit on Waste Crime to bring down the most serious and organised criminal groups."" The joint unit brings together police forces, the National Crime Agency, the Environment Agency, HMRC and Natural Resources Wales. The agency encourages anyone who has witnessed waste crime to report it to the incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.

Sharp increase in coronavirus deaths and cases,"The WHO has said a vaccine will likely be found but it will take time Some 242 deaths from the new coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei on Wednesday, the deadliest day of the outbreak. There was also a huge increase in the number of cases, with 14,840 people diagnosed withCovid-19. Hubei has started using a broader definition to diagnose people, which accounts for most of the rise in cases. China sacked two top officials in Hubei province hours after the new figures were revealed. Until Wednesday's increases, the number of people with the virus in Hubei, where the outbreak emerged, was stabilising. But the new cases and deaths in the province have pushed the national death toll above 1,350 with almost 60,000 infections in total. Meanwhile Japan has announced its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s who lived in Kanagawa, south-west of Tokyo. It is the third death outside mainland China, following one each in the Philippines and Hong Kong. The woman's diagnosis was confirmed after her death and she had no obvious link to China's Hubei province, Japanese media reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is seeking ""further clarity"" from China about the changes to how cases of the virus are being confirmed. China has been accused of suppressing the full extent of the outbreak in the past, says the BBC's Nick Beake in Hong Kong. David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""What has happened in China is that they have changed the definition of what the disease really is - now they are taking people who have lesser symptoms. ""The deaths are quite worrisome, there is an increased number of deaths reported, but if you look overall at the total number of deaths and the total number of cases, the fatality ratio is about the same as it has been - but it is still high, as high as the death rate in influenza."" Only Hubei province - which accounts for more than 80% of overall Chinese infections - is using the new definition to diagnose new cases. Just about everyone who's been following China's official coronavirus numbers has been able to see that they have been incomplete. Government officials know this too. There's no way they've accounted for everybody infected. How could they? But at least we had what appeared to be a trend. We could observe the pattern to try and estimate the trajectory of outbreak. Now that's gone too. You can understand why it has been decided that people who have virus symptoms, plus a CT scan showing chest infection, are now being counted in the ""definitely infected"" column. However, this has thrown the trend mapping into chaos. Over the past 24 hours in Hubei alone, nearly 15,000 people were moved into the infected column. This would have sent shockwaves around the world, but actually, if you consider Wednesday's cases by the old definition, the rate could well mean another day of decline: a completely different picture. So now, we're scratching our heads: do we start looking at the pattern all over again from Thursday onwards? This has also left many wondering what the real death rate must have been over recent weeks and the extent to which we should be treating the overall figures seriously anyway. Meanwhile, the Communist Party secretary in Hubei, Jiang Chaoliang, has been replaced by the Shanghai party chief, Ying Yong, according to state media. The party chief of the capital city, Wuhan, has also been relieved of his duties. It is the first major change of Hubei party officials since the outbreak began. Earlier this week, a number of health officials were""removed"" from their jobs. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Why a global city is so vulnerable to virus spread The Valentine messages to coronavirus medics The province now includes ""clinically diagnosed cases"" in the number of confirmed cases. This means it includes those showing symptoms, and having a CT scan showing an infected lung, rather than relying only on the standard nucleic acid tests. Of the 242 new deaths in Wuhan, 135 are such ""clinically diagnosed"" cases. That means, even without the new definition, the number of deaths in Hubei on Wednesday was 107 - a new high for the province. The province's 14,840 new infections include 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases. Overall, the province now has 48,206 confirmed infections. A cruise ship carrying more than 2,000 people has docked in Cambodia after it was turned away by five ports over fears that some passengers might be infected with the virus. The MS Westerdam arrived on Thursday morning after Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand had all refused to accept the ship despite having no sick patients on board. Cruise ship rejected by five ports docks at last Are cruise ships really 'floating petri dishes'? Meanwhile, another 44 cases have been confirmed on the Diamond Princess, which is in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan. The increase means 218 people of the 3,700 people on board the ship have caught the virus. Not everyone has been tested yet. People with the virus are taken to hospitals on land to be treated, while those on board are largely confined to their cabins. However on Thursday Japan said it would allow those aged 80 or over who have tested negative for the coronavirus to disembark. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said they could be allowed off the ship as early as Friday but would have to stay in accommodation provided by the government, the Japan Times reported.

How do you stop fly-tipping?,"What are the solutions to the problem of fly-tipping? The scourge of fly-tipping across England is getting worse with councils spending more than Â£67m to clean up public land and prosecute anyone they catch, according to official figures. So what should be done about the problem? From old mattresses and fridges to tyres and masonry - and even coffins and live turtles - almost a million incidents of rubbish dumped illegally are recorded each year. Councils have been given new powers to fine people up to Â£400 for ""smaller"" offences, but this depends on evidence. It has left local authorities having to consider new ways to clamp down on those who illegally dump their waste - or try to persuade them not to do it in the first place. Whether it is cutting-edge DNA profiling or covert surveillance, online naming and shaming or conscience-pricking children's artwork, BBCInside Outhas been exploring the different ways to stop dumping and littering. For more stories from the BBC England data unit follow our Pinterest board,external This video can not be played Can DNA Tests identify litter louts? If neither the carrot nor the stick brings down illegal dumping, could science hold the key? In Hong Kong a campaign group used the DNA found on litter to create a photo-fit picture of the alleged culprits.""The Face of Litter"",externalwas used by Hong Kong Cleanup and communications firm Ogilvy & Mather, working with a forensics company to create the images. DNA can narrow down the search to gender and some visible characteristics, such as the most likely hair colour, eye colour and ethnicity of the litterbug. Rafael Guida of Ogilvy said: ""While this method may not identify specific individuals, it will be enough to make people think twice about littering. The campaign combines a public service message with science and technology, enabling us to communicate with Hong Kongers in a very different way."" However, Dr Denise Syndercombe-Court, reader in forensic science at King's College London, said: ""I think it's crazy talking about catching somebody who has dropped litter. ""It's too expensive. The result that you get can't be used in a court of law. ""It won't be precise enough and it will mean the law enforcement agencies will be targeting people, the majority of whom are going to be innocent."" For the time being at least, councils will have to rely on trying to catch offenders in the act. Richard Weston was caught on camera throwing a kitchen appliance into a ditch As the dishwasher tumbled from his hands into the weeds at the side of the road, Richard Weston was caught on camera by a council surveillance operation. The 38-year-old of Woodville, Derbyshire, was fined Â£1,200 in April after pleading guilty to dumping waste illegally. Matt Holford, environmental health manager at South Derbyshire Council, says surveillance works and appears to have been a deterrent. ""We have adopted the use of inconspicuous, highly mobile surveillance cameras to help with fly-tipping enforcement work and as a result we've recently caught a number of waste offenders. ""We have secured four successful convictions in the last 12 months and have interviewed 10 people under caution in the last three months. ""Since April 2016 we've recorded a significant reduction in fly-tipping incidents again."" South Derbyshire Council, which had to clean up after 498 incidents of fly-tipping in 2014-15, is not alone in using surveillance tactics. Rhonda Cynon Taff Council in south Wales puts wardens on the streets with cameras to catch people dropping litter, which it thenposts online,externalfor the public to see. Fly-tipping is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to Â£50,000 or up to five years' imprisonment. From May 2016, councils in England were given the power to issue fixed penalty notices between Â£150 and Â£400 for ""small-scale"" offences. Despite the threat of fines, fly-tipping has been getting worse, having previously been in steady decline. Statistics from Defra showed there were 900,000 cases of fly-tipping in handled by local authorities in England in 2014-15, a 5.6% rise on the year before. Littering also costs the taxpayer between Â£717m and Â£850m a year to tidy up. However, fining people requires them to be caught first. London boroughs make up seven of the 10 worst affected areas for fly-tipping by head of population. Council workers have found everything from typical bulky items such as mattresses and tyres to the more bizarre. Redbridge Council staff discovered an empty coffin dumped with a pile of tyres behind some garages in Ilford in 2014. In a separate incident the same year they found two turtles in a shoebox in Hainault and sent them to the RSPCA. Children's artwork gives people in the Forest of Dean the impression they are being watched Perhaps a softer approach will work. In the Forest of Dean, six primary schools and one secondary school work with a charity using children's art to make would-be dumpers and litterers think again. Fifty children's models of faces, attached to trees at 16 sites, are intended to give people the impression they are being watched. Environmental charity Hubbub has called it the ""Communitrees"" project. The charity was inspired by similar schemes such as 10,000 Eyes in Rotterdam, which saw eyes painted on buildings and down alleyways in a bid to deter crime. Elle McAll from Hubbub said: ""The eyes on the trees form a new community of 'Communitrees', keeping a watchful eye on their forest floor to deter litterers and encourage others to keep their ancient flora and fauna clean and green. ""We're are collecting data at seven of the Communitree sites. Early indications suggest a slight reduction in the quantity of litter found. The full impact of the campaign is being assessed and will be widely shared both good and bad in the next few months."" Forest of Dean District Council had to handle in excess of 800 incidents of fly-tipping in 2014-15, costing more than Â£34,000 of taxpayers' money to clean up and a further Â£56,000 to investigate and take action. Natalie McDermoth was named in a council ""hall of shame"" Can the shaming of others deter would be fly-tippers and litterbugs from blotting the landscape in the first place? That was how Croydon Council, which has seen an 84% rise in fly-tipping since 2014, decided to handle the problem. (The latest figures showed London was the worst-affected area of England with 367,075 incidents of fly-tipping across the capital in 2014-15.) A Â£420 fine was handed to 24-year-old Natalie McDermoth for dropping a single cigarette butt. She had refused to pay an Â£80 on-the-spot fine and was taken to court. Yet while the financial penalty was significant, it was not the end of the punishment. Miss McDermoth was among more than 100 people added to a ""hall of shame"" published by the authority for littering and fly-tipping. ""I was embarrassed,"" she said. ""I was mortified. If my kids grow up and put my name in Google, that's what's going to come up.""

The volunteers at risk,"Many of Wuhan's streets are deserted As Wuhan - the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - remains under lockdown, groups of volunteers have stepped in to help by taking patients to hospital and acting as taxis for health workers who have no transport. The BBC spoke to one such volunteer, a man surnamed Zhou, who described how the network of volunteers emerged as normal life in the city shut down. Everything happened so suddenly. Life was normal until the lockdown and we were all caught off guard. At the beginning of the outbreak, the frontline health workers were working intensively from 06:00 to 23:00 and some of them don't have cars. Public transport has been stopped so sometimes they had to cycle for up to two hours to get to work. It's very tough in the winter. So people started to set up WeChat [a popular Chinese messaging app] groups to recruit and organise volunteers. China and the virus that threatens everything The Chinese doctor who tried to warn about coronavirus Car owners like me joined those groups and volunteered to ferry them about. My main jobs are to take medical staff to and from work and to deliver medical supplies to hospitals. We also deliver meals to them from restaurants that have been providing free food throughout the outbreak. Those who do venture out wear as much protective clothing as they can It's possible [that we are transporting infected people] because they are potentially exposed to the virus and may fall ill as well. But we do have guidelines: there are volunteers in the groups who are professionals and who have trained us how to protect ourselves. Super-spreaders: Why are they important? How worried should we be? They have also given us protective clothing. I used to just wear raincoats and goggles and two surgical masks, one on top of the other, when it had just started, but now I have a protective suit. I disinfect my car every time after I've dropped someone off, and when there's a gap between two assignments, I go home to have a shower and change my clothes. Sometimes I have three or four showers a day.

I love this city, as simple as that. Also I think I'm cut out for this work because I'm on my own, I'm healthy and strong, and I have the ability. So I signed myself up. I think many people from Wuhan are like me, we're warm-hearted, and we're people with courage. In this difficult time, we have to unite and look after each other, so there's hope. Public transport in and out of Wuhan has been suspended It's an emergency situation that none of us expected. Yes, the local authorities were lacking resources at the beginning. For them, it was beyond their ability to deal with such a sudden outbreak. They had to ask for help from the central government and this takes time. So, ordinary people like us felt that we had a responsibility to do something to protect our people and our hometown, and to support the government while we're waiting for help. People are trying to be optimistic. And I believe we'll eventually get through this. Video shows medical staff and patients dancing at a makeshift hospital in Wuhan I've spoken to many doctors. They didn't have the right experience to deal with the emergency either. Some of them are very young - just starting their careers. It's true that there were limited resources at the beginning, a lack of masks and protective suits. Sometimes one protective suit had to be shared by many health workers, so they were under huge pressure. A&E doctor one of UK coronavirus cases Coronavirus disease named Covid-19 But the situation is gradually getting better and I think they have the basic supplies they need - much to their relief. Conference centres and other venues have been turned into makeshift medical centres Sometimes, when I pick them up in the middle of the night, I honestly think they're great; I have respect for them. They have their own families too, but they're putting patients first. So we should do something as well to support them. I think we should all do our best: if you can protect yourself well while helping  others, then do it. Otherwise, staying at home is also a form of support.

A global city helped the spread,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Singapore minister says the country is 'vulnerable' Several international cases of the coronavirus from the UK to South Korea can be traced back to Singapore and some countries are now advising against travel to the international hub. But while Singapore has been commended for its management of the crisis, the tiny city-state faces unique challenges. Changi airport in Singapore is one of the most interconnected hubs in the world. In fact, there'sa flight taking off and arriving every 80 seconds here,external, making it more connected than JFK and San Francisco in the US and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. But the scenes there these days are very different. Dozens of thermal scanners dot the terminals, automatically taking the temperature of passengers as they enter and exit Singapore. Travellers are checked for fever, cold and cough symptoms - airport staff on the lookout for any sign of the coronavirus. The country's open borders and interconnectedness as well as its pro-active approach to testing means it has reported one of the highest tallies outside mainland China - 50. ""We are vulnerable, but we have to do everything that we can to contain that spread of the virus,"" says Lawrence Wong, co-chair of Singapore's task force on the coronavirus. But when a virus comes to Singapore it won't just affect this city. It can and has spread through Singapore to other countries around the world. This became painfully obvious when one meeting held in a luxury hotel in mid-January spawned several coronavirus cases around the world. More than 100 people attended the sales conference, including some from China. About a week after that meeting, stories of confirmed coronavirus cases began popping up all over the world - from South Korea to Malaysia, the UK and even Spain. Thefirst Malaysian to catch the virus,externalwas a 41-year-old man who had attended the conference along with colleagues from China. Subsequently, his sister and mother-in-law caught it from him. Singapore bank evacuated after worker falls ill Why are super-spreaders important? A visual guide to the outbreak Then,South Korea confirmed two infected cases,externalof South Korean nationals who had also attended the meeting. Singapore reported three cases,external: two Singaporean nationals and a permanent resident. British national and super-spreader Steve Walsh was also at the Singapore conference. After his meetings in the tropical city-state he flew to a French ski resort for a holiday, on his way back home. He is thought to have infected 11 others while he was there - people who eventually flew elsewhere - leading to five cases in England, five in France, and one in Majorca, Spain. This one meeting demonstrates how Singapore became a super-conductor for the virus. China and the virus that threatens everything How worried should we be? And the worry is it's not just one conference. Singapore is at risk of spreading the virus precisely because it is a top destination for business meetings and international travellers. The city-state is a big draw for Chinese businesses too, given the close economic links between the two countries -3.62m Chinese visitors came to Singapore in 2019,external, making up the largest group. Singapore learnt lessons from the Sars crisis in 2002-3 With Chinese tourists shunning Hong Kong because of the anti-government protests there, many chose to come to Singapore over the Lunar New Year holidays - which coincided with the coronavirus outbreak. ""We are very mindful that we are indeed an open economy, we are an international travel hub,"" Mr Wong says. ""So we are doing all we can to contain that spread. We are putting out information in a very transparent manner and we continue to work with all health authorities overseas."" At home, Singapore is stepping up its coronavirus response by taking extreme measures. It immediately understood the implications of spread in a densely-populated city. Indeed, eight of the 50 cases reported so far have no known links to clusters that had been in contact with Chinese travellers from Wuhan. That is likely to be of concern because it means the linking cases out there could yet pass on the illness to others. That's why Singapore has put in place a highly sophisticated contact tracing mechanism to hunt down every known possible contact of those infected so they can be quarantined or monitored. This video can not be played Coronavirus quarantine in US: 'I haven't had freedom for a month' It was the first country after North Korea and Russia toshut its borders to China,externaland has enforced astrict 14-day leave of absence for Chinese nationals,externalreturning from the mainland who are permanent residents or have work permits It has a zero tolerance approach to any breaches of the measures it has put in - and this is of comfort to many Singaporeans. Employees caught breaking isolation rules saw their work permits revoked and were barred from working in Singapore permanently. Meanwhile, theiremployers have been banned from hiring foreigners,externalfor two years. Singapore also distributed masks to more than a million households and has started a government-run WhatsApp group that provides daily updates to subscribers on the number of infected. It's even cleared out university dorms to make room for quarantined patients, a move that was executed so quickly it took students by surprise. But while the measures have been applauded by international health experts, Singaporeans themselves have not always bought the government's messaging. Social media comments show many Singaporeans don't believe the government's advice to wear masks only when you're unwell, suspecting a shortage of masks instead. Many also complained Singapore didn't close borders to China soon enough. Anti-fake news laws are being used to combat misinformation And when authorities raised the health alert level last week, indicating the spread of the disease was severe, scores of Singaporeans rushed to the supermarkets to stock up on rice, instant noodles and toilet paper, worried the country was going into lockdown. The panic abated only when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong released a recorded message assuring his citizens there were more than enough supplies. This level of control is only achievable in Singapore because of its centralised form of decision-making and the massive parliamentary majority the ruling party enjoys. There are also strict restrictions on what you can say in the public domain about the coronavirus, with thecountry's anti-fake news law being usedto curtail the spread of misinformation. Still, the main reason Singapore can move fast and quickly to fight the coronavirus is because it's so small, and it is clear that there is a plan in place - one that has been crafted from the harsh lessons of the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2002-2003. ""You would see your colleagues one day at lunch, and then a few days later, you would hear that they are in the ICU, or worse - dead,"" says Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist. A Sars survivor, he was on the frontline treating people with the illness in a period that, he says, ""scarred and traumatised Singaporeans"". Some238 people were infected and 33 lost their lives,external. ""We are such a vulnerable country, so small and well connected,"" Dr Leong says. ""You could have a disease one day in China, or anywhere else in the world, and the next minute it could be in Singapore. Containment is actually unrealistic, I don't think China will be able to control it. ""I think a weakened form of the virus will emerge, like a common cold. That will be the eventuality of this virus."" Singapore has no choice but to be extra vigilant and transparent in its fight against this deadly disease. This country is dependent on the rest of the world for its economy, for its food, for its lifeline. Its strict containment methods managed to stamp out Sars but in the last 10 years Singapore has become more - not less - integrated into the global economy, and more closely tied to China.
