Kate Osamor resigns as shadow minister,"Kate Osamor has resigned from her post as shadow secretary of state for international development Labour frontbencher Kate Osamor has quit her role to support her family, after allegedly throwing a bucket of water at a newspaper journalist. It comes weeks after she was reported to Parliament's standards watchdog. Earlier in the year, the Edmonton MP's son, Ishmael - then a Haringey councillor - was convicted of having Â£2,500-worth of drugs at a festival. The Times newspaper says its reporter was visiting her home to ask questions about the case. Her resignation follows allegations of misconductmade by the newspaper,external, which says she verbally abused its reporter on Friday night before throwing water over him, then calling the police. The reporter had visited the MP's home seeking a response to ongoing questions surrounding Ms Osamor's son's conviction for drug offences, the newspaper said. In a statement on Twitter,external, the Edmonton MP said it had been a ""difficult time"". Ishmael Osamor pleaded guilty in September to four charges of drug possession at the Bestival festival in Dorset, but prosecutors accepted he wasn't planning to sell the drugs. According to The Times, Ms Osamor, who was Labour's shadow secretary of state for international development, said she did not know about the case until after sentencing in October. But the newspaper reports that the MP wrote a letter to the trial judge asking for leniency and stressing her son's remorse. The BBC has approached Ms Osamor for comment on the allegations made by the newspaper. Ishmael Osamor resigned from Haringey Council after being caught with a large amount of drugs Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn thanked Ms Osamor, who was elected in 2015, for bringing ""a new dimension"" to her role as a shadow minister ""by committing Labour to tackling global inequality as well as poverty"". Dan Carden, MP for Liverpool Walton, has been appointed acting shadow secretary of state for international development. Ms Osamor's ""integrity"" was questioned when she continued to employ her son as a communications officer after he resigned as a local councillor. Last month a Tory MP reported her to Parliament's standards watchdog over her son's continued employment in her Westminster office as a researcher. Ishmael Osamor was caughttrying to take ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and cannabis into the festival in August 2017 - nine months before he was elected as a councillor for Haringey. Following his conviction he resigned from his cabinet post on the council, and later resigned as a councillor following pressure from opposition groups.

Corbyn will do BBC debate if head-to-head,"Other parties reject the idea of a May-Corbyn head-to-head debate as they want a chance to have their say too Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accepted Theresa May's challenge of a TV Brexit debate on the BBC - but only if it is the two leaders head-to-head. Mr Corbyn had previously claimed he preferred the bid from broadcaster ITV, but Mrs May wanted the BBC to host it. In a statement on Saturday, the BBC said its proposal includes a one-on-one debate as well as a chance to hear from ""a wider range of voices"". Other parties say they want to be part of any Brexit TV debate. The BBC's debate would take part on Sunday 9 December, two days before MPs are due to vote the government's Brexit deal. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the agreement, which has already been agreed between the UK and EU. Brexit: A really simple guide Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? Clash over who screens Brexit TV debate Mrs May accepted the BBC's offer to take part in the debate earlier this week. Mr Corbyn said he preferred ITV's bid out of ""respect"" for viewers who wanted to watch the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final on ITV the same evening. But in a tweet on Saturday,  he said: ""Theresa May said she wanted a head to head debate with me on her botched Brexit deal and I am ready to do that. ""ITV have a straightforward plan. If she and her team prefer BBC, she should join me in asking them to arrange an actual head-to-head debate."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Several partieshave said they should be included in the debate- including the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens. Theresa May was criticised for missing a TV debate ahead of the 2017 general election Although Jeremy Corbynhas suggestedLabour believes another referendum is ""an option for the future"", but not an option for now, other parties have taken harder lines calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. In a statement, the BBC said: ""Our proposal is to broadcast a programme which includes both a head-to-head debate between the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition and also an opportunity to hear from a wider range of voices. ""After all, a broad range of views on this issue is held by the public and by Parliamentarians - from those who want a different form of Brexit to those who want another public vote - and we believe that should be reflected in the debate.""

Scalpel blades taped to children's slide,"Police say the blades could ""have caused serious injury to a child"" Scalpel and razor blades have been found taped to the sides of a slide in a children's play area. They were found stuck to play equipment at the Winifred Lane play area in Aughton, near Ormskirk,Lancashire Police said on Facebook,external. Doreen Stephenson, a councillor for Aughton Park, labelled the culprits a ""disgrace"", adding: ""It's quite frightening to think what the consequences could be."" Police urged ""everyone to be vigilant"". Ms Stephenson said: ""I can't believe anybody would stoop so low to do something like this in a public children's play area. ""It's an absolute disgrace."" Police urged parents to ""check any play equipment before you let your child use it"". ""Whoever did this could have caused serious injury to a child - please be assured we are fully investigating this matter,"" they added. Another local ward councillor, David Westley, said the park was run by the parish council and they would be passing any useful CCTV footage on to police. He added: ""I'm absolutely horrified. It's impossible to comprehend why anyone would do such a thing."" People commenting on the police Facebook post branded the vandals ""disgusting"", ""sick"" and ""horrible"".

Riot police clash with Paris protesters,"This video can not be played Tear gas filled the streets around the Arc de Triomphe Protesters have scaled the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris, as clashes with riot police continued during a third weekend of ""yellow vest"" rallies. Police fired tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon on the Champs-ElysÃ©es, while masked protesters hurled projectiles and set buildings on fire. At least 110 people were injured, including 17 members of the security forces, and 270 arrests were made. Protests over fuel tax have grown into general anger at higher living costs. President Emmanuel Macron says his fuel policies are needed to combat global warming. One person was in a critical condition after protesters pulled down an iron gate at the Tuileries garden near the Louvre museum, which fell on several people. An assault rifle was also stolen from a police vehicle although it was unclear if it was loaded, AFP news agency quotes a police source as saying. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The French interior ministry said at least 75,000 people had turned out across France for the latest ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) rallies - so called because the protesters donned the high-vis vest required to be carried in every vehicle by law. Nearly 190 fires were put out and six buildings were set ablaze, the interior ministry said. By Hugh Schofield, Paris It is quite clear there were agitators or ""casseurs"" at the sharp end of the clashes with police. We saw groups of people both from the anarchist far left and from the nationalist far right. They were tooled up and ready for a fight. The vast majority of ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vests) who came to Paris to protest were not in that category. There were many who were happy to look on, jeering police and providing moral encouragement to the front lines. And then there were the crowds who hung back - genuinely wanting nothing to do with the trouble. Inevitably even these people agreed it was the police who had started it all, by wanton use of tear gas. The numbers were small, just a few thousand. But across the country the cause is extremely popular. They say - quite proudly - that they are the ""sans-dents"", the great unwashed, the forgotten majority from the sticks. And they've had enough.

Responding to the day's events from the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Mr Macron said the protests ""had absolutely nothing to do with a peaceful demonstration of a legitimate unhappiness or discontent."" He said those responsible did not want change, but instead intended to ""wreak chaos"". ""No cause justifies that authorities are attacked, that businesses are plundered, that passers-by or journalists are threatened or that the Arc de Triomphe is defiled,"" he added. At least 110 people were injured Earlier this week,Mr Macron tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying he was open to ideas about how the fuel tax could be applied. But his speech does not appear to have gone far enough in assuaging people of the view that he is out of touch with ordinary people. The Health Minister said the protests had been taken over by ""extremist groups"" Dramatic protests took place over several hours in French capital. One building was set on fire on a major avenue near the Arc de Triomphe and protesters stole an assault rifle from a police vehicle in the centre of the city. Department stores and metro stations were closed as a result of the violence. But protesters insisted the movement was peaceful. ""It's a mess because we don't have a leader,"" Dan Lodi, 68, told AFP. ""You always have some idiots who come to fight, but they don't represent us at all,"" he said. Among the peaceful demonstrators, who held up slogans such as ""Macron, stop treating us like idiots"", there were those hiding their faces with masks and goggles. A number of officers, wearing protective gear and helmets, were spattered with vivid yellow paint Police fired tear gas, a water cannon and stun grenades to disperse those who were trying to tear down the barricades. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who visited the scene, tweeted that there were ""1,500 agitators,externaloutside the security perimeter who came to fight"". He called the protests""an insult to the republic"",external. The movement has grown via social media to encompass rising anger at high taxes and living costs, and broader criticism of President Macron's economic policies. It has supporters across the political spectrum, from far left to far right, although Mr Macron has accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. A sign on the Arc de Triomphe reads ""The yellow vests will triumph"" Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Our correspondent says that because the movement has grown via social media, it does not have an identifiable leadership or a coherent demand. What it does have, he says, is a lot of co-ordination via Facebook and a lot of support from the public. Nearly 300,000 people took part in the first country-wide demonstration, on 17 November. Most demonstrators have remained peaceful, although more than 200 people were injured, several seriously. One person died when they were struck by a panicked driver and a motorcyclist was killed a few days later, when they were hit by a van making a sudden turn in the traffic chaos. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. Who are France's 'yellow vests'?

George HW Bush to lie in state,"This video can not be played A look back at the life of George Bush Senior The body of former US President George HW Bush is to lie in state next week ahead of a day of national mourning. An arrival ceremony will be held for Bush Snr on Monday evening at the US Capitol. The public will be invited to pay their respects. Bush served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, and died late on Friday. A funeral service will be held at a later date at the National Cathedral in Washington DC. The former president had been receiving treatment for a form of Parkinson's disease and had been admitted to hospital with a blood infection in April. He died aged 94 in Houston, Texas. The presidential plane will be flown to Houston to bring the former president's body to Washington DC. His body will lie in state in the US Capitol until 07:00 EST (12:00 GMT) on Wednesday, where the public will be able to pay tribute. He will be buried at the presidential library in Texas, alongside his wife, Barbara Bush, who died seven months ago. The Bush family said they would announce additional details about funeral arrangements ""as soon as is practical"". The making of a president What makes a one-term president? A life in pictures A statement from a joint military task force supporting events around the state funeral promised a ""nothing less than a first-class tribute"". The White House said President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump would attend, despite not being at the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush. Dozens of other world leaders are also expected to be in attendance. Although US President Donald Trump has had difficult relations with the Bush family, he has declared Wednesday, 5 December, a national day of mourning. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will also be closed on Wednesday in his honour. Mr Trump also called off a press conference planned at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires as a mark of respect for Bush. Speaking in Buenos Aires, the U.S. President called Bush ""a high-quality man."" He was a terrific guy and he'll be missed. He led a full life, and a very exemplary life, too,"" he told reporters. As communism collapsed across Central and Eastern Europe, he oversaw warming relations with the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev George Herbert Walker Bush was born in Massachusetts in June 1924 and grew up in Connecticut. He entered politics in 1964 after starting a Texan oil business and becoming a millionaire by the age of 40. During World War Two, he was an aviator before being shot down by the Japanese in September 1944 while on a bombing raid. In 1945, Bush married 18-year-old Barbara Pierce, with whom he went on to have six children. His single presidential term in office was defined by the end of the Cold War and the first Iraq war against Saddam Hussein. In 2001, his son George W Bush followed him into the White House, serving two terms. Reaction to Bush's death George HW Bush: The war years UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that ""in navigating a peaceful end to the Cold War he made the world a safer place for generations to come"" Queen Elizabeth said he was ""a great friend and ally"" of the United Kingdom His successor, Bill Clinton, said he and Hillary gave ""thanks for his great long life of service, love and friendship"", adding: ""I am grateful for every minute I spent with him and will always hold our friendship as one of my life's greatest gifts"" Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev hailed Bush's contribution to ending the Cold War and reducing nuclear weapons. Both men signed the first Start treaty in 1991, which led to big cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. ""He was a genuine partner,"" Mr Gorbachev said. The last state funeral for a former president was that of Gerald Ford, which began on 30 December 2006 with a lying in state and service at the US Capitol.

Russian TV crew sparks military alert,"Timur Siraziev's report from outside the Berkshire base was broadcast on Russia's Channel One The defence secretary has called on the public to report suspicious activity near military sites after a Russian TV crew prompted an alert at an Army base. Gavin Williamson issued the warning after Timur Siraziev, of Channel One, was seen outside 77 Brigade's Berkshire base, theMail on Sunday reported,external. The unit works in social media and psychological operations. The MoD said Mr Siraziev's ""suspicious"" behaviour was monitored by the base's security systems. Russia's Channel One later broadcast a report by Mr Siraziev containing footage apparently filmed from a vehicle as it passed the barracks in Hermitage on 21 November. He is also shown speaking on camera as he walks close to an entrance to the base. Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Inside Army 'psy-ops' headquarters The Mail on Sunday said the security alert warns troops not to approach Mr Siraziev or engage him in conversation if they are alone but to contact police immediately. Mr Williamson said: ""We take the security of our bases and personnel incredibly seriously. ""If a member of the public sees anyone acting suspiciously in or around a military base it should be reported to the police as a matter of urgency."" With UK-Russian relations frosty in the wake of theSalisbury Novichok poisoning, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming warned earlier this year that Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community. Last month, the head of the Army, Gen Mark Carleton-Smith, described Russia as a ""far greater threat"" to UK security than the Islamic State group. Mr Siraziev is listed on the Russian Embassy's website as Channel One's bureau chief. When set up in 2015,77 Brigade was touted as a unitthat would help the UK to fight wars in the ""information age"" by helping to win hearts and minds. It includes both regular troops and reservists. Head of the Army at the time, Gen Sir Nick Carter, said the move was about trying to operate ""smarter"".

Egyptian star charged over revealing dress,"Ms Youssef says she ""probably miscalculated"" in wearing the dress An Egyptian actress who wore a revealing dress to the Cairo Film Festival is to appear in court after being accused of ""inciting debauchery"". Rania Youssef appeared in a lacy, black, see-through outfit that exposed most of her legs, outraging many Egyptians, though some said she should be able to wear what she wanted. She could be jailed for up to five years if found guilty, a judicial source told AFP. Ms Youssef has apologised. The 44-year-old said she would not have worn the dress if she had known it would cause such controversy. Egyptian singer jailed over banana video Egyptian singer facing jail for Nile joke The complaint against her was filed by two lawyers, Amro Abdelsalam and Samir Sabri, who are known for taking celebrities to court. Ms Youssef's appearance ""did not meet societal values, traditions and morals and therefore undermined the reputation of the festival and the reputation of Egyptian women in particular"", Mr Sabri told AFP. The Egyptian Actors' Syndicate also criticised the ""appearance of some of the guests"", which it said ""undermined the festival and the union"". In a social media post,the actress said she had ""probably miscalculated"",externalin choosing to wear the dress. ""It was the first time that I wore it and I did not realise it would spark so much anger,"" she said. ""I reaffirm my commitment to the values upon which we were raised in Egyptian society,"" she added. Last year anEgyptian court jailed singer Shaimaa Ahmedfor two years - later reduced to a year - for appearing in a music video in her underwear while suggestively eating a banana. Meanwhile in Januaryprosecutors detained another singer, Laila Amer, after her music video, showing her dancing and making suggestive gestures, sparked controversy.

Trump and Xi meet amid trade tensions,"Mr Trump (front right) met Mr Xi (front left) after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to halt new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks, the US says. At a post-G20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on $200bn (Â£157bn) of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January. China will buy a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products, the US says. Meanwhile, Beijing says the two sides agreed to open up their markets. The Trump and Xi deal: A temporary truce It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since a trade war erupted earlier this year. The dispute broke out after Mr Trump complained China was doing nothing to cut its large surplus in bilateral trade. At the summit in Argentina's capital earlier on Saturday, the G20 leaders agreeda joint declaration that notes divisions over trade,externalbut does not criticise protectionism. Mr Trump and Mr Xi held a ""highly successful meeting"",the White House says in a statement.,external It says the US tariffs on Chinese goods will remain unchanged for 90 days, but warns: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods The US says China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", the White House says. President Trump said earlier this year he wanted to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". According to the US, China has also signalled it will allow a tie-up between two major semiconductor manufacturers which Chinese regulators have been blocking. The White House statement said China was ""open to approving the previously unapproved Qualcomm-NXP deal"". Qualcomm - the world's biggest chipmaker - had abandoned its $44bn bid for Dutch rival NXPSemiconductors after Chinese opposition. The US also says Beijing agreed to designate Fentanyl as a controlled substance. The opioid - much of it thought to be made in China - is driving a huge rise in drug addiction in the US. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". He hailed ""new space for win-win co-operation"", while Chinese state TV said negotiations would continue. US-China trade war in 300 words Both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump had also said that if talks in Argentina were unsuccessful, he would carry out a threat to hit the remaining $267bn of annual Chinese exports to the US with tariffs of between 10 and 25%. US-China trade divisions meantan Asian economic summit earlier this month was unable to agree a formal leaders' statementfor the first time in its history. Returning from the G20 summit on Air Force One, Mr Trump told reporters ""it's an incredible deal"" that would have an ""incredibly positive impact on farming"". ""What I'd be doing is holding back on tariffs. China will be opening up. China will be getting rid of tariffs,"" Mr Trump said. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing China has pretty much given up nothing in this deal because the future tariffs threatened from the Beijing side were retaliatory in nature and only to be applied if the United State escalated. For this it has gained a 90-day reprieve, during which time both sides have pledged to ramp up talks. When China's Foreign Minster Wang Yi spoke to reporters after the meeting he said the two leaders had agreed to open up each other's markets and that this process could lead to the resolution of ""legitimate"" US concerns. This was either an acknowledgment that Washington does have legitimate concerns or a way of differentiating those American concerns which are reasonable from those which are not actually ""legitimate"". This is not a suspension of the trade war but a suspension of the escalation of the trade war. Big questions remain about the preparedness of Beijing to allow international access to this enormous market to a level that would satisfy the Trump administration prompting a complete halt in the trade war. On other issues, the US president announced he would be ""formally terminating Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement] shortly"". Mr Trump (C) earlier signed a new trade agreement on Friday with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts This would give lawmakers six months, he said, to approve a new trade deal agreed with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday or revert to trade rules from before 1994, when Nafta took effect. Trump expects second Kim summit soon Trump claims progress after Kim summit He also said he was likely to meet North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un in January or February and three locations for their second meeting were being considered. Mr Trump added that he would also invite Mr Kim, with whom he has ""a good relationship"", to the US at some point. French leader Emmanuel Macron told reporters that the World Trade Organization, the body that regulates trade disputes, needed to be modernised. A senior US official told Reuters that it was the first time that the G20 had recognised that the WTO was ""currently falling short of meeting its objectives"" and needed reform. China v the US: Not just a trade war Erdogan demands Khashoggi extraditions On Friday Mr Trump briefly met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20, a Russian official told Reuters. Earlier the US president said he had postponed a planned press conference ""out of respect for the Bush family"", following the death of former President George HW Bush, at the age of 94. Earlier on in the summit, emerging economies denounced protectionism. Trump talks tough on China before G20 US-China trade row: What has happened so far?

Minister quits over 'naive' Brexit deal,"Mr Gyimah said he would be voting against Mrs May's Brexit deal A minister has resigned saying a row over involvement in the EU's Galileo satellite-navigation system shows the UK will be ""hammered"" in negotiations over a Brexit deal. Science and universities minister Sam Gyimah quit after Mrs May said the UK was pulling out of Galileo. The UK wanted to stay part of it but the EU said it would be banned from extra-secure elements of the project. Mr Gyimah said it was a foretaste of the ""brutal negotiations"" to come. He's the 10th member of government to resign over the agreement, which he dismissed as a ""deal in name only"". He said he intended to vote against the deal negotiated with Brussels, and called for another referendum. The UK's interests ""will be repeatedly and permanently hammered by the EU27 for many years to come"", Mr Gyimah said in aFacebook post setting out his reasons for resigning,external. However, prominent Brexiteer and cabinet minister Michael Gove has defended Mrs May's plan,writing in the Daily Mail that leaving the EU is under ""great threat"" if the deal is rejected by MPs,external. Japan's prime minister told Mrs May to avoid a no-deal Brexit Meanwhile, Mrs May is in Argentina, where she met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for talks on the fringes of the G20 summit on Saturday. He asked her to avoid a no-deal Brexit -  major Japanese companies such as Nissan and Honda are concerned about the possible impact on their supply chains across Europe. She told him she was confident Japanese businesses in the UK would continue to trade well with the EU. Mrs May also held talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Galileo is the EU's upcoming version of the US's GPS, which is used by millions of people around the world, and will be used by EU governments, citizens, military and industry. Brussels has said that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will not be allowed immediate access to part of the system intended for use by government agencies, the armed forces and emergency responders once it comes online in 2020. But the UK, which has invested â¬1.4bn (Â£1.24bn) in the project, says access is vital to its military and security interests. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? A dilemma for the People's Vote campaign Mr Gyimah told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""What has happened with Galileo is a foretaste of the brutal negotiations we will go through that will weaken our national interests, make us poorer and less secure."" Mrs May has now said the British army will not use Galileo and the UK will instead explore options to build its own satellite-navigation system -having already set aside Â£92mto look at how it can be done. ""I cannot let our armed services depend on a system we cannot be sure of,"" Mrs May said. ""That would not be in our national interest."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor As Theresa May was sitting down to at a glittering evening with her fellow world leaders at the G20, news broke that Sam Gyimah had just become the latest minister to quit over Brexit. He had a specific reason to leave. But it is his overall verdict on Mrs May's Brexit compromise that will really hurt. There is some comfort overnight for Mrs May from Michael Gove, who as one of the leading voices in the Leave campaign is, belatedly perhaps, urging his Brexiteer colleagues to get onboard. But this latest resignation is another sign of how hard it will be for the prime minister to pass the vote that could define her future. Read more from Laura here Mr Gyimah, who voted for Remain in the referendum, said it was the right decision for Mrs May to leave the Galileo project, saying the negotiations had been ""stacked against us from the very beginning"". The MP for East Surrey said that, as minister with the responsibility for space technology, he had seen ""the EU stack the deck against us time and time again"". The European Union has put together Galileo as its own network of satellites He told Today: ""Looking at the deal in detail, we don't actually have a deal. We have a deal in name only. ""We have given up our voice, our veto and our vote. Our interests will be hammered because we will have no leverage."" He urged Mrs May not to rule out another referendum if she loses the 11 December vote. ""If Parliament was in deadlock, Theresa May could get herself out of that deadlock by backing a second referendum,"" he said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""another very dangerous moment"" for the prime minister - as she is not just losing another vote, but also because others may share his concerns and choose to quit too. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said he was ""very sad"" to see Mr Gyimah leave the government and that he had been ""a very good minister"". ""All of my colleagues are going to have to make their own judgment about what they think about this deal,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said that Mrs May's deal should not be compared with an idealised version of Brexit. Former Tory cabinet minister and campaigner for a second referendum Justine Greening said Mr Gyimah was a ""highly respected and capable minister"" and praised him for not ruling out another vote. And the Lib Dem's education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said Mr Gyimah had ""seen at close quarters the devastating effect this botched Brexit will have on these important sectors"" and that his exit showed the government was ""falling apart"". Matt Waddup, of the University and College Union, said his resignation showed there were clear concerns about the impact of Brexit on research and innovation and higher and further education. ""Those concerns are shared by our members in colleges and universities who have clearly signalled that they want a referendum on any final deal,"" he added. Galileo satellites are now launching on Europe's premier rocket, the Ariane 5 Many people's sat-navs and mobile location services currently run on a US military-based system called GPS - global positioning system - which uses satellites to pinpoint our locations. China and Russia also have satellite-navigation positioning systems. In 1999, the European Union embarked on a plan to put together its own network of satellites, called Galileo, so it was not reliant on the US, Russian and Chinese systems. The first satellites were put into orbit in 2013 and it is planned to be fully operational in 2020 with 30 satellites orbiting earth. UK companies have built components for Galileo and one of the project's two Galileo Security Monitoring Centres was based in the UK, in Swanwick. The site is now being relocated to Spain. The government said there should be no noticeable impact for the public from withdrawing from the project, as devices that already use Galileo, such as smartphones, will carry on doing so. It says UK industry has earned about â¬1.15bn (Â£1.02bn) from the project but, when the BBC asked if any more money would be given back, a spokesman said the project was ""part of the withdrawal agreement"" and the UK had reached ""a fair financial settlement with the EU"".

He has had difficult relations with the Bush family and did not attend Barbara Bush's funeral. But he is due to speak to George Bush Jr today.

The US flag has been lowered to half staff at the White House. Bush Sr's single presidential term in office was dominated by foreign policy - the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He was instrumental in building the international military coalition that forced Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. A life in pictures George HW Bush: The war years Bush became president after serving two terms as vice-president to Ronald Reagan, but he suffered the ignominy of becoming a single-term president - defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election amid a weakening economy. His famous 1988 campaign promise - ""Read my lips. No new taxes"" - came back to haunt him when he felt compelled to reverse policy.

Such a course, Mr Bush said later, would have 'incurred incalculable human and political costs â¦ We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq.' Which is exactly what his son, George W Bush, a less cautious man, set out to do 12 years later - with disastrous results."" Fox News,external: ""Although occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence - such as referring to a focus on the larger picture as 'the vision thing' - Bush's comments also could be endearingly frank. Referring to his dislike for a particular vegetable, he once said, 'I do not like broccoli. And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I'm President of the United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli.'""

Both men signed the first Start treaty in 1991, which led to big cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. ""He was a genuine partner,"" Mr Gorbachev said. While the White House said Wednesday would be a day of mourning, its statement did not make clear whether the funeral was to be held on the same day. Announcing Mr Trump's attendance, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckerbee Sanders released a statement saying: ""A state funeral is being arranged with all of the accompanying support and honours."" It will take place at the National Cathedral in Washington. A lying in state in Washington is thought likely, followed by burial at the presidential library in Texas alongside Barbara Bush. The last state funeral for a former president was that of Gerald Ford, which began on 30 December 2006 with a lying in state and service at the US Capitol. Further services were held at the Washington National Cathedral on 2 January 2007 and the following day in Grand Rapids, Michigan, his boyhood home.

"Riot police clash with Paris protesters'Yellow vest' protesters lit fires, torched cars and looted shops as they opposed a new fuel tax.Europe","This video can not be played Tear gas filled the streets around the Arc de Triomphe Protesters have scaled the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris, as clashes with riot police continued during a third weekend of ""yellow vest"" rallies. Police fired tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon on the Champs-ElysÃ©es, while masked protesters hurled projectiles and set buildings on fire. At least 110 people were injured, including 17 members of the security forces, and 270 arrests were made. Protests over fuel tax have grown into general anger at higher living costs. President Emmanuel Macron says his fuel policies are needed to combat global warming. One person was in a critical condition after protesters pulled down an iron gate at the Tuileries garden near the Louvre museum, which fell on several people. An assault rifle was also stolen from a police vehicle although it was unclear if it was loaded, AFP news agency quotes a police source as saying. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The French interior ministry said at least 75,000 people had turned out across France for the latest ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) rallies - so called because the protesters donned the high-vis vest required to be carried in every vehicle by law. Nearly 190 fires were put out and six buildings were set ablaze, the interior ministry said. By Hugh Schofield, Paris It is quite clear there were agitators or ""casseurs"" at the sharp end of the clashes with police. We saw groups of people both from the anarchist far left and from the nationalist far right. They were tooled up and ready for a fight. The vast majority of ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vests) who came to Paris to protest were not in that category. There were many who were happy to look on, jeering police and providing moral encouragement to the front lines. And then there were the crowds who hung back - genuinely wanting nothing to do with the trouble. Inevitably even these people agreed it was the police who had started it all, by wanton use of tear gas. The numbers were small, just a few thousand. But across the country the cause is extremely popular. They say - quite proudly - that they are the ""sans-dents"", the great unwashed, the forgotten majority from the sticks. And they've had enough.

Responding to the day's events from the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Mr Macron said the protests ""had absolutely nothing to do with a peaceful demonstration of a legitimate unhappiness or discontent."" He said those responsible did not want change, but instead intended to ""wreak chaos"". ""No cause justifies that authorities are attacked, that businesses are plundered, that passers-by or journalists are threatened or that the Arc de Triomphe is defiled,"" he added. At least 110 people were injured Earlier this week,Mr Macron tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying he was open to ideas about how the fuel tax could be applied. But his speech does not appear to have gone far enough in assuaging people of the view that he is out of touch with ordinary people. The Health Minister said the protests had been taken over by ""extremist groups"" Dramatic protests took place over several hours in French capital. One building was set on fire on a major avenue near the Arc de Triomphe and protesters stole an assault rifle from a police vehicle in the centre of the city. Department stores and metro stations were closed as a result of the violence. But protesters insisted the movement was peaceful. ""It's a mess because we don't have a leader,"" Dan Lodi, 68, told AFP. ""You always have some idiots who come to fight, but they don't represent us at all,"" he said. Among the peaceful demonstrators, who held up slogans such as ""Macron, stop treating us like idiots"", there were those hiding their faces with masks and goggles. A number of officers, wearing protective gear and helmets, were spattered with vivid yellow paint Police fired tear gas, a water cannon and stun grenades to disperse those who were trying to tear down the barricades. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who visited the scene, tweeted that there were ""1,500 agitators,externaloutside the security perimeter who came to fight"". He called the protests""an insult to the republic"",external. The movement has grown via social media to encompass rising anger at high taxes and living costs, and broader criticism of President Macron's economic policies. It has supporters across the political spectrum, from far left to far right, although Mr Macron has accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. A sign on the Arc de Triomphe reads ""The yellow vests will triumph"" Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Our correspondent says that because the movement has grown via social media, it does not have an identifiable leadership or a coherent demand. What it does have, he says, is a lot of co-ordination via Facebook and a lot of support from the public. Nearly 300,000 people took part in the first country-wide demonstration, on 17 November. Most demonstrators have remained peaceful, although more than 200 people were injured, several seriously. One person died when they were struck by a panicked driver and a motorcyclist was killed a few days later, when they were hit by a van making a sudden turn in the traffic chaos. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. Who are France's 'yellow vests'?

"Fallen Madonna sells for ÃÂ£15k at auctionThe ""masterpiece"" was bought by a man from Nouvion in France, where 'Allo 'Allo was supposedly set.Bristol","The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies was supposedly painted by fictional artist Van Clomp A portrait made famous in the BBC sitcom 'Allo 'Allo has been sold for Â£15,000. The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies, by fictional artist Van Clomp, was a running joke in the show, which ran between 1982 and 1992. The infamous prop was previously sold in 2007 for Â£4,000 to a private buyer. Auctioneer Andy Stowe, said the latest buyer was from Nouvion in France where the series was set so ""it was going home"". The priceless but elusive masterpiece was the centrepiece to every episode of the classic sitcom. Stolen and relentlessly pursued by the Germans, the artwork was rolled into German sausages, shoved down trouser legs and singed by an exploding gilded frame intended as a gift for Adolf Hitler. Described as ""a rare and important piece of British sitcom history"" the prop was one of the few copies of the picture to have survived all nine series of the show. 'Allo 'Allo was set in German-occupied France during World War Two The portrait by fictional artist Van Clomp sold for Â£15,000 Mr Stowe, from East Bristol Auction House in Hanham, said: ""I've been overwhelmed by the amount of interest. ""And Â£15,000 for a TV prop is just fantastic.  It's sold for more than most real artworks go for - there are Old Masters that can't get that amount."" Set in a cafÃ© in Nouvion in German-occupied France during World War Two, 'Allo 'Allo poked fun at the Gestapo, French Resistance and the British. Mr Stowe said: ""We had 25 bidders from all over the world but it was a chap from Nouvion in France, the place where the show was set, that got it... ""It's the best result, the painting is effectively going home."" The painting had an estimate of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000.

Trump and Xi to meet amid trade tensions,"Mr Trump (front right) met Mr Xi (front left) after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to halt new trade tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks, the US says. At a post-G20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires, Mr Trump agreed not to boost tariffs on $200bn (Â£157bn) of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on 1 January. China will buy a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, industrial and energy products, the US says. Meanwhile, Beijing says the two sides agreed to open up their markets. The Trump and Xi deal: A temporary truce It was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since a trade war erupted earlier this year. The dispute broke out after Mr Trump complained China was doing nothing to cut its large surplus in bilateral trade. At the summit in Argentina's capital earlier on Saturday, the G20 leaders agreeda joint declaration that notes divisions over trade,externalbut does not criticise protectionism. Mr Trump and Mr Xi held a ""highly successful meeting"",the White House says in a statement.,external It says the US tariffs on Chinese goods will remain unchanged for 90 days, but warns: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods The US says China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", the White House says. President Trump said earlier this year he wanted to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". According to the US, China has also signalled it will allow a tie-up between two major semiconductor manufacturers which Chinese regulators have been blocking. The White House statement said China was ""open to approving the previously unapproved Qualcomm-NXP deal"". Qualcomm - the world's biggest chipmaker - had abandoned its $44bn bid for Dutch rival NXPSemiconductors after Chinese opposition. The US also says Beijing agreed to designate Fentanyl as a controlled substance. The opioid - much of it thought to be made in China - is driving a huge rise in drug addiction in the US. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". He hailed ""new space for win-win co-operation"", while Chinese state TV said negotiations would continue. US-China trade war in 300 words Both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. The US has hit $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. Mr Trump had also said that if talks in Argentina were unsuccessful, he would carry out a threat to hit the remaining $267bn of annual Chinese exports to the US with tariffs of between 10 and 25%. US-China trade divisions meantan Asian economic summit earlier this month was unable to agree a formal leaders' statementfor the first time in its history. Returning from the G20 summit on Air Force One, Mr Trump told reporters ""it's an incredible deal"" that would have an ""incredibly positive impact on farming"". ""What I'd be doing is holding back on tariffs. China will be opening up. China will be getting rid of tariffs,"" Mr Trump said. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing China has pretty much given up nothing in this deal because the future tariffs threatened from the Beijing side were retaliatory in nature and only to be applied if the United State escalated. For this it has gained a 90-day reprieve, during which time both sides have pledged to ramp up talks. When China's Foreign Minster Wang Yi spoke to reporters after the meeting he said the two leaders had agreed to open up each other's markets and that this process could lead to the resolution of ""legitimate"" US concerns. This was either an acknowledgment that Washington does have legitimate concerns or a way of differentiating those American concerns which are reasonable from those which are not actually ""legitimate"". This is not a suspension of the trade war but a suspension of the escalation of the trade war. Big questions remain about the preparedness of Beijing to allow international access to this enormous market to a level that would satisfy the Trump administration prompting a complete halt in the trade war. On other issues, the US president announced he would be ""formally terminating Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement] shortly"". Mr Trump (C) earlier signed a new trade agreement on Friday with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts This would give lawmakers six months, he said, to approve a new trade deal agreed with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday or revert to trade rules from before 1994, when Nafta took effect. Trump expects second Kim summit soon Trump claims progress after Kim summit He also said he was likely to meet North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un in January or February and three locations for their second meeting were being considered. Mr Trump added that he would also invite Mr Kim, with whom he has ""a good relationship"", to the US at some point. French leader Emmanuel Macron told reporters that the World Trade Organization, the body that regulates trade disputes, needed to be modernised. A senior US official told Reuters that it was the first time that the G20 had recognised that the WTO was ""currently falling short of meeting its objectives"" and needed reform. China v the US: Not just a trade war Erdogan demands Khashoggi extraditions On Friday Mr Trump briefly met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20, a Russian official told Reuters. Earlier the US president said he had postponed a planned press conference ""out of respect for the Bush family"", following the death of former President George HW Bush, at the age of 94. Earlier on in the summit, emerging economies denounced protectionism. Trump talks tough on China before G20 US-China trade row: What has happened so far?

Premier League: Southampton v Man Utd,"Armstrong scores third in goal in two games for Saints Cedric curls in free-kick to double lead Lukaku scores first Man Utd goal since 15 Sept Herrera flicks in at near post to bring Utd level Alex Bysouth Southampton 2-2 Manchester United So Manchester United host Arsenal on Wednesday at Old Trafford looking to close the gap on the top four, while Southampton visit Tottenham at Wembley looking to climb out of the bottom three. A point here wasn't the greatest outcome for either side, but who will leave St Mary's the happier? ReadTom Rostance's report here to make your own mind up. Anyway, I'm off to dream about curling a free-kick in the top bins a la Cedric Soares. Thanks for joining us, and don't forget to tune into Match of the Day tonight. Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Southampton More from Southampton boss Mark Hughes, speaking to Match of the Day:""When you look at our performance and the table, we are not where we want to be. Are we under-performing compared to last year? Probably not. ""We have to get maximum points in games, everybody saw by the manner of our performance that we are a good side, we just have to keep working and performing."" Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Manchester United Interesting this from Jose Mourinho about over-complicating things in midfield... wonder who's getting an earful for that in the changing room this evening? ""We lost so many balls in midfield and in our transition to the last third it was difficult to have that continuity,"" he told BT Sport. ""What we did so well in the end of the first half was connect the attacking players by playing simple, accelerating the play. ""When the players don't understand simplicity is genius, it is difficult to have that continuity. ""Choices, when they have the ball, what we needed to improve was to play one-touch, two-touch, make it simple, make it arrive fast for the attacking players. ""By losing too many balls in midfield we broke the dynamic that usually leads to goals."" Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Manchester United Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera, speaking to Match of the Day:""It's two points dropped, but apart from that we can build from what we did after they scored the second goal. ""We did the most difficult thing in football, we came back and drew the game but we didn't win it. ""Half time came at the wrong moment for us, but that's not an excuse, we should have won the game. We want to be in the top four and at the moment we are far from it. ""We should forget right now about the table, we should try to win every game. That's how we will reach the top four. We should approach the Arsenal game like a final."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) A Chelsea win and united are 8 points off the top 4. At this stage of the season is a disgrace. If Woodward and the board don't sack Mourinho they clearly don't care about the club. Dean Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Manchester United And here's Mourinho on which players might return for the Arsenal game at Old Trafford on Wednesday:""I don't know. Victor Lindelof is an important injury. Alexis Sanchez is an important injury. Ashley Young is suspended. If Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly are ready - if they are ready to train tomorrow it wouldnât be a surprise."" Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Manchester United More from Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho:""We lost easy balls in the transition to attacking areas making it more difficult for our attackers against a line of five defenders. ""Iâm always confident but always doubtful at the same time because we donât start well many times. Today we had a reason for the fragility. Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic, were out of position, and Phil Jones had to step up, and in my opinion he played really well. ""To have more continuity in our attacking waves you cannot lose the ball so many times."" On Marcus Rashford:""Iâm pleased with Marcus Rashford even without that (scoring). His work rate was amazing, he was doing things that others have to do, working out wide and trying to give solutions in midfield. ""The only thing that was missing was a goal but I can only praise him for his desire and respect for the shirt."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Time to go Jose... Jose clearly isn't right manager for Man Utd and will not make club better. Boring & dull football, players definitely not playing for manager for a long time. Above all I would not let Jose to spend many more millions in January transfer market. Ed Woodward make right choice for club. Gio Southampton 2-2 Man Utd Manchester United Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""I think the result is quite fair in spite of the fact we were
more dominant in the game. They had a better start than us. We were in trouble, organising a defensive line with only one centre-back, we tried to protect that weakness
with playing three instead of two central defenders. ""It worked quite well, the goals we conceded were a direct free-kick and a
good shot. But we needed to lose less balls in midfield and if you do that you
have more continuity in attack."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Credit to Southampton, I'm sure I wasn't the only one that thought once United drew level with so much time left in the game, they'd go on to throw it away Chris - a Grimsby fan: Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Southampton And what did Mark Hughes think about Cedric Soares' free-kick? ""I was a bit worried!"" said the Saints boss. ""He practices in training and his conversion rate isn't as great as some others! But fair play to him."" Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Southampton Southamton boss Mark Hughes speaking to BT Sport:""We have to view it as a positive, we have been playing well for a number of weeks. ""Unfortunately when you do not get the results people expect sometimes you don't get the credit. ""We had opportunities to nip things in the bud, clear our lines and track runners - as a consequence they were able to get back into the game ""Second half we restricted United to a few free kicks, there was not a lot of momentum generated by United, that's credit to us. ""Overall I am really pleased. It's a positive point against a good team and we will build on that."" Spanish La Liga Real Madrid, now down to seventh place in La Liga, are hosting Valencia in La Liga, kick-off 19:45 GMT. Follow live text commentary of that bad boy here. Southampton 2-2 Man Utd Southampton Southampton winger Nathan Redmond speaking to BT Sport:""At 2-0 up we had a foothold, weâve been working hard in training on different tactics and formations and we stuck with this one from
midweek but we're kicking ourselves that we couldnât manage the game better. ""We started really well, on the front foot which is what we wanted to do. We have to learn from these things and build. We wanted to impose ourselves and
fight, we knew that if we didnât we wouldnât have the space to play. ""Weâve got great belief. We take the good and bad and move
on from that."" Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Stick with us for all the reaction from St Mary's. No water bottle-throwing from Jose Mourinho today, but then there was no last-minute winner. In fact, United only had one shot on target in the second half. Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Encouraging, in spells, from Southampton, but I make that 12 points they have now dropped from winning positions in the Premier League this season. Would be in the top half if they'd held on to those... #bbcfootball or text 81111 Jeremiah Kariuki:This is shamefully unbelievable! But Man Utd don't fail to frustrate. Next team to play with Southampton will be hammering them to prove the Red Devils standards have fallen down completely. London Money:Another two points dropped against a very poor team . Come on Southampton sort yourselves out ! Mr Lamide:Mourinho keeps saying we could be in the top 4 by the end of the year. As things look, we could be in the bottom half by Christmas. I wonder how long the board will let this go on. Week in week out, we're being humiliated (esp by rival fans). Help! Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Manchester United return to seventh, Southampton climb to 18th and one point from safety. Reckon Mark Hughes will feel they could have won that. Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Now Stuart Armstrong clatters into Ashley Young, eighth yellow card of the game, and the Manchester United captain will have a chance to deliver into the box. It's headed away. And that's the full-time whistle. A point apiece. Cracking first half, pretty drab second to be honest. Southampton 2-2 Manchester United Manolo Gabbiadini fancies it... That's well over, and a groan goes out around St Mary's. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Radio station pulls Baby It's Cold Outside,"The song was recorded for the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter and won an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1950 It's a Christmas classic probably being played in shops and radio stations all over the world. But a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio has decided to remove Baby It's Cold Outside from its playlist following complaints from listeners. Local media report that listeners said the song was inappropriate and at odds with the #MeToo movement. But a poll on the station's Facebook page showed a majority of respondents did not want the song banned. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Is Baby It's Cold Outside creepy or empowering? What's the secret to the perfect Christmas ad? Banned Iceland ad 'too political' The tune takes the form of a back-and-forth conversation where a man tries to persuade his female guest not to risk the journey home in bad weather, but to have another drink and spend the night with him instead. Normally performed as a duet between a man and a woman, it features lyrics such as: ""I simply must go (But baby it's cold outside) The answer is no (But baby it's cold outside)."" Another line, ""Say what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)"", is perhaps one of the most controversial, andhas been interpreted by some as a reference to date rape.,external Others, such as comedian Jen Kirkman, have pointed out that the phrase had a different meaning the the 1930s, and that the song was more complex than it might appear on the surface.

Fallen Madonna sells for Â£15k at auction,"The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies was supposedly painted by fictional artist Van Clomp A portrait made famous in the BBC sitcom 'Allo 'Allo has been sold for Â£15,000. The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies, by fictional artist Van Clomp, was a running joke in the show, which ran between 1982 and 1992. The infamous prop was previously sold in 2007 for Â£4,000 to a private buyer. Auctioneer Andy Stowe, said the latest buyer was from Nouvion in France where the series was set so ""it was going home"". The priceless but elusive masterpiece was the centrepiece to every episode of the classic sitcom. Stolen and relentlessly pursued by the Germans, the artwork was rolled into German sausages, shoved down trouser legs and singed by an exploding gilded frame intended as a gift for Adolf Hitler. Described as ""a rare and important piece of British sitcom history"" the prop was one of the few copies of the picture to have survived all nine series of the show. 'Allo 'Allo was set in German-occupied France during World War Two The portrait by fictional artist Van Clomp sold for Â£15,000 Mr Stowe, from East Bristol Auction House in Hanham, said: ""I've been overwhelmed by the amount of interest. ""And Â£15,000 for a TV prop is just fantastic.  It's sold for more than most real artworks go for - there are Old Masters that can't get that amount."" Set in a cafÃ© in Nouvion in German-occupied France during World War Two, 'Allo 'Allo poked fun at the Gestapo, French Resistance and the British. Mr Stowe said: ""We had 25 bidders from all over the world but it was a chap from Nouvion in France, the place where the show was set, that got it... ""It's the best result, the painting is effectively going home."" The painting had an estimate of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000.

PM seeks to reassure world leaders on Brexit,"This video can not be played Asked about the legacy she'd like to leave as PM, Mrs May says there's ""a lot more for me still to do"". Theresa May has sought to reassure world leaders that her Brexit deal is ""good for the global economy"". The PM was speaking at the G20 summit in Argentina, where she has met leaders for talks on trade deals after Brexit. She said they were ""keen"" to sign free trade agreements and wanted certainty, which she pledged her deal would bring. Asked about her legacy as PM, she said there was ""a lot more for me still to do, not least being the prime minister that does take the UK out of the EU"". The G20, which this year holds its summit in Buenos Aires, is made up of the 19 of the world's most industrialised nations, plus the European Union. It accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population. Trump and Xi to meet amid trade tensions Brexit: A really simple guide Another referendum 'may be PM's only option' ""For the first time in more than four decades, the UK will have an independent trade policy,"" she told reporters at a press conference. ""That this deal sets a path for the UK to a brighter future has been affirmed by the discussions I've had on trade over the past two days with friends and partners making clear that they are keen to sign and implement ambitious free trade agreements as soon as possible."" The summit came as another government minister,Sam Gyimah, resignedover Mrs May's Brexit deal, saying he would vote against it when the agreement goes before Parliament on 11 December. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many other Tory MPs have said they will also vote against it. Mrs May also said she had raised the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi during her meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Asked about the situation back in the UK, Mrs May said: ""The next nine days are a really important time for our country leading up to the vote on this deal. ""I will be talking with members of Parliament obviously and explaining to them why I believe this is a good deal for the UK. ""Why it is a deal that delivers on Brexit but it is also a deal that protects jobs and the economy and why passing this deal in the vote that takes place in the House of the Commons will take us to certainty for the future, and that failure to do that would only lead to uncertainty. ""What I've been hearing here at the G20 is the importance of that certainty for the future."" Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google The Brexit deal has already been agreed between the EU and UK. If MPs reject the deal, a number of things could happen - including leaving with no deal, an attempt to renegotiate or a general election. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Asked if this might be her last overseas trip, the prime minister insisted ""there's a lot more for me to do"". A senior member of the government told me not only would she not have discussions about losing the vote - only about how to win it -  but that those who believed that Theresa May would quit if her deal fell were misreading her. They said that she would ""not go until she was forced to go"" and, contrary to some of the speculation in Westminster, even a heavy defeat for her plan would not automatically see her depart. Of course, many of her critics - and the opposition parties - would beg to differ. Read more from Laura here Mrs May held one-to-one talks with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Japan, Turkey and Chile. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, urged her to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Major Japanese companies such as Nissan - which employs 7,000 people at Britain's biggest car factory in Sunderland - and Honda are concerned about the possible impact on their supply chains across Europe. Japan's prime minister told Mrs May to avoid a no-deal Brexit She said told him she was confident Japanese businesses in the UK would continue to trade well with the EU. Mrs May also held talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who praised her ""great determination on one of the most vexed issues I think there is"". The prime minister was also quizzed about her meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - who she shook hands with - on Friday. She did not say whether she had confronted him directly over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul in October. ""What I said to the Crown Prince yesterday was the importance of a full, credible and transparent investigation that identifies those who were involved and the importance of ensuring that those who were involved are held to account,"" she said. ""That is the message we have consistently given since the terrible murder of Jamal Khashoggi and it is a message we will continue to give.""

Another referendum 'may be PM's only option',"Mr Gyimah said he would be voting against Mrs May's Brexit deal The minister who resigned over Theresa May's Brexit strategy says another referendum may be the only option if MPs reject the deal. Science and universities minister Sam Gyimah quit after Mrs May pulled the UK out of the EU's Galileo sat-nav system, following a row with Brussels. He said the decision showed the UK will be ""hammered"" in Brexit talks. Mr Gyimah is the 10th person to resign over Mrs May's Brexit agreement. He said he intends to vote against it. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""another very dangerous moment"" for the prime minister as it meant not only that she had lost another vote for her deal, but also that others might share Mr Gyimah's concerns and quit her government as well. ""Mr Gyimah's departure shows it is not just Brexiteers who are unhappy and feel her deal ties us too closely to the EU for good - but also Remainers who are worried the deal is an unsavoury halfway house,"" she said. MPs will vote on the Brexit agreement - which has already been agreed between the UK and EU - on 11 December. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against it. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? A dilemma for the People's Vote campaign Speaking on the Today programme on Saturday, Mr Gyimah - who voted Remain - said: ""Looking at the deal in detail, we don't actually have a deal. We have a deal in name only. ""We have given up our voice, our veto and our vote. Our interests will be hammered because we will have no leverage."" He urged Mrs May not to rule out another referendum if she loses the 11 December vote. ""If Parliament was in deadlock, Theresa May could get herself out of that deadlock by backing a second referendum,"" he said. Tory MP Mr Gyimah's resignation was announced on Friday night, shortly after Mrs May said the UK was pulling out of Galileo, which is Europe's version of GPS and due to be fully operational in 2020. The UK wanted to stay part of it but the EU said it would be banned from extra-secure elements of the project. Europe's Galileo: Britain's blast-off Why is there a row about Galileo? Mr Gyimah said what happened with Galileo was a foretaste of the ""brutal negotiations"". In aFacebook post setting out his reasons for resigning,external, Mr Gyimah said the UK's interests ""will be repeatedly and permanently hammered by the EU27 for many years to come"". However, prominent Brexiteer and cabinet minister Michael Gove has defended Mrs May's plan,writing in the Daily Mail that leaving the EU is under ""great threat"" if the deal is rejected by MPs,external. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor As Theresa May was sitting down to at a glittering evening with her fellow world leaders at the G20, news broke that Sam Gyimah had just become the latest minister to quit over Brexit. He had a specific reason to leave. But it is his overall verdict on Mrs May's Brexit compromise that will really hurt. There is some comfort overnight for Mrs May from Michael Gove, who as one of the leading voices in the Leave campaign is, belatedly perhaps, urging his Brexiteer colleagues to get on board. But this latest resignation is another sign of how hard it will be for the prime minister to pass the vote that could define her future. Read more from Laura here Meanwhile, Mrs May is in Argentina, where she met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for talks on the fringes of the G20 summit on Saturday. He asked her to avoid a no-deal Brexit as major Japanese companies like Nissan and Honda are concerned about the possible impact on their supply chains across Europe. Japan's prime minister told Mrs May to avoid a no-deal Brexit She told him she was confident Japanese businesses in the UK would continue to trade well with the EU. Mrs May also held talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said he was ""very sad"" to see Mr Gyimah leave the government and that he had been ""a very good minister"". ""All of my colleagues are going to have to make their own judgment about what they think about this deal,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said that Mrs May's deal should not be compared with an idealised version of Brexit. Former Tory cabinet minister and campaigner for a second referendum, Justine Greening, said Mr Gyimah was a ""highly respected and capable minister"" and praised him for not ruling out another vote. And the Lib Dem's education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said Mr Gyimah's exit showed the government was ""falling apart"", and that he had ""seen at close quarters the devastating effect this botched Brexit will have on these important sectors"". Please upgrade your browser Matt Waddup, head of policy and campaigns at the University and College Union, said: ""This latest resignation shows that there are clear concerns about the impact of Brexit on research and innovation as well as upon higher and further education itself.

Bodies found in search for missing couple,"Susan and James Kenneavy have not been seen at home or been in contact with family Police searching for a couple missing after their car was found washed up on a beach have found two bodies. James and Susan Kenneavy's empty vehicle was found by workmen clearing debris on Drummore beach, near Stranraer, on Thursday morning. Police said they were called after a woman's body was found at the edge of the water in Port William, near Newton Stewart, at 08:15 on Saturday. The body of a man was discovered nearby at 08:45. Search on hold after car washes up on beach A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: ""Although formal identification has still to take place, it is believed to be the missing couple and their next of kin has been informed. ""A full report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. Our thoughts are with their family at this time."" Port William is on the opposite side of Luce Bay to Drummore, where the Kenneavy's car was found. The discovery of the couple's empty Ford Kuga followed heavy rain and flooding on Drummore coastal road on Wednesday. The couple, thought to be in their 70s, had not been seen at home in Drummore and had not been in contact with family. Search teams worked into the night on Thursday looking for the couple - and air, sea and land searches took place on Friday. The efforts had involved local lifeboats, Galloway Mountain Rescue Team and the Coastguard and Rescue 936 search helicopter. Drummore coastal road was closed on Wednesday due to heavy rain and flooding Local people said conditions on the coastal route could be extremely treacherous, and large storm waves could affect the main road into the village. On Friday villager Edward Beck toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that local people were aware of weather and flood warnings. He added: ""You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. ""That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."" Speaking to the BBC Scotland website, he paid tribute to Mr Kenneavy, who moved to Drummore from East Kilbride. ""He was always smartly dressed whenever he went out, in collar and tie,"" he said. ""He was very humorous, smart, clever - a witty man. No matter what he was going through he always brought cheer to people's faces. He would make people smile. ""He was loads of fun."" A search into the night on Thursday failed to find any trace of Mr and Mrs Kenneavy The missing couple's neighbours, George Gregory and Lynne Copland, said they were well known in the small village. Mr Gregory said: ""I have been here more than 20 years now and Jim lived here when I first came here and he was just one of the local characters, I guess. A nice friendly fellow. A very nice couple."" Ms Copland said the incident had been a ""shock to the system"". She added: ""They were a lovely couple. If you met either of them outside in the street, they would stand and talk to you for as long as you wanted. They were a really, really nice couple.""

What do we know about HS2?,"HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof The HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and Manchester will be scrapped, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Another part of the route, between the East Midlands and Leeds,has already been cancelled. Instead, Â£36bn funding will be put into alternative transport projects, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. That has been pared down to a high-speed link between Birmingham and London. It is aimed at cutting journey times, creating more space on the rail network and more jobs outside London. But HS2 has faced delays, spiralling costs and cuts. HS2 was meant to connectLondonwithBirmingham,ManchesterandLeeds. Lots of work has been done on the section linking London and Birmingham. Butthe government scrapped the Leeds leg in 2021,external. It decided to upgrade existing routes for HS2 trains, instead of building new ones. In June, the government said it would still build HS2 from London Euston to Manchester and the East Midlands. However,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said recently that costs were getting ""totally out of control"". Now, thealready-delayedBirmingham to Manchester leg has been cancelled. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link to connect HS2 and the West Coast Main Line in Cheshire and Greater Manchesterhad already been scrapped. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, Mr Sunak said the latest decision would save Â£36bn, which would be used instead in ""hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country"". This will include road and rail schemes. HS2 will now eventually run from London to Birmingham Interchange, with branches to central Birmingham and Handsacre, near Lichfield. HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre. The government previously said HS2 would cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, to 52 minutes. Before the link was scrapped, HS2 was projected to take an hour off Manchester to London journeys - from just over two hours to just over one hour. HS2 trains will still run to Manchester, and journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham and London by up to 30 minutes, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was originally meant to reach Euston in central London, although demolition work was paused due to rising costs. The government said it would ""get a grip"" on plans for the station's ""unaffordable designs"". It has already cut the number of planned platforms for high-speed trains from 11 to six. But if cash is not put forward by private investorsthen the high-speed line will only run from Birmingham to Old Oak Commonin London's western suburbs. It is unclear whether the same capacity across the line will be needed now the HS2 line to Manchester has been discarded. The cost of the project, the biggest of its kind in Europe, has grown. The first estimate in 2010 was for about Â£33bn. The government's most recent official estimate was about Â£71bn in 2019 prices. But this included Â£26bn for Birmingham to Manchester, which will now not be built. The government is currently updating its cost estimates. About Â£24.7bn had been spent on HS2 as of February 2023. This includes at least Â£22.5bn on Phase 1 and Â£2.3bn on Phase 2, including on the purchase of more than 400 properties between Birmingham and Manchester. HS2: Six reasons why the rail route is so expensive HS2 was due to open by 2026. Under current plans, HS2 trains would carry their first passengers between Old Oak Common and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033. Timescales for when Euston will open have yet to be announced. The government has announced the ""Network North"" scheme, with Â£36bn redirected from HS2 to road and rail projects. This will allow the objectives of the previous ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" project to be met, it said. ""Network North"" plans including upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull and Leeds. In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham recently said scrapping the Manchester link ""rips the heart"" out of Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the government said Northern Powerhouse Rail, including high speed rail links, will be delivered ""as previously planned"". Big decisions await as HS2 row simmers on What is levelling up and who is it helping? Mr Sunak diverting money from HS2 to road schemes ""shows how little he really cares about tackling air pollution, traffic and cutting carbon emissions"", Greenpeace says. Previously the HS2 project said it could provide ""zero carbon rail travel"" and create new wildlife habitats along its route. But environmental campaigners and conservation organisations had objected, saying it would destroy irreplaceable natural habitats. How much?

Spending watchdog to probe Crossrail delay,"The National Audit Office (NAO) probe is planned for early 2019 The delay to Crossrail's opening and the project's ballooning costs will be investigated by the spending watchdog. Transport officials said in August that the new rail line, which isalmost Â£600m over budget, wouldopen nine months after its scheduled launch. A National Audit Office (NAO) probe is now planned for early 2019. The project's joint sponsors, Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport (DfT), said they would assist the NAO's investigation. The NAO will examine the ""causes of the cost increases and schedule delays, the terms of the additional funding, and the governance and oversight of the programme"", according toa statement on its website,external. Europe's biggest infrastructure project aims to help ease London's congestion by connecting sites such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. The route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, was due to open in December, but will now be launched in autumn 2019 to allow more time for testing. The DfT and TfL have also commissioned independent reviews into Crossrail Ltd's governance and financing The government announced in July that Crossrail's overall funding had increased to Â£15.4bn, and the DfT later agreed to make Â£350m of short-term finance available. The NAO added: ""We will also examine the steps being taken by Crossrail Ltd, TfL, and the department to minimise the impact of the cost increases and delays."" A DfT spokesperson said: ""We welcome the NAO investigation and stand ready to assist."" The DfT and TfL have also commissioned independent reviews into Crossrail Ltd's governance and financing. which are being carried out by auditors KPMG. Transport bosses said in September that TfL wouldmiss out on Â£20m of new revenuedue to the delay, but the total cost of the delay could be far higher.

Crossrail running Â£600m over budget,"Crossrail will be called the Elizabeth Line when it opens at the end of 2018 London's Crossrail project is running almost Â£600m over budget with extra funding required to complete the work, the rail minister has announced. Jo Johnson revealed the scheme's budget had increased from Â£14.8bn to Â£15.4bn in hisannual update about the project.,external Mr Johnson said ""cost pressures"" had risen but additional finance will be provided by the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL). Crossrail is due to open in December. A spokesperson for the project said that while the cost increases were ""disappointing"" the extra funding ""is critical to the delivery of this vital project"". Crossrail's original budget was set at Â£15.9bn in 2007 but cut to Â£14.8bn in 2010 The DfT and TfL are each providing Â£150m of additional funding to complete construction of the scheme. An extra Â£290m will also be paid by the DfT and Network Rail to upgrade the existing rail network linked to the project. In his statement, Mr Johnson said the project was 93% complete and was entering ""the critical testing and commissioning stage"". He said in spite of the extra funding, more than 60% of the project had been provided by Londoners and London businesses. TfL said the the railway had ""involved some of the most complex engineering ever undertaken in Europe"" and ""a number of factors"" made the additional funding necessary. A spokesperson for the DfT said Crossrail would add ""up to Â£42bn to the UK economy"" and the final budget was still ""significantly below the original funding package of Â£15.9bn."" Jo Johnson said the project was 93% complete However, think tank IPPR North said the announcement about the increased funding will be ""poorly received by people in the north... who are yet to see the investment that we need."" Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram claimed the increase in Crossrail's budget could fund ""a significant amount of a new west to east rail line to Manchester."" Groups in the north have previously spoken of their ""widespread anger"" following the government'sbacking of Crossrail 2. When it opens in December, Crossrail trains will operate on three routes before the line fully opens at the end of 2019.

New bank check could hit online shoppers,"As millions start their Christmas shopping online, there's a warning that consumers may need to have a mobile phone, and a decent signal, to make sure their transactions go through. UK banks are starting to introduce a new layer of security, involving passwords sent to your mobile phone. That could be a problem for hundreds of thousands of householders without a mobile, or no proper signal. Now banks are being urged to find other ways to check a customer's identity. The new rules are part of an EU directive - already adopted by the UK - which is due to come into force by September 2019. But critics say many people are likely to be inconvenienced. ""Banks are not yet great at looking after people at the margins - because they're disabled, or because they live with no mobile coverage,"" said James Daley, the managing director of Fairer Finance. ""These systems are designed for the 95% - while the remaining 5% are hung out to dry."" If online shoppers spend more than about Â£27 (â¬30 under the EU directive) in one transaction, payment providers will be required to ask for an extra form of verification, usually sent as a one-time password by text to your mobile phone. The same will apply once you have spent Â£90 in total on a particular card - or if you make five separate payments of Â£27. Further exemptions are also possible - if a retailer decides that your purchase is low risk, for example. In addition, if your bank can prove to the regulator that it has a good record on fraud, it can allow exemptions on payments worth up to about Â£450 (â¬500). Open banking revolution begins This is not yet clear. One bank the BBC spoke to advised customers to find another means of payment, such as PayPal. UK Finance - the umbrella body for the industry - has told its members that they need to find other ways of verifying their customers' identities, such as by phoning them on their landline, or by using biometric data. This could be via a finger-print on the bank's app, for example. And, while it is inconvenient and time-consuming, customers can always phone their bank to get a one-off approval for a particular transaction. Banks are working hard to make things easier for customers. They are also under pressure from retailers, who don't want anything to interrupt the online buying process. As one senior executive put it: ""there's a lot of angst"" in the industry, as firms try to get things running smoothly by 14 September 2019. There is also concern that the banks have not yet done enough to communicate the changes to customers. One bank that has started sending passwords to mobiles is First Direct. It advised anyone having difficulties to get in touch with them. ""We do have alternative processes for customers who cannot use this method, and they may be required to call us to authenticate,"" a spokesperson said. Part two of thePayment Services Directive,external(PSD2) - which also introduced the concept of open banking to EU member states - is designed to combat fraud. The new rules are officially known as ""Strong Customer Authentication"". But banks are having to balance anti-fraud measures with the ease of buying goods online. ""These changes are aimed at further enhancing payment security and reducing fraud,"" a spokesperson for UK Finance told the BBC. ""The requirements will include exemptions for low-risk and low-value transactions to help prevent any unnecessary inconvenience for customers.""

Bush Sr served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, his term defined by the end of the Cold War and the first Iraq war against Saddam Hussein. While his health had been failing in recent years, he still managed to make public appearances. The former president died at 22:10 local time on Friday (04:10 GMT Saturday), a family spokesperson said. In April,he was admitted to hospitalwith a blood infection but had since been discharged.

President Trump will be attending the funeral in Washington, the White House said, and Wednesday 5 December has been designated a day of national mourning. He has had difficult relations with the Bush family and did not attend Barbara Bush's funeral. But he is due to speak to George Bush Jr today. In one of dozens of tributes from former and current world leaders, Mr Trump praised,externalBush's ""essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family and country."" The US flag has been lowered to half staff at the White House. Bush Sr's single presidential term in office was dominated by foreign policy - the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He was instrumental in building the international military coalition that forced Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. A life in pictures George HW Bush: The war years Bush became president after serving two terms as vice-president to Ronald Reagan, but he suffered the ignominy of becoming a single-term president - defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election amid a weakening economy. His famous 1988 campaign promise - ""Read my lips. No new taxes"" - came back to haunt him when he felt compelled to reverse policy. Bush enjoying some downtime on the Kennebunk River in 1990 Bush entered politics in 1964 after starting a Texan oil business and becoming a millionaire by the age of 40. During World War Two, he was an aviator before being shot down by the Japanese in September 1944 while on a bombing raid. Following his honourable discharge from the navy in 1945, Bush married then 18-year-old Barbara Pierce. Their marriage would last 73 years and they would have six children together. This video can not be played Jeb Bush, delivering his mother's eulogy, remembered the love between his parents In later life, his character came under scrutiny whenhe was accused of groping a number of women at public events. A statement issued by his spokesman after a recent incident said he would never ""intentionally cause anyone distress"". New York Times,external: ""Some critics have said that Mr Hussein would not have been so bold as to invade Kuwait had Washington not shamelessly cultivated him over the years; others faulted Mr Bush for not pushing Mr Hussein all the way back to Baghdad and removing him from power. Such a course, Mr Bush said later, would have 'incurred incalculable human and political costs â¦ We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq.' Which is exactly what his son, George W Bush, a less cautious man, set out to do 12 years later - with disastrous results."" Fox News,external: ""Although occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence - such as referring to a focus on the larger picture as 'the vision thing' - Bush's comments also could be endearingly frank. Referring to his dislike for a particular vegetable, he once said, 'I do not like broccoli. And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I'm President of the United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli.'"" This video can not be played Ex-UK PM John Major: Bush Sr ""raised America's standing in the world"" UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that ""in navigating a peaceful end to the Cold War he made the world a safer place for generations to come"" Former UK PM John Major said he was ""privileged to have worked"" with George HW Bush Queen Elizabeth said he was ""a great friend and ally"" of the United Kingdom Bill Clinton said he and Hillary gave ""thanks for his great long life of service, love and friendship"", adding: ""I am grateful for every minute I spent with him and will always hold our friendship as one of my life's greatest gifts"" Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev hailed Bush's contribution to ending the Cold War and reducing nuclear weapons. Both men signed the first Start treaty in 1991, which led to big cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. ""He was a genuine partner,"" Mr Gorbachev said. While the White House said Wednesday would be a day of mourning, its statement did not make clear whether the funeral was to be held on the same day. Announcing Mr Trump's attendance, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckerbee Sanders released a statement saying: ""A state funeral is being arranged with all of the accompanying support and honours."" It will take place at the National Cathedral in Washington. A lying in state in Washington is thought likely, followed by burial at the presidential library in Texas alongside Barbara Bush. The last state funeral for a former president was that of Gerald Ford, which began on 30 December 2006 with a lying in state and service at the US Capitol. Further services were held at the Washington National Cathedral on 2 January 2007 and the following day in Grand Rapids, Michigan, his boyhood home. The US flag was flown at half mast on official buildings for 30 days.

Mum's kindness calendar after stillbirth,"Jenny Whatling at 40 weeks pregnant with Jude - a week before they found out he would be stillborn A mother of a stillborn son has made an advent calendar encouraging children to carry out daily acts of kindness. Jenny Whatling's son Jude was stillborn at 41 weeks in May at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital after what she said was a ""textbook pregnancy"". She said she thought up the calendars to help keep her busy ""within my grief"" and raise money for the hospital. The Random Acts of Kindness calendars have so far raised Â£4,000 towards a new Â£35,000 bereavement suite. Mrs Whatling, 30, from Harleston, Norfolk, said the success of the advent calendars - which include ideas like donating to a food bank or hiding nice messages - was ""really bittersweet"" because ""I wish I didn't have the time to do this"". The ""precious"" memory box of Jude who was stillborn at 41 weeks ""It's difficult to explain but after a loss, you have a lot of unexpected time on your hands,"" she said. ""A person missing from everything that you planned to do. All of these weeks and months I should have been busy with Jude. ""It's nice to think of Jude's name being all over the world, and people doing acts of kindness in his memory."" The calendars come as 25 small brown numbered envelopes, which include a challenge aimed at primary school-aged children for every day in December. Mrs Whatling said the success of the 800 calendars - which sold out more than a week ago - had been unexpected. ""Everyone has jumped on board with the kindness aspect of it,"" she said. ""One lady said she hadn't been looking forward to Christmas because she had lost her dad a couple of years ago. Now she and the children are looking forward to something positive to do."" Each envelope has an idea for a different random act of kindness such as hiding a nice message for someone to find The hospital's new bereavement suite would give families a private space to mourn, unlike Mrs Whatling, who was kept on a normal delivery suite. ""Walking out, around people who are preparing to take their babies home, is really awful,"" she said. ""We just want to make that part of people's life a little bit more bearable.""

President Trump will be attending the funeral in Washington, the White House said, and Wednesday 5 December has been designated a day of national mourning. He has had difficult relations with the Bush family and did not attend Barbara Bush's funeral. But he is due to speak to George Bush Jr today. In one of dozens of tributes from former and current world leaders, Mr Trump praised,externalBush's ""essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family and country."" The US flag has been lowered to half staff at the White House. Bush Sr's single presidential term in office was dominated by foreign policy - the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He was instrumental in building the international military coalition that forced Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. A life in pictures George HW Bush: The war years Bush became president after serving two terms as vice-president to Ronald Reagan, but he suffered the ignominy of becoming a single-term president - defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election amid a weakening economy. His famous 1988 campaign promise - ""Read my lips. No new taxes"" - came back to haunt him when he felt compelled to reverse policy. Bush enjoying some downtime on the Kennebunk River in 1990 Bush entered politics in 1964 after starting a Texan oil business and becoming a millionaire by the age of 40. During World War Two, he was an aviator before being shot down by the Japanese in September 1944 while on a bombing raid. Following his honourable discharge from the navy in 1945, Bush married then 18-year-old Barbara Pierce. Their marriage would last 73 years and they would have six children together.

A statement issued by his spokesman after a recent incident said he would never ""intentionally cause anyone distress"". New York Times,external: ""Some critics have said that Mr Hussein would not have been so bold as to invade Kuwait had Washington not shamelessly cultivated him over the years; others faulted Mr Bush for not pushing Mr Hussein all the way back to Baghdad and removing him from power. Such a course, Mr Bush said later, would have 'incurred incalculable human and political costs â¦ We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq.' Which is exactly what his son, George W Bush, a less cautious man, set out to do 12 years later - with disastrous results."" Fox News,external: ""Although occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence - such as referring to a focus on the larger picture as 'the vision thing' - Bush's comments also could be endearingly frank. Referring to his dislike for a particular vegetable, he once said, 'I do not like broccoli. And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I'm President of the United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli.'"" This video can not be played Ex-UK PM John Major: Bush Sr ""raised America's standing in the world"" UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that ""in navigating a peaceful end to the Cold War he made the world a safer place for generations to come"" Former UK PM John Major said he was ""privileged to have worked"" with George HW Bush Queen Elizabeth said he was ""a great friend and ally"" of the United Kingdom Bill Clinton said he and Hillary gave ""thanks for his great long life of service, love and friendship"", adding: ""I am grateful for every minute I spent with him and will always hold our friendship as one of my life's greatest gifts"" Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev hailed Bush's contribution to ending the Cold War and reducing nuclear weapons. Both men signed the first Start treaty in 1991, which led to big cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. ""He was a genuine partner,"" Mr Gorbachev said. While the White House said Wednesday would be a day of mourning, its statement did not make clear whether the funeral was to be held on the same day. Announcing Mr Trump's attendance, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckerbee Sanders released a statement saying: ""A state funeral is being arranged with all of the accompanying support and honours."" It will take place at the National Cathedral in Washington. A lying in state in Washington is thought likely, followed by burial at the presidential library in Texas alongside Barbara Bush. The last state funeral for a former president was that of Gerald Ford, which began on 30 December 2006 with a lying in state and service at the US Capitol. Further services were held at the Washington National Cathedral on 2 January 2007 and the following day in Grand Rapids, Michigan, his boyhood home. The US flag was flown at half mast on official buildings for 30 days.

Bodies found in search for missing coupleA car belonging to Susan and James Kenneavy was found on a shore near Stranraer on Thursday.South Scotland,"Susan and James Kenneavy have not been seen at home or been in contact with family Police searching for a couple missing after their car was found washed up on a beach have found two bodies. James and Susan Kenneavy's empty vehicle was found by workmen clearing debris on Drummore beach, near Stranraer, on Thursday morning. Police said they were called after a woman's body was found at the edge of the water in Port William, near Newton Stewart, at 08:15 on Saturday. The body of a man was discovered nearby at 08:45. Search on hold after car washes up on beach A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: ""Although formal identification has still to take place, it is believed to be the missing couple and their next of kin has been informed. ""A full report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. Our thoughts are with their family at this time."" Port William is on the opposite side of Luce Bay to Drummore, where the Kenneavy's car was found. The discovery of the couple's empty Ford Kuga followed heavy rain and flooding on Drummore coastal road on Wednesday. The couple, thought to be in their 70s, had not been seen at home in Drummore and had not been in contact with family. Search teams worked into the night on Thursday looking for the couple - and air, sea and land searches took place on Friday. The efforts had involved local lifeboats, Galloway Mountain Rescue Team and the Coastguard and Rescue 936 search helicopter. Drummore coastal road was closed on Wednesday due to heavy rain and flooding Local people said conditions on the coastal route could be extremely treacherous, and large storm waves could affect the main road into the village. On Friday villager Edward Beck toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that local people were aware of weather and flood warnings. He added: ""You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. ""That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."" Speaking to the BBC Scotland website, he paid tribute to Mr Kenneavy, who moved to Drummore from East Kilbride. ""He was always smartly dressed whenever he went out, in collar and tie,"" he said. ""He was very humorous, smart, clever - a witty man. No matter what he was going through he always brought cheer to people's faces. He would make people smile. ""He was loads of fun."" A search into the night on Thursday failed to find any trace of Mr and Mrs Kenneavy The missing couple's neighbours, George Gregory and Lynne Copland, said they were well known in the small village. Mr Gregory said: ""I have been here more than 20 years now and Jim lived here when I first came here and he was just one of the local characters, I guess. A nice friendly fellow. A very nice couple."" Ms Copland said the incident had been a ""shock to the system"". She added: ""They were a lovely couple. If you met either of them outside in the street, they would stand and talk to you for as long as you wanted. They were a really, really nice couple.""

HS2 chairman expects to be sacked,"Sir Terry Morgan in September 2017, when Crossrail's Elizabeth line track was completed The chairman of the HS2 rail programme, Britain's biggest infrastructure project, has told BBC News he expects to be sacked in the coming days. Sir Terry Morgan, who took up the role only four months ago, has also been involved in London's Crossrail project for the past decade. Speaking to PM on Radio 4 he said there was disappointment at Westminster about the delays affecting Crossrail. HS2 is the government's Â£55.7bn planned high-speed rail network. It will connect London to Birmingham and to Manchester and Leeds. Critics of the project say it will damage the environment and is too expensive. Crossrail, which is London's Â£15bn project connecting landmarks like Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf, is delayed and is due toopen nine months afterits scheduled launch. It is alsoalmost Â£600mover budget. What do we know about HS2? Spending watchdog to probe Crossrail delay Crossrail running Â£600m over budget Asked why he thought he was being forced out, Sir Terry said: ""I can only assume that because HS2 is such a critically important programme and with the sense of disappointment around the performance of Crossrail, that it was considered to be too risky for a programme like HS2 to continue in my role as chairman."" He said he had ""mixed feelings"" - including a ""sense of responsibility or contribution to the position in terms of Crossrail"". And he said he was ""disappointed"" that he no longer had the opportunity to give his experience and knowledge to HS2. He said HS2 is a ""fantastic programme that has huge potential"" - but it will be a big challenge to deliver it. But it did not have the ""same difficulties"" as completing the Crossrail work, he added. Sir Terry said he was confident that Crossrail - which is funded by the Department for Transport and Transport for London - ""behaved properly"". ""Although the station build did run a little late, what most people don't realise is the rolling stock, the trains, are not a Crossrail contract, they're a Transport for London contract,"" he said. ""I'm not responsible for rolling stock and nor are any of the executives. I personally now realise that TfL were advised that this train contract was running 18 months late and they have known that for at least eight months and that to me today still feels to be the case."" The BBC's business correspondent Joe Miller, said Sir Terry - who first learnt about his impending dismissal via leaks to the Financial Times - had angered London's mayor Sadiq Khan over the Crossrail project. Sir Terry meets the Queen, during her visit to the site of Crossrail's new Bond Street station in 2016 Following the report in the FT, the leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, Manuel Cortes, said ""it was always nuts to have one person responsible for heading up both these enormous infrastructure projects."" Sir Terry started work at HS2 in August. Phase one, linking London to Birmingham, is due to open in December 2026, while the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds open by 2032-33. The Crossrail route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, was due to open in December, but will now be launched in autumn 2019 to allow more time for testing. Responding to Sir Terry saying he has not formally heard of his dismissal, a Department for Transport spokesman said: ""We do not comment on personnel matters"" The department added: ""The Crossrail board took the decision to delay the opening on Wednesday 29 August and informed the Secretary of State of that decision on 30 August."" A spokesperson for the Mayor of London - who has asked Transport for London (TfL) for an independent review of Crossrail's governance - said Mr Khan ""has been clear that he discussed rising cost and schedule pressures with Crossrail over the summer, including looking at the implications if these issues weren't resolved"". They added: ""Furthermore, the mayor has been open with Government about his concerns in relation to Crossrail governance for months, given the way that it became apparent that the work remaining was much more significant than he had previously been advised ""It was not until the end of August that the mayor, TfL and the DfT were told that the opening of the central section would definitely be delayed until Autumn 2019 - something the mayor has not hidden his anger and disappointment about.""

GalleryGeorge HW Bush: Life in pictures,"As a bona fide war hero and son of a statesman, George HW Bush had impeccable credentials for a career in politics. He made his first foray into national politics in the 1960s, when he won a seat in the House of Representatives. His wife, Barbara, was rather more liberal than her husband in her own politics but campaigned hard for him. His rise was rapid and after serving in various diplomatic posts under President Richard Nixon, he was made director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1976 by President Gerald Ford. He attempted to gain the Republican nomination for president in 1980, but was beaten by Ronald Reagan. He served as vice-president throughout the 1980s. His career as a political insider culminated in his victory in the 1988 presidential election, and it was Reagan who finally handed him the reins of power. His most notable successes during his time in office were in the field of foreign policy. Some analysts credit him with restoring international standing to the US and healing the wounds of the Vietnam War. As communism collapsed across Central and Eastern Europe, he oversaw warming relations with the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev. His predecessor, Ronald Reagan, had described Russia as ""evil empire"". His foreign policy was ultimately defined by the first Gulf War, which ended in a morale-boosting victory over Iraq. But his 1992 presidential campaign was derailed by his domestic policies, including a now-infamous U-turn on taxes. He eventually lost to Bill Clinton. The Bush political dynasty continued long after George HW Bush left office. His son, George W Bush, was elected president in 2000 and served two terms. George Bush Sr continued to play an active role in US public life, and was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2011. In April 2018, former US First Lady Barbara Bush died at the age of 92. The couple had been married for more than 70 years. The 93-year-old former president fell ill the day after his wife's funeral in Houston, Texas, where he had posed for a picture with three former US Presidents and First Ladies - Laura Bush, George W Bush, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. US First Lady Melania Trump was also in the picture, but US President Donald Trump decided against attending the invite-only service.

Obituary: George HW Bush,"The inauguration of George HW Bush as president in January 1989 was the culmination of a career built on privilege: a series of political promotions ending at the White House. The 41st president of the United States had previously served eight years as vice-president to Ronald Reagan and was the first serving vice-president for more than 150 years to be elected to the highest office. His term in office was defined by his foreign policy at a time when communism was collapsing in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the USSR left the US as the world's only superpower. His policies helped restore the credibility of the US in the rest of the world and lay to rest the ghost of the intervention in Vietnam. But he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and, after reneging on a campaign promise not to increase taxes, he was defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. â¢1966:Wins seat in House of Representatives â¢1971:Nixon installs him as UN ambassador â¢1974:Heads newly established mission in Beijing â¢1976:Ford makes him CIA director â¢1981-1989:Ronald Reagan's vice-president â¢1989-1993:President of the US; leads US into first Gulf War; copes with collapse of communism in Eastern Bloc George Herbert Walker Bush was born on 12 June 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of an investment banker who later became a US senator. He volunteered for the US Navy after Pearl Harbor. He trained as an aviator before being assigned duties in the Pacific where he saw action against the Japanese during World War Two. Just 18, he may well have been America's youngest flying officer, assigned to pilot torpedo bombers off aircraft carriers. He was shot down in September 1944 while on a bombing raid. His plane filled with smoke and flames swallowed both wings. ""My God,"" he recalled thinking, ""This thing's going to blow up."" He continued to pilot the aircraft, dropping his bombs on their target. He ordered his two fellow crew members to parachute out of the plane but neither man survived. Choking on the smoke, Bush followed his crew - smashing his head on the tail of the plane as the wind propelled him backwards. He was picked up by a US submarine after his plane was shot down in the Pacific. 'Welcome aboard, sir,' said the torpedo man who hauled him from the water. 'Happy to be aboard,' replied the future commander-in-chief. He made it into a tiny life-raft and began paddling away from the nearby Japanese island with his hands. Incredibly, a US submarine rose to the surface right next to him and his rescue was even captured on camera. Following his honourable discharge from the navy in 1945, Bush married 18-year-old Barbara Pierce. Their marriage would last 72 years and they would have six children together. Their first son, the future president George Walker Bush, was born a year later. Bush had been offered a place at Yale prior to his enlistment in the navy, and he took it up in 1945, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Only weeks after returning from the Pacific, Bush married Barbara Pierce. 'I married the first man I ever kissed,' the future First Lady recalled. 'When I tell my children that they just about throw up.' Bush and his family then moved to Texas where, with the use of his father's business connections, he got a job in the oil industry. By the age of 40, he was a millionaire. He and Barbara suffered the trauma of losing their first daughter to leukaemia.  Robin was taken to the doctor suffering from tiredness and the awful diagnosis was completely unexpected. Two future presidents - George H W Bush holding aloft his baby son, George junior The family was shattered by her death a few months later.  When Barbara Bush herself died, 65 years later, the family posted a touching note. ""Give Robin a hug from us, Mom,"" it said. George's professional interest had turned to politics. After serving as the chairman of a local branch of the Republican Party he took a major step, seeking and winning the Republican nomination for the US Senate seat for Texas. The Democratic incumbent successfully branded Bush as a right-wing extremist, gaining 56% of the vote to Bush's 43%. Undaunted, Bush successfully stood for the House of Representatives in 1966, where he served for two terms. President Richard Nixon persuaded Bush to try for the Senate again in 1970 but, again, he was defeated by the Democratic candidate. Instead, Nixon appointed him US ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and then Republican Party chairman. When Nixon was forced to resign 1974, Bush did his best to heal some of the wounds left by Watergate, touring the country in support of Republican candidates. At the end of the year he went to Beijing as head of the new US mission there. As Republican National Chairman in 1973 with then Vice-president Gerald Ford After just over a year in China, President Gerald Ford brought him home to take charge of the Central Intelligence Agency, which had been rocked by a series of scandals relating to covert operations abroad and unauthorised spying on US citizens. The posting coincided with a deterioration in Barbara's mental health. She wrote in her biography that she would have to pull her car up on the side of the road for fear of steering into a tree, or on-coming traffic.  The dark feelings eventually passed. Bush left the CIA after Ford left office and, in 1978, began campaigning for the Republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election. He travelled the country, preaching his brand of moderate conservatism and, by the beginning of 1980, had emerged as the main challenger to Ronald Reagan. But he entered the presidential fray only to find that his privileged past could be a political liability. ""What's wrong with excellence?"" he said at the time. ""What's wrong with having a good education? What's wrong with having excelled in my life and business or being a good ambassador in China or the United Nations, or having done an excellent job at the CIA? I have. I know that sounds a little immodest, but that's my record."" A cabinet meeting in the family quarters of the White House. From left to right: James Baker, Edwin Meese, Vice-President George Bush, Reagan and Caspar Weinberger, secretary of defence Defeated by Reagan there was, once again, a consolation: a ticket to the White House as Reagan's deputy and eight years of training for the top job itself. In the 1988 race which delivered George HW Bush to the presidency, he made two fundamental misjudgements. The first was his choice of vice-presidential candidate: Dan Quayle, a little-known senator from Indiana, who gained international fame through a series of gaffes. The second was in a speech Bush made at the 1988 Republican National Convention. During an attack on the fiscal policy of his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, Bush made a pledge that was to haunt his presidency and ultimately bring about his political downfall. ""Read my lips,"" he told the assembled delegates. ""No new taxes."" After one of the most acrimonious election campaigns in US history, Bush became the first serving vice-president to be elected to the top job since Martin van Buren in 1836. It was a time of momentous change which saw the the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of the Soviet empire. George H W Bush came to the presidency at a time of great global change. 'A new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over,' he declared on the steps of the Capitol ""A new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over,"" he declared on the steps of the Capitol. His true test came in August 1990 when the US was caught off-guard by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Bush moved quickly to build an international coalition to end Saddam Hussein's occupation and establish a US military toehold in Saudi Arabia, a valuable strategic dividend. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, George HW Bush faced his greatest foreign policy dilemma. When he decided to delay military action in order to get approval from the UN, Margaret Thatcher famously warned him that ""this is no time to go wobbly"". He delayed military action in order to give time to secure UN approval for the action.  The decision led to a famous rebuke from Margaret Thatcher. 'Well, all right, George, but this is no time to go wobbly,"" said the Iron Lady in a middle-of-the-night phone call from Downing Street. The subsequent battle proved to be a triumph for American military expertise and a major boost for the nation's morale. In the defining moment of Bush's presidency, the US and its allies swept across the desert in a ground war lasting just 100 hours. The 1991 Gulf war was one of the biggest tests of his presidency. The ground war lasted 100 hours but Saddam Hussein remained in power The victory boosted the president's standing despite the fact that US and allied forces stopped well short of Baghdad, allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It would be left to the president's son to topple the Iraqi dictator. Despite achieving popularity ratings of 90%, Bush's decision to concentrate on foreign affairs led to accusations that he was ignoring the worsening economic situation at home, most notably, the longest-lasting recession since World War Two. Hamstrung by a Democratic-controlled Congress, President Bush insisted that the worst was over economically. ""We are going to lift this nation out of hard times,"" he pledged, ""Inch-by-inch and day-by-day and those who would stop us had better step aside."" But the country would not believe him. To make matters worse he did the one thing he had promised he would never do: he raised taxes. The 1992 election was a disaster. He was let down by a poorly run campaign and had to fight off a strong challenge from the conservative Pat Buchanan for the Republican nomination. Bush could not match the energy of his opponent, the young Democratic governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, who conveyed a new vision for America that Bush admitted he simply could not express. The image that summed it all up came on a trade trip to Japan that ended in dismal failure when the president fainted after vomiting at a banquet laid on by his hosts. Bush went down to a landslide defeat. His later years were spent touring the world in his role as elder statesman. Though delighted to see George W Bush enter the White House, relations between the two men were said to be somewhat strained. Relations between the two Bush presidents were said to have sometimes been strained Bush celebrated his 90th birthday in June 2014 by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. But he began to make fewer public appearances and was forced to use a wheelchair after developing a form of Parkinson's which meant he could no longer use his legs. A series of women accused him of acting inappropriately towards them at various times in the past.  A spokesman, Jim McGrath, acknowledged that Mr Bush had ""on occasionâ¦ patted women's rears in what he intended to be in a good-natured manner"".  The former president denied groping anyone but let it be known he apologised to anyone he might have offended. He also lost Barbara - his wartime bride - after more than seven decades of marriage. Her funeral was attended by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - although President Trump stayed away. George HW Bush at the funeral of his wife Barbara, surrounded by former presidents and first ladies As president, he proved himself an efficient chief executive - more of a manager than inspiring leader. His public image suffered because of his Ivy League background and many voters saw him as lacking a common touch. His foreign policy was successful in the handling of the invasion of Kuwait and the fall of communism.  His domestic agenda will be less well applauded - with critics complaining he came across as a somewhat confused president with a shaky grasp of economics. And personally, George Herbert Walker Bush will be remembered as, essentially, a cultured family man, uncomfortable with the rough and tumble of politics. ""Because you run against each other that doesn't mean you're enemies,"" he once said. ""Politics doesn't have to be uncivil and nasty.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsHS2 chairman expects to be sackedHS2 rail chairman Sir Terry Morgan tells BBC he expects to be sacked within days, months after getting jobUK","Sir Terry Morgan in September 2017, when Crossrail's Elizabeth line track was completed The chairman of the HS2 rail programme, Britain's biggest infrastructure project, has told BBC News he expects to be sacked in the coming days. Sir Terry Morgan, who took up the role only four months ago, has also been involved in London's Crossrail project for the past decade. Speaking to PM on Radio 4 he said there was disappointment at Westminster about the delays affecting Crossrail. HS2 is the government's Â£55.7bn planned high-speed rail network. It will connect London to Birmingham and to Manchester and Leeds. Critics of the project say it will damage the environment and is too expensive. Crossrail, which is London's Â£15bn project connecting landmarks like Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf, is delayed and is due toopen nine months afterits scheduled launch. It is alsoalmost Â£600mover budget. What do we know about HS2? Spending watchdog to probe Crossrail delay Crossrail running Â£600m over budget Asked why he thought he was being forced out, Sir Terry said: ""I can only assume that because HS2 is such a critically important programme and with the sense of disappointment around the performance of Crossrail, that it was considered to be too risky for a programme like HS2 to continue in my role as chairman."" He said he had ""mixed feelings"" - including a ""sense of responsibility or contribution to the position in terms of Crossrail"". And he said he was ""disappointed"" that he no longer had the opportunity to give his experience and knowledge to HS2. He said HS2 is a ""fantastic programme that has huge potential"" - but it will be a big challenge to deliver it. But it did not have the ""same difficulties"" as completing the Crossrail work, he added. Sir Terry said he was confident that Crossrail - which is funded by the Department for Transport and Transport for London - ""behaved properly"". ""Although the station build did run a little late, what most people don't realise is the rolling stock, the trains, are not a Crossrail contract, they're a Transport for London contract,"" he said. ""I'm not responsible for rolling stock and nor are any of the executives. I personally now realise that TfL were advised that this train contract was running 18 months late and they have known that for at least eight months and that to me today still feels to be the case."" The BBC's business correspondent Joe Miller, said Sir Terry - who first learnt about his impending dismissal via leaks to the Financial Times - had angered London's mayor Sadiq Khan over the Crossrail project. Sir Terry meets the Queen, during her visit to the site of Crossrail's new Bond Street station in 2016 Following the report in the FT, the leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, Manuel Cortes, said ""it was always nuts to have one person responsible for heading up both these enormous infrastructure projects."" Sir Terry started work at HS2 in August. Phase one, linking London to Birmingham, is due to open in December 2026, while the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds open by 2032-33. The Crossrail route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, was due to open in December, but will now be launched in autumn 2019 to allow more time for testing. Responding to Sir Terry saying he has not formally heard of his dismissal, a Department for Transport spokesman said: ""We do not comment on personnel matters"" The department added: ""The Crossrail board took the decision to delay the opening on Wednesday 29 August and informed the Secretary of State of that decision on 30 August."" A spokesperson for the Mayor of London - who has asked Transport for London (TfL) for an independent review of Crossrail's governance - said Mr Khan ""has been clear that he discussed rising cost and schedule pressures with Crossrail over the summer, including looking at the implications if these issues weren't resolved"". They added: ""Furthermore, the mayor has been open with Government about his concerns in relation to Crossrail governance for months, given the way that it became apparent that the work remaining was much more significant than he had previously been advised ""It was not until the end of August that the mayor, TfL and the DfT were told that the opening of the central section would definitely be delayed until Autumn 2019 - something the mayor has not hidden his anger and disappointment about."" What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

Major quake rocks Alaska's biggest cityA 7.0 magnitude earthquake causes people to run from buildings and prompted a tsunami alert.US & Canada,"This video can not be played 7.0 magnitude earthquake strikes Alaska A major 7.0 magnitude earthquake has struck Alaska, causing people to run from buildings and briefly prompting a tsunami alert for coastal areas. The quake was centred about seven miles (11km) north of Anchorage, the largest city in the state, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). A series of aftershocks was recorded following the initial shock, which had a depth of 40.9km, the USGS said. Around 300,000 people live in Anchorage with 100,000 in the surrounding area. The earthquake was reported at 08.29 local time (17.29 GMT), the USGS added. One of the more powerful aftershocks that followed minutes later had a magnitude of 5.7. So far, officials have registered 40 aftershocks: 10 with magnitudes above 4.0 and three with magnitudes above 5.0, the Alaska Earthquake Center reported. ""The aftershocks are nerve-wracking, but we want to stress that they are what we would expect for an earthquake like this,"" the centre said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Chinese pair banned for match-fixing,"Yu Delu's highest finish at a ranking event was the semi-finals of the 2016 Scottish Open China's Yu Delu has been banned from snooker for 10 years and nine months after a major match-fixing inquiry. His compatriot Cao Yupeng also pleaded guilty to fixing and was banned for six years, although three and a half years of his sentence are suspended. Suspicious betting patterns in numerous matches were investigated over two years in one of the sport's biggest corruption scandals. Yu has been described as a ""scourge to the game of snooker"". As reported first by the BBC, the pair are the first Chinese players to be banned for cheating. Yu, who manipulated the outcome of five matches over a two-and-a-half-year period, will serve the longest suspension since English player Stephen Lee was given a 12-year ban in 2013. In one match, the stakes placed on the result totalled Â£65,000, which would have generated a profit of Â£86,000. The 31-year-old reached the semi-finals of the 2016 Scottish Open and was ranked 43 in the world when he was charged. Twenty-eight-year-old Cao, who fixed three matches, was runner-up in the Scottish event last year and world number 38 when initially suspended in May. Both players were investigated by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) before an independent tribunal ruled on their cases. The tribunal, chaired by David Casement QC, found that Yu ""engaged in deliberate and premeditated corruption to secure substantial financial gain for his friends/associates and himself."" Yu also admitted lying to the investigator, failing to cooperate with the inquiry and betting on snooker when prohibited from doing so. ""It is very sad when talented players are attracted to the opportunity to make money from fixing matches,"" said WPBSA chairman Jason Ferguson. Cao Yupeng ""expressed his sorrow"" over match-fixing and said he had financial difficulties Yu Delu admitted fixing in five matches: Indian Open qualifiers: WON 4-3 v Martin McCrudden - 12 February 2015 Paul Hunter Classic: LOST 4-1 v Dominic Dale in Germany - 29 August 2015 Welsh Open: WON 4-3 v Ian Glover - 15 February 2016 European Masters qualifiers: LOST 4-1 v Michael Georgiou - 4 August 2017 Shanghai Masters: LOST 5-3 v Kurt Maflin - 15 November 2017 He also failed to report approaches to fix matches, did not cooperate with the investigation and breached rules by betting on snooker. The scandals involved betting on markets in the Far East. Yu won two of the five fixed matches, but had arranged for the correct score to be 4-3 to either player. There is no suggestion any of the opponents were aware of the match-fixing plan. Cao Yupeng admitted fixing in three matches: Welsh Open: LOST 4-1 v Ali Carter - 15 February 2016 Indian Open qualifiers: LOST 4-0 v Stuart Bingham - 30 June 2016 UK Championship: LOST 6-1 v Stephen Maguire - 24 November 2016 Cao also failed to provide material that was requested during the investigation. He told investigators that he received Â£5,000 for each of the matches he fixed and he was initially given an eight-year ban, but this was reduced to six - three and a half of which were suspended - because of his co-operation with the inquiry. ""Cao Yupeng has shown true remorse and he will assist the WPBSA in player education and in its fight against corruption, which is reflected in his reduced sanction,"" said Ferguson. Yu was given a 12-year ban, to match the sanction imposed on Lee five years ago, but this was reduced to 10 years and nine months because of his late guilty plea. Stephen Lee - Where did it all go wrong for shamed snooker player? Jamie Broughton, 5 live snooker reporter These two players are well known in China, and this story will be headline news there. Lengthy bans show that the sport's world governing body, the WPBSA, has the capability and desire to investigate such cases all over the world, and not just in Europe. Sanctions like this send out a clear message to any player tempted to get involved in match fixing that it's not worth the risk of getting caught.

"Rifts laid bare as G20 leaders meetUkraine, climate change, trade and the Khashoggi affair all tax world leaders at the Argentina summit.Latin America & Caribbean","This video can not be played Putin and the Saudi crown prince ""high five"" in Buenos Aires World leaders have held the opening session of their annual G20 summit, with any number of disputes and disagreements on the table. Host president, Argentina's Mauricio Macri, said the solution was ""dialogue, dialogue and dialogue"" and called for a clear message of shared responsibility. But US President Donald Trump has already cancelled meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. And huge differences remain on climate change, trade and the Khashoggi affair. The G20, made up of 19 of the world's most industrialised nations plus the EU, accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population. In pictures: World leaders gather Trump's trade war: Stakes are high at G20 Merkel's travel nightmare Its meetings, which began in 2008, are an opportunity for members to develop global policies tackling major issues - but many of the key decisions will be made in one-on-one encounters. There is massive security for the summit in Buenos Aires, with a bank holiday declared for Friday and the city's main business district shut down. Protesters angry at the money spent on the summit while Argentina struggles through tough austerity demonstrated outside the meeting. Analysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Meeting world leaders at the G20 summit was a test for Mohammed bin Salman to see who would snub him. He is the only Arab leader in the G20 and already stood out in his traditional dress amid a sea of suits. And at times he looked uncertain, even nervous. Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand. So the optics of the summit, to use the diplomatic jargon, were not that great for MBS. Read on The world leaders were all called on to the stage and assumed their position for the traditional family photograph. The G20 photo ahead of Friday's plenary session Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stood on the outside of the photo, far away from Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This is the crown prince's first major diplomatic test since the murder in Turkey of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the government. Saudi Arabia has blamed ""rogue agents"" but suspicion has fallen on the prince for ordering the killing. After the photo was taken, the crown prince did manage a hearty exchange with Mr Putin. French President Emmanuel Macron held a five-minute exchange with the crown prince during which, a French official said, Mr Macron had conveyed ""very firm"" messages over the Khashoggi affair. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr Trump had a ""friendly meeting"" with the crown prince, Saudi media said, although the president later said there had been ""no discussion"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May also met the crown prince. A Downing Street spokesman said the PM had ""stressed the importance of ensuring that those responsible for the appalling murder of Jamal Khashoggi are held to account"" and that ""such a deplorable incident"" should not happen again. In addition Mrs May held a 15-minute meeting to discuss trade with Mr Macri. Their two nations have long disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. Mr Macri's opening address to the summit admitted there would be issues of disagreement that needed to be managed. This video can not be played So how does a G20 summit work? He called for consensus on sustainable development, the future of work, food supply, climate change and international trade, adding: ""I am an optimist"". There are certain to be plenty of bilateral, trilateral or even larger get-togethers, although the one that will not be taking place is the highest-profile. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putinbecause three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors seized by Russia in the Black Sea near Crimea had not been returned. ""We don't like what happened. Nobody does,"" he said on Friday. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow regretted the decision. But he said: ""If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin. The second-highest profile meeting will also involve Mr Trump. He will have dinner on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The key issue there will be the nations' trade tariffs dispute. The US has hit a total of $250bn (Â£196bn) of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. China said consensus was increasing on a deal but that differences remained. After earlier indicating pessimism on an agreement, Mr Trump said: ""They want to and we'd like to. There are some good signs. We'll see what happens."" Mr Putin has also weighed in, with a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First policy. The Russian president condemned ""dishonest competition"" along with ""vicious"" sanctions and protectionist measures. The Brics group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, issued a statement saying protectionism ran counter to the ""spirit and rules of the World Trade Organization"". Ahead of the summit's official startMr Trump signed a trade deal with the Mexican and Canadian leaders. Mr Trump described the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - which replaces the Nafta free trade deal - as ""probably the greatest trade deal ever"". ""All of our countries will benefit greatly,"" he said. European diplomats told Associated Press there has been tough haggling over a final statement. Argentine officials indicated differences on trade could be overcome. However, that will still leave the obstacle of climate change. This video can not be played Why have thousands of demonstrators been marching against the G20 summit in Buenos Aires? Mr Trump has not hidden his objection to collective action on the issue. UN chief Antonio Guterres said in Buenos Aires that ""this is a make-it-or-break-it moment"" on the issue. President Macron was quoted by AFP news agency as saying he would refuse to sign a trade deal with South America's Mercosur bloc if Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro withdrew from the Paris climate accord.

'I got paid less for doing the same work',"Connor McCann works in a BT call centre in Canterbury but despite doing the same role as his colleagues was paid thousands less a year. That's because the 24-year-old was employed by agency Manpower and not BT. ""It didn't matter how good you are at your job, you're still being paid less than your colleagues,"" he said. New research finds the 950,000 UK workers employed through an agency, like Mr McCann, earn more than Â£400 a year less than those employed directly. The Resolution Foundation figure includes wages as well as other benefits such as unclaimed holiday or sick pay, and deductions for uniforms. That's more than the number of people on zero-hours contracts, according to the think-tank. ""I was speaking to the exact same customers and selling the exact same products, so it felt really unfair,"" Mr McCann said. ""It meant I struggled to move out of my family home. I struggled with my bills and my social life, too."" Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Agency work has been largely absent from recent discussions about the modern world of work, despite almost a million people being employed via an agency. ""As well as reforming poor regulation, the government should stamp out unlawful practices through tougher, targeted enforcement work."" The foundation is concerned that many agency staff are unaware of their contract rights, with Â£500m in unpaid holiday pay and 500,000 eligible for pension auto-enrolment who are not signed up to schemes. Its research, which is based on official ONS data, found that agency staff are more likely to be employed in lower wage roles across a wide range of professions. Further, when the Resolution Foundation compared the pay of two similar individuals of the same age and background, working in the same kind of business, those employed by an agency received 22p an hour less than those directly employed. That adds up to Â£422 over the course of a year. Connor McCann works for a BT call centre in Canterbury The think-tank wants contracts - so-called Pay Between Assignment - to be outlawed because they give firms a legal way to avoid equal pay obligations. It also argues that specialist government taskforces should be set up in hotspots such as Barking and Dagenham, Leicester and North East Lincolnshire, where there is a high proportion of agency work. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, which represents the industry, says that agency work is vital to both workers and companies. ""While very short-term temps can be paid differently to long-term employees of a company, the law rightly states that after 12 weeks on the job pay should be the same,"" a spokesperson said. ""With many assignments lasting a few days or weeks, it is no surprise that some pay differences exist when comparing these temps with experienced staff who have an ongoing relationship with the business."" The REC's latest survey data showed two thirds of employers paid agency workers the same or more than permanent staff. A spokesperson for Manpower says the company ""ensures that it is always compliant with appropriate regulations and best practice and welcomes any move by Government to stamp out malpractice in support of temporary workers."" There has been a happy ending for Mr McCann at least. The Communications Union worked with Manpower and BT to bring the team of agency workers in-house, which increased his salary from about Â£15,000 to more than Â£21,000. ""It's the difference between going out to get a coffee or getting a taxi home on a night out, or even going to see family back in Dublin,"" Mr McCann. ""Moving on to a contract meant I could start putting money aside and put more into a pension and think about my long-term future."" Everyone should be paid National Minimum or Living Wage - depending on age All workers are eligible for statutory sick, holiday and maternity or paternity pay Everyone is protected from unlawful deductions from wages and discrimination Everyone is entitled to be enrolled into a pension if they meet the criteria No one should work more than 48 hours a week unless they opt out No one should be charged direct or indirect fees for finding a job No one should be prevented from working elsewhere From day one, agency workers should: Get access to the same facilities such as canteens, crÃ¨che or car parks Be made aware of any job vacancies After 12 weeks, agency workers should: Get the equal pay as a permanent employee Get equal treatment on breaks, holidays and hours Gig workers promised rights crackdown Workers 'exploited' by 'umbrella firms' Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Space Odyssey to launch first 8K TV channel,"2001: A Space Odyssey was released in 1968 Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey helped launch the world's first super-high definition 8K television channel on Saturday. Japanese broadcaster NHK said it had asked Warner Bros to scan the original film negatives in 8K for its new channel. Super-high definition 8K pictures offer 16 times the resolution of HD TV. However, few people currently have the necessary television or equipment to receive the broadcasts. NHK says it has been developing 8K, which it calls super-hi vision, since 1995. As well as improved picture resolution, broadcasts can include 24 channels of audio for immersive surround sound experiences. It is hoping to broadcast the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games using the new format. Television manufacturers including Samsung and LG have announced 8K-capable television sets, but they are still prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption. NHK's new channel BS8K will broadcast programmes for about 12 hours a day. The first programme at 10:00 local time (01:00 GMT) was an information broadcast, highlighting future shows on the channel. The channel also broadcast live from Italy to showcase ""popular tourist attractions from Rome, as well as food, culture and history"". 2001: A Space Odyssey has been remastered NHK said it had chosen to broadcast 2001: A Space Odyssey on its launch night so that viewers could enjoy a ""masterpiece of film history"". Although many movies are shot on 35mm film, 2001: A Space Odyssey was shot on 65mm film, which was the highest quality available at the time. Warner Bros was able to scan the original film negatives, repair scratches and provide an 8K version of the film that captures the ""power and beauty of the original"". ""The many famous scenes become even more vivid, with the attention to detail of director Stanley Kubrick expressed in the exquisite images, creating the feeling of really being on a trip in space, allowing the film to be enjoyed for the first time at home,"" NHK said in a statement. In March, the channel will broadcast My Fair Lady starring Audrey Hepburn, which was also shot on 65mm film. Japanese electronics-maker Sharp began selling its first 8K television in 2015. At launch it cost $133,000 (Â£104,000). Currently, the cheapest Samsung 8K television costs about Â£5,000. Viewers will also need an 8K-capable satellite receiver. Sharp produces one that costs 250,000 yen (Â£1,750; $2,200). It requires four HDMI cables to get the pictures into a Sharp TV set, and another cable for sound. Since 8K televisions and receivers are not yet owned by many people, NHK intends to showcase equipment in venues around Japan. It hopes live events will tempt people to tune in, but will also repeat programmes regularly. ""8K is at the moment based around watching at the time of broadcast,"" it said in a statement. ""We plan to increase the number of chances to watch through rebroadcasts."" ""Content has always been crucial for a new TV technology to take off,"" Joe Cox, editor-in-chief of technology news site What Hi-Fi, told the BBC. ""The launch of the world's first 8K TV channel is great news, even if it is only in Japan. But realistically, mass market adoption is still a long, long way off. ""While the likes of Amazon and Netflix have charged head first into 4K this year, the BBC is only at the trial stage, and others are still struggling to stream HD, so 8K remains a pipedream in the UK. ""But with TV brands suggesting 8K resolution screens can improve 4K and even HD pictures, expect to see plenty more 8K TVs in 2019, even if the content doesn't come so quickly."" 8K TV: Samsung and LG reveal rival screens.

Jolie and Pitt reach custody agreement,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie separated in 2016 Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached an agreement over the custody of their children, according to a lawyer in the case. The couple separated in September 2016 after two years of marriage, with Jolie citing ""irreconcilable differences"" when she filed for divorce. The pair have six children - three biological and three adopted - aged between 10 and 17. Jolie's lawyer did not say how custody would be divided. The couple, known as ""Brangelina"" by fans, met on the set of the film Mr & Mrs Smith in 2004 and were together for 10 years before they wed. The marriage was Pitt's second, the actor having previously wed Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after relationships with actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller. After Jolie announced the split the pair became embroiled in a bitter child custody battle, which included Pitt being investigated for possible child abuse after losing his temper in front of some of the children - he was later cleared of the allegations. The agreement means they will not have to go to trial over custody, but they have yet to reach a final divorce settlement.

Gun No. 6: The untold story of Britainâs deadliest illegal firearm," After shootings, guns in the UK are often passed on, traded, rented or hidden away. That is how this gun travelled across a major city without being seized, and was used in multiple, unrelated shootings. Some of these shootings remain unresolved. The police give every gun they know about a different number, so that they can be tracked and monitored depending on their own unique characteristics. This particular gun is a black CZ 75 semi-automatic pistol made in the Czech Republic. Investigators have called it Gun No 6. Now, almost a decade after the firearm was last used, an in-depthBBC Two documentaryhas tracked its journey. ""The history of Gun No 6 starts on the streets of Birmingham one night at about 3am, when shots are fired."" Andy Hough was Detective Chief Inspector of West Midlands Police when Gun No 6 first appeared. He describes the night of 23 February 2003. Police receive an anonymous call about a shooting outside a club. When they arrive on the scene, they find two bullet casings. But no-one - neither the witnesses, nor those who were shot at - comes forward. The only person who actually knows what happened, and why, is the person who pulled the trigger ""From about [the year] 2000 onwards, we had started to see an escalation in gun-related homicides,"" Andy says. ""And we had a community that wouldn't talk to us because they were frightened. “We had no known witnesses, there was no scientific material other than the bullet casings, there was no CCTV, there was no telephone evidence, and most importantly, there was nobody coming forward to say, 'In the early hours of this morning somebody tried to shoot me.' ""The only person who actually knows what happened, and why, is the person who pulled the trigger."" Nobody who has fired Gun No 6 has ever told police where to find it. They're either unknown, or are currently serving life sentences after using the gun to murder their victims. Filmmakers Zac Beattie, Georgina Cammalleri and James Newton have spent two years diving into the gun's disturbing history. ""The idea for the film came from an old newspaper article about a different gun that police realised was used in seven different crimes in London,"" Zac explains. ""We were fascinated to learn that you could follow the journey of a gun, and potentially the lives it touched."" After working with experts at the National Ballistic Intelligence Service (NABIS), they were ""shocked"" to learn about Gun No 6 - which had been ""used in more shootings and murders than any other"". ""We want to see if, by telling the story of this one gun, we could tell a story about something bigger - about violence, and about the society we live in."" But the story of Gun No 6, and all illegal guns in Britain, doesn't start with the first shooting. Really, it starts with Dunblane. Dunblane Primary School became a crime scene in the wake of the 1996 massacre (Picture: Getty Images) What later came to be known as theDunblane Massacrechanged everything. It was the worst school shooting ever carried out in Britain, and even now the word ""Dunblane"" is synonymous with heart-wrenching grief. Less than two years later, theFirearms Acthad been amended to ban all handguns from private use. Gun control in the UK is now among thetoughest in the world. Handguns are banned, and without going through a strict licensing procedure, it is illegal for a person to sell or be in possession of any firearm. A child lays teddy bears at a memorial in Dunblane in 1996 (Picture: Getty Images) So how do weapons like Gun No 6 end up on our streets? Helen Poole, a firearms expert from the University of Northampton, says that there are a number of ways that this happens - one of which is thefts from legal gun sellers and owners. These gun sellers, Helen explains, usually sell ""deactivated antique guns to history enthusiasts"" - that is, old guns that have been modified so that they can no longer shoot. But in thewrong handsthey can be reactivated relatively easily, making them potentially deadly again. According to the latest stats,over 586,000 people in England and Walesown a firearms or shotgun certificate. It's estimated that around 600 guns a year are stolen from legal gun owners, most of which inevitably end up on the black market. Another way guns come into the country is throughlarge shipments from abroad. A replica of Gun No 6 (Picture: BBC Two) Simon Brough from the National Crime Agency (NCA) explains that intercepting these shipments is a delicate collaboration between his agency and Border Force. ""Dover is the UK's largest port, and already this year we've had seven operations there that have involved the seizure of firearms and ammunition,"" he says. ""What we hope is that our work makes the prospect of smuggling guns across the border an incredibly risky one for criminal gangs."" Helen agrees, adding that the NCA and Border Force are ""particularly good"" at intercepting shipments of guns. Among these hauls, she adds, will be deactivated guns that ""have often originated in post-conflict regions, including some countries in the western Balkans"". Many will have been modified so they can shoot again. These weapons are usually military-grade, and their import into the UK is organised by large criminal gangs. The final way people get their hands on guns is by buying the parts separately online - often, but not always, on the dark web - and building the weapons themselves at home. And once a gun is in the country, it remains in circulation until it's found by the police. Firearms are dangerous weapons and the State has a duty to protect the public from their misuse. Gun ownership is a privilege, not a right But Helen explains that guns don't need to be sold on the black market in order to change hands and be used in different, seemingly separate crimes. ""I previously worked in DNA and fingerprinting, and at the time there was a big issue with vehicles that were essentially 'community cars' for use in crimes,"" she says. ""In the same way, there are possibly guns that aren't being sold between people, but are 'community guns' - so if you need to get hold of it, anyone in that community will know to go to the last person who used it."" Helen mentions a pistol - a Beretta 9000S - that was seized by investigators in Merseyside last year. It was discovered when police raided the home of Adam Bigley, then 24, and found the gun hidden in a bathroom behind some pipes. The gun was still loaded with four live rounds. The serial number on the side of the gun, which is one way a firearm can be traced, had been scratched out. But despite the missing serial number, investigators could confidently link that gun to 19 non-fatal shootings. There wasno evidencethat Adam was directly involved in any of the actual shootings, but he was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison for possession of a prohibited firearm. Officers could track that firearm because, when a gun is fired, it leaves unique marks on the casing of the ammunition. Andy says this is like “a fingerprint”. This is how investigators were able to track the journey of Gun No 6. In the space of less than two years, after the first incident on Proctor Street, they found its 'fingerprints' at seven more non-fatal shootings. “You’ve got two things when you fire a gun,” Andy explains. “You’ve got the rifling [spiral grooves that add a spinning motion to the bullet] within the barrel, and you’ve got where the hammer of the gun hits the back of the bullet. ""There are then two sets of marks - one along the length of the cartridge, and one on the circular bit on the back of the cartridge. “These both leave distinct markings, because each gun is slightly different. We don’t always recover the gun itself, but by looking at these prints we can tell when bullets in different shootings were fired from the same weapon.” A West Midlands police officer stands guard near the site of a shooting in 2003 (Picture: Getty Images) Gun No 6's story is set against a backdrop of escalating gang violence in the UK's second biggest city. For at least a decade before the gun made its debut, the streets of Birmingham had been terrorisedlargely by two gangs: the Burger Bar Boys and the Johnson Crew. The origins of these two gangs are unclear - but by most accounts, they originated in the mid-1990s. Some saythe crews were formed when people banded together to form vigilante groups, protecting their communities from targeted attacks by racists. Otherversionshave it that the groups simply used to all be mates, before an argument over a bet on who won a game of Streetfighter on the PlayStation. Either way, things between them became vicious. The groups split down the middle according to their postcodes and violently defended their territories. Two gangs formed from this schism - the Burger Bar Boys, also known as ""The Burgers"", and the Johnson Crew, aka ""The Johnnies"". Both werenamed after their regular meeting spotsin Handsworth, north-west Birmingham, in the mid-1990s: The Burger Bar on Soho Road, now closed, and Johnson's cafe on Heathfield Road in nearby Lozells, which has also since closed down. The city was quickly divided up into territories, according to who had the right to sell drugs where. The Burgers were said to be wealthier and better organised, with a much deadlier collection of weapons. But the Johnnies, on the other hand, were larger - they had more members, and had allegiances with other splinter gangs in the area. In 1995, the two gangs were already notorious among police in Birmingham for being involved in drug dealing, robberies and kidnappings, when shootings started happening outside the city's nightclubs and community centres. Prompted by the unsolved murder of Corey Wayne Allen, 27, in 1999, West Midlands Police launchedOperation Ventarato fight gang violence in Birmingham - in particular, the city's growing gun culture. Ventara did little to quell the violence, however, and the shootings continued to escalate. Across England and Wales, gun crime hadincreased by 40%in the two years following the 1997 handgun ban. Things came to a head in December 2002, when Burger Bar member Yohanne Martinwas shot in the headwhile waiting at traffic lights in West Bromwich, a suburb north-west of Birmingham. Yohanne's brother Nathan, also a Burger Bar member, was convinced that the Johnnies were behind the killing. On New Year's Eve, 2002, Nathan and other Burgers bought a red Ford Mondeo. Less than 48 hours later, they drove it up to a New Year's Day party at a hair salon in Aston andopened fire on partygoerswith a Mac 10 machine gun - a gun first developed as a military weapon in the mid-'60s. They were trying to hit a group of young men standing close by - one of whom was an alleged member of the Johnson Crew. Charlene Ellis, second from left, and Letishia Shakespeare, far right, were killed in the shooting (Picture: BBC Two) But instead, they shot and killed two young girls - Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letishia Shakespeare, 17. This horrific shooting made headlines across the UK. The deaths of Charlene and Letishia were fresh in everyone's minds when, less than three months later, Gun No 6 first appeared on the streets of Birmingham. Two years later, Nathan Martin, Michael Gregory, Rodrigo Simms and Marcus Ellis - Charlene's half-brother - were convicted of the girls' murder andsentenced to life in prisonwith a minimum recommended sentence of 35 years. After the sentencing, the victims' mums shouted ""justice"" as they drove away from the court. Ishfaq Ahmed worked as a doorman at a nightclub called Premonitions in Birmingham city centre. On the cold winter night of 20 November 2004, he kissed his partner Penny and baby daughter Aneesah goodbye - as he always did before heading into work. It seemed like a normal Saturday night. People were out, drinking, dancing and having a good time. That was until about 03:30. A group of men linked to the Johnson Crew were ""rushing doors"" in the local area - pushing and forcing their way into clubs. Ishfaq jostled with them, trying to do his job and stop them from getting in without paying. After a struggle, the Johnnies appeared to be walking away - before they turned around again to shoot. Ishfaq was shot three times in the back by two 9mm handguns - one of which was Gun No 6. Ishfaq was killed by a bullet that entered his shoulder, travelled through his chest, and shattered the main blood vessel in his abdomen. He was 24 years old. Ishfaq Ahmed will never get to see his daughter grow up (Picture: BBC Two) Penny remembers the last time she ever saw her partner. Their daughter, Aneesah, was only about 18 months old at the time. ""I can remember him dropping me and Aneesah off [at home], and I came up the stairs and looked out the window,"" Penny says. She saw him sitting outside in his car, looking back up at her. ""Whereas before he'd just speed off, this time he wasn't - he was just sat there. ""My home phone was ringing, it was my friend Melanie. I actually said to her: 'He's looked at us like he's never going to see us again'. I just had this horrible feeling."" In the middle of the night, Penny started to worry about Ishfaq. She had woken up to feed Aneesah and was surprised to see that Ishfaq wasn't home. Despite telling herself that he must be OK - that he always comes home safely - she couldn't shake the niggling feeling that something terrible had happened. Then she got a phone call. ""I woke up to get Aneesah a bottle and... he wasn't there,"" she says. ""And within five minutes my phone was ringing. It was his dad phoning me to tell me what had happened."" Penny started to think of all the things he would miss out on - all the little moments they had looked forward to together. ""He wouldn't see Aneesah grow up,"" she says. ""Her first day at school, he'd wanted to take her - knowing [he'd miss that] was hard."" ""It's all gone. All because of one bullet."" Ishfaq, Aneesah and his partner Penny (Picture: BBC Two) The following year, in December 2005, six men were convicted of killing Ishfaq in the Bristol Street shooting. Dean Smith, William Carter, Carl Spencer, and Michael Christie - allegedly all part of the Johnson Crew - along with Leonard Wilkins and Jemal Parchment,were found guiltyof murder. During the two-month trial, an armed convoy brought the defendants to and from court every day. [A] gun was fired and killed a blameless man, for no other reason than that he was doing his duty as a doorman at a nightclub They were all jailed for life, with a stipulation that they must serve a minimum of 30 years. Sentencing the killers, Mr Justice Mitting told them: ""[A] gun was fired and killed a blameless man, for no other reason than that he was doing his duty as a doorman at a nightclub - and caused you loss of face or annoyance, or both."" Penny found out Ishfaq had died in the middle of the night (Picture: BBC Two) Now, speaking 13 years later, Andy Hough reflects on the shooting. ""The investigation into the murder of Ishfaq Ahmed was a tremendous piece of policing work,"" Andy says. ""It involved detectives from the then-Murder Investigation Unit working with the local police and the local community to bring six notorious criminals from the Johnson Crew to justice. ""However - we didn't recover Gun No 6."" It had been eight months since Gun No 6 was used. But on 23 July 2005, it reappeared - this time in the hands of a man from London. That man wasKemar Whittaker, a 23-year-old drug dealer. He was looking for Andrew Huntley, a 31-year-old dad. He found him waiting to get into a nightclub - and immediately started to chase him. Andrew tried to run away. We are brothers. We do not have to live like this Terrified, Andrew ended up kneeling on the ground beneath a railway arch on Heath Mill Lane in Digbeth, raising his arms in apparent surrender and begging Kemar for mercy. Kemar then opened fire on Andrew and shot him twice in the head - killing him in cold blood. According to a witness, Andrew's last words were, ""We are brothers. We do not have to live like this."" The shooting would later be described by judges as an ""execution"". Andrew Huntley, pictured as a young man, was shot in cold blood (Picture: BBC Two) Eight months later, Kemar Whittaker went on trial for killing Andrew and was convicted after just two weeks. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 30 years. ""There was minimal argument before you executed him in cold blood when he was kneeling on the ground,"" Mr Justice Hughes told the killer. ""You had access to a weapon that was in circulation on the streets being used for crimes just such as this."" That weapon was Gun No 6. Andrew had a young son, Akeem. ""My dad was a happy person,"" Akeem remembers. ""He liked fashion, he liked to dress well. As soon as he smiled it's like he gleamed up the whole of the room - it was like a light."" Now aged 20, Akeem has become cynical - the death of his dad altered his worldview. But when he was a kid, he had big dreams. ""When I was five years old, my dad started taking me to football,"" Akeem says. ""I got into a team, and started taking it more seriously when he died. ""But then I just stopped playing. As you get older you realise the dreams you have aren't always going to come true."" He still carries around the memory of his dad, keeping photos of him on his phone. ""You won't see me show it but the emotions are still there. I think about my dad every day... because if not [for what happened], my life would be different."" After Andrew's murder, Gun No 6 disappeared for four years - and Andy Hough believes he knows why. “When a gun is used in a murder, it becomes ‘hot',” he says. “That is, no-one wants it. If you’re caught with a gun that’s linked to a murder, you’ll have to answer a lot of difficult questions. “So the owner will try to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Sometimes they get buried in gardens or graveyards, other times they get passed on to people who aren’t within their circles at all.” And so Gun No 6 was off the streets, for a while at least. Four years after the murder of Andrew Huntley, Gun No 6 reappeared. This time, it was in the hands of a known criminal, Anselm Ribera, who held up a Post Office in the quiet village of Fairfield - about 45 minutes' drive from central Birmingham. ""We used to open at 7am so it would give me about a quarter of an hour to do all the papers and that,"" says Ken Hodson-Walker, who lived above the shop with his wife and two sons. As Ken was opening the shop, his wife, Judy, told him that she was just popping upstairs to sort some bits and pieces out. Remembering that morning, on 9 January 2009, Judy says: ""To this day I bitterly regret that I didn't look out the window - because I would have seen them getting out of the car."" She's referring to a group of armed robbers who, just over an hour later, would force their way into the small corner shop, hold them up at gunpoint, and plunge their family into tragedy. ""They came in,"" Ken recalls. ""One of them had a big sledgehammer. The other one had a gun, which I didn't really believe was real. ""There was a young girl in there - she saw them come in and she absolutely screamed the place down."" The shopper's screams were heard throughout the house, including in the family bedrooms. Judy and her eldest son Craig, 29, immediately ran out into the hallway. They knew something terrible was happening downstairs. At about 08:20 Judy ran into the shop, followed closely by Craig - who, in his panic, had run out wearing only his boxer shorts. Realising that they were in the middle of a robbery, Craig held his mum's shoulder and pulled her back, away from the danger. He then reached over and picked up a cricket bat. A fight ensued. Craig tried to hit the robbers with a cricket bat while his mum retreated behind a shelf, and his dad tried to fight the attackers off from behind. Then - a gunshot rang out. Ken recalls all the vivid details of what happened next. ""Craig was shot. He said, 'They got me'. I heard the cricket bat drop on the floor, so I went round and picked it up. ""The middle [robber] grabbed hold of the gunman and pulled him round the corner - then they shot me in the leg. It bloody hurt. It hit my bone right on my knee. ""They obviously wanted to do me more harm, so they grabbed all these metal shelves, threw those onto me, and they proceeded to jump up and down on the shelves - which I was stuck underneath. They did that quite a few times."" Then the robbers left. Ken recalls the day in vivid detail (Picture: BBC Two) The shop was completely turned over. Different products, normally meticulously laid out by Ken and Judy, were strewn across the floor. Fearing that his son was badly injured, Ken pushed the shelves off his body, pulled himself up into a seated position, and used his arms to drag himself along the floor towards Craig, his leg bleeding profusely. Pushing through the throbbing pain coursing through his body, Ken pulled himself around the corner to where he knew Craig had been hit. He saw him lying still in a large pool of blood. Ken dragged his increasingly weak body the final distance towards Craig and touched him gently, full of desperate hope that his son was still alive. A cold chill passed through Ken's body. ""I knew he was dead."" The trial was at Birmingham Crown Court (Picture: Getty Images) Craig had been shot in the chest. The bullet had pierced one of his lungs and heart, killing him almost instantly. At the end of that year, three men went on trial accused of Craig's murder. They were Christopher Morrissey, then 32, Declan Morrissey, then 34, and Anselm Ribera, who was also 34. The three men were also accused of attempting to murder Ken by shooting him in the leg during the robbery. The Morrissey brothers shared a sledgehammer, while Anselm was said to have gone into the shop brandishing a pistol. This was Gun No 6. The trial lasted 10 weeks. The three men were described by the judge during sentencing as ""parasitic criminals"" and wereconvicted of murder and attempted murder. They were sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum of 34 years, each. ""I was 19 when I first met Anselm,"" his former partner, Alison Cope, says. ""He was 18."" Far from the killer he would later become, at that time she says he was ""quiet, shy and unsure"". To her at the time, she says, he seemed like a caring and kind-hearted young man. ""I was just happy to have this person in my life."" The two of them moved in together ""very quickly"", and just a few months later, 21-year-old Alison found out she was pregnant. It was the mid-’90s. ""During that pregnancy, Anselm was arrested and charged with a burglary, and sent to prison for just a few weeks,"" Alison remembers. But although his sentence was relatively short, she says, it changed him. ""I remember him coming out of prison with more knowledge of crime than he'd had going in."" Alison and Anselm's son, Joshua, as a baby (Picture: BBC Two) On 10 August 1995, Joshua Ribera was born. When she looked at his face for the first time, Alison was struck by how much he looked like Anselm. This tiny newborn was his dad's exact double. And she was filled with boundless, overwhelming love for him. Josh's first few months were happy. The young family loved to chat, play together and spend time with each other. The young baby was just learning to smile and laugh. But it wasn't long before things started to change. When Josh was still young, Anselm was arrested for another burglary. This arrest ended up becoming the turning point in their relationship. ""I said to him, 'Listen, this isn't really what I want from a relationship. I need you.' But Anselm's need to live that life was far greater at that point than it was to be with me. ""So I left him - and the relationship was over."" Alison and Anselm with their son Josh (Picture: BBC Two) When Josh was still young - about seven years old - Anselm was arrested and charged with an armed robbery. After a trial, he was convicted. ""It was quite a lengthy sentence,"" Alison says. But it was another two years before she was told what he had actually been convicted of. She hadn't imagined that her former partner, who she had once been so in love with, was capable of something as serious and violent as armed robbery. ""I was told it was a warehouse theft. So even at that point I didn't realise the road he was going down was so serious."" Anselm went to prison for armed robbery in 2002 (Picture: BBC Two) Anselm was released from prison in 2007. This was when he started spending time with two known petty criminals, the Morrissey brothers. The three of them plotted to hold up a small, family-owned post office in Fairfield. That was when he killed Craig Hodson-Walker in cold blood. But it wasn't just Craig's family that was torn apart by the killing. Anselm destroyed his own family too. Josh Ribera, Anselm's son, pictured in his teens (Picture: BBC Two) Josh Ribera, who was only 13 at the time, struggled to come to terms with the fact that his dad could be a murderer. Alison remembers the moment when her mum called to tell her Anselm had been arrested and charged with the murder of a young man in Fairfield. Her immediate thought was for Josh. She was filled with worry about how he would take the news - and started panicking in case he saw it in the newspapers first. She rushed out of the house to find him, so she could break the news gently. Alison eventually found him - he was ice skating. She brought him home, but when she told Josh his dad had been arrested again, she was met with a defensive tone. ""For what?"" he asked, shrugging it off as though it didn't bother him either way. But it did bother him. ""When I said the word 'murder', Josh just demolished the front room. He smashed everything up. He was crying, he was angry."" That was when, as Alison describes it, ""the nightmare began"". Josh as a baby, left, and dressed as a policeman, right (Picture: BBC Two) ""He was devastated,"" she says. ""His dad was 'the scum of the earth', as quoted in one newspaper. His dad had destroyed a young man's life."" After that, Alison says that Josh ""went through a really difficult time, and just kept getting into trouble"". But after a few years, things started getting better. When he was around 16, Josh discovered a passion for music. He threw himself into producing music - rap and grime - putting his heart and soul into every song he wrote. Going by the name Depzman, Josh became a big success - and was tipped to be the next big thing in grime. By the time he was 18, he was doing shows across the UK and flying out to Europe to perform. His album got to number one in the hip hop charts, and appeared on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Josh stood out because he rapped about positive things. Some of his songs were about how much he loved his mum, for example. Others, about how he missed his dad. With the money he got from the sales of his album, he bought his grandma flowers - tweeting photos with her to inspire his followers to show they loved their grans too. It worked - his replies were flooded with fans tweeting him similar photos with their own grandparents. A photo Josh tweeted, with the caption: 'Grandma means the world to me' (Picture: BBC Two) On 20 September 2013, Josh went to a concert in the Selly Oak suburb of Birmingham. It was a memorial concert dedicated to a friend of his, who had been stabbed and killed exactly one year beforehand. ""He left me here that evening,"" Alison says. ""His last words to me were, 'I love you mum.' Then he gave me a hug and a kiss, and said, 'I'll see you later.'"" At that concert, Josh was stabbed once in the chest. The knife attack proved fatal. He was rushed to Solihull Hospital, and passed away in the early hours of the morning. Now, Alison dedicates her time to preserving Josh's memory, giving talks at schools to prevent other kids from going down the same path as her son's killer. ""The 9mm parabellum [firearms cartridge on Gun No 6] was designed primarily for military use,"" Gareth Cooper, Ballistics Material Examiner for West Midlands Police, says. ""It's a penetrating round, above all else, which is designed to increase the rate at which the energy is dumped into the target - causing an increased rate of tissue damage. ""But effectively, pistol bullets all work by haemorrhagic effect. It's a question of rupturing as much body tissue - preferably critical body tissue - as possible."" In other words - Gun No 6 is a dangerous killing machine. ""A weapon like this on the streets is a worrying thing to us."" This gun has ruined lives and ripped families apart - both of the victims, and of those who pulled its trigger. All of these brutal shootings were in some way connected by this one handheld weapon. Gun No 6 has never been recovered. Credit: Getty Images Watch 'Gun No 6' on BBC iPlayer now. If you've been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, help is availablehere.

Gun No. 6: The untold story of BritainÃ¢ÂÂs deadliest illegal firearm," After shootings, guns in the UK are often passed on, traded, rented or hidden away. That is how this gun travelled across a major city without being seized, and was used in multiple, unrelated shootings. Some of these shootings remain unresolved. The police give every gun they know about a different number, so that they can be tracked and monitored depending on their own unique characteristics. This particular gun is a black CZ 75 semi-automatic pistol made in the Czech Republic. Investigators have called it Gun No 6. Now, almost a decade after the firearm was last used, an in-depthBBC Two documentaryhas tracked its journey. ""The history of Gun No 6 starts on the streets of Birmingham one night at about 3am, when shots are fired."" Andy Hough was Detective Chief Inspector of West Midlands Police when Gun No 6 first appeared. He describes the night of 23 February 2003. Police receive an anonymous call about a shooting outside a club. When they arrive on the scene, they find two bullet casings. But no-one - neither the witnesses, nor those who were shot at - comes forward. The only person who actually knows what happened, and why, is the person who pulled the trigger ""From about [the year] 2000 onwards, we had started to see an escalation in gun-related homicides,"" Andy says. ""And we had a community that wouldn't talk to us because they were frightened. “We had no known witnesses, there was no scientific material other than the bullet casings, there was no CCTV, there was no telephone evidence, and most importantly, there was nobody coming forward to say, 'In the early hours of this morning somebody tried to shoot me.' ""The only person who actually knows what happened, and why, is the person who pulled the trigger."" Nobody who has fired Gun No 6 has ever told police where to find it. They're either unknown, or are currently serving life sentences after using the gun to murder their victims. Filmmakers Zac Beattie, Georgina Cammalleri and James Newton have spent two years diving into the gun's disturbing history. ""The idea for the film came from an old newspaper article about a different gun that police realised was used in seven different crimes in London,"" Zac explains. ""We were fascinated to learn that you could follow the journey of a gun, and potentially the lives it touched."" After working with experts at the National Ballistic Intelligence Service (NABIS), they were ""shocked"" to learn about Gun No 6 - which had been ""used in more shootings and murders than any other"". ""We want to see if, by telling the story of this one gun, we could tell a story about something bigger - about violence, and about the society we live in."" But the story of Gun No 6, and all illegal guns in Britain, doesn't start with the first shooting. Really, it starts with Dunblane. Dunblane Primary School became a crime scene in the wake of the 1996 massacre (Picture: Getty Images) What later came to be known as theDunblane Massacrechanged everything. It was the worst school shooting ever carried out in Britain, and even now the word ""Dunblane"" is synonymous with heart-wrenching grief. Less than two years later, theFirearms Acthad been amended to ban all handguns from private use. Gun control in the UK is now among thetoughest in the world. Handguns are banned, and without going through a strict licensing procedure, it is illegal for a person to sell or be in possession of any firearm. A child lays teddy bears at a memorial in Dunblane in 1996 (Picture: Getty Images) So how do weapons like Gun No 6 end up on our streets? Helen Poole, a firearms expert from the University of Northampton, says that there are a number of ways that this happens - one of which is thefts from legal gun sellers and owners. These gun sellers, Helen explains, usually sell ""deactivated antique guns to history enthusiasts"" - that is, old guns that have been modified so that they can no longer shoot. But in thewrong handsthey can be reactivated relatively easily, making them potentially deadly again. According to the latest stats,over 586,000 people in England and Walesown a firearms or shotgun certificate. It's estimated that around 600 guns a year are stolen from legal gun owners, most of which inevitably end up on the black market. Another way guns come into the country is throughlarge shipments from abroad. A replica of Gun No 6 (Picture: BBC Two) Simon Brough from the National Crime Agency (NCA) explains that intercepting these shipments is a delicate collaboration between his agency and Border Force. ""Dover is the UK's largest port, and already this year we've had seven operations there that have involved the seizure of firearms and ammunition,"" he says. ""What we hope is that our work makes the prospect of smuggling guns across the border an incredibly risky one for criminal gangs."" Helen agrees, adding that the NCA and Border Force are ""particularly good"" at intercepting shipments of guns. Among these hauls, she adds, will be deactivated guns that ""have often originated in post-conflict regions, including some countries in the western Balkans"". Many will have been modified so they can shoot again. These weapons are usually military-grade, and their import into the UK is organised by large criminal gangs. The final way people get their hands on guns is by buying the parts separately online - often, but not always, on the dark web - and building the weapons themselves at home. And once a gun is in the country, it remains in circulation until it's found by the police. Firearms are dangerous weapons and the State has a duty to protect the public from their misuse. Gun ownership is a privilege, not a right But Helen explains that guns don't need to be sold on the black market in order to change hands and be used in different, seemingly separate crimes. ""I previously worked in DNA and fingerprinting, and at the time there was a big issue with vehicles that were essentially 'community cars' for use in crimes,"" she says. ""In the same way, there are possibly guns that aren't being sold between people, but are 'community guns' - so if you need to get hold of it, anyone in that community will know to go to the last person who used it."" Helen mentions a pistol - a Beretta 9000S - that was seized by investigators in Merseyside last year. It was discovered when police raided the home of Adam Bigley, then 24, and found the gun hidden in a bathroom behind some pipes. The gun was still loaded with four live rounds. The serial number on the side of the gun, which is one way a firearm can be traced, had been scratched out. But despite the missing serial number, investigators could confidently link that gun to 19 non-fatal shootings. There wasno evidencethat Adam was directly involved in any of the actual shootings, but he was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison for possession of a prohibited firearm. Officers could track that firearm because, when a gun is fired, it leaves unique marks on the casing of the ammunition. Andy says this is like “a fingerprint”. This is how investigators were able to track the journey of Gun No 6. In the space of less than two years, after the first incident on Proctor Street, they found its 'fingerprints' at seven more non-fatal shootings. “You’ve got two things when you fire a gun,” Andy explains. “You’ve got the rifling [spiral grooves that add a spinning motion to the bullet] within the barrel, and you’ve got where the hammer of the gun hits the back of the bullet. ""There are then two sets of marks - one along the length of the cartridge, and one on the circular bit on the back of the cartridge. “These both leave distinct markings, because each gun is slightly different. We don’t always recover the gun itself, but by looking at these prints we can tell when bullets in different shootings were fired from the same weapon.” A West Midlands police officer stands guard near the site of a shooting in 2003 (Picture: Getty Images) Gun No 6's story is set against a backdrop of escalating gang violence in the UK's second biggest city. For at least a decade before the gun made its debut, the streets of Birmingham had been terrorisedlargely by two gangs: the Burger Bar Boys and the Johnson Crew. The origins of these two gangs are unclear - but by most accounts, they originated in the mid-1990s. Some saythe crews were formed when people banded together to form vigilante groups, protecting their communities from targeted attacks by racists. Otherversionshave it that the groups simply used to all be mates, before an argument over a bet on who won a game of Streetfighter on the PlayStation. Either way, things between them became vicious. The groups split down the middle according to their postcodes and violently defended their territories. Two gangs formed from this schism - the Burger Bar Boys, also known as ""The Burgers"", and the Johnson Crew, aka ""The Johnnies"". Both werenamed after their regular meeting spotsin Handsworth, north-west Birmingham, in the mid-1990s: The Burger Bar on Soho Road, now closed, and Johnson's cafe on Heathfield Road in nearby Lozells, which has also since closed down. The city was quickly divided up into territories, according to who had the right to sell drugs where. The Burgers were said to be wealthier and better organised, with a much deadlier collection of weapons. But the Johnnies, on the other hand, were larger - they had more members, and had allegiances with other splinter gangs in the area. In 1995, the two gangs were already notorious among police in Birmingham for being involved in drug dealing, robberies and kidnappings, when shootings started happening outside the city's nightclubs and community centres. Prompted by the unsolved murder of Corey Wayne Allen, 27, in 1999, West Midlands Police launchedOperation Ventarato fight gang violence in Birmingham - in particular, the city's growing gun culture. Ventara did little to quell the violence, however, and the shootings continued to escalate. Across England and Wales, gun crime hadincreased by 40%in the two years following the 1997 handgun ban. Things came to a head in December 2002, when Burger Bar member Yohanne Martinwas shot in the headwhile waiting at traffic lights in West Bromwich, a suburb north-west of Birmingham. Yohanne's brother Nathan, also a Burger Bar member, was convinced that the Johnnies were behind the killing. On New Year's Eve, 2002, Nathan and other Burgers bought a red Ford Mondeo. Less than 48 hours later, they drove it up to a New Year's Day party at a hair salon in Aston andopened fire on partygoerswith a Mac 10 machine gun - a gun first developed as a military weapon in the mid-'60s. They were trying to hit a group of young men standing close by - one of whom was an alleged member of the Johnson Crew. Charlene Ellis, second from left, and Letishia Shakespeare, far right, were killed in the shooting (Picture: BBC Two) But instead, they shot and killed two young girls - Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letishia Shakespeare, 17. This horrific shooting made headlines across the UK. The deaths of Charlene and Letishia were fresh in everyone's minds when, less than three months later, Gun No 6 first appeared on the streets of Birmingham. Two years later, Nathan Martin, Michael Gregory, Rodrigo Simms and Marcus Ellis - Charlene's half-brother - were convicted of the girls' murder andsentenced to life in prisonwith a minimum recommended sentence of 35 years. After the sentencing, the victims' mums shouted ""justice"" as they drove away from the court. Ishfaq Ahmed worked as a doorman at a nightclub called Premonitions in Birmingham city centre. On the cold winter night of 20 November 2004, he kissed his partner Penny and baby daughter Aneesah goodbye - as he always did before heading into work. It seemed like a normal Saturday night. People were out, drinking, dancing and having a good time. That was until about 03:30. A group of men linked to the Johnson Crew were ""rushing doors"" in the local area - pushing and forcing their way into clubs. Ishfaq jostled with them, trying to do his job and stop them from getting in without paying. After a struggle, the Johnnies appeared to be walking away - before they turned around again to shoot. Ishfaq was shot three times in the back by two 9mm handguns - one of which was Gun No 6. Ishfaq was killed by a bullet that entered his shoulder, travelled through his chest, and shattered the main blood vessel in his abdomen. He was 24 years old. Ishfaq Ahmed will never get to see his daughter grow up (Picture: BBC Two) Penny remembers the last time she ever saw her partner. Their daughter, Aneesah, was only about 18 months old at the time. ""I can remember him dropping me and Aneesah off [at home], and I came up the stairs and looked out the window,"" Penny says. She saw him sitting outside in his car, looking back up at her. ""Whereas before he'd just speed off, this time he wasn't - he was just sat there. ""My home phone was ringing, it was my friend Melanie. I actually said to her: 'He's looked at us like he's never going to see us again'. I just had this horrible feeling."" In the middle of the night, Penny started to worry about Ishfaq. She had woken up to feed Aneesah and was surprised to see that Ishfaq wasn't home. Despite telling herself that he must be OK - that he always comes home safely - she couldn't shake the niggling feeling that something terrible had happened. Then she got a phone call. ""I woke up to get Aneesah a bottle and... he wasn't there,"" she says. ""And within five minutes my phone was ringing. It was his dad phoning me to tell me what had happened."" Penny started to think of all the things he would miss out on - all the little moments they had looked forward to together. ""He wouldn't see Aneesah grow up,"" she says. ""Her first day at school, he'd wanted to take her - knowing [he'd miss that] was hard."" ""It's all gone. All because of one bullet."" Ishfaq, Aneesah and his partner Penny (Picture: BBC Two) The following year, in December 2005, six men were convicted of killing Ishfaq in the Bristol Street shooting. Dean Smith, William Carter, Carl Spencer, and Michael Christie - allegedly all part of the Johnson Crew - along with Leonard Wilkins and Jemal Parchment,were found guiltyof murder. During the two-month trial, an armed convoy brought the defendants to and from court every day. [A] gun was fired and killed a blameless man, for no other reason than that he was doing his duty as a doorman at a nightclub They were all jailed for life, with a stipulation that they must serve a minimum of 30 years. Sentencing the killers, Mr Justice Mitting told them: ""[A] gun was fired and killed a blameless man, for no other reason than that he was doing his duty as a doorman at a nightclub - and caused you loss of face or annoyance, or both."" Penny found out Ishfaq had died in the middle of the night (Picture: BBC Two) Now, speaking 13 years later, Andy Hough reflects on the shooting. ""The investigation into the murder of Ishfaq Ahmed was a tremendous piece of policing work,"" Andy says. ""It involved detectives from the then-Murder Investigation Unit working with the local police and the local community to bring six notorious criminals from the Johnson Crew to justice. ""However - we didn't recover Gun No 6."" It had been eight months since Gun No 6 was used. But on 23 July 2005, it reappeared - this time in the hands of a man from London. That man wasKemar Whittaker, a 23-year-old drug dealer. He was looking for Andrew Huntley, a 31-year-old dad. He found him waiting to get into a nightclub - and immediately started to chase him. Andrew tried to run away. We are brothers. We do not have to live like this Terrified, Andrew ended up kneeling on the ground beneath a railway arch on Heath Mill Lane in Digbeth, raising his arms in apparent surrender and begging Kemar for mercy. Kemar then opened fire on Andrew and shot him twice in the head - killing him in cold blood. According to a witness, Andrew's last words were, ""We are brothers. We do not have to live like this."" The shooting would later be described by judges as an ""execution"". Andrew Huntley, pictured as a young man, was shot in cold blood (Picture: BBC Two) Eight months later, Kemar Whittaker went on trial for killing Andrew and was convicted after just two weeks. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 30 years. ""There was minimal argument before you executed him in cold blood when he was kneeling on the ground,"" Mr Justice Hughes told the killer. ""You had access to a weapon that was in circulation on the streets being used for crimes just such as this."" That weapon was Gun No 6. Andrew had a young son, Akeem. ""My dad was a happy person,"" Akeem remembers. ""He liked fashion, he liked to dress well. As soon as he smiled it's like he gleamed up the whole of the room - it was like a light."" Now aged 20, Akeem has become cynical - the death of his dad altered his worldview. But when he was a kid, he had big dreams. ""When I was five years old, my dad started taking me to football,"" Akeem says. ""I got into a team, and started taking it more seriously when he died. ""But then I just stopped playing. As you get older you realise the dreams you have aren't always going to come true."" He still carries around the memory of his dad, keeping photos of him on his phone. ""You won't see me show it but the emotions are still there. I think about my dad every day... because if not [for what happened], my life would be different."" After Andrew's murder, Gun No 6 disappeared for four years - and Andy Hough believes he knows why. “When a gun is used in a murder, it becomes ‘hot',” he says. “That is, no-one wants it. If you’re caught with a gun that’s linked to a murder, you’ll have to answer a lot of difficult questions. “So the owner will try to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Sometimes they get buried in gardens or graveyards, other times they get passed on to people who aren’t within their circles at all.” And so Gun No 6 was off the streets, for a while at least. Four years after the murder of Andrew Huntley, Gun No 6 reappeared. This time, it was in the hands of a known criminal, Anselm Ribera, who held up a Post Office in the quiet village of Fairfield - about 45 minutes' drive from central Birmingham. ""We used to open at 7am so it would give me about a quarter of an hour to do all the papers and that,"" says Ken Hodson-Walker, who lived above the shop with his wife and two sons. As Ken was opening the shop, his wife, Judy, told him that she was just popping upstairs to sort some bits and pieces out. Remembering that morning, on 9 January 2009, Judy says: ""To this day I bitterly regret that I didn't look out the window - because I would have seen them getting out of the car."" She's referring to a group of armed robbers who, just over an hour later, would force their way into the small corner shop, hold them up at gunpoint, and plunge their family into tragedy. ""They came in,"" Ken recalls. ""One of them had a big sledgehammer. The other one had a gun, which I didn't really believe was real. ""There was a young girl in there - she saw them come in and she absolutely screamed the place down."" The shopper's screams were heard throughout the house, including in the family bedrooms. Judy and her eldest son Craig, 29, immediately ran out into the hallway. They knew something terrible was happening downstairs. At about 08:20 Judy ran into the shop, followed closely by Craig - who, in his panic, had run out wearing only his boxer shorts. Realising that they were in the middle of a robbery, Craig held his mum's shoulder and pulled her back, away from the danger. He then reached over and picked up a cricket bat. A fight ensued. Craig tried to hit the robbers with a cricket bat while his mum retreated behind a shelf, and his dad tried to fight the attackers off from behind. Then - a gunshot rang out. Ken recalls all the vivid details of what happened next. ""Craig was shot. He said, 'They got me'. I heard the cricket bat drop on the floor, so I went round and picked it up. ""The middle [robber] grabbed hold of the gunman and pulled him round the corner - then they shot me in the leg. It bloody hurt. It hit my bone right on my knee. ""They obviously wanted to do me more harm, so they grabbed all these metal shelves, threw those onto me, and they proceeded to jump up and down on the shelves - which I was stuck underneath. They did that quite a few times."" Then the robbers left. Ken recalls the day in vivid detail (Picture: BBC Two) The shop was completely turned over. Different products, normally meticulously laid out by Ken and Judy, were strewn across the floor. Fearing that his son was badly injured, Ken pushed the shelves off his body, pulled himself up into a seated position, and used his arms to drag himself along the floor towards Craig, his leg bleeding profusely. Pushing through the throbbing pain coursing through his body, Ken pulled himself around the corner to where he knew Craig had been hit. He saw him lying still in a large pool of blood. Ken dragged his increasingly weak body the final distance towards Craig and touched him gently, full of desperate hope that his son was still alive. A cold chill passed through Ken's body. ""I knew he was dead."" The trial was at Birmingham Crown Court (Picture: Getty Images) Craig had been shot in the chest. The bullet had pierced one of his lungs and heart, killing him almost instantly. At the end of that year, three men went on trial accused of Craig's murder. They were Christopher Morrissey, then 32, Declan Morrissey, then 34, and Anselm Ribera, who was also 34. The three men were also accused of attempting to murder Ken by shooting him in the leg during the robbery. The Morrissey brothers shared a sledgehammer, while Anselm was said to have gone into the shop brandishing a pistol. This was Gun No 6. The trial lasted 10 weeks. The three men were described by the judge during sentencing as ""parasitic criminals"" and wereconvicted of murder and attempted murder. They were sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum of 34 years, each. ""I was 19 when I first met Anselm,"" his former partner, Alison Cope, says. ""He was 18."" Far from the killer he would later become, at that time she says he was ""quiet, shy and unsure"". To her at the time, she says, he seemed like a caring and kind-hearted young man. ""I was just happy to have this person in my life."" The two of them moved in together ""very quickly"", and just a few months later, 21-year-old Alison found out she was pregnant. It was the mid-’90s. ""During that pregnancy, Anselm was arrested and charged with a burglary, and sent to prison for just a few weeks,"" Alison remembers. But although his sentence was relatively short, she says, it changed him. ""I remember him coming out of prison with more knowledge of crime than he'd had going in."" Alison and Anselm's son, Joshua, as a baby (Picture: BBC Two) On 10 August 1995, Joshua Ribera was born. When she looked at his face for the first time, Alison was struck by how much he looked like Anselm. This tiny newborn was his dad's exact double. And she was filled with boundless, overwhelming love for him. Josh's first few months were happy. The young family loved to chat, play together and spend time with each other. The young baby was just learning to smile and laugh. But it wasn't long before things started to change. When Josh was still young, Anselm was arrested for another burglary. This arrest ended up becoming the turning point in their relationship. ""I said to him, 'Listen, this isn't really what I want from a relationship. I need you.' But Anselm's need to live that life was far greater at that point than it was to be with me. ""So I left him - and the relationship was over."" Alison and Anselm with their son Josh (Picture: BBC Two) When Josh was still young - about seven years old - Anselm was arrested and charged with an armed robbery. After a trial, he was convicted. ""It was quite a lengthy sentence,"" Alison says. But it was another two years before she was told what he had actually been convicted of. She hadn't imagined that her former partner, who she had once been so in love with, was capable of something as serious and violent as armed robbery. ""I was told it was a warehouse theft. So even at that point I didn't realise the road he was going down was so serious."" Anselm went to prison for armed robbery in 2002 (Picture: BBC Two) Anselm was released from prison in 2007. This was when he started spending time with two known petty criminals, the Morrissey brothers. The three of them plotted to hold up a small, family-owned post office in Fairfield. That was when he killed Craig Hodson-Walker in cold blood. But it wasn't just Craig's family that was torn apart by the killing. Anselm destroyed his own family too. Josh Ribera, Anselm's son, pictured in his teens (Picture: BBC Two) Josh Ribera, who was only 13 at the time, struggled to come to terms with the fact that his dad could be a murderer. Alison remembers the moment when her mum called to tell her Anselm had been arrested and charged with the murder of a young man in Fairfield. Her immediate thought was for Josh. She was filled with worry about how he would take the news - and started panicking in case he saw it in the newspapers first. She rushed out of the house to find him, so she could break the news gently. Alison eventually found him - he was ice skating. She brought him home, but when she told Josh his dad had been arrested again, she was met with a defensive tone. ""For what?"" he asked, shrugging it off as though it didn't bother him either way. But it did bother him. ""When I said the word 'murder', Josh just demolished the front room. He smashed everything up. He was crying, he was angry."" That was when, as Alison describes it, ""the nightmare began"". Josh as a baby, left, and dressed as a policeman, right (Picture: BBC Two) ""He was devastated,"" she says. ""His dad was 'the scum of the earth', as quoted in one newspaper. His dad had destroyed a young man's life."" After that, Alison says that Josh ""went through a really difficult time, and just kept getting into trouble"". But after a few years, things started getting better. When he was around 16, Josh discovered a passion for music. He threw himself into producing music - rap and grime - putting his heart and soul into every song he wrote. Going by the name Depzman, Josh became a big success - and was tipped to be the next big thing in grime. By the time he was 18, he was doing shows across the UK and flying out to Europe to perform. His album got to number one in the hip hop charts, and appeared on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Josh stood out because he rapped about positive things. Some of his songs were about how much he loved his mum, for example. Others, about how he missed his dad. With the money he got from the sales of his album, he bought his grandma flowers - tweeting photos with her to inspire his followers to show they loved their grans too. It worked - his replies were flooded with fans tweeting him similar photos with their own grandparents. A photo Josh tweeted, with the caption: 'Grandma means the world to me' (Picture: BBC Two) On 20 September 2013, Josh went to a concert in the Selly Oak suburb of Birmingham. It was a memorial concert dedicated to a friend of his, who had been stabbed and killed exactly one year beforehand. ""He left me here that evening,"" Alison says. ""His last words to me were, 'I love you mum.' Then he gave me a hug and a kiss, and said, 'I'll see you later.'"" At that concert, Josh was stabbed once in the chest. The knife attack proved fatal. He was rushed to Solihull Hospital, and passed away in the early hours of the morning. Now, Alison dedicates her time to preserving Josh's memory, giving talks at schools to prevent other kids from going down the same path as her son's killer. ""The 9mm parabellum [firearms cartridge on Gun No 6] was designed primarily for military use,"" Gareth Cooper, Ballistics Material Examiner for West Midlands Police, says. ""It's a penetrating round, above all else, which is designed to increase the rate at which the energy is dumped into the target - causing an increased rate of tissue damage. ""But effectively, pistol bullets all work by haemorrhagic effect. It's a question of rupturing as much body tissue - preferably critical body tissue - as possible."" In other words - Gun No 6 is a dangerous killing machine. ""A weapon like this on the streets is a worrying thing to us."" This gun has ruined lives and ripped families apart - both of the victims, and of those who pulled its trigger. All of these brutal shootings were in some way connected by this one handheld weapon. Gun No 6 has never been recovered. Credit: Getty Images Watch 'Gun No 6' on BBC iPlayer now. If you've been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, help is availablehere.

Rifts laid bare as G20 leaders meet,"This video can not be played Putin and the Saudi crown prince ""high five"" in Buenos Aires World leaders have held the opening session of their annual G20 summit, with any number of disputes and disagreements on the table. Host president, Argentina's Mauricio Macri, said the solution was ""dialogue, dialogue and dialogue"" and called for a clear message of shared responsibility. But US President Donald Trump has already cancelled meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. And huge differences remain on climate change, trade and the Khashoggi affair. The G20, made up of 19 of the world's most industrialised nations plus the EU, accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population. In pictures: World leaders gather Trump's trade war: Stakes are high at G20 Merkel's travel nightmare Its meetings, which began in 2008, are an opportunity for members to develop global policies tackling major issues - but many of the key decisions will be made in one-on-one encounters. There is massive security for the summit in Buenos Aires, with a bank holiday declared for Friday and the city's main business district shut down. Protesters angry at the money spent on the summit while Argentina struggles through tough austerity demonstrated outside the meeting. Analysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Meeting world leaders at the G20 summit was a test for Mohammed bin Salman to see who would snub him. He is the only Arab leader in the G20 and already stood out in his traditional dress amid a sea of suits. And at times he looked uncertain, even nervous. Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand. So the optics of the summit, to use the diplomatic jargon, were not that great for MBS. Read on The world leaders were all called on to the stage and assumed their position for the traditional family photograph. The G20 photo ahead of Friday's plenary session Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stood on the outside of the photo, far away from Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This is the crown prince's first major diplomatic test since the murder in Turkey of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the government. Saudi Arabia has blamed ""rogue agents"" but suspicion has fallen on the prince for ordering the killing. After the photo was taken, the crown prince did manage a hearty exchange with Mr Putin. French President Emmanuel Macron held a five-minute exchange with the crown prince during which, a French official said, Mr Macron had conveyed ""very firm"" messages over the Khashoggi affair. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr Trump had a ""friendly meeting"" with the crown prince, Saudi media said, although the president later said there had been ""no discussion"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May also met the crown prince. A Downing Street spokesman said the PM had ""stressed the importance of ensuring that those responsible for the appalling murder of Jamal Khashoggi are held to account"" and that ""such a deplorable incident"" should not happen again. In addition Mrs May held a 15-minute meeting to discuss trade with Mr Macri. Their two nations have long disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. Mr Macri's opening address to the summit admitted there would be issues of disagreement that needed to be managed. This video can not be played So how does a G20 summit work? He called for consensus on sustainable development, the future of work, food supply, climate change and international trade, adding: ""I am an optimist"". There are certain to be plenty of bilateral, trilateral or even larger get-togethers, although the one that will not be taking place is the highest-profile. Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putinbecause three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors seized by Russia in the Black Sea near Crimea had not been returned. ""We don't like what happened. Nobody does,"" he said on Friday. This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow regretted the decision. But he said: ""If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin. The second-highest profile meeting will also involve Mr Trump. He will have dinner on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The key issue there will be the nations' trade tariffs dispute. The US has hit a total of $250bn (Â£196bn) of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products. China said consensus was increasing on a deal but that differences remained. After earlier indicating pessimism on an agreement, Mr Trump said: ""They want to and we'd like to. There are some good signs. We'll see what happens."" Mr Putin has also weighed in, with a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First policy. The Russian president condemned ""dishonest competition"" along with ""vicious"" sanctions and protectionist measures. The Brics group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, issued a statement saying protectionism ran counter to the ""spirit and rules of the World Trade Organization"". Ahead of the summit's official startMr Trump signed a trade deal with the Mexican and Canadian leaders. Mr Trump described the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - which replaces the Nafta free trade deal - as ""probably the greatest trade deal ever"". ""All of our countries will benefit greatly,"" he said. European diplomats told Associated Press there has been tough haggling over a final statement. Argentine officials indicated differences on trade could be overcome. However, that will still leave the obstacle of climate change. This video can not be played Why have thousands of demonstrators been marching against the G20 summit in Buenos Aires? Mr Trump has not hidden his objection to collective action on the issue. UN chief Antonio Guterres said in Buenos Aires that ""this is a make-it-or-break-it moment"" on the issue. President Macron was quoted by AFP news agency as saying he would refuse to sign a trade deal with South America's Mercosur bloc if Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro withdrew from the Paris climate accord.

The making of a president,"Few men have arrived at the White House with a longer CV than George HW Bush. Besides his wartime exploits, he ran an oil company and the CIA and had been US ambassador to the United Nations as well as serving as US vice-president for eight years. It was in 1948 when George Herbert Walker Bush, newly graduated from Yale and the scion of an eastern establishment family, rode into Odessa, Texas, in a red Studebaker car to start a new career as an oilman. Initially, he worked as a salesman for Dresser Industries, a company which manufactured oil drilling equipment and which was owned by a friend of Bush's father. The years following World War II were a boom time for both the US economy and the Texas oil industry and, despite slumming it for a time in a shotgun shack, Bush and his family soon found their feet, developing a taste for Texan food and country and western music. Within three years, he had founded his own firm, the Bush-Overbey Oil Development Company, the first of a number of highly successful drilling ventures. The transition from wealthy Connecticut boy to wealthy Texan had been accomplished. Now Bush looked to secure himself a political career. In 1964 he ran, unsuccessfully, for a US Senate seat in Texas, which was then solidly Democratic. At the time, Bush was a radical Republican who supported the right-wing firebrand and presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, denounced civil rights and backed military action in Cuba. Two years later, running on decidedly more moderate policies, he was elected to the US House of Representatives as member for Texas's 7th District. He was director of the CIA for two years That election saw Bush steer away from ideology and, as he would do in every campaign from then on, talk mainly about his personal qualities and not, as he later called it, ""the vision thing"". At the time, he told one reporter: ""Labels are for cans."" Bush's progress in Congress was rapid and he soon found himself on the influential Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxes. Although he was again defeated for one of the Texas seats in the Senate in 1970, his closeness to then-President Richard Nixon soon secured him high office. In 1971, Bush became US ambassador to the United Nations, where he was involved in Nixon's policy to build bridges to China and also extricate the US from Vietnam. And 1973 saw Bush take over from Senator Bob Dole as chairman of the Republican National Committee. It was the time of Watergate and, as Richard Nixon's hold on the White House grew weaker, George Bush's position as a leading member of his party became ever stronger.

The following day, 8 August 1974, Nixon did just that. George HW Bush had proved a decisive player in the greatest downfall in US political history. Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, rewarded Bush with two plum jobs.

George HW Bush: The making of a president,"Few men have arrived at the White House with a longer CV than George HW Bush. Besides his wartime exploits, he ran an oil company and the CIA and had been US ambassador to the United Nations as well as serving as US vice-president for eight years. It was in 1948 when George Herbert Walker Bush, newly graduated from Yale and the scion of an eastern establishment family, rode into Odessa, Texas, in a red Studebaker car to start a new career as an oilman. Initially, he worked as a salesman for Dresser Industries, a company which manufactured oil drilling equipment and which was owned by a friend of Bush's father. The years following World War II were a boom time for both the US economy and the Texas oil industry and, despite slumming it for a time in a shotgun shack, Bush and his family soon found their feet, developing a taste for Texan food and country and western music. Within three years, he had founded his own firm, the Bush-Overbey Oil Development Company, the first of a number of highly successful drilling ventures. The transition from wealthy Connecticut boy to wealthy Texan had been accomplished. Now Bush looked to secure himself a political career. In 1964 he ran, unsuccessfully, for a US Senate seat in Texas, which was then solidly Democratic. At the time, Bush was a radical Republican who supported the right-wing firebrand and presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, denounced civil rights and backed military action in Cuba. Two years later, running on decidedly more moderate policies, he was elected to the US House of Representatives as member for Texas's 7th District. He was director of the CIA for two years That election saw Bush steer away from ideology and, as he would do in every campaign from then on, talk mainly about his personal qualities and not, as he later called it, ""the vision thing"". At the time, he told one reporter: ""Labels are for cans."" Bush's progress in Congress was rapid and he soon found himself on the influential Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxes. Although he was again defeated for one of the Texas seats in the Senate in 1970, his closeness to then-President Richard Nixon soon secured him high office. In 1971, Bush became US ambassador to the United Nations, where he was involved in Nixon's policy to build bridges to China and also extricate the US from Vietnam. And 1973 saw Bush take over from Senator Bob Dole as chairman of the Republican National Committee. It was the time of Watergate and, as Richard Nixon's hold on the White House grew weaker, George Bush's position as a leading member of his party became ever stronger. Bush was Republican National Chairman when Gerald Ford was president As the Watergate crisis reached its climax, Bush wrote to Nixon, telling him bluntly: ""It is my considered judgement that you should now resign.""

Will more Remainers speak out?,"Theresa May is currently in Argentina for the G20 meeting of world leaders She might be 7,000 miles away, but Theresa May's colleagues at home - including those she promoted - have the capacity to ruin her night. Just as she was sitting down to at a glittering evening with her fellow world leaders, news broke that Sam Gyimah had just become the latest minister to quit over Brexit. He had a specific reason to leave. As a science minister,he was frustrated with arguments between the UK and the EU over the satellite programme Galileo. It's only today that the prime minister confirmed that the UK was giving up on those talks. But it is his overall verdict on Mrs May's Brexit compromise that will really hurt. May not ruling out second MPs' Brexit vote Why is there a row about Galileo? Labour gets behind bid to stop 'no-deal' Mr Gymiah was a Remainer, but an early backer of the prime minister and part of her leadership campaign back in 2018. However, his words are strong - this is not just a minor grump. He slams her agreement with the EU overall, judging that it is not in the national interest and sets up the country for failure, leaving us poorer, weaker, and less secure. He even says the idea of another referendum should not be dismissed, even if that means the legal process of departure, Article 50, has to be extended. Mr Gyimah said he would be voting against Mrs May's Breit deal There is some comfort overnight for Mrs May from Michael Gove, who as one of the leading voices in the Leave campaign is, belatedly perhaps, urging his Brexiteer colleagues to get onboard. In an article for the Daily Mail, Mr Gove warns that if they vote down the PM's compromise, Brexit itself is under threat. But this latest resignation is another sign of how hard it will be for the prime minister to pass the vote that could define her future. And perhaps while Brexiteer anger about the deal has been raging for weeks, more former Remainers are yet to voice their fears. One former minister suggested that ministers with doubts, of which there are many, may now be deciding to call time, saying, ""they are not prepared to go over the cliff for a rotten deal that will be voted down anyway"". It's not certain that will happen. But Mr Gyimah is one fewer vote for Mrs May's compromise deal, when she desperately needs every single one.

"Owl phobia woman wins damages from GPSally Brayshaw was left terrified of the birds after her GP religiously groomed her, a judge rules.Stoke & Staffordshire","A judge ruled Sally Brayshaw was entitled to more than Â£12,700 compensation from Dr Thomas O'Brien A woman who developed a crippling fear of owls after religious grooming by her doctor has won a damages claim. Sally Brayshaw, 54, was taken to religious meetings and told the devil was ""having a real go"" at her by GP Thomas O'Brien. She claimed the locum doctor, a Pentecostal Christian, suggested she was possessed by demons and advised her not to see a psychiatrist. A High Court judge ruled she was entitled to more than Â£12,700. Mrs Brayshaw, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was in pain following an operation when she went to see Dr O'Brien in August 2012. At a previous hearing, her lawyers told the court the GP ""commended to her a way of healing without medication"". Over the next six months Dr O'Brien engaged Mrs Brayshaw in a number of religious activities, taking her to services, giving her religious gifts and setting her television to the Gospel channel to ""soak"" her in religious content. On one occasion, Mrs Brayshaw said she was taken to a meeting where a preacher spoke of sacrificing an owl. The hearing was told Mrs Brayshaw developed a fear of owls after being taken to a meeting where a preacher spoke about sacrificing a bird This left her so terrified of the birds she could no longer look at a picture of one without becoming terrified. Mr Justice Martin Spencer said it was ""foreseeable"" Mrs Brayshaw might ""react adversely"", adding: ""By reason of his zealous promotion of the religious aspects, [Dr O'Brien] became blind to the medical aspects and thereby caused or contributed to the deterioration in the claimant's mental health."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Dr O'Brien took no part in the case and his whereabouts are unknown. He was investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC) andstruck off in 2015. The judge rejected Mrs Brayshaw's claim against the partners of Apsley Surgery, in Stoke-on-Trent, where Mr O'Brien worked as a locum.

'My parents were told to swap me for a boy',"Nargis now campaigns for women's education in her home country When Nargis Taraki became the fifth girl born to her parents in Afghanistan, her parents were told they should swap her with another baby in the village. Now 21, she has made it her life ambition to prove they were right to keep her. Nargis now campaigns for women's education and empowerment in her home country, and is one of theBBC's 2018 100 Women. In 1997 I opened my eyes to the world as my parents' fifth child, and their fifth girl. My father's sister, and other relatives, immediately put pressure on my mum to agree to my father taking a second wife. Taking a second or even third wife is not uncommon in Afghanistan, and is sometimes done because they believe a new wife could mean a new chance to have a male child. When she refused, they suggested that my father swap me for a boy. They even found a family in the village who was willing to give their boy away and take me. Swapping children is not something that is part of our culture, and I haven't heard of it happening before, but boys are more valued in Afghan society as the traditional family breadwinners. Nargis credits her father's support for her ability to get an education People deliberately said things to upset my mother and make her feel inferior for not having a son. Despite her refusal to part ways with me, some elders still kept approaching my father. But he had a completely different mentality. He told them he loved me, and he would one day prove to them that a daughter can achieve everything a son can. It was not an easy time for my father. He had a military background and a history of service in the previous Soviet-backed regime, and my native district at the time was controlled by people with religious or fundamentalist tendencies. So certain people in the village used to detest him and did not socialise with us. But my father believed in what he said, and he always stood by his word. Although there was pressure on my parents to swap me because I was a girl, it was a man who had the most positive impact on my character. Things got worse for us after Taliban militants took control of our district.  In 1998 my father had to flee to Pakistan and soon after that we joined him there. Jolie spotlights Afghan girls' plight 10 toughest places for girls to go to school Life there was not easy - but he managed to get work as a manager in a shoe factory. Perhaps the best thing to happen to my parents whilst in Pakistan was that they finally had a son, followed by my fifth sister. Nargis (left) with one of her sisters and younger brother In 2001, we all returned to Kabul after the Taliban regime was toppled. We didn't have a house of our own and had to live with my uncles. My sisters and I managed to keep going to school despite conservatism in our culture. I went on to study public policy and administration at Kabul University and graduated two years ago with the highest marks for that year. Throughout that time my father never stopped supporting me. A couple of years ago I went to watch a cricket game in Kabul with my sister. There weren't many women in the stadium and our photographs and videos were circulated on social media. People started criticising us and leaving negative comments, saying we were shameless to be in a stadium amongst men. Others said we were trying to spread adultery and were being paid by the Americans. Afghanistan women's football is 'life or death' From Afghan refugee to Man City striker When my father saw some of the comments on Facebook, he looked at me and said: ""My dear. You have done the right thing. I am glad you have annoyed some of these idiots. Life is short. Enjoy it as much as you can."" My father died of cancer earlier this year. In him, I lost someone whose constant support made me into the person that I am today, and I know he will always be with me. Nargis presenting a talk at a Forward Together Afghanistan event Three years ago I tried to open a school for girls in my native village in Ghazni. I talked to my father about it and he said it would be almost impossible because of cultural boundaries, and even boys have difficulties because of the security situation. My father thought giving it a name of a religious madrassa might have improved our chances. In the end I was unable to travel to my native village because it was simply too dangerous. One of my sisters and I still hope to achieve this goal one day. In the meantime, I volunteered for several years for NGOs in that part of the world, working for women's education, health and empowerment. I've also presented talks on a girl's right to go to school, university and to get a job. I've always dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford one day. When I look at international university rankings I always find Oxford in first or second position, and when I compare that with Kabul University I feel a bit sad - although that's not to say I'm not thankful I was able to go. Nargis has given talks on the importance of education I love to read in my spare time - an average of two to three books a week - and Paolo Coelho is my favourite author. In terms of marriage, I would like to choose someone myself and my family have given me permission to marry someone of my own choice. It would be great if I can find someone who has the same qualities as my father. I would want to spend the rest of my life with someone who has a similar attitude - who can support me and stand by my choices. Family is also important - sometimes you marry the best man out there but then you cannot adapt to his family. They will have to support me in what I want to do in my life. If they resist then I will try and change their minds. I believe in what I want to achieve in life and will not compromise.

'Why you shouldn't put a ring on it'VideoVideoFighting South Korea's spy cam porn'My parents were told to swap me for a boy'VideoVideoA place for women and pets to flee abuseVideoVideoThe female superbiker travelling the world,"Matilde is not married at the moment but she lives with her partner Media strategist Matilde SuescÃºn believes that the fairytale aspiration of a big expensive engagement ring is damaging for women. She believes this fantasy should be stopped, and writes forBBC 100 Womenabout why things need to change. I have been married twice in the past, and may marry again, but I have never had or wanted an engagement ring. I believe engagement rings are anti-feminist. They symbolise an attitude which is in complete antithesis to the idea of an independent woman - signifying that the woman with the ring belongs to another person. They are also a way of signifying status: the bigger the diamond, the greater apparent value they give to the woman wearing it. Why did women only get one day to propose? Do people spend a month's salary on a ring? All of my friends here in the US disagree with me. Most of them have diamond engagement rings, some bigger than others. And they usually show them off on social media and when we meet up and make fun of me. And it's not just my generation who find my ideas odd - my daughter makes fun of me too. She dreams of having a showy engagement ring. I try to understand her because I know it is part of the cultural context in which she was born, but I don't agree at all with that mentality. In fact, the whole ritual of proposing marriage bothers me. The pantomime of a man kneeling down and asking for a woman's hand seems absurd to me. It puts her in a passive role, and asking her in a very public way - such as live on stage or in front of cameras - makes her even more vulnerable.  It really is an eccentric act. Marrying someone is not just a romantic gesture - it is a mutual agreement. It has economic and legal implications. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre. One of our projects this year is the Freedom Trash Can. In 1968 feminist protestors encouraged women to throw their ""items of oppression"" in the bin, so we'll be asking our audiences what they would throw away as women today. If my ex-husbands had proposed I would have started laughing. But it never happened because it was more of a conversation - it was a mutual decision in both cases. Although women can of course take the lead and propose marriage themselves,it still rarely happens that way,external. Matilde was born in Colombia, where she says the culture is different I am concerned that society and the media seems to educate girls to dream, from when they are young, about the man who, to quote Beyonce, will ""Put a ring on it"". And those girls then grow up with this idea that married life will then solve all their problems. Instead of just aspiring to marriage and a ring, I think girls should aspire to be independent, to study and develop, to seek happiness for themselves. When I wrote something similar in my blog for El Tiempo, a newspaper in my native Colombia, readers called me a radical feminist and accused me of killing romance. But that is not true - I am a very romantic person. What I don't find romantic at all is waiting for a ""brave prince"" to come into my life with a ring. What I actually do find romantic is the idea that if I do get married at my age, it's simply a reflection of a profound commitment of loyalty and love to the other person.

'My parents were told to swap me for a boy'VideoVideoA place for women and pets to flee abuseVideoVideoThe female superbiker travelling the world,"Nargis now campaigns for women's education in her home country When Nargis Taraki became the fifth girl born to her parents in Afghanistan, her parents were told they should swap her with another baby in the village. Now 21, she has made it her life ambition to prove they were right to keep her. Nargis now campaigns for women's education and empowerment in her home country, and is one of theBBC's 2018 100 Women. In 1997 I opened my eyes to the world as my parents' fifth child, and their fifth girl. My father's sister, and other relatives, immediately put pressure on my mum to agree to my father taking a second wife. Taking a second or even third wife is not uncommon in Afghanistan, and is sometimes done because they believe a new wife could mean a new chance to have a male child. When she refused, they suggested that my father swap me for a boy. They even found a family in the village who was willing to give their boy away and take me. Swapping children is not something that is part of our culture, and I haven't heard of it happening before, but boys are more valued in Afghan society as the traditional family breadwinners. Nargis credits her father's support for her ability to get an education People deliberately said things to upset my mother and make her feel inferior for not having a son. Despite her refusal to part ways with me, some elders still kept approaching my father. But he had a completely different mentality. He told them he loved me, and he would one day prove to them that a daughter can achieve everything a son can. It was not an easy time for my father. He had a military background and a history of service in the previous Soviet-backed regime, and my native district at the time was controlled by people with religious or fundamentalist tendencies. So certain people in the village used to detest him and did not socialise with us. But my father believed in what he said, and he always stood by his word. Although there was pressure on my parents to swap me because I was a girl, it was a man who had the most positive impact on my character. Things got worse for us after Taliban militants took control of our district.  In 1998 my father had to flee to Pakistan and soon after that we joined him there. Jolie spotlights Afghan girls' plight 10 toughest places for girls to go to school Life there was not easy - but he managed to get work as a manager in a shoe factory. Perhaps the best thing to happen to my parents whilst in Pakistan was that they finally had a son, followed by my fifth sister. Nargis (left) with one of her sisters and younger brother In 2001, we all returned to Kabul after the Taliban regime was toppled. We didn't have a house of our own and had to live with my uncles. My sisters and I managed to keep going to school despite conservatism in our culture. I went on to study public policy and administration at Kabul University and graduated two years ago with the highest marks for that year. Throughout that time my father never stopped supporting me. A couple of years ago I went to watch a cricket game in Kabul with my sister. There weren't many women in the stadium and our photographs and videos were circulated on social media. People started criticising us and leaving negative comments, saying we were shameless to be in a stadium amongst men. Others said we were trying to spread adultery and were being paid by the Americans. Afghanistan women's football is 'life or death' From Afghan refugee to Man City striker When my father saw some of the comments on Facebook, he looked at me and said: ""My dear. You have done the right thing. I am glad you have annoyed some of these idiots. Life is short. Enjoy it as much as you can."" My father died of cancer earlier this year. In him, I lost someone whose constant support made me into the person that I am today, and I know he will always be with me. Nargis presenting a talk at a Forward Together Afghanistan event Three years ago I tried to open a school for girls in my native village in Ghazni. I talked to my father about it and he said it would be almost impossible because of cultural boundaries, and even boys have difficulties because of the security situation. My father thought giving it a name of a religious madrassa might have improved our chances. In the end I was unable to travel to my native village because it was simply too dangerous. One of my sisters and I still hope to achieve this goal one day. In the meantime, I volunteered for several years for NGOs in that part of the world, working for women's education, health and empowerment. I've also presented talks on a girl's right to go to school, university and to get a job. I've always dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford one day. When I look at international university rankings I always find Oxford in first or second position, and when I compare that with Kabul University I feel a bit sad - although that's not to say I'm not thankful I was able to go. Nargis has given talks on the importance of education I love to read in my spare time - an average of two to three books a week - and Paolo Coelho is my favourite author. In terms of marriage, I would like to choose someone myself and my family have given me permission to marry someone of my own choice. It would be great if I can find someone who has the same qualities as my father. I would want to spend the rest of my life with someone who has a similar attitude - who can support me and stand by my choices. Family is also important - sometimes you marry the best man out there but then you cannot adapt to his family. They will have to support me in what I want to do in my life. If they resist then I will try and change their minds. I believe in what I want to achieve in life and will not compromise.

'I got paid less for doing the same work'Resolution Foundation finds agency workers are paid ÃÂ£400 a year less than directly employed colleaguesBusiness,"Connor McCann works in a BT call centre in Canterbury but despite doing the same role as his colleagues was paid thousands less a year. That's because the 24-year-old was employed by agency Manpower and not BT. ""It didn't matter how good you are at your job, you're still being paid less than your colleagues,"" he said. New research finds the 950,000 UK workers employed through an agency, like Mr McCann, earn more than Â£400 a year less than those employed directly. The Resolution Foundation figure includes wages as well as other benefits such as unclaimed holiday or sick pay, and deductions for uniforms. That's more than the number of people on zero-hours contracts, according to the think-tank. ""I was speaking to the exact same customers and selling the exact same products, so it felt really unfair,"" Mr McCann said. ""It meant I struggled to move out of my family home. I struggled with my bills and my social life, too."" Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Agency work has been largely absent from recent discussions about the modern world of work, despite almost a million people being employed via an agency. ""As well as reforming poor regulation, the government should stamp out unlawful practices through tougher, targeted enforcement work."" The foundation is concerned that many agency staff are unaware of their contract rights, with Â£500m in unpaid holiday pay and 500,000 eligible for pension auto-enrolment who are not signed up to schemes. Its research, which is based on official ONS data, found that agency staff are more likely to be employed in lower wage roles across a wide range of professions. Further, when the Resolution Foundation compared the pay of two similar individuals of the same age and background, working in the same kind of business, those employed by an agency received 22p an hour less than those directly employed. That adds up to Â£422 over the course of a year. Connor McCann works for a BT call centre in Canterbury The think-tank wants contracts - so-called Pay Between Assignment - to be outlawed because they give firms a legal way to avoid equal pay obligations. It also argues that specialist government taskforces should be set up in hotspots such as Barking and Dagenham, Leicester and North East Lincolnshire, where there is a high proportion of agency work. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, which represents the industry, says that agency work is vital to both workers and companies. ""While very short-term temps can be paid differently to long-term employees of a company, the law rightly states that after 12 weeks on the job pay should be the same,"" a spokesperson said. ""With many assignments lasting a few days or weeks, it is no surprise that some pay differences exist when comparing these temps with experienced staff who have an ongoing relationship with the business."" The REC's latest survey data showed two thirds of employers paid agency workers the same or more than permanent staff. A spokesperson for Manpower says the company ""ensures that it is always compliant with appropriate regulations and best practice and welcomes any move by Government to stamp out malpractice in support of temporary workers."" There has been a happy ending for Mr McCann at least. The Communications Union worked with Manpower and BT to bring the team of agency workers in-house, which increased his salary from about Â£15,000 to more than Â£21,000. ""It's the difference between going out to get a coffee or getting a taxi home on a night out, or even going to see family back in Dublin,"" Mr McCann. ""Moving on to a contract meant I could start putting money aside and put more into a pension and think about my long-term future."" Everyone should be paid National Minimum or Living Wage - depending on age All workers are eligible for statutory sick, holiday and maternity or paternity pay Everyone is protected from unlawful deductions from wages and discrimination Everyone is entitled to be enrolled into a pension if they meet the criteria No one should work more than 48 hours a week unless they opt out No one should be charged direct or indirect fees for finding a job No one should be prevented from working elsewhere From day one, agency workers should: Get access to the same facilities such as canteens, crÃ¨che or car parks Be made aware of any job vacancies After 12 weeks, agency workers should: Get the equal pay as a permanent employee Get equal treatment on breaks, holidays and hours Gig workers promised rights crackdown Workers 'exploited' by 'umbrella firms' Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Madrid bans old cars to cut pollutionDriving restrictions introduced in the Spanish capital aim to reduce air pollution by up to 40%.Europe,"The measures in Spain's capital prioritise cyclists and pedestrians ahead of motorists Spanish authorities have introduced new driving restrictions in the centre of the country's capital, Madrid, aimed at reducing air pollution by up to 40%. The tough measures mean motorists will have to test their vehicles' emissions, with the oldest and most polluting vehicles banned from the city centre. Drivers entering the controlled zone in breach of the rules will ultimately have to pay a fine of â¬90 (Â£80). The move is also to help reduce noise and encourage more cycling in the city. Madrid City Council estimates that the project, which was launched on Friday and labelled Madrid Central, will affect about 20% of the cars that enter the city centre. The new rules imposed on Madrid's busy city centre form part of a plan by Spanish authorities to create a cleaner environment by prioritising cyclists, pedestrians, and the use of public transport. Restrictions for those entering the designated low emission zone vary depending on the type of vehicle and its ""label"", which is issued following emissions tests. For example, hybrid cars with an ""eco label"" are permitted to drive freely in the centre and use public or designated car parks with no time restrictions. Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Air pollution: Half a million early deaths in Europe However, diesel vehicles produced prior to 2006 and petrol vehicles prior to 2000 will not receive a label and can only enter the zone if they are registered in advance and have access to private parking. From 2020, these vehicles will not be permitted to enter the emissions zone. Meanwhile, residents who live within the controlled zone can drive freely at any time once registered, but can only park on their own street. The Madrid Central area, which is marked with red lines on road surfaces and signs displaying red circles at the point of entry, is being policed with surveillance cameras. Motorists pass red road markings and a sign that reads: ""Madrid Central"" Concerns about the impact of exhaust pollutants emitted from older vehicles and diesel engines have risen in recent years. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that millions of deaths around the world every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. Diesel engines contribute to the problem in two key ways - through the production of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Very fine soot PM can penetrate the lungs and can contribute to cardiovascular illness and death. Back in 2016, the mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena, said the issue needed to be addressed urgently in order to improve the health of ""our children, our grandparents and our neighbours"". Madrid is not the only capital city to focus on improving its air quality. Paris, Mexico City and Athens have all pledged to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025. Measures implemented by other cities include: Paris Banning cars built prior to 1997 from entering the city centre during weekdays between 08:00 and 20:00 An additional ban on all diesel vehicles registered before 2001 A strategy to phase out older vehicles and remove all diesels from the centre, while offering generous subsidies for other forms of transport Plan to pedestrianise the city centre Stockholm Introduced a congestion charge for vehicles entering the centre Set up a park-and-ride bus service to encourage drivers to leave their vehicles on the outskirts Adopted an Urban Mobility Strategy initiative, investing in public transport systems buses, trams and the subway London Introduced a congestion charge for many vehicles entering the city centre Established a 24-hour low emission zone targeting diesel vehicles throughout the Greater London area To introduce an ""ultra-low emission zone"" promoting tighter exhaust emission standards in the city centre from April 2019 Set up ""Cycle Superhighways"" to make it safer to cycle throughout the city How can cities tackle air pollution?

Microsoft beats Apple for biggest market cap,"Bill Gates founded Microsoft. The firm's fortunes have rebounded in recent years Microsoft has unseated Apple to rank as the world's most valuable listed company, reclaiming the number one spot after more than 15 years. The software giant ended Friday with a market value of more than $851bn (Â£668bn) compared with Apple's $847bn. The two firms have been vying for top place all week, with Apple remaining ahead at the end of each trading day. But the iPhone maker, which has seen its share price plunge in recent weeks, finally lost its lead. On Friday, Microsoft shares gained more than 0.6% to close at $110.89, while Apple shares finished at $178.60, down about 0.5%. Apple's shares have fallen almost 25% since October - more steeply than the market overall - amid concerns about slowing smart phone demand and the possibility of additional US tariffs on Chinese-made goods. The sell-off has erased more than $200bn from the firm's market value, which is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of traded shares cited in the firms' most recent quarterly reports. Four reasons that Apple shares have been falling Why tech is taking a hammering By many measures - including annual revenue and profit - Apple remains the bigger company. For now, however, investors are betting that Microsoft's prospects are brighter. The firm's cloud services unit, which sells to other businesses, has driven the firm's growth in recent years. Apple, by contrast, depends on consumer spending, which investors are worried could slow. Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said Microsoft is poised for significant growth, as more companies sign up for the firm's cloud products. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is well-positioned to ""further transform [Microsoft] into a cloud behemoth over the coming years,"" he wrote in a research note. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has focused on cloud services Microsoft flourished in the 1990s and ranked as the world's most valuable company in the early 2000s. But the firm took a hit after a landmark anti-trust case and fell farther out of favour as mobile phones emerged to challenge desktop computers. In 2010,Apple overtook Microsoft as the most valuable technology firm. The iPhone maker unseated Exxon Mobil for the overall number one spot for the first time in 2011, and has held the title largely uninterrupted since. It became the first trillion dollar company in the US this summer, but lost that distinction this autumn as its share price started to plunge. What's gone wrong for Apple?
