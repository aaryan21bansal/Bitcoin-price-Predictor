'Frazzled' pharmacist mixed up pills,"The patient was prescribed Amitriptyline but a Boots pharmacy gave him Amlodipine A patient has described suffering ""horrendous"" symptoms for three days after a Boots pharmacy gave him the wrong medication. The 51-year-old was prescribed a drug to help with his insomnia, but was given one for high blood pressure with a similar name. He believes Boots pharmacy staff are overworked and this led to the mistake. Boots said the pharmacy in Basingstoke was ""fully staffed"" and it took patient safety ""very seriously"". The patient's symptoms lasted for three days and included a ""nasty, thumping, unbearable headache"" and ""constant nausea"". He contacted the BBC following an investigation into the Nottingham-based company, in which somepharmacy staff said they were under too much pressureand feared mistakes would be made. The man has been getting medication from the same pharmacy in Basingstoke every month for 14 years and said he had ""seen the pattern of them being overwhelmed"". The patient said he went through a ""horrendous"" experience after Boots gave him the wrong medication The person who gave him the wrong medication was ""looking a bit frazzled"", he said, and he ""chalked it up to them being really stressed"". WATCH: Boots: Pharmacists under Pressure? Boots pharmacists raise staffing concerns ""It is shocking that this happened to me, and what I went through was horrendous,"" said the patient. ""Had that been someone else who took different medication to me, they could have died as a result."" 14 December- The patient was given the wrong medication - amlodipine instead of amitriptyline - at a Boots pharmacy in Basingstoke, Hampshire. 17 December- He took two pills at bedtime but had a ""nagging doubt"" so googled the name, realised it was a completely different medication, then called 111 and was told he was on the ""borderline beginning of toxicity"". 18 December- He ""felt like someone was standing on my chest and I was having to take big deep breaths every few minutes throughout the entire night and following day as the medicine was making me feel like I couldn't catch my breath"". By the afternoon he was feeling the same symptoms ""with an added massive headache that had hit me when I woke up after a brief hour or so of sleep"". 19 December- His ""nasty, thumping, unbearable headache"" lasted until the afternoon and he ""couldn't sleep hardly at all"" during that time, ""had absolutely no appetite and felt a constant nausea"". 20 December- He still had a ""fuzzy muddled head"" feeling, a constant pain in his right calf and a shortness of breath that caused him to periodically take ""big deep sighing breaths to cope"". This type of a mistake is known as a ""dispensing error"". Three people died between May 2012 and November 2013 following dispensing errors at Boots pharmacies -Douglas Lamond, 86,who died in May 2012, Arlene Devereaux, who died on her 71st birthday in November 2012, andMargaret Forrest, 86, who died in November 2013. Inquests and a fatal accident inquiry were held into the deaths, and understaffing was not found to have contributed to any of them. Douglas Lamond, Arlene Devereux and Margaret Forrest died following dispensing errors at Boots pharmacies The Basingstoke patient said: ""From what I saw that day, when I was given the wrong medication, there clearly is a staffing issue. ""I noticed how the place was slammed with people waiting for their medication as does happen quite often. ""I noticed that as usual the queue went slowly because it seemed like the dispensing assistants at the counters were all mega busy."" Dr Rupert Payne from Bristol Medical School said it is ""very difficult to know"" whether the drug could have been fatal if the patient had carried on taking it, as patients can ""vary considerably in the side effects they get with drugs"". ""Virtually any drug is potentially fatal in overdose,"" he said. Dr Payne said 10mg of amlodipine would be a ""fairly standard dose"". The patient took two 10mg pills, and the sticker on the packet advised him to take up to three. ""If it was two 10mg tablets he had, that would be more than the recommended dose and would be more likely to cause side effects,"" said Dr Payne. ""Common side effects in the short term could include sleeping difficulties, dizziness, headache, flushing and racing heart."" Richard Bradley, pharmacy director for Boots UK, said: ""Boots takes patient safety very seriously and I was sorry to hear about [the patient's] experience. ""I can assure you that this incident was reported to the Superintendent Pharmacist's Office when it was highlighted to the pharmacy team in Basingstoke and a local investigation has been undertaken. ""Pharmacies are generally busier in the run up to Christmas as patients want to make sure they have their medicines, but this particular pharmacy was fully staffed. ""We have been in touch with [the patient] directly to apologise and discuss his concerns; we have learned from his experience to put further measures in place in the pharmacy to help prevent this type of mistake happening in the future.""

Three cars of attackers swooped in on the venue, located on the outskirts of Fortaleza, during the early hours of Saturday morning. Two minors are among the dead and several people were taken to hospital, including a 12-year-old boy. Local media said the attackers were part of a criminal gang involved in drug trafficking. The security secretary for Ceara state, Andre Costa, confirmed the deaths at the Forro do Gago club in a press conference. Brazil's problem with stray bullets Army sent into Rio favela to tackle violence An abandoned and burnt car thought to belong to the attackers ""There is no reason for panic and fear,"" Mr Costa was quoted by the Globo news network as saying. ""It is a one-off event, as occurs all over the world, with 50 or 60 deaths,"" he said, adding that the police could not have done anything to stop it.

Irish PM to campaign for abortion changes,"The prime minister of Ireland has told the BBC he will campaign for the country's near-total ban on abortion to be liberalised. Leo Varadkar had previously said the laws were ""too restrictive"". A referendum will take place this summer on whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans pregnancy terminations. The wording of the referendum question is yet to be decided. Ireland's eighth amendment places the right to life of an unborn child on a par with that of a mother, meaning abortion is banned even when the pregnancy is the result of rape or when the foetus has a fatal abnormality. Campaigners have long called for the laws to be changed, and last year a Citizens' Assembly and a cross-party parliamentary committee both recommended removing the ban. Leo Varadkar profile: Ireland's youngest PM Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice The committee recommended that abortions should be allowed without restriction up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. The Republic of Ireland has a near total ban on abortion. In 2013, abortion was permitted for the first time in the country under certain conditions - when doctors deem that a woman is at risk of taking her life, or that her life is at risk due to medical complications. This video can not be played Claire had to carry her pregnancy to full term and describes her experiences The law does not allow for terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality. The law was introduced in the wake of the case of an Indian woman, Savita Halappanavar,who died in a Galway hospital in 2012 after she was refused an abortion. The eighth amendment to the Republic's constitution, introduced in 1983, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"". In what was known as the X Case of 1992, a 14-year-old rape victim was initially prevented from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy. This ruling was overturned by the Irish Supreme Court and a referendum approved a further update to the constitution, stating that the eighth amendment did not restrict the freedom to travel to another state. In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Republic of Ireland addresses when accessing abortion services at clinics in England and Wales,external, according to UK Department of Health statistics.

One of world's oldest gorillas dies,"Vila was the head of five generations, the safari park said. One of the oldest gorillas in the world has died at the age of 60. San Diego Zoo Safari Park announced on Friday that Vila, who was born in the Congo in 1957, died surrounded by members of her family troop. She was the ""matriarch"", they said, of five generations. ""There are very few gorillas anywhere near that age,"" said Peggy Sexton, a lead animal keeper at the safari park in California. Gorillas typically live for 35-40 years. ""She will be missed by zoo members, guests, volunteers and staff,"" said Randy Riches, mammals curator at the safari park. The oldest gorilla living in the care of humans is thought to be 61-year-old Trudy at Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Like Vila, she was captured from the wild.A gorilla called Colo who died last yearwas at the time the oldest gorilla born in captivity.

All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed,"This video can not be played Liam Allan had been on bail for two years before his trial collapsed All current rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales are to be reviewed ""as a matter of urgency"" to ensure evidence has been disclosed. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders warned the review could see ""a number of cases"" dropped. It comes after the collapse of several rape trials because evidence had not been shared with defence lawyers. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said there had been a failure to share digital evidence in each of the cases. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said there was no evidence of ""widespread malpractice or dishonesty"", but police and prosecutors needed to get to grips with the way they handled electronic evidence. CPS chief insists justice system is working Collapsed rape trials could hamper convictions, says Lord Judge WATCH: Why disclosure failings can prove crucial In the lead up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case. However, the system has come under scrutiny after the collapse of a number of trials, heightening concerns that evidence is not being disclosed early enough - or that rules are not being followed. Concerns have also been raised that potentially key information taken from mobile phones, computers and social media is not being shared. The Crown Prosecution Service, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing have launched an ""improvement plan"" to tackle the issue. It will include reviewing training, developing specialist disclosure experts in every police force, and providing all multimedia evidence to the defence digitally. Ms Saunders - the most senior public prosecutor in England and Wales - said the steps would help to deal with ""deep-rooted and systemic"" disclosure issues which were of ""great concern"". ""Changes in society, such as the vastly increasing use of social media and mobile phone messaging, bring challenges that all parts of the criminal justice system, despite the resourcing challenges, must deal with,"" she said. ""We are taking steps to identify any individual cases of concern as a matter of urgency."" Ms Saunders said the CPS was taking steps to identify cases of concern as a matter of urgency Last week,a rape charge against Oxford University student Oliver Mears was droppedon the eve of his trial, after a diary which supported his case was uncovered. And in December,the trial of Liam Allan, who faced 12 counts of rape and sexual assault,was dropped when it emerged evidence on a computer disc - which police had looked through - showed messages from the alleged victim pestering him for ""casual sex"". Earlier this week, the BBC revealed the number of prosecutions in England and Wales that collapsed because of a failure by police or prosecutors to disclose evidence hadincreased by 70% in the last two years. Our correspondent said the review was ""unprecedented"" despite coming after years of warnings about disclosure issues by lawyers. He said the plan revealed little about how changes would be funded, or about whether there was scope for reviewing past convictions. It also begged the question of why the review was confined to rape and sexual assault cases when many believed problems of disclosure were systemic, he added. On Friday,the trial of three people held on trafficking and prostitution charges was stoppedafter it was discovered social media evidence had not been disclosed. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said that although he had not seen evidence of malpractice or dishonesty in the prosecution system, in some cases people were ""not doing their job properly"". ""But I think it also shows something else - what we're seeing over the last year or two or three, is a huge increase in the volume of particularly electronic material that features in criminal cases. ""There really is no excuse for investigators and prosecutors not getting to grips with social media traffic and text messages,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, the NPCC lead for criminal justice, said the disclosure of evidence had too often been seen as an ""administrative task"" finished at the end of a case, and now needed to be firmly embedded in the ""investigative mindset"". He said problems had been ""exacerbated by the rapid expansion of digital material involved in almost every case"". ""Reviews of recent cases have shown a range of issues leading to failures but there has been no intention by officers to conceal information,"" he added.

Taliban kill 95 with ambulance bomb,"This video can not be played How the attack unfolded A suicide bombing has killed at least 95 people and injured 158 others in the centre of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, officials say. Attackers drove an ambulance laden with explosives past a police checkpoint in a secure zone, home to government offices and foreign embassies. The Taliban have said they carried out the attack, the deadliest for months. US President Donald Trump called for ""decisive action"" against the group after the ""despicable"" bombing. A week ago, Taliban militants killed 22 people in a luxury Kabul hotel. Witnesses say the area - also home to offices of the European Union, a hospital anda shopping zone known as Chicken Street- was crowded with people when the bomb exploded on Saturday at about 12:15 local time (08:45 GMT). Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, said the attacker got through a security checkpoint after telling police he was taking a patient to nearby Jamhuriat hospital. He detonated the bomb at a second checkpoint, said Mr Rahimi. The BBC's Zia Shahreyar, speaking from the scene, says it is not easy to get through the checkpoints. Cars are searched and drivers' identities checked. He adds that questions will be asked about how the attacker got through. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the use of an ambulance was ""harrowing"". MP Mirwais Yasini told the BBCthe area looked like a butcher's shop afterwards. He was having lunch at his family home, just metres away, when the blast went off.  ""First of all we thought it was inside our house,"" he said. Then he went outside and saw scattered bodies. ""It is very, very inhumane."" Who are the Taliban? Four days behind the Taliban front line How Kabul's Chicken Street fell on hard times Another witness, a software engineer who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC he was about a kilometre (two thirds of a mile) away when he heard the noise. ""I saw a huge flame,"" he said. ""The smoke was pungent. It entered my eyes and I was not able to see for some time."" He said when he moved closer he saw the dead bodies, and it looked like a ""brutal graveyard"". ""It was a terrible moment. [The area] is completely destroyed."" The Afghan government has condemned the bombing as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan of providing support to the attackers. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and parts of neighbouring Pakistan. Pakistan denies supporting militants that carry out attacks in Afghanistan. This month,the US cut its security aid to Pakistan, saying it had failed to take action against terrorist networks on its soil. The injured and distressed were helped away from the scene In a statement, US President Donald Trump said: ""I condemn the despicable car bombing attack in Kabul today that has left scores of innocent civilians dead and hundreds injured. This murderous attack renews our resolve and that of our Afghan partners."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said: ""Indiscriminate attacks against civilians are a serious violation of human rights and humanitarian laws, and can never be justified."" In France, the Eiffel Tower turned off its lights at midnight on Saturday as a mark of respect for the dead and injured. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter: ""The city of Paris and Parisians are with the Afghan people who are once again facing terrorist barbarity,"" she said. The attack is the deadliest in Kabul in several months. In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. More than 150 people were wounded in the bombing The area of the attack was a scene of devastation Thehardline Islamic Taliban movementswept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and were ousted by the US-led invasion five years later, but returned to run some key areas In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted - since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today In 2016, Afghan civilian casualties hit a new high- a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban Civilian casualties remained at high levels in 2017,external, the UN said A plume of smoke from the explosion was seen around the city Kabul hospitals were overwhelmed with patients in the aftermath Ambulance suicide bomb: What we know.

"Ministers promise Brexit 'continuity'UK firms will still trade under ""unchanged"" EU rules after March 2019, they say in a joint letter.3h3 hours agoUK Politics","David Davis, Greg Clark and Philip Hammond signed the joint open letter UK firms will continue to trade under ""unchanged"" EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period, three cabinet ministers have said in a letter. Chancellor Philip Hammond, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Business Secretary Greg Clark said access to EU markets would continue on current terms from March 2019 for ""around two years"". The open letter to business leaders,externalfollows Tory party rifts over Brexit. Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg said that would amount to ""Brexit in name only"". The letter, addressed to ""business leaders"", said existing rules and regulations would still apply during the UK's Brexit transition, or ""implementation period"". The duration of that period will be ""strictly time-limited"" and will last about two years, they said in the letter. Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Davis plays down Tory row over Brexit transition Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit ""In order that our terms of trade remain unchanged during the implementation period, it will need to be based on the existing structure of EU rules and regulations,"" the three ministers wrote. ""Our intention is to mimic the breadth of our current arrangements, from goods to agriculture to financial services, meaning that every business, small or large, will be able to go on trading with the EU as it does today until it's time to make any changes necessary for the future partnership."" BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the letter had sought to reassure employers ""nervous about the implications of Brexit"". He said it also came after ""a blast of internal turbulence"" within the Conservative Party over the issue of Brexit. This video can not be played David Davis said there was no difference over Brexit aims Earlier this week, backbench Tories criticised Mr Hammond for saying that changes to UK-EU relations could be ""very modest"". Mr Rees-Mogg, a Eurosceptic Conservative MP, called for a fundamental change in ministers' tone on Brexit, accusing UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Rees-Mogg warned Prime Minister Theresa May: ""The less of Brexit you get, the more likely you are to get Jeremy Corbyn."" He told her that ""the leader is important, [but] the party is more important"". ""If everything is delayed for two years and then there's high alignment you will find that by 2022 no-one will have noticed any difference from having left,"" he added. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clark dismissed those who criticised having an implementation period. He said the UK was ""absolutely, unambiguously"" still leaving the EU. But he added: ""Businesses all across the country have been very clear - large businesses, but small business as well - that we need to take the time to adjust to the new regime."" Jacob Rees-Mogg said the party was more important than the party leader On Friday, Brexit secretary Mr Davis set out his ambitions for an ""implementation period"" immediately after the UK leaves the EU, in March 2019.

Three arrests in jeweller murder probe,"Ramniklal Jogiya's body was found in Stoughton, Leicestershire, on Thursday morning Three men have been arrested on suspicion of kidnap and murder after the death of a Leicester jeweller. Ramniklal Jogiya was discovered in Gaulby Lane, Stoughton, at about 10:00 GMT on Thursday. Three men, aged 19, 20 and 23, and all from Leicester, have been arrested and remain in custody. Leicestershire Police said they believed Mr Jogiya was ""taken against his will"" after a break-in at his shop on Belgrave Road on Wednesday. A person was seen on CCTV in the jewellers with a shopping trolley after Mr Jogiya locked up Police have also released a CCTV image of a person seen pulling a shopping trolley and wearing a burkha in the shop just minutes after Mr Jogiya locked up on Wednesday evening. Det Ch Insp David Swift-Rollinson said: ""Whoever that is seen on CCTV entering the jewellers a short while after Mr Jogiya had locked up and left, is clearly someone I need to identify quickly. ""To protect my investigation, I'm not willing to say how I believe that person got into the jewellers - but I do want to hear from anyone who was in Belgrave Road between 7.30pm and 8pm last Wednesday evening and who may have seen this individual, seen Mr Jogiya or any vehicles that were being driven suspiciously."" He said Mr Jogiya, who was reported missing after failing to return home from work on Wednesday, had suffered severe injuries in a ""savage and heartbreaking"" attack. A post-mortem examination has been carried out but further tests were being conducted to ""absolutely establish the cause of death"", police said. Police have released CCTV footage of Mr Jogiya leaving his shop Supt Shane O'Neil said ""high-profile"" police patrols were being carried out in the Belgrave Road area over the weekend. ""The business community and local residents are understandably shocked and worried about this awful crime,"" he said. A special meeting was also planned for Monday to discuss safety concerns from the community after Mr Jogiya's death, he added.

Biggest ever digital currency 'theft',"Coincheck representatives looked numb when they faced journalists One of Japan's largest digital currency exchanges says it has lost some $534m (Â£380m) worth of virtual assets in a hacking attack on its network. Coincheck froze deposits and withdrawals for all crypto-currencies except Bitcoin as it assessed its losses in NEM, a lesser-known currency. It may be unable to reimburse the funds lost on Friday, a representative told Japanese media. If the theft is confirmed, it will be the largest involving digital currency. Another Tokyo exchange, MtGox, collapsed in 2014 after admitting that $400m had been stolen from its network. The stolen Coincheck assets were said to be kept in a ""hot wallet"" - a part of the exchange connected to the internet. That contrasts with a cold wallet, where funds are stored securely offline. Coincheck says it has the digital address of where the assets were sent. Cyber-thieves cash in on Bitcoin boom Hack attack shuts Youbit exchange Bitcoin boom boosts graphics card prices Hackers broke in at 02:57 on Friday (17:57 GMT Thursday), the company said in a statement,external, but the breach was not discovered until 11:25, nearly eight and a half hours later. Company chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka said 523m NEMs had been sent from Coincheck's NEM address during the breach. ""It's worth 58bn yen based on the calculation at the rate when detected,"" he told reporters at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Coincheck Inc is based in Tokyo Coincheck was still examining how many customers had been affected and trying to establish whether the break-in had been launched from Japan or another country. ""We know where the funds were sent,"" Mr Otsuka added. ""We are tracing them and if we're able to continue tracking, it may be possible to recover them."" Coincheck reported the incident to the police and to Japan's Financial Services Agency. NEM, the 10th-largest crypto-currency by market value, fell 11% over a 24-hour period to 87 cents, as of 18:30, Bloomberg news agency reports.,external Among the other crypto-currencies, Bitcoin dropped 3.4% and Ripple retreated 9.9% on Friday, according to prices seen by the agency. More was lost on Friday than in 2014, whenMtGox lost what it thought was 850,000 bitcoins. However, MtGox later found 200.000 bitcoins in an old digital wallet. ""In a worst-case scenario, we may not be able to return clients' assets,"" an unnamed Coincheck representative was quoted as saying on Saturday by Japan's Kyodo news agency. After the collapse of MtGox shook the digital currency world, a licensing system was introduced in Japan to increase oversight of local currency exchanges such as Coincheck. ""What's the lasting impact? It's hard to tell,"" Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, told Bloomberg. ""Japan is one of the most pro-crypto trading countries, among the G-20. In Japan they don't really want a wholesale clampdown. So it will be interesting how Japanese regulators respond to this, if they indeed do."" 50 Cent discovers his Bitcoin millions Founded in 2012, the company is based in Tokyo, where it employed 71 people as of August last year. Its headquarters are located in the city's Shibuya district, an area popular with start-ups that was also home to MtGox, Bloomberg reports. Last year, Coincheck began running adverts on national television featuring popular local comedian Tetsuro Degawa, the agency adds. Kunihiko Sato, a 30-year-old customer from Tokyo, told Kyodo he had deposited about 500,000 yen ($4,600), into his account with the exchange. ""I never thought this kind of thing would happen with Japan's developed legislation,"" he said. Whereas money is printed by governments or traditional banks, digital currencies are generated  through a complex process known as ""mining"". Transactions are then monitored by a network of computers across the world using a technology called blockchain. There are thousands of them, largely existing online, unlike the notes or coins in your pocket. It may be more useful to think of them as assets, rather than digital cash. The vast majority of Bitcoin holders, for instance, appear to be investors. But the anonymity that crypto-currencies afford has also attracted criminals. The value of a crypto-currency is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell them for.

Second-hand toys 'could harm children',"Plastic used in some second-hand toys could pose a health risk for children as they don't meet the most up-to-date safety guidelines, a study has found. Scientists tested 200 used plastic toys they found in nurseries, thrift shops and homes across England's south-west for nine hazardous elements. Twenty toys had traces of all nine elements, with some concentrations high enough to fail European standards. But experts said it would be difficult to quantify the risk. ""Lego bricks from the 70s and 80s are the big fail,"" said Dr Andrew Turner, of the University of Plymouth, who conducted thestudy.,external""Toys in those days weren't tested and now we're using them and handing them down."" For the study, published in Environmental Science and Technology, Dr Turner and his team used X-ray fluorescence technology to analyse a host of toys - from cars and trains to figures and puzzles. All the toys were of the size that could be chewed by young children. They discovered high concentrations of hazardous elements including antimony, barium, bromine, cadmium, chromium, lead and selenium. These chemicals can be chronically toxic if children are exposed to them at a low level over an extended period of time. If the children put the toys in their mouths, they would be exposed to greater levels of these chemicals. Dr Turner conducted a separate analysis on 26 of these toys to see if they comply with limits set by theEuropean Council's Toy Safety Directive.,externalTen failed this test because they were secreting too much bromine, cadmium or lead. Red, yellow or black plastics were the worst offenders. Dr Turner said: ""Second-hand toys are an attractive option to families because they can be inherited directly from friends or relatives or obtained cheaply and readily from charity stores, flea markets and the internet."" But he said new regulations do not cover the recycling or resale of older toys. Dr Turner said: ""Consumers should be made more aware of the potential risks associated with small, mouthable and brightly coloured old plastic toys or components. ""Without that, the attractive cost, convenience and recyclability of previously used toys has the potential to create a legacy of chemical contamination for younger children."" Prof Andrew Watterson, of the University of Stirling, who was not involved in the research, said: ""Cadmium is a carcinogen and any uptake should be avoided if possible because of chronic effects. ""So these second-hand toys, especially of particular colours may present a risk, but it will be difficult to quantify it."" He said a ""precautionary approach to their sale would therefore be wise"" especially since ""the exposed socio-economic population may also be more likely to come into more contact with other environmental sources of these substances like lead and cadmium than children who get 'new' toys."" Mark Gardiner, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: ""Any goods that are bought second-hand are not going to have the same safety assurances. ""Parents should weigh up these risks, especially when giving their children toys that are very old and could have also mechanically deteriorated over time."" Mr Gardiner said that ""if the toys do indeed pose a risk to children"" then ""the products can be removed from the market"". He added: ""If parents are concerned then the advice would be to take them away.""

"Ministers promise Brexit 'continuity'UK firms will still trade under ""unchanged"" EU rules after March 2019, they say in a joint letter.5m5 minutes agoUK Politics","David Davis, Greg Clark and Philip Hammond signed the joint open letter UK firms will continue to trade under ""unchanged"" EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period, three cabinet ministers have said in a letter. Chancellor Philip Hammond, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Business Secretary Greg Clark said access to EU markets would continue on current terms from March 2019 for ""around two years"". The open letter to business leaders,externalfollows Tory party rifts over Brexit. Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg said that would amount to ""Brexit in name only"". The letter, addressed to ""business leaders"", said existing rules and regulations would still apply during the UK's Brexit transition, or ""implementation period"". The duration of that period will be ""strictly time-limited"" and will last about two years, they said in the letter. Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Davis plays down Tory row over Brexit transition Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit ""In order that our terms of trade remain unchanged during the implementation period, it will need to be based on the existing structure of EU rules and regulations,"" the three ministers wrote. ""Our intention is to mimic the breadth of our current arrangements, from goods to agriculture to financial services, meaning that every business, small or large, will be able to go on trading with the EU as it does today until it's time to make any changes necessary for the future partnership."" BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the letter had sought to reassure employers ""nervous about the implications of Brexit"". He said it also came after ""a blast of internal turbulence"" within the Conservative Party over the issue of Brexit. This video can not be played David Davis said there was no difference over Brexit aims Earlier this week, backbench Tories criticised Mr Hammond for saying that changes to UK-EU relations could be ""very modest"". Mr Rees-Mogg, a Eurosceptic Conservative MP, called for a fundamental change in ministers' tone on Brexit, accusing UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Rees-Mogg warned Prime Minister Theresa May: ""The less of Brexit you get, the more likely you are to get Jeremy Corbyn."" He told her that ""the leader is important, [but] the party is more important"". ""If everything is delayed for two years and then there's high alignment you will find that by 2022 no-one will have noticed any difference from having left,"" he added. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clark dismissed those who criticised having an implementation period. He said the UK was ""absolutely, unambiguously"" still leaving the EU. But he added: ""Businesses all across the country have been very clear - large businesses, but small business as well - that we need to take the time to adjust to the new regime."" Jacob Rees-Mogg said the party was more important than the party leader On Friday, Brexit secretary Mr Davis set out his ambitions for an ""implementation period"" immediately after the UK leaves the EU, in March 2019. In his speech, Mr Davis said that the UK would be able to sign new trade deals in the ""implementation"" period. Eurosceptic Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin told the BBC it would be easier for the PM if Mr Hammond and other cabinet ministers ""stuck to her script"".

Cape Town urged to turn off toilet tapsResidents will be banned from using more than 50 litres of water a day from next month.19h19 hours agoAfrica,"From next month residents in Cape Town will be limited to 50 litres of water per day Residents in the South African city of Cape Town have been warned to ""save water as if your life depends on it"" to avoid the supply being shut off. A severe drought has forced the city's municipality to limit consumption to 50 litres (11 gallons) per person per day. Officials are urging people to switch off their toilet cisterns and limit flushing to conserve water. The head of the provincial government said if the taps ran dry it would be ""the disaster above all disasters"". Helen Zille said it was still possible to avoid what has become known as Day Zero, when the water supply will be shut off. She said a full crisis could still be averted if everyone used 50 litres or fewer a day. ""That is not difficult if we all put our minds to it in our homes and in our workplaces,"" she said.

Ms Zille then offered some suggestions on how to save water. ""Turn off the tap of your toilet cistern and use all of the grey water in your house from washing, save it, and put it into your toilet cistern"", she said. ""No-one should be showering more than twice a week at this stage. You need to save water as if your life depends on it because it does."" Last year, Ms Zille revealed that she was showering once every three days. ""I regard oily hair in a drought to be as much of a status symbol as a dusty car,"" she wrote in a column. Cape Town, a popular tourist destination, has been hit by its worst drought in a century. Much of southern Africa has been recovering from a drought caused by the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon, following heavy summer rains. However, Cape Town is still gripped by a drought and has had very low rainfall for the past three years. Mohammed Allie, BBC News, Cape Town My wife does not use the shower any more. Instead, she boils about 1.5 litres of water and mixes it with about a litre of tap water to have her daily wash while the rest of us catch the slow running water in a bucket for re-use in the toilet cistern. Like most residents of Cape Town, my household of four has had to change our habits to conserve water. A bucket and jug have now become essential tools for me and my children when taking a quick two-minute shower. Read more from Mohammed here Last week, Mayor Patricia de Lille warned the city had reached a ""point of no return"". ""We can no longer ask people to stop wasting water. We must force them,"" she said at a press conference. ""Despite our urging for months, 60% of Capetonians are callously using more than 87 litres per day,"" she added, referring to the current daily limit. A person uses about 15 litres per minute for a typical shower and the same amount when flushing a standard toilet, according to WaterWise, a South African water usage awareness campaign.

US ruling 'relief' for Bombardier workers,"This video can not be played Bombardier's Belfast workforce was not going to back down, said Unite's Susan Fitzgerald Politicians and union leaders have welcomed a ruling which stops the US imposing huge 292% import tariffs on planes partly made by British workers. Over a thousand jobs in Belfast depend on the success of the C-Series passenger jet, which is manufactured by Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""good news"" for UK industry. Trade union Unite said workers in Northern Ireland ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief"". Bombardier had been widely expected to fail in its bid to overturn a ruling by the US Commerce Department in December that the UK and Canada had given it unfair subsidies. But the case, centred on a complaint by US rival Boeing, was dismissed by the US International Trade Commission (ITC). Mrs May welcomed the decision, saying: ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy."" Gavin Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for East Belfast, said it had been a ""very difficult time"" for the firm's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland who had ""faced an uncertain future"". He added: ""Bombardier's greatest strength here in Belfast is the quality of those workers and the product they deliver."" Bombardier ruling Q&A Reaction to surprise Bombardier ruling Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said Bombardier workers ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief that the International Trade Commission has seen through Boeing's baseless complaint"". The ITC voted 4-0 in favour of Bombardier, ruling that there was no injury to US manufacturers. Tariffs of 292% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by US airlines. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. The wings for the plane are made by 1,000 workers in Belfast. The BBC's business correspondent, Theo Leggett, said the move came as ""a big surprise"" as ""most analysts thought the odds were stacked against Bombardier"". ""It is good news for workers at Bombardier's Belfast plant, where parts for the C-Series are made, but it's also good news for Airbus, which took advantage of Bombardier's struggles to take a majority stake in the C-Series."" A spokesperson for Bombardier said the ITC's decision was ""a victory for innovation, competition and the rule of law."" ""Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom."" Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary said it was ""the right decision"" A spokesperson for Boeing said it was ""disappointed"" by the ITC's decision and that it would ""review the detailed conclusions when they are released"". But Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian governments working hand in hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this."" It was ""excellent news for the dedicated workforce in Northern Ireland and supply chain across the UK, who have a great future ahead,"" he added. Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader Michelle O'Neill said the ruling was a ""welcome victory"" for the Belfast workforce and she hoped ""the matter was now closed"".

Taliban kill 40 with ambulance bomb,"This video can not be played How the attack unfolded A suicide bombing has killed at least 95 people and injured 158 others in the centre of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, officials say. Attackers drove an ambulance laden with explosives past a police checkpoint in a secure zone, home to government offices and foreign embassies. The Taliban have said they carried out the attack, the deadliest for months. US President Donald Trump called for ""decisive action"" against the group after the ""despicable"" bombing. A week ago, Taliban militants killed 22 people in a luxury Kabul hotel. Witnesses say the area - also home to offices of the European Union, a hospital anda shopping zone known as Chicken Street- was crowded with people when the bomb exploded on Saturday at about 12:15 local time (08:45 GMT). Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, said the attacker got through a security checkpoint after telling police he was taking a patient to nearby Jamhuriat hospital. He detonated the bomb at a second checkpoint, said Mr Rahimi. The BBC's Zia Shahreyar, speaking from the scene, says it is not easy to get through the checkpoints. Cars are searched and drivers' identities checked. He adds that questions will be asked about how the attacker got through. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the use of an ambulance was ""harrowing"". MP Mirwais Yasini told the BBCthe area looked like a butcher's shop afterwards. He was having lunch at his family home, just metres away, when the blast went off.  ""First of all we thought it was inside our house,"" he said. Then he went outside and saw scattered bodies. ""It is very, very inhumane."" Who are the Taliban? Four days behind the Taliban front line How Kabul's Chicken Street fell on hard times Another witness, a software engineer who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC he was about a kilometre (two thirds of a mile) away when he heard the noise. ""I saw a huge flame,"" he said. ""The smoke was pungent. It entered my eyes and I was not able to see for some time."" He said when he moved closer he saw the dead bodies, and it looked like a ""brutal graveyard"". ""It was a terrible moment. [The area] is completely destroyed."" The Afghan government has condemned the bombing as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan of providing support to the attackers. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and parts of neighbouring Pakistan. Pakistan denies supporting militants that carry out attacks in Afghanistan. This month,the US cut its security aid to Pakistan, saying it had failed to take action against terrorist networks on its soil. The injured and distressed were helped away from the scene In a statement, US President Donald Trump said: ""I condemn the despicable car bombing attack in Kabul today that has left scores of innocent civilians dead and hundreds injured. This murderous attack renews our resolve and that of our Afghan partners."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said: ""Indiscriminate attacks against civilians are a serious violation of human rights and humanitarian laws, and can never be justified."" In France, the Eiffel Tower turned off its lights at midnight on Saturday as a mark of respect for the dead and injured. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter: ""The city of Paris and Parisians are with the Afghan people who are once again facing terrorist barbarity,"" she said. The attack is the deadliest in Kabul in several months. In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. More than 150 people were wounded in the bombing The area of the attack was a scene of devastation Thehardline Islamic Taliban movementswept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and were ousted by the US-led invasion five years later, but returned to run some key areas In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted - since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today In 2016, Afghan civilian casualties hit a new high- a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban Civilian casualties remained at high levels in 2017,external, the UN said A plume of smoke from the explosion was seen around the city Kabul hospitals were overwhelmed with patients in the aftermath Ambulance suicide bomb: What we know.

Three teenagers killed in bus stop crash,"Three teenage boys were killed when a car hit them near a bus stop in west London on Friday evening in what police have called a ""horrific"" crash. Two of the boys, who were aged 16 and 17 and had been heading to a birthday party, have been named locally as Harry Louis Rice and George Wilkinson. The crash happened in Shepiston Lane, Hayes, near a petrol station. A man, 28, who was in the Audi involved in the crash, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. The suspect was detained by members of the public, and was then taken to hospital for treatment before going to a north London police station for questioning. At least one other male is reported to have left the car following the collision. Police said they were doing everything they could to establish the full facts and trace everybody involved. A black Audi car is believed to have mounted the pavement before crashing into a lamp post The boys' next of kin have been informed, and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. The victims have yet to be formally identified, the Met Police said. Other teenagers who were standing with the boys were uninjured. Friends who left flowers at the scene on Saturday said the teenagers were going to a 16th birthday party. Police were called to the scene at 20:41 GMT on Friday A crowd gathered on Shepiston Lane to pay tribute to the boys Staff at the nearby Esso garage said a group had been fighting at the entrance to the forecourt just before the crash. It is believed the Audi was travelling at high speed before it mounted the pavement just outside the entrance and travelled a few yards down the road before hitting a lamp post. Three energy drink bottles were left at the scene along with flowers One person who passed the crash scene said he saw friends of the victims help a fast-response paramedic get equipment from the car. Amamdeep Matharoo, 27, said: ""The lads were shouting on the phone. They were saying 'three of our friends are dead'. They were hysterical and in pieces."" Tony Kitchin, 44, who works as a security guard at a haulage firm nearby, said: ""This road is busy 24/7. It's a speed trap. ""I'm really surprised we haven't had more horrific accidents like this. ""No parent should have to deal with that. My heartfelt sympathies go out to the family and friends of the people who lost their lives last night."" Det Sgt Jane Shaw, from the Met's serious collision investigation unit, said: ""There are horrific circumstances that have resulted in three young people losing their lives."" She appealed for anyone who saw what happened to contact the police. Temporary road closures have now been lifted.

Who are the Taliban?,"Taliban security guards in Kabul, a year on from their triumphant return to power The Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021, two decades after being removed from power by a US-led military coalition. The hardline Islamist group advanced rapidly across the country, seizing province after province before taking the capital Kabul on 15 August last year, as the Afghan military collapsed. Foreign forces, who had agreed to leave, were stunned by the speed of the advance and had to accelerate their exit. Many Western-backed Afghan government leaders fled, while thousands of their compatriots and foreigners fearing Taliban rule scrambled to find room on flights out of the country. Within weeks, the Taliban were in control of all of Afghanistan - something they had not managed to do in their first stint in power between 1996 and 2001. The group had struck a deal with the Americans in 2020 for US troops to withdraw, following a bloody but ultimately successful guerrilla campaign lasting many years. Taliban fighters pictured in Laghman Province last year as they began a lightning offensive to retake the country Under the deal, the Taliban committed to national peace talks, which never took place, and to preventing al-Qaeda and other militants from operating in areas that the Taliban controlled. Following the group's return to power, Afghanistan's economy imploded, leaving a huge portion of the population struggling to find enough money to eat and to access other essentials. Billions of dollars in Afghan assets held abroad are frozen as the international community waits for the Taliban to honour promises still to be met on security, governance and human rights,including allowing all girls to be educated. The Taliban, or ""students"" in the Pashto language, emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. It is believed that the predominantly Pashtun movement first appeared in religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - which preached a hardline form of Sunni Islam. The promise made by the Taliban - in Pashtun areas straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan - was to restore peace and security and enforce their own austere version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once in power. From south-western Afghanistan, the Taliban quickly extended their influence. In September 1995, they captured the province of Herat, bordering Iran. Exactly one year later, they captured the Afghan capital, Kabul, overthrowing the regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of the founding fathers of the Afghan mujahideen that resisted the Soviet occupation. By 1998, the Taliban were in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan. Afghans, weary of the mujahideen's excesses and infighting after the Soviets were driven out, generally welcomed the Taliban when they first appeared on the scene. Their early popularity was largely due to their success in stamping out corruption, curbing lawlessness and making the roads and the areas under their control safe for commerce to flourish. But the Taliban also introduced or supported punishments in line with their strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, as well as amputations for those found guilty of theft. Men were required to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. The Taliban also banned television, music and cinema, and disapproved of girls aged 10 and over going to school. They were accused of various human rights and cultural abuses. One notorious example was in 2001, when the Taliban went ahead with thedestruction of the famous Bamiyan Buddhastatues in central Afghanistan, despite international outrage. Policing faces, bodies and beards on Kabul streets Womenâs faces become latest Taliban restriction Scraps of stale bread are keeping Afghans alive This time round, there has been no repeat of such excesses, but the Taliban are accused of a range of well-documented abuses, including killing opponents, as well as beating and detaining journalists and Afghans protesting for their rights. Women are no longer allowed to go on long-distance journeys without a male chaperone and, while not required to wear the burka, have been ordered to cover their faces in public. Most women are not allowed to work. Taliban gunmen controlling the Kandahar-Herat highway, near Kandahar city, 31 October 2001 Pakistan has repeatedly denied that it was the architect of the Taliban enterprise, but there is little doubt that many Afghans who initially joined the movement were educated in madrassas (religious schools) in Pakistan. Pakistan was also one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which recognised the Taliban when they were in power the first time round in Afghanistan. It was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the group. At one point, a Pakistani offshoot of the Taliban threatened to destabilise Pakistan from areas it controlled in the north-west. One of the most high-profile and internationally condemned of all Pakistani Taliban attacks took place in October 2012, when schoolgirlMalala Yousafzai was shoton her way home in the town of Mingora. A major military offensive two years later following thePeshawar school massacregreatly reduced the group's influence in Pakistan, though. At least three key figures of the Pakistani Taliban had been killed in US drone strikes, including the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud in 2013. Schoolgirl and rights activist Malala Yousafzai was shot by Taliban gunmen in October 2012 The attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. The Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the prime suspects, Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement. On 7 October 2001, a US-led military coalition launched attacks in Afghanistan: by the first week of December, the Taliban regime had collapsed. The group's then leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other senior figures, including Bin Laden, evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world. Many senior Taliban leaders reportedly took refuge in the Pakistani city of Quetta, from where they guided the Taliban. But the existence of what was dubbed the ""Quetta Shura"" was denied by Islamabad. Despite ever higher numbers of foreign troops, the Taliban gradually regained and then extended their influence in Afghanistan, rendering vast tracts of the country insecure, while violence in the country returned to levels not seen since 2001. There were numerous Taliban attacks on Kabul and in September 2012, the group carried outa high-profile raid on Nato's Camp Bastion base. Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike in 2013 Hopes of a negotiated peace were raised in 2013, when the Taliban announced plans to open an office in Qatar. But mistrust on all sides remained high and the violence went on. In August 2015, the Taliban admitted they had covered up Mullah Omar's death - reportedly from health problems at a hospital in Pakistan - for more than two years. The following month, the group said it had put aside weeks of infighting and rallied around a new leader, Mullah Mansour, who had been the deputy of Mullah Omar. At about the same time, the Taliban seized control of a provincial capital for the first time since their defeat in 2001, taking control of the strategically important city of Kunduz. Mullah Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in May 2016 and replaced by his deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remains in control of the group. In the year following the US-Taliban peace deal of February 2020 - which was the culmination of a long spell of direct talks - the Taliban appeared to shift their tactics from complex attacks in cities and on military outposts to awave of targeted assassinations that terrorised Afghan civilians. The targets - journalists, judges, peace activists, women in positions of power - suggested that the Taliban had not changed their extremist ideology, only their strategy. Despite grave concerns from Afghan officials over the government's vulnerability to the Taliban without international support, new US President Joe Biden announced in April 2021 that all American forces would leave the country by 11 September - two decades to the day since the felling of the World Trade Center. This video can not be played Hibatullah Akhundzada is a religious scholar and he is former head of the Taliban courts Having outlasted a superpower through two decades of war, the Taliban began seizing vast swathes of territory, before once again toppling a government in Kabul in the wake of a foreign power withdrawing. They swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking their first provincial capital on 6 August. By 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul. Their lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries. The future for Afghans living under the Taliban's rule remains highly uncertain. While most are relieved war is over, millions are struggling to survive. No country has recognised the Taliban government in the year since they returned to power. The August 2022killing in a US drone attack of al-Qaeda's leaderAyman al-Zawahiri in Kabul will do nothing to persuade Taliban critics that the group has turned over a new leaf. Hardliners in the movement appear to have the upper hand on issues such as female employment, freedom of speech and secondary education for girls, meaning that desperately needed foreign-held funds are unlikely to be released any time soon.

US ruling 'relief' for Bombardier workersA surprise ruling in favour of the aircraft manufacturer is welcomed by UK politicians and unions.7h7 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"This video can not be played Bombardier's Belfast workforce was not going to back down, said Unite's Susan Fitzgerald Politicians and union leaders have welcomed a ruling which stops the US imposing huge 292% import tariffs on planes partly made by British workers. Over a thousand jobs in Belfast depend on the success of the C-Series passenger jet, which is manufactured by Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""good news"" for UK industry. Trade union Unite said workers in Northern Ireland ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief"". Bombardier had been widely expected to fail in its bid to overturn a ruling by the US Commerce Department in December that the UK and Canada had given it unfair subsidies. But the case, centred on a complaint by US rival Boeing, was dismissed by the US International Trade Commission (ITC). Mrs May welcomed the decision, saying: ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy."" Gavin Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for East Belfast, said it had been a ""very difficult time"" for the firm's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland who had ""faced an uncertain future"". He added: ""Bombardier's greatest strength here in Belfast is the quality of those workers and the product they deliver."" Bombardier ruling Q&A Reaction to surprise Bombardier ruling Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said Bombardier workers ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief that the International Trade Commission has seen through Boeing's baseless complaint"". The ITC voted 4-0 in favour of Bombardier, ruling that there was no injury to US manufacturers. Tariffs of 292% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by US airlines. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. The wings for the plane are made by 1,000 workers in Belfast. The BBC's business correspondent, Theo Leggett, said the move came as ""a big surprise"" as ""most analysts thought the odds were stacked against Bombardier"". ""It is good news for workers at Bombardier's Belfast plant, where parts for the C-Series are made, but it's also good news for Airbus, which took advantage of Bombardier's struggles to take a majority stake in the C-Series."" A spokesperson for Bombardier said the ITC's decision was ""a victory for innovation, competition and the rule of law."" ""Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom."" Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary said it was ""the right decision"" A spokesperson for Boeing said it was ""disappointed"" by the ITC's decision and that it would ""review the detailed conclusions when they are released"". But Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian governments working hand in hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this."" It was ""excellent news for the dedicated workforce in Northern Ireland and supply chain across the UK, who have a great future ahead,"" he added. Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader Michelle O'Neill said the ruling was a ""welcome victory"" for the Belfast workforce and she hoped ""the matter was now closed"".

Review: Charles I - King and Collector âââââ,"There really is only one conclusion to come to having seen the Charles I exhibition at the Royal Academy in London, and that is: Oliver Cromwell was an idiot. I am not referring to his controversial military career, or the role he played in the beheading of the King, but what he did when he led the republican government in 1649. In an act of extreme religious piety and mean-spirited whitewashing of the previous regime, the great oaf sold off Charles I's magnificent art collection to a disbelieving but gleefully opportunistic continental cohort of rich aristocrats and royal courts. This is why it is the Prado in Madrid - and not the Royal Collection in London - which owns Titian's fabulous full-length portrait, Charles V with a Dog (1533). It also explains why the Louvre in Paris is home to Anthony van Dyck's superb Charles I in the Hunting Field (1599-1641) and not, as you might expect, Windsor Castle or Hampton Court. Charles I in the Hunting Field by Anthony van Dyck They are but two of the hundreds of masterpieces that Charles and his French wife, Henrietta Maria (a Catholic, which would have made Cromwell spit), acquired in a two-decade spending spree informed by their highly educated eye for art. For more than 350 years, Cromwell's folly - his small-minded money raising exercise the Prado mischievously calls The Sale of the Century - has made it impossible for us to see and enjoy the full extent of the artistic riches that made the Caroline Court the envy of Europe. Now we can. Charles I and Henrietta Maria with Prince Charles and Princess Mary by Anthony van Dyck And that is largely thanks to the good offices of the effervescent Desmond Shawe-Taylor, Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, who co-curated the exhibition with Per Rumberg. For it was he who suggested, when asked how best the Royal Academy might celebrate its 250th anniversary, a reunification of Charles I's collection. It was a good idea, which has been exceptionally well realised. From the first room to the last, the show maintains a coherent, compelling structure, which tells the story of Charles's collecting and collection in clear chronological and thematic episodes. It starts with the main protagonists. Charles I in Three Positions by Anthony van Dyck We meet the King head on and in triplicate in Charles I in Three Positions (1635-36), by his artist-in-residence, Anthony van Dyck. The Flemish 'principalle Paynter in Ordenarie to their Majesties' can be seen to the King's left looking conspicuously arty in Self-Portrait with a Sunflower (1633). On the opposing wall is his portrait of Henrietta Maria (1638) in profile. These three characters are the mainstays of the show. The story proper starts in the next room, when Charles was a 22-year-old unmarried Prince on the lookout for a suitable bride. He decided to chance his arm and nipped over to Madrid in the hope of making a tactical marriage to the Infanta Maria Anna, sister of Philip IV of Spain. It didn't work out, but he did fall in love. With art. The Supper at Emmauss by Titian He returned with a hoard of tip-top paintings, including the aforementioned Titian, a very good Veronese, and a portrait of himself (now lost) by Philip IV's court painter, a certain Diego VelÃ¡zquez. Like a true connoisseur, Charles focussed his collecting. First and foremost there were the pieces produced by Anthony van Dyck, designed to document, celebrate and elevate the King's magnificence. As were the other two areas in which he concentrated his efforts. The first we encounter is the work of the Dutch, Flemish and German artists of the Northern renaissance. In a gallery decorated in a deep, dark blue, we are presented with a wonder wall of Hans Holbein portraits, the star of which is a tough looking Robert Cheesman (1533), the Royal Falconer. Opposite him is an exquisite painting by Albrecht DÃ¼rer of the Burkhard of Speyer (1506), and a small but perfectly formed Pieter Bruegel the Elder oil on panel, Three Soldiers (1568). Robert Cheseman by Hans Holbein the Younger From here we move onto the Italian Renaissance and works by Bassano, Correggio, and most prominently, Titian. Honestly, I would forgive Cromwell his short-sighted philistinism if only he hadn't sold the three huge paintings by the great Venetian master that hang side-by-side in this show. The Allocution of Alfonso d'Avalos to his Troops (1540-41) is now owned by the Prado, while The Supper at Emmaus (c. 1534) and heart-achingly beautiful Conjugal Allegory (1530-35) are both the property of the Louvre. The Allocution of Alfonso dâAvalos to His Troops by Titian You can't helping thinking 'what ifâ¦' as you walk through room after room of incredible paintings. What if the King hadn't lost his head? What if he and Henrietta had continued to collect at the same rate for another twenty years? What if his son, Charles II, had carried on in the same manner? The answer is, the finest collection of outstanding renaissance art ever amassed in a single country would be in Britain. Sadly, that is not the case. But this fabulous show does at least give us a tantalising glimpse of what could have been.

Rapist's release held over legal challenge,"John Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them The release of black cab rapist John Worboys from prison has been put on temporary hold following a legal challenge by two of his victims. Lawyers representing the women were granted a stay on his release after making an urgent application to the High Court on Thursday. The Parole Board provoked anger this month after announcing Worboys would be released from jail. Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009. He was convicted of 19 offences and given an indeterminate sentence for public protection, although police believe he may have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults. Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? The cabbie who preyed on young women Rapist's victims 'told he would serve life' Lawyer Harriet Wistrich said the stay on his release had been granted ""until an oral application between 6-8 February"". She said it was ""obviously good that we have got through the first hurdle"" but added that Worboys could ""potentially"" have a claim for damages if the victims fail in their legal battle. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the Justice Secretary David Gauke had supported the request for a stay on Worboys' release while the judicial review is heard. He said: ""It is right that victims can be reassured that Worboys will not be released until the court has had a chance to consider their views.""

Suicide bomb kills 17 in Kabul,"This video can not be played How the attack unfolded A suicide bombing has killed at least 95 people and injured 158 others in the centre of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, officials say. Attackers drove an ambulance laden with explosives past a police checkpoint in a secure zone, home to government offices and foreign embassies. The Taliban have said they carried out the attack, the deadliest for months. US President Donald Trump called for ""decisive action"" against the group after the ""despicable"" bombing. A week ago, Taliban militants killed 22 people in a luxury Kabul hotel. Witnesses say the area - also home to offices of the European Union, a hospital anda shopping zone known as Chicken Street- was crowded with people when the bomb exploded on Saturday at about 12:15 local time (08:45 GMT). Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, said the attacker got through a security checkpoint after telling police he was taking a patient to nearby Jamhuriat hospital. He detonated the bomb at a second checkpoint, said Mr Rahimi. The BBC's Zia Shahreyar, speaking from the scene, says it is not easy to get through the checkpoints. Cars are searched and drivers' identities checked. He adds that questions will be asked about how the attacker got through. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the use of an ambulance was ""harrowing"". MP Mirwais Yasini told the BBCthe area looked like a butcher's shop afterwards. He was having lunch at his family home, just metres away, when the blast went off.  ""First of all we thought it was inside our house,"" he said. Then he went outside and saw scattered bodies. ""It is very, very inhumane."" Who are the Taliban? Four days behind the Taliban front line How Kabul's Chicken Street fell on hard times Another witness, a software engineer who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC he was about a kilometre (two thirds of a mile) away when he heard the noise. ""I saw a huge flame,"" he said. ""The smoke was pungent. It entered my eyes and I was not able to see for some time."" He said when he moved closer he saw the dead bodies, and it looked like a ""brutal graveyard"". ""It was a terrible moment. [The area] is completely destroyed."" The Afghan government has condemned the bombing as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan of providing support to the attackers. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and parts of neighbouring Pakistan. Pakistan denies supporting militants that carry out attacks in Afghanistan. This month,the US cut its security aid to Pakistan, saying it had failed to take action against terrorist networks on its soil. The injured and distressed were helped away from the scene In a statement, US President Donald Trump said: ""I condemn the despicable car bombing attack in Kabul today that has left scores of innocent civilians dead and hundreds injured. This murderous attack renews our resolve and that of our Afghan partners."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said: ""Indiscriminate attacks against civilians are a serious violation of human rights and humanitarian laws, and can never be justified."" In France, the Eiffel Tower turned off its lights at midnight on Saturday as a mark of respect for the dead and injured. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter: ""The city of Paris and Parisians are with the Afghan people who are once again facing terrorist barbarity,"" she said. The attack is the deadliest in Kabul in several months. In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. More than 150 people were wounded in the bombing The area of the attack was a scene of devastation Thehardline Islamic Taliban movementswept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and were ousted by the US-led invasion five years later, but returned to run some key areas In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted - since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today In 2016, Afghan civilian casualties hit a new high- a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban Civilian casualties remained at high levels in 2017,external, the UN said A plume of smoke from the explosion was seen around the city Kabul hospitals were overwhelmed with patients in the aftermath Ambulance suicide bomb: What we know.

US ruling 'relief' for Bombardier workersA surprise ruling in favour of the aircraft manufacturer is welcomed by UK politicians and unions.,"This video can not be played Bombardier's Belfast workforce was not going to back down, said Unite's Susan Fitzgerald Politicians and union leaders have welcomed a ruling which stops the US imposing huge 292% import tariffs on planes partly made by British workers.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""good news"" for UK industry. Trade union Unite said workers in Northern Ireland ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief"". Bombardier had been widely expected to fail in its bid to overturn a ruling by the US Commerce Department in December that the UK and Canada had given it unfair subsidies.

"Paris braced as Seine surges higherThe River Seine has burst its banks in places, and is expected to reach its peak this weekend.6h6 hours agoEurope","This video can not be played Watch drone footage of the swollen river Seine in Paris Riverside homes and businesses in Paris are on high alert as the swollen River Seine threatens to overflow its banks. Weeks of rainfall have produced a relentless rise in the water level, which is expected to peak just below 6m (20ft) above normal. Touring boats are tied up, riverside roads are sealed off and the Louvre museum has closed a lower gallery. France has seen rain like this over the New Year period only three times in the last century. The surging brown waters are also reportedly flushing rats out of their usual haunts below ground, the BBC's Kevin Connolly reports from the French capital. Within Paris, the Seine runs in a deep channel which limits the effects of the rising waters. But in smaller towns along the river, our correspondent adds, shoppers and commuters have been punting boats along flooded streets. They are waiting for the waters to recede to allow the first estimates of the financial cost of the flooding to be made. A statue of a French soldier from the Crimean War- known as The Zouave - on the Pont de l'Alma has long been used as a marker for water levels in the city. On Saturday afternoon, the water was still well below his waist; during the historically bad floods of 1910, when the city was submerged for two months, it reached his neck. When Paris was under water for two months As of 09:00 (08:00 GMT) on Saturday, the river level had reached 5.7m above normal. Parisian anglers are getting closer to the fish While forecasters believe it will continue to rise, peaking on Sunday night or Monday, it is not expected to reach the 2016 high of 6.1m, AFP news agency reports. Saying the city was coping, Mayor Anne Hidalgo suggested the flooding, coupled with recent summer heat waves, was ""clearly a question of the town adapting to climate change"". She warned that the high water levels would remain into next week, as water levels subside slowly due to waterlogged soil in the region. At the Louvre, a lower level housing Islamic artwork was closed to visitors. Other famous attractions like  the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Orangerie gallery were on high alert. Perching seagulls are barely out of the water now In the prestigious 16th Arrondissement (district), some basements in residential buildings were slowly being inundated. ""There are six studios in the basement, and we've had to set up blocks outside to keep the windows from breaking and covering everything in water,"" one caretaker, Joao de Macedo, told AFP. Inside the studios, tables and dressers have been lifted off the floor as water seeps through the walls, the agency says. Outside, a young woman said it was ""great to see ducks instead of cars"" in places. A health centre in the north-western suburbs, where 86 patients were receiving care, was evacuated on Friday.

"'Frazzled' pharmacist mixed up pillsA patient describes his ""horrendous"" symptoms after being given the wrong pills by Boots.","The patient was prescribed Amitriptyline but a Boots pharmacy gave him Amlodipine A patient has described suffering ""horrendous"" symptoms for three days after a Boots pharmacy gave him the wrong medication. The 51-year-old was prescribed a drug to help with his insomnia, but was given one for high blood pressure with a similar name. He believes Boots pharmacy staff are overworked and this led to the mistake. Boots said the pharmacy in Basingstoke was ""fully staffed"" and it took patient safety ""very seriously"". The patient's symptoms lasted for three days and included a ""nasty, thumping, unbearable headache"" and ""constant nausea"". He contacted the BBC following an investigation into the Nottingham-based company, in which somepharmacy staff said they were under too much pressureand feared mistakes would be made. The man has been getting medication from the same pharmacy in Basingstoke every month for 14 years and said he had ""seen the pattern of them being overwhelmed"". The patient said he went through a ""horrendous"" experience after Boots gave him the wrong medication The person who gave him the wrong medication was ""looking a bit frazzled"", he said, and he ""chalked it up to them being really stressed"". WATCH: Boots: Pharmacists under Pressure? Boots pharmacists raise staffing concerns ""It is shocking that this happened to me, and what I went through was horrendous,"" said the patient. ""Had that been someone else who took different medication to me, they could have died as a result."" 14 December- The patient was given the wrong medication - amlodipine instead of amitriptyline - at a Boots pharmacy in Basingstoke, Hampshire. 17 December- He took two pills at bedtime but had a ""nagging doubt"" so googled the name, realised it was a completely different medication, then called 111 and was told he was on the ""borderline beginning of toxicity"". 18 December- He ""felt like someone was standing on my chest and I was having to take big deep breaths every few minutes throughout the entire night and following day as the medicine was making me feel like I couldn't catch my breath"". By the afternoon he was feeling the same symptoms ""with an added massive headache that had hit me when I woke up after a brief hour or so of sleep"". 19 December- His ""nasty, thumping, unbearable headache"" lasted until the afternoon and he ""couldn't sleep hardly at all"" during that time, ""had absolutely no appetite and felt a constant nausea"". 20 December- He still had a ""fuzzy muddled head"" feeling, a constant pain in his right calf and a shortness of breath that caused him to periodically take ""big deep sighing breaths to cope"". This type of a mistake is known as a ""dispensing error"". Three people died between May 2012 and November 2013 following dispensing errors at Boots pharmacies -Douglas Lamond, 86,who died in May 2012, Arlene Devereaux, who died on her 71st birthday in November 2012, andMargaret Forrest, 86, who died in November 2013. Inquests and a fatal accident inquiry were held into the deaths, and understaffing was not found to have contributed to any of them. Douglas Lamond, Arlene Devereux and Margaret Forrest died following dispensing errors at Boots pharmacies The Basingstoke patient said: ""From what I saw that day, when I was given the wrong medication, there clearly is a staffing issue. ""I noticed how the place was slammed with people waiting for their medication as does happen quite often. ""I noticed that as usual the queue went slowly because it seemed like the dispensing assistants at the counters were all mega busy."" Dr Rupert Payne from Bristol Medical School said it is ""very difficult to know"" whether the drug could have been fatal if the patient had carried on taking it, as patients can ""vary considerably in the side effects they get with drugs"". ""Virtually any drug is potentially fatal in overdose,"" he said. Dr Payne said 10mg of amlodipine would be a ""fairly standard dose"". The patient took two 10mg pills, and the sticker on the packet advised him to take up to three. ""If it was two 10mg tablets he had, that would be more than the recommended dose and would be more likely to cause side effects,"" said Dr Payne. ""Common side effects in the short term could include sleeping difficulties, dizziness, headache, flushing and racing heart."" Richard Bradley, pharmacy director for Boots UK, said: ""Boots takes patient safety very seriously and I was sorry to hear about [the patient's] experience. ""I can assure you that this incident was reported to the Superintendent Pharmacist's Office when it was highlighted to the pharmacy team in Basingstoke and a local investigation has been undertaken. ""Pharmacies are generally busier in the run up to Christmas as patients want to make sure they have their medicines, but this particular pharmacy was fully staffed. ""We have been in touch with [the patient] directly to apologise and discuss his concerns; we have learned from his experience to put further measures in place in the pharmacy to help prevent this type of mistake happening in the future.""

"Three teenagers killed by car at bus stopThe driver of an Audi was arrested after the young men were hit in Hayes, west London on Friday night.5m5 minutes agoLondon","Three teenage boys were killed when a car hit them near a bus stop in west London on Friday evening in what police have called a ""horrific"" crash. Two of the boys, who were aged 16 and 17 and had been heading to a birthday party, have been named locally as Harry Louis Rice and George Wilkinson. The crash happened in Shepiston Lane, Hayes, near a petrol station. A man, 28, who was in the Audi involved in the crash, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. The suspect was detained by members of the public, and was then taken to hospital for treatment before going to a north London police station for questioning. At least one other male is reported to have left the car following the collision. Police said they were doing everything they could to establish the full facts and trace everybody involved. A black Audi car is believed to have mounted the pavement before crashing into a lamp post The boys' next of kin have been informed, and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. The victims have yet to be formally identified, the Met Police said. Other teenagers who were standing with the boys were uninjured. Friends who left flowers at the scene on Saturday said the teenagers were going to a 16th birthday party. Police were called to the scene at 20:41 GMT on Friday A crowd gathered on Shepiston Lane to pay tribute to the boys Staff at the nearby Esso garage said a group had been fighting at the entrance to the forecourt just before the crash. It is believed the Audi was travelling at high speed before it mounted the pavement just outside the entrance and travelled a few yards down the road before hitting a lamp post. Three energy drink bottles were left at the scene along with flowers One person who passed the crash scene said he saw friends of the victims help a fast-response paramedic get equipment from the car. Amamdeep Matharoo, 27, said: ""The lads were shouting on the phone. They were saying 'three of our friends are dead'. They were hysterical and in pieces."" Tony Kitchin, 44, who works as a security guard at a haulage firm nearby, said: ""This road is busy 24/7. It's a speed trap. ""I'm really surprised we haven't had more horrific accidents like this. ""No parent should have to deal with that. My heartfelt sympathies go out to the family and friends of the people who lost their lives last night."" Det Sgt Jane Shaw, from the Met's serious collision investigation unit, said: ""There are horrific circumstances that have resulted in three young people losing their lives."" She appealed for anyone who saw what happened to contact the police. Temporary road closures have now been lifted.

"Global register lists alien speciesA fifth of more than 6,000 catalogued invasive animals and plants worldwide are causing harm.8h8 hours agoScience & Environment","The American mink is an introduced species in the UK The first global register of alien species shows that a fifth of 6,400 plants and animals catalogued are causing harm. Some of the biggest factors in their spread are ballast water in ships for marine species and trade in ornamental plants on land, say scientists. They released data for 20 countries this week, with the aim of completing the register by the end of the year. Invasive species are living things that are not native to an ecosystem. They can harm the environment, the economy, or human health. For instance, rats can cause bird extinctions on islands, while the crown-of-thorns star fish is smothering parts of the Great Barrier Reef. Crown-of-thorns starfish make coral more susceptible to bleaching The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) provides the first country-wide checklists of introduced and invasive species. ""The GRIIS is not about any single one of these, but about all of them and about the many thousands of species that have become naturalised outside of their historical ranges across the world as a result of human activity,"" said Melodie McGeoch of the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group in Rome, Italy. ""Until now there has been highly uneven distribution of knowledge on invasive species globally."" The register will generate information that is publically available on all kinds of invasive species across the world. Zebra mussels are regarded as a pest The number of species catalogued for the 20 countries studied so far range from 77 in Mongolia to 2107 in South Africa. Of the 6,414 species across the 20 countries, more than 80% had evidence of impact in at least one or two countries. Cross-border trade and transport are the main drivers of introductions of new species. Only by accurately identifying and cataloguing animals and plants on land and at sea can biological invasions be managed, say the researchers.

"'Frazzled' pharmacist mixed up pillsA patient describes his ""horrendous"" symptoms after being given the wrong pills by Boots.8h8 hours agoNottingham","The patient was prescribed Amitriptyline but a Boots pharmacy gave him Amlodipine A patient has described suffering ""horrendous"" symptoms for three days after a Boots pharmacy gave him the wrong medication. The 51-year-old was prescribed a drug to help with his insomnia, but was given one for high blood pressure with a similar name. He believes Boots pharmacy staff are overworked and this led to the mistake. Boots said the pharmacy in Basingstoke was ""fully staffed"" and it took patient safety ""very seriously"". The patient's symptoms lasted for three days and included a ""nasty, thumping, unbearable headache"" and ""constant nausea"". He contacted the BBC following an investigation into the Nottingham-based company, in which somepharmacy staff said they were under too much pressureand feared mistakes would be made. The man has been getting medication from the same pharmacy in Basingstoke every month for 14 years and said he had ""seen the pattern of them being overwhelmed"". The patient said he went through a ""horrendous"" experience after Boots gave him the wrong medication The person who gave him the wrong medication was ""looking a bit frazzled"", he said, and he ""chalked it up to them being really stressed"". WATCH: Boots: Pharmacists under Pressure? Boots pharmacists raise staffing concerns ""It is shocking that this happened to me, and what I went through was horrendous,"" said the patient. ""Had that been someone else who took different medication to me, they could have died as a result."" 14 December- The patient was given the wrong medication - amlodipine instead of amitriptyline - at a Boots pharmacy in Basingstoke, Hampshire. 17 December- He took two pills at bedtime but had a ""nagging doubt"" so googled the name, realised it was a completely different medication, then called 111 and was told he was on the ""borderline beginning of toxicity"". 18 December- He ""felt like someone was standing on my chest and I was having to take big deep breaths every few minutes throughout the entire night and following day as the medicine was making me feel like I couldn't catch my breath"". By the afternoon he was feeling the same symptoms ""with an added massive headache that had hit me when I woke up after a brief hour or so of sleep"". 19 December- His ""nasty, thumping, unbearable headache"" lasted until the afternoon and he ""couldn't sleep hardly at all"" during that time, ""had absolutely no appetite and felt a constant nausea"". 20 December- He still had a ""fuzzy muddled head"" feeling, a constant pain in his right calf and a shortness of breath that caused him to periodically take ""big deep sighing breaths to cope"". This type of a mistake is known as a ""dispensing error"". Three people died between May 2012 and November 2013 following dispensing errors at Boots pharmacies -Douglas Lamond, 86,who died in May 2012, Arlene Devereaux, who died on her 71st birthday in November 2012, andMargaret Forrest, 86, who died in November 2013. Inquests and a fatal accident inquiry were held into the deaths, and understaffing was not found to have contributed to any of them. Douglas Lamond, Arlene Devereux and Margaret Forrest died following dispensing errors at Boots pharmacies The Basingstoke patient said: ""From what I saw that day, when I was given the wrong medication, there clearly is a staffing issue. ""I noticed how the place was slammed with people waiting for their medication as does happen quite often. ""I noticed that as usual the queue went slowly because it seemed like the dispensing assistants at the counters were all mega busy."" Dr Rupert Payne from Bristol Medical School said it is ""very difficult to know"" whether the drug could have been fatal if the patient had carried on taking it, as patients can ""vary considerably in the side effects they get with drugs"". ""Virtually any drug is potentially fatal in overdose,"" he said. Dr Payne said 10mg of amlodipine would be a ""fairly standard dose"". The patient took two 10mg pills, and the sticker on the packet advised him to take up to three. ""If it was two 10mg tablets he had, that would be more than the recommended dose and would be more likely to cause side effects,"" said Dr Payne. ""Common side effects in the short term could include sleeping difficulties, dizziness, headache, flushing and racing heart."" Richard Bradley, pharmacy director for Boots UK, said: ""Boots takes patient safety very seriously and I was sorry to hear about [the patient's] experience. ""I can assure you that this incident was reported to the Superintendent Pharmacist's Office when it was highlighted to the pharmacy team in Basingstoke and a local investigation has been undertaken. ""Pharmacies are generally busier in the run up to Christmas as patients want to make sure they have their medicines, but this particular pharmacy was fully staffed. ""We have been in touch with [the patient] directly to apologise and discuss his concerns; we have learned from his experience to put further measures in place in the pharmacy to help prevent this type of mistake happening in the future.""

"Latest Banksy work appears in HullThe design, on a disused bridge, depicts a child carrying a sword with a pencil attached to the end.8h8 hours agoHumberside","A number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have attracted the artist A mural by graffiti artist Banksy has appeared on a bridge in Hull. Speculation about the artist's identity was rife after the work, on a disused river crossing, was spotted by passers-by on Thursday. The stencilled design depicts a child carrying a wooden sword with a pencil attached to the end, under the text ""Draw the raised bridge!"" Images of the mural wereshared on Banksy's official Instagram account,externalon Friday. The elusive street artist posted two photos of the permanently raised bridge, situated on Scott Street in the Wincolmlee area of the city. Who is the street artist Banksy? Hundreds of fans responded, with some expressing surprise at the location and others speculating on the meaning of the work. A number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have inspired the decision. And many were quick to link the work to Brexit, after recent pieces which touched on the UK's impending departure from the European Union.

Cheese rolling cancelled as 'no longer cool',"Teams roll a log shaped like a block of cheese in Stilton An annual cheese rolling event in a village famed for its dairy connections has been cancelled as it is no longer seen as ""cool"", organisers said. It has taken place for more than 50 years in Stilton, Cambridgeshire, whichsome claim to be the true home of its namesake cheese. However, the organisers cancelled the May event citing a lack of interest,the Peterborough Telegraph reported,external. Only two teams registered last year but it is hoped it will go ahead in 2019. ""In recent years there has been a disappointing lack of enthusiasm for taking part in the cheese rolling,"" Olive Main and Carol Warren from Stilton Community Associationwrote on Facebook,external. ""To make a real contest we need 12 to 16 men's teams and eight to 12 ladies teams. We have not come anywhere near these targets for four years,"" they added. Enough teams came forward to bolster the two that actually registered last year and the race went ahead. ""It is no longer seen as 'cool',"" they wrote. One village sign depicts cheese rolling Another bears a plaque claiming the village is the original home of the blue cheese In addition to a ""disappointing lack of enthusiasm"" for rolling cheese-shaped logs around the village, no-one wants to organise the race. ""The team who ran the cheese rolling races retired after 2017's event and no-one has come forward to replace them,"" Ms Main and Ms Warren said. The cost of organising the event, insuring it, disposing of waste, and ""public order"" issues were also cited as reasons for the cancellation. The race was dreamt up in 1959 to encourage tourists to the village A number of people have expressed disappointment at the news, with one pointing out the Stilton village sign depicts cheese rolling. ""Maybe the sign should be removed as we can't be bothered anymore,"" he wrote. The event was originally dreamt up to encourage visitors after the village was by-passed by the A1 in 1959.

All current rape cases to be reviewed,"This video can not be played Liam Allan had been on bail for two years before his trial collapsed All current rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales are to be reviewed ""as a matter of urgency"" to ensure evidence has been disclosed. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders warned the review could see ""a number of cases"" dropped. It comes after the collapse of several rape trials because evidence had not been shared with defence lawyers. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said there had been a failure to share digital evidence in each of the cases. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said there was no evidence of ""widespread malpractice or dishonesty"", but police and prosecutors needed to get to grips with the way they handled electronic evidence. CPS chief insists justice system is working Collapsed rape trials could hamper convictions, says Lord Judge WATCH: Why disclosure failings can prove crucial In the lead up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case. However, the system has come under scrutiny after the collapse of a number of trials, heightening concerns that evidence is not being disclosed early enough - or that rules are not being followed. Concerns have also been raised that potentially key information taken from mobile phones, computers and social media is not being shared. The Crown Prosecution Service, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing have launched an ""improvement plan"" to tackle the issue. It will include reviewing training, developing specialist disclosure experts in every police force, and providing all multimedia evidence to the defence digitally. Ms Saunders - the most senior public prosecutor in England and Wales - said the steps would help to deal with ""deep-rooted and systemic"" disclosure issues which were of ""great concern"". ""Changes in society, such as the vastly increasing use of social media and mobile phone messaging, bring challenges that all parts of the criminal justice system, despite the resourcing challenges, must deal with,"" she said. ""We are taking steps to identify any individual cases of concern as a matter of urgency."" Ms Saunders said the CPS was taking steps to identify cases of concern as a matter of urgency Last week,a rape charge against Oxford University student Oliver Mears was droppedon the eve of his trial, after a diary which supported his case was uncovered. And in December,the trial of Liam Allan, who faced 12 counts of rape and sexual assault,was dropped when it emerged evidence on a computer disc - which police had looked through - showed messages from the alleged victim pestering him for ""casual sex"". Earlier this week, the BBC revealed the number of prosecutions in England and Wales that collapsed because of a failure by police or prosecutors to disclose evidence hadincreased by 70% in the last two years. Our correspondent said the review was ""unprecedented"" despite coming after years of warnings about disclosure issues by lawyers. He said the plan revealed little about how changes would be funded, or about whether there was scope for reviewing past convictions. It also begged the question of why the review was confined to rape and sexual assault cases when many believed problems of disclosure were systemic, he added. On Friday,the trial of three people held on trafficking and prostitution charges was stoppedafter it was discovered social media evidence had not been disclosed. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said that although he had not seen evidence of malpractice or dishonesty in the prosecution system, in some cases people were ""not doing their job properly"". ""But I think it also shows something else - what we're seeing over the last year or two or three, is a huge increase in the volume of particularly electronic material that features in criminal cases. ""There really is no excuse for investigators and prosecutors not getting to grips with social media traffic and text messages,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, the NPCC lead for criminal justice, said the disclosure of evidence had too often been seen as an ""administrative task"" finished at the end of a case, and now needed to be firmly embedded in the ""investigative mindset"". He said problems had been ""exacerbated by the rapid expansion of digital material involved in almost every case"". ""Reviews of recent cases have shown a range of issues leading to failures but there has been no intention by officers to conceal information,"" he added.

What was dispute about?,"This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland Bombardier has won a trade case in the United States, overturning a decision to impose damaging tariffs on imports of its C-Series aircraft. In December,the US Commerce Department ruledthe UK and Canada had given unfair subsidies to Bombardier to help it build the aircraft. But in a surprise ruling, the US International Trade Commission (ITC)rejected the complaint brought by Boeing. We look at the case. The case relates to a major order for Bombardier from the US airline Delta for 75 C-Series aircraft. Unions argued a tariff would threaten sales and UK jobs would be hit Boeing complained to the US Commerce Department that they had been sold at ""absurdly low prices"" in violation of trade law and this was made possible by unfair subsidies to Bombardier from the British and Canadian governments. Bombardier has received Â£135m in UK aid, almost all of it a loan towards a new C-Series wing factory in Belfast which opened in 2013. About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. The case relates to a major order for Bombardier from the US airline Delta for 75 C-Series aircraft. The UK government sided with Bombardier. The company employs about 4,000 people in Northern Ireland. Its main factories are in constituencies held by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who have a confidence-and-supply deal keeping Theresa May in power. The prime minister lobbied President Donald Trump on Bombardier's behalf, but the government resisted trade union calls to cancel defence contracts with Boeing. Bombardier said Boeing never lost out in the Delta order as it does not make the small size of plane requested. Some analysts wondered if Boeing was simply out to damage a competitor. The Canadian aerospace firm is Northern Ireland's largest manufacturing employer Following an investigation last year,it made a final ruling on 20 December. It recommended an import tariff of 292% be added to the price of each C-Series plane sold in America. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States will always stand up for American workers and companies being harmed by unfair imports."" Bombardier's C-series jets began rollout in 2016, thanks to major contributions from both Quebec and the federal government. Cost over-runs on the C-Series almost bankrupted Bombardier. Orders have been sluggish and the fear was tariffs would damage sales prospects in America and have a knock-on impact on jobs. The stakes were arguably made higher because Bombardier is the biggest manufacturing company in Northern Ireland and is important to its economy. However, even before its victory at the US ITC, Bombardier was hopeful for the future after Airbus announced it would acquire a controlling stake in the C-Series and promised to boost its fortunes.

Global register lists alien species,"The American mink is an introduced species in the UK The first global register of alien species shows that a fifth of 6,400 plants and animals catalogued are causing harm. Some of the biggest factors in their spread are ballast water in ships for marine species and trade in ornamental plants on land, say scientists. They released data for 20 countries this week, with the aim of completing the register by the end of the year. Invasive species are living things that are not native to an ecosystem. They can harm the environment, the economy, or human health. For instance, rats can cause bird extinctions on islands, while the crown-of-thorns star fish is smothering parts of the Great Barrier Reef. Crown-of-thorns starfish make coral more susceptible to bleaching The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) provides the first country-wide checklists of introduced and invasive species. ""The GRIIS is not about any single one of these, but about all of them and about the many thousands of species that have become naturalised outside of their historical ranges across the world as a result of human activity,"" said Melodie McGeoch of the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group in Rome, Italy. ""Until now there has been highly uneven distribution of knowledge on invasive species globally."" The register will generate information that is publically available on all kinds of invasive species across the world. Zebra mussels are regarded as a pest The number of species catalogued for the 20 countries studied so far range from 77 in Mongolia to 2107 in South Africa. Of the 6,414 species across the 20 countries, more than 80% had evidence of impact in at least one or two countries. Cross-border trade and transport are the main drivers of introductions of new species. Only by accurately identifying and cataloguing animals and plants on land and at sea can biological invasions be managed, say the researchers.

Latest Banksy work appears in Hull,"A number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have attracted the artist A mural by graffiti artist Banksy has appeared on a bridge in Hull. Speculation about the artist's identity was rife after the work, on a disused river crossing, was spotted by passers-by on Thursday. The stencilled design depicts a child carrying a wooden sword with a pencil attached to the end, under the text ""Draw the raised bridge!"" Images of the mural wereshared on Banksy's official Instagram account,externalon Friday. The elusive street artist posted two photos of the permanently raised bridge, situated on Scott Street in the Wincolmlee area of the city. Who is the street artist Banksy? Hundreds of fans responded, with some expressing surprise at the location and others speculating on the meaning of the work. A number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have inspired the decision. And many were quick to link the work to Brexit, after recent pieces which touched on the UK's impending departure from the European Union.

Worboys release held over legal challenge,"John Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them The release of black cab rapist John Worboys from prison has been put on temporary hold following a legal challenge by two of his victims. Lawyers representing the women were granted a stay on his release after making an urgent application to the High Court on Thursday. The Parole Board provoked anger this month after announcing Worboys would be released from jail. Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009. He was convicted of 19 offences and given an indeterminate sentence for public protection, although police believe he may have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults. Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? The cabbie who preyed on young women Rapist's victims 'told he would serve life' Lawyer Harriet Wistrich said the stay on his release had been granted ""until an oral application between 6-8 February"". She said it was ""obviously good that we have got through the first hurdle"" but added that Worboys could ""potentially"" have a claim for damages if the victims fail in their legal battle. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the Justice Secretary David Gauke had supported the request for a stay on Worboys' release while the judicial review is heard. He said: ""It is right that victims can be reassured that Worboys will not be released until the court has had a chance to consider their views."" This video can not be played ""Fiona"" - not her real name- told BBC Newsnightâs Kirsty Wark she believed John Worboys would re-offend The Parole Board approved his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions, with chairman Nick Hardwick saying the board was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend. The government previously announced it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. However, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan haslodged an application for a judicial review into the plan to release him. Worboys told his victims he had won the lottery and invited them to celebrate with him At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in London's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. Scotland Yard is currently investigating a new sexual assault allegationmade against Worboys which was reported to them this month. No arrests have been made.

Saudi Arabia elites in corruption deal,"This video can not be played A Canada-based businessman tells the BBC about how Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption drive is being conducted. Some of Saudi Arabia's most powerful men detained in November in an anti-corruption purge have been released. Among those set free are Waleed al-Ibrahim, the head of MBC television network, and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, a former chief of the royal court. They have paid substantial financial settlements, reports say - though the amounts have not been made public. More than 200 princes, politicians, and wealthy businessmen were detained in the crackdown. Since then, they have been held in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, which is due to reopen on 14 February. The settlements are likely to have been costly. This video can not be played The Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh is holding about 200 members of the Saudi elite Life inside Saudi Arabia's 'five-star prison' Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed? Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was released at the end of November, paid more than $1bn(Â£750m). Media reports suggest that Mr al-Ibrahim's deal may have included his controlling share in MBC - the largest media company in the Middle East. The anti-corruption drive was instigated by Prince Mohammed bin Salman - who has been accused of using the investigation to remove opponents and consolidate his power. In the aftermath of the purge,Saudi Arabia's attorney general said at least $100bn (Â£76bn) had been misused through systemic corruptionand embezzlement going back decades. The detentions - and the expensive settlements - are being characterised by the state as an attempt to recover those funds. Many more of those detained remain in the Ritz Carlton under guard, until it reopens for Valentine's Day in mid-February. Those who do not reach settlements before then are expected to be sent to prison to await trial. Meanwhile, one of the highest-profile detainees, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, told Reuters news agency on Saturday that he expected to be cleared of wrongdoing and ""released from custody within days"". The billionaire - who is one of the country's richest people - said he expected to keep full control of his investment firm.

Cape Town urged to turn off toilet taps,"From next month residents in Cape Town will be limited to 50 litres of water per day Residents in the South African city of Cape Town have been warned to ""save water as if your life depends on it"" to avoid the supply being shut off. A severe drought has forced the city's municipality to limit consumption to 50 litres (11 gallons) per person per day. Officials are urging people to switch off their toilet cisterns and limit flushing to conserve water. The head of the provincial government said if the taps ran dry it would be ""the disaster above all disasters"". Helen Zille said it was still possible to avoid what has become known as Day Zero, when the water supply will be shut off. She said a full crisis could still be averted if everyone used 50 litres or fewer a day. ""That is not difficult if we all put our minds to it in our homes and in our workplaces,"" she said.

Ms Zille then offered some suggestions on how to save water. ""Turn off the tap of your toilet cistern and use all of the grey water in your house from washing, save it, and put it into your toilet cistern"", she said. ""No-one should be showering more than twice a week at this stage. You need to save water as if your life depends on it because it does."" Last year, Ms Zille revealed that she was showering once every three days. ""I regard oily hair in a drought to be as much of a status symbol as a dusty car,"" she wrote in a column. Cape Town, a popular tourist destination, has been hit by its worst drought in a century. Much of southern Africa has been recovering from a drought caused by the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon, following heavy summer rains. However, Cape Town is still gripped by a drought and has had very low rainfall for the past three years. Mohammed Allie, BBC News, Cape Town My wife does not use the shower any more. Instead, she boils about 1.5 litres of water and mixes it with about a litre of tap water to have her daily wash while the rest of us catch the slow running water in a bucket for re-use in the toilet cistern. Like most residents of Cape Town, my household of four has had to change our habits to conserve water. A bucket and jug have now become essential tools for me and my children when taking a quick two-minute shower. Read more from Mohammed here Last week, Mayor Patricia de Lille warned the city had reached a ""point of no return"". ""We can no longer ask people to stop wasting water. We must force them,"" she said at a press conference. ""Despite our urging for months, 60% of Capetonians are callously using more than 87 litres per day,"" she added, referring to the current daily limit. A person uses about 15 litres per minute for a typical shower and the same amount when flushing a standard toilet, according to WaterWise, a South African water usage awareness campaign.

USA Gymnastics board to quit over abuse,"Nearly 160 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse The entire USA Gymnastics (USAG) board has said it will comply with a US Olympic Committee's (USOC) ultimatum to resign over an abuse scandal. The USOC earlier said the 18-member board must step down by 31 January or lose status as a sports governing body. The USOC outlined steps the board must take after ex-USAG doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexually abusing young athletes. Five directors of the USAG board have already resigned amid the fallout. Two Michigan State University (MSU) officials have also quit after the school became embroiled in the scandal. This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis stepped down on Friday following reports that the school knew of the abuse claims but failed to take action. He said he was ""brought to tears"" as he listened to Nassar's victims during his sentencing on Tuesday. ""My heart breaks thinking about the incomprehensible pain all of them and their families have experienced,"" he said in a statement. Nassar, 54, worked at MSU between 1997 and 2016 and served as national medical co-ordinator for USAG from 1996 to 2014. Nearly 160 women have accused him of sexual abuse. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony USAG has admitted dragging its feet on alerting the authorities when it learned of abuse allegations against Nassar in 2015. Multiple molestation complaints from young athletes against the physician between 1997 and 2014 were ignored by MSU. USOC CEO Scott Blackmun wrote in a letter on Thursday that USAG board directors had six days to resign and until 28 February to replace them with an interim panel. ""While the USOC encourages USAG to think and act broadly on reforming its culture, we also believe that reform must start with an entirely new board,"" Mr Blackmun wrote. Critics of Ms Simon say she failed to take action after learning of Nassar abuse claims He outlined six steps the sports body must take, including: Replace interim board members in the next 12 months USAG must co-operate with ""an independent investigation"" looking into whether the anyone knew of and ignored the abuse allegations against Nassar The board ""must substantially discuss"" plans for combating abuse In a statement on Thursday night, USAG said it ""completely embraces the requirements outlined"" in the letter and ""appreciates the opportunity to work with the USOC to accomplish change"". Michael Burns, the head men's gymnastics coach at the University of Minnesota, became at least the fifth member to resign from USAG's board on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

He confirmed in an email he submitted his resignation letter on Wednesday. Both USAG and MSU deny there was a cover-up, but some victims have criticised both organisations for not doing enough to prevent the abuse. Mr Hollis' resignation from the university comes a day after the Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon quit amid increasing calls for her resignation over the case. But it was revealed on Friday that Ms Simon can opt to return to a faculty position and take a 12-month leave of absence to conduct research, during which time she would receive her $750,000 (Â£529,000) salary,according to her contract, which was provided to CNN by Michigan State spokesman Jason Cody,external. Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who testified at Nassar's sentencing, slammed USOC in a tweet on Thursday. Also on Friday, the US House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it would launch an investigation into sexual abuse in organised sports following Nassar's case.

'Fantastic news for Bombardier',"More than 4,000 workers are employed in Belfast by the Canadian aircraft manufacturer Politicians and unions in the UK have reacted with surprise and relief after the Canadian aerospace firmBombardier won a major trade case in the US. It had been anticipated that the manufacturer would fail in its bid to overturn a ruling to impose big tariffs on US imports of its C-Series jet. It was thought such an outcome could threaten thousands of jobs in the UK, many of which are based in Belfast. But the case, centred on a complaint by aerospace rival Boeing, was dismissed. The ruling, by the US International Trade Commission (ITC), means that a tax of almost 300% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by American carriers. ""I welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry. ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy."" ""The UK government has been working tirelessly to safeguard Bombardier jobs and argued from the very start this case was wholly unjustified. ""It is great that the company will continue to play a hugely important role in our economy as we build a Northern Ireland fit for the future."" ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian Governments working hand-in-hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. ""We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this."" ""This is fantastic news for Bombardier and particularly for the firm's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland and the many more who form part of the supply chain here. ""This news means that the C-Series is fully ready for take-off and I firmly believe it can now maximise its huge potential."" ""[This] represents a welcome victory for Bombardier, the Belfast workforce and their representatives at Unite the Union. ""I hope that the matter is now closed and that the company can secure the future of the C-Series, and by extension the workforce in their new partnership with Airbus."" ""I hope it is the end of the matter, which has been highly disruptive to Bombardier and extremely stressful for local employees of the company and those working in the supply chain. ""We need to ensure the organisation can now proceed with the construction and supply of one of the most innovative aircraft on the global market."" ""I welcome the common sense approach from the ITC in rejecting the protectionist complaint brought by Boeing. ""This ruling is testament to the unwavering campaign by all involved in exposing the complaint from Boeing for what it really was - a bid to silence a competitor."" ""Workers at Bombardier will be delighted tonight - they and the company are wholly vindicated by the ITC decision.

Bombardier in Boeing fight,"Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast The US has ruled that Canada's Bombardier received government subsidies and sold C-Series jets below cost in the US, a step likely to lead to steep tariffs. The US Commerce Department investigated the aerospace firm's US sales after a petition from rival American company Boeing. The conflict has the potential to lead to job losses in Northern Ireland. Bombardier said it was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision. The dispute has contributed to escalating trade tensions between the US and Canada. The fight stems from a 2016 sale of 75 C-Series jets to Delta Air Lines. Boeing claims Delta paid $20m per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33m and what Bombardier charges in Canada. Bombardier employs about 1,000 people in Belfast linked to the C-Series. The Unite union in the UK called the Commerce Department decision ""nakedly political"", adding it had the potential to ""crush jobs, not only in Northern Ireland but in the US too"". ""More than 50 percent of C-Series components are sourced from the US, where the supply chain sustains 22,000 US jobs. The economic impact of these tariffs would be felt in communities on both sides of the Atlantic,"" said Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner. ""Boeing is using its meritless complaint as cover to close the US market, which is one of the biggest in the world, to new entrants such as Bombardier's C-Series aircraft."" This video can not be played The Unite union reacts to latest Bombardier ruling The Commerce Department's final determination on Wednesday set trade duties of about 292% - slightly lower than a preliminary finding. The inquiry now moves to the US International Trade Commission, which will examine if the dumping and subsidies caused injury to Boeing. It is expected to make a final decision in February 2018, which would trigger the duties. This week, Canada's ambassador to the US warned that it might take the fight to the World Trade Organization, if the US continues to side with Boeing. Earlier this month Canada scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Canada's anger over the trade challenge. On Wednesday, Bombardier said the Commerce Department had not taken into account Bombardier's plan to build a facility in the US, as part of a planned partnership with Airbus. ""This facility will provide US airlines with a US-built plane thereby eliminating any possibility of harm due to imports,"" said spokesman Mike Nadolski. ""Unfortunately, the Commerce Department decision is divorced from this reality and ignores long-standing business practices in the aerospace industry, including launch pricing and the financing of multibillion dollar aircraft programs."" The Commerce Department said it will collect the duties from the importer, if the US commission finds against Bombardier. Delta has said it plans to move forward with the order, but does not expect to pay the tariffs. Bombardier ruling 'disappointing' - union.

Reaction in quotes,"More than 4,000 workers are employed in Belfast by the Canadian aircraft manufacturer Politicians and unions in the UK have reacted with surprise and relief after the Canadian aerospace firmBombardier won a major trade case in the US. It had been anticipated that the manufacturer would fail in its bid to overturn a ruling to impose big tariffs on US imports of its C-Series jet. It was thought such an outcome could threaten thousands of jobs in the UK, many of which are based in Belfast. But the case, centred on a complaint by aerospace rival Boeing, was dismissed. The ruling, by the US International Trade Commission (ITC), means that a tax of almost 300% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by American carriers. ""I welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry. ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy."" ""The UK government has been working tirelessly to safeguard Bombardier jobs and argued from the very start this case was wholly unjustified. ""It is great that the company will continue to play a hugely important role in our economy as we build a Northern Ireland fit for the future."" ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian Governments working hand-in-hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. ""We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this."" ""This is fantastic news for Bombardier and particularly for the firm's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland and the many more who form part of the supply chain here. ""This news means that the C-Series is fully ready for take-off and I firmly believe it can now maximise its huge potential."" ""[This] represents a welcome victory for Bombardier, the Belfast workforce and their representatives at Unite the Union. ""I hope that the matter is now closed and that the company can secure the future of the C-Series, and by extension the workforce in their new partnership with Airbus."" ""I hope it is the end of the matter, which has been highly disruptive to Bombardier and extremely stressful for local employees of the company and those working in the supply chain. ""We need to ensure the organisation can now proceed with the construction and supply of one of the most innovative aircraft on the global market."" ""I welcome the common sense approach from the ITC in rejecting the protectionist complaint brought by Boeing. ""This ruling is testament to the unwavering campaign by all involved in exposing the complaint from Boeing for what it really was - a bid to silence a competitor."" ""Workers at Bombardier will be delighted tonight - they and the company are wholly vindicated by the ITC decision. ""They will know that their unions - especially Steve Turner and all at Unite - worked incredibly hard to win this."" ""It is a right and just decision, which is in no small part down to the tireless campaign by Unite members - when the going got tough Unite did not throw the towel in. ""The C-Series is a world-beating aircraft made by world-class workers. There can be no backsliding from the US government on this decision.""

Paris braced as Seine surges higher,"This video can not be played Watch drone footage of the swollen river Seine in Paris Riverside homes and businesses in Paris are on high alert as the swollen River Seine threatens to overflow its banks. Weeks of rainfall have produced a relentless rise in the water level, which is expected to peak just below 6m (20ft) above normal. Touring boats are tied up, riverside roads are sealed off and the Louvre museum has closed a lower gallery. France has seen rain like this over the New Year period only three times in the last century. The surging brown waters are also reportedly flushing rats out of their usual haunts below ground, the BBC's Kevin Connolly reports from the French capital. Within Paris, the Seine runs in a deep channel which limits the effects of the rising waters. But in smaller towns along the river, our correspondent adds, shoppers and commuters have been punting boats along flooded streets. They are waiting for the waters to recede to allow the first estimates of the financial cost of the flooding to be made. A statue of a French soldier from the Crimean War- known as The Zouave - on the Pont de l'Alma has long been used as a marker for water levels in the city. On Saturday afternoon, the water was still well below his waist; during the historically bad floods of 1910, when the city was submerged for two months, it reached his neck. When Paris was under water for two months As of 09:00 (08:00 GMT) on Saturday, the river level had reached 5.7m above normal. Parisian anglers are getting closer to the fish While forecasters believe it will continue to rise, peaking on Sunday night or Monday, it is not expected to reach the 2016 high of 6.1m, AFP news agency reports. Saying the city was coping, Mayor Anne Hidalgo suggested the flooding, coupled with recent summer heat waves, was ""clearly a question of the town adapting to climate change"". She warned that the high water levels would remain into next week, as water levels subside slowly due to waterlogged soil in the region. At the Louvre, a lower level housing Islamic artwork was closed to visitors. Other famous attractions like  the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Orangerie gallery were on high alert. Perching seagulls are barely out of the water now In the prestigious 16th Arrondissement (district), some basements in residential buildings were slowly being inundated. ""There are six studios in the basement, and we've had to set up blocks outside to keep the windows from breaking and covering everything in water,"" one caretaker, Joao de Macedo, told AFP. Inside the studios, tables and dressers have been lifted off the floor as water seeps through the walls, the agency says. Outside, a young woman said it was ""great to see ducks instead of cars"" in places. A health centre in the north-western suburbs, where 86 patients were receiving care, was evacuated on Friday.

'Huge relief' for Bombardier workers,"This video can not be played Bombardier's Belfast workforce was not going to back down, said Unite's Susan Fitzgerald Politicians and union leaders have welcomed a ruling which stops the US imposing huge 292% import tariffs on planes partly made by British workers. Over a thousand jobs in Belfast depend on the success of the C-Series passenger jet, which is manufactured by Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""good news"" for UK industry. Trade union Unite said workers in Northern Ireland ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief"". Bombardier had been widely expected to fail in its bid to overturn a ruling by the US Commerce Department in December that the UK and Canada had given it unfair subsidies. But the case, centred on a complaint by US rival Boeing, was dismissed by the US International Trade Commission (ITC). Mrs May welcomed the decision, saying: ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy."" Gavin Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for East Belfast, said it had been a ""very difficult time"" for the firm's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland who had ""faced an uncertain future"". He added: ""Bombardier's greatest strength here in Belfast is the quality of those workers and the product they deliver."" Bombardier ruling Q&A Reaction to surprise Bombardier ruling Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said Bombardier workers ""will be breathing a huge sigh of relief that the International Trade Commission has seen through Boeing's baseless complaint"". The ITC voted 4-0 in favour of Bombardier, ruling that there was no injury to US manufacturers. Tariffs of 292% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by US airlines. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. The wings for the plane are made by 1,000 workers in Belfast. The BBC's business correspondent, Theo Leggett, said the move came as ""a big surprise"" as ""most analysts thought the odds were stacked against Bombardier"". ""It is good news for workers at Bombardier's Belfast plant, where parts for the C-Series are made, but it's also good news for Airbus, which took advantage of Bombardier's struggles to take a majority stake in the C-Series."" A spokesperson for Bombardier said the ITC's decision was ""a victory for innovation, competition and the rule of law."" ""Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom."" Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary said it was ""the right decision"" A spokesperson for Boeing said it was ""disappointed"" by the ITC's decision and that it would ""review the detailed conclusions when they are released"". But Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian governments working hand in hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this."" It was ""excellent news for the dedicated workforce in Northern Ireland and supply chain across the UK, who have a great future ahead,"" he added. Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader Michelle O'Neill said the ruling was a ""welcome victory"" for the Belfast workforce and she hoped ""the matter was now closed"".

John Humphrys' salary will be 'hugely less',"This video can not be played John Humphrys says pay cut is 'fair' BBC presenter John Humphrys has said he will be earning ""hugely less"" after agreeing to take a pay cut. The Today programme and Mastermind host was paid between Â£600,000 and Â£649,999 in 2016/17. He's one of six male stars who have agreed to earn less after revelations about differences between men's and women's pay at the corporation. He refused to confirm exactly how much he'll lose but it is thought he will earn roughly half what he did before. Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine have also accepted reduced wages, the BBC said. The move comes after the BBCrevealed the pay of on-air talent earning over Â£150,000in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men. Earlier this month, Carrie Gracieresigned as BBC China editorin protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Speaking about his salary, Humphrys said it ""seemed fair"" for him to take a pay cut. Asked by BBC media correspondent David Sillito whether he was happy to have his salary cut in half, he replied that the new amount was ""not exactly a pathetically low salary"". He said: ""Most people listening to this would probably say, 'He's not worth even that, is he?' ""It's still a lot of money. A lot less than it was, which just goes to show that what I was earning was a very large amount of money, and it seems, as I say, entirely fair to take rather less."" The BBC did not comment on how much the six presenters would now receive. Humphrys was recently criticised for an off-air conversation with Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, who earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999 in 2016/17, compared with Carrie Gracie's Â£135,000-a-year. Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor In their exchange, Humphrys reportedly asked Sopel about ""how much of your salary you are prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her"". He then referred to ""other men who are earning too much"" at the BBC. Asked about the conversation, which took place when Humphrys was preparing to interview Sopel for Radio 4's Today programme, Humphrys said the pair were ""having a bit of a joke"". He said: ""It was four o'clock in the morning, I was having a joke with an old friend, and we were exchanging our usual insults, which is the sort of thing if you've known someone for a very long time. ""We were taking the mickey out of each other. Not out of Carrie Gracie or any women. It was a not a gender-based discussion. ""It wasn't a discussion. It was about 90 seconds of badinage, winding each other up, the type of thing I've done with Sopel 1,000 times. But this time somebody was recording it and it was fed to people outside the BBC."" This video can not be played Jeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' A BBC statement on the pay cuts said: ""We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. ""These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. ""The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course."" After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be ""paid equally"". On Wednesday, she will discuss the topic before a select committee of MPs, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. Itfound the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%,external, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week Lord Hall has previously pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

USA Gymnastics board to quit over abuseThe whole board will resign by the end of the month in the wake of Larry Nasser abuse scandal.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada,"Nearly 160 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse The entire USA Gymnastics (USAG) board has said it will comply with a US Olympic Committee's (USOC) ultimatum to resign over an abuse scandal. The USOC earlier said the 18-member board must step down by 31 January or lose status as a sports governing body. The USOC outlined steps the board must take after ex-USAG doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexually abusing young athletes. Five directors of the USAG board have already resigned amid the fallout. Two Michigan State University (MSU) officials have also quit after the school became embroiled in the scandal. This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis stepped down on Friday following reports that the school knew of the abuse claims but failed to take action. He said he was ""brought to tears"" as he listened to Nassar's victims during his sentencing on Tuesday. ""My heart breaks thinking about the incomprehensible pain all of them and their families have experienced,"" he said in a statement. Nassar, 54, worked at MSU between 1997 and 2016 and served as national medical co-ordinator for USAG from 1996 to 2014. Nearly 160 women have accused him of sexual abuse. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony USAG has admitted dragging its feet on alerting the authorities when it learned of abuse allegations against Nassar in 2015. Multiple molestation complaints from young athletes against the physician between 1997 and 2014 were ignored by MSU. USOC CEO Scott Blackmun wrote in a letter on Thursday that USAG board directors had six days to resign and until 28 February to replace them with an interim panel. ""While the USOC encourages USAG to think and act broadly on reforming its culture, we also believe that reform must start with an entirely new board,"" Mr Blackmun wrote. Critics of Ms Simon say she failed to take action after learning of Nassar abuse claims He outlined six steps the sports body must take, including: Replace interim board members in the next 12 months USAG must co-operate with ""an independent investigation"" looking into whether the anyone knew of and ignored the abuse allegations against Nassar The board ""must substantially discuss"" plans for combating abuse In a statement on Thursday night, USAG said it ""completely embraces the requirements outlined"" in the letter and ""appreciates the opportunity to work with the USOC to accomplish change"". Michael Burns, the head men's gymnastics coach at the University of Minnesota, became at least the fifth member to resign from USAG's board on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

He confirmed in an email he submitted his resignation letter on Wednesday. Both USAG and MSU deny there was a cover-up, but some victims have criticised both organisations for not doing enough to prevent the abuse. Mr Hollis' resignation from the university comes a day after the Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon quit amid increasing calls for her resignation over the case. But it was revealed on Friday that Ms Simon can opt to return to a faculty position and take a 12-month leave of absence to conduct research, during which time she would receive her $750,000 (Â£529,000) salary,according to her contract, which was provided to CNN by Michigan State spokesman Jason Cody,external. Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who testified at Nassar's sentencing, slammed USOC in a tweet on Thursday. Also on Friday, the US House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it would launch an investigation into sexual abuse in organised sports following Nassar's case.

The move comes after the BBCrevealed the pay of on-air talent earning over Â£150,000in July. Two-thirds of stars on the list, including the top seven earners, were men. Earlier this month, Carrie Gracieresigned as BBC China editorin protest at unequal pay between male and female international editors. Speaking about his salary, Humphrys said it ""seemed fair"" for him to take a pay cut. Asked by BBC media correspondent David Sillito whether he was happy to have his salary cut in half, he replied that the new amount was ""not exactly a pathetically low salary"". He said: ""Most people listening to this would probably say, 'He's not worth even that, is he?' ""It's still a lot of money. A lot less than it was, which just goes to show that what I was earning was a very large amount of money, and it seems, as I say, entirely fair to take rather less."" The BBC did not comment on how much the six presenters would now receive. Humphrys was recently criticised for an off-air conversation with Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, who earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999 in 2016/17, compared with Carrie Gracie's Â£135,000-a-year. Carrie Gracie published an open letter giving her reasons for resigning as China editor In their exchange, Humphrys reportedly asked Sopel about ""how much of your salary you are prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her"". He then referred to ""other men who are earning too much"" at the BBC. Asked about the conversation, which took place when Humphrys was preparing to interview Sopel for Radio 4's Today programme, Humphrys said the pair were ""having a bit of a joke"". He said: ""It was four o'clock in the morning, I was having a joke with an old friend, and we were exchanging our usual insults, which is the sort of thing if you've known someone for a very long time. ""We were taking the mickey out of each other. Not out of Carrie Gracie or any women. It was a not a gender-based discussion. ""It wasn't a discussion. It was about 90 seconds of badinage, winding each other up, the type of thing I've done with Sopel 1,000 times. But this time somebody was recording it and it was fed to people outside the BBC."" This video can not be played Jeremy Vine: Taking a pay cut is 'a no-brainer' A BBC statement on the pay cuts said: ""We are very grateful to Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine, who have agreed that their pay will now be reduced. ""These are great journalists and presenters, who have a real connection with the audience. We are proud to have them working at the BBC. ""The final details of some of these changes are still being discussed, and there are further conversations that the BBC will have with others in due course."" After leaving her post as China editor, Gracie is now returning to the BBC newsroom in London, saying she expects to be ""paid equally"". On Wednesday, she will discuss the topic before a select committee of MPs, shortly before director general of the BBC Tony Hall, his deputy Anne Bulford and director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth. There have been three investigations into gender pay at the BBC: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. Itfound the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%,external, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff published at the same time found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is due to be published next week Lord Hall has previously pledged to close the gap by 2020, saying the corporation should be ""an exemplar of what can be achieved when it comes to pay, fairness, gender and representation"".

Judge calls CPS to court over case collapseThe trial of three people is stopped after the disclosure of social media material.4h4 hours agoUK,"A judge has ordered the Crown Prosecution Service to explain itself in a case that collapsed because social media evidence was not disclosed. The trial of three people held on trafficking and prostitution charges was stopped after the material cast doubt on the complainant's story. Judge Perrins said the failure to disclose material earlier ""would appear to be as a result of incompetence"". The CPS said it was ""concerned"" by the outcome and would review the case. The trial of Adrian Iordan, Anisoara Lautaru, Petruta-Cristina Bosoanca was stopped after the complainant in the case had been cross-examined. The defendants were charged with people trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act and controlling prostitution charges under the Sexual Offences Act. Hundreds of court cases axed over failings They were accused of conspiring to traffic a young woman to the UK from Romania for the purpose of prostitution. One defendant, Ms Bosoanca, gave birth during her 13 months in custody. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent This case could not illustrate more dramatically the devastating effect on people's lives that can result from a failure on the part of police and prosecutors to disclose evidence to the defence which can assist the defence. Cristina Bosoanca has spent more than 13 months in prison, during which time she has given birth, when she should never have been there in the first place. Her case also provides evidence that disclosure failures are not limited to rape and that there is, as lawyers in the criminal justice system have been telling me for years, a systemic problem with disclosure. At its heart is a seeming inability by police and prosecutors to recognise the extent to which valuable evidence is to be found where people now live their lives - online, on mobile phones and on social media. Searching these areas comprehensively for critical evidence is perhaps the criminal justice system's biggest challenge. In a ruling at London's Wood Green Crown Court, Judge Perrins said: ""It would also appear as though the court has been significantly misled as to the prosecution's state of readiness as well as the strength of the evidence at previous bail hearings as well as applications to extend the custody time limits. ""The fact that one defendant has had to give birth in custody and her baby is currently in prison with her makes this all the more shocking."" He demanded the CPS attend court on Wednesday to explain its failures in the case. The BBC understands that relevant social media material was known to the police from January 2017 but wasn't disclosed until December 2017. A CPS spokesman said: ""We are concerned by the outcome of the case and the comments of the judge today. ""It is clear there have been failings in this case, and it is being reviewed by senior CPS lawyers as a matter of urgency.""

Manchester United see off Yeovil in FA Cup,"This video can not be played FA Cup: Yeovil Town 0-4 Manchester United highlights Alexis Sanchez played a hand in two goals as his Manchester United debut ended in a comfortable 4-0 FA Cup fourth-round victory at League Two strugglers Yeovil Town. Chile forward Sanchez, whojoined United from Arsenal in a swap deal for Armenia's Henrikh Mkhitaryan on Monday,started wide on the left at a packed Huish Park. The 29-year-old was frequently involved for United and his passes found Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera for their goals either side of half-time, before he was substituted on 72 minutes. The Somerset side had started brightly as Jordan Green's early effort was saved by Sergio Romero - who came in as one of 10 United changes - but the lowest-ranked side left in this season's FA Cup rarely looked likely to produce one of the competitions greatest ever shocks. Jesse Lingard slotted in a third before Romelu Lukaku volleyed a fourth in stoppage time for the visitors, for whom victory came on manager Jose Mourinho's 55th birthday and in his 100th match in charge of the Premier League side. The Portuguese - who signed a new contract to 2020 with the Old Trafford club on Thursday - has now won 62 of his first 100 games. 5 live Football Daily: 'Lingard is in the form of his life' Sanchez was on the receiving end of several heavy tackles Former Barcelona forward Sanchez, who scored 80 goals in all competitions for Arsenal in a three-and-a-half-year spell, became the first Chilean to play in a competitive first-team match for United. Starting out wide, he gave the ball away repeatedly in the first half but was nevertheless lively and showed plenty of confident touches, cutting inside regularly. He was on the receiving end of a very heavy tackle from Yeovil left-back Nathan Smith, before his curling effort from the resulting free-kick was held by Glovers keeper Artur Krysiak. His simple pass found Rashford for United's opener, as the young England striker dribbled through the Yeovil box and lost the ball briefly before slotting home after the Glovers failed to clear their lines. Sanchez will have to explain whereabouts to anti-doping testers After the break, Sanchez was involved again, sliding a ball to Herrera to slot home the second and mark his 150th appearance for the club in style. For Yeovil, who knocked out League One Bradford City in the third round, the defeat came with the positive of Â£144,000 of television broadcast revenue, as they played in the fourth round for only the third time since 1949. This video can not be played Analysis: Alexis Sanchez impresses on debut against Yeovil United, who have not failed to reach at least the quarter-finals since 2014's surprise third-round loss to Swansea City under manager David Moyes,had won 2-0 at Huish Park in the third round just three years ago. The FA Cup could prove to be United's best opportunity to win a trophy this season, having been knocked out of the Carabao Cup at Bristol City in December, especially with them trailing Premier League leaders Manchester City by 12 points. Nevertheless, Mourinho was content to make sweeping changes to his starting side. The visitors started relatively sluggishly, and stand-in keeper Romero was required to make an important early save to deny Yeovil's Green from close range. But Mourinho's men controlled most of the remainder of the game and Yeovil - who remain yet to score against United after four meetings - will now return to focusing on their bid to avoid relegation to the National League. Darren Way's spirited side sit just two points above the relegation zone, 21st in League Two. For the Checkatrade Trophy quarter-finalists, defeat was their 10th consecutive loss in FA Cup meetings with top-flight sides, having now failed to scored in eight of those. Sanchez lost the ball 31 times, but his risk-taking was rewarded as he set up a clutch of chances and two goals Manchester United have progressed from 13 of their last 14 ties in the FA Cup fourth round, with their only defeat in this run coming back in 2012 (1-2 v Liverpool). This was Jose Mourinho's 100th game in charge of Manchester United - he has won 62% of his games since taking over at the start of last season (P100 W62 D23 L15). The Red Devils have now won each of their last five games; their longest run of victories in all competitions since winning six in a row in September 2017. Marcus Rashford is the fourth different Manchester United player to score 10 or more goals in all competitions in 2017-18 (with Lukaku, Lingard and Anthony Martial) - Manchester City are the only Premier League team with as many. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (29) is the only Manchester United player who has scored more goals for the club under Jose Mourinho than Marcus Rashford (21). Alexis Sanchez has been directly involved in 15 goals in 15 appearances in the FA Cup (eight goals and seven assists). Jesse Lingard has scored 12 goals for the Red Devils in all competitions this term; one more than he did in the previous two seasons combined (11). This was the sixth time Jose Mourinho has taken charge of a game on his birthday, while he's won five of those six games, losing the other. Yeovil have lost each of their last 10 FA Cup games against top-flight sides, failing to score on eight of those occasions.

Reaction Bombardier ruling,"More than 4,000 workers are employed in Belfast by the Canadian aircraft manufacturer Politicians and unions in the UK have reacted with surprise and relief after the Canadian aerospace firmBombardier won a major trade case in the US. It had been anticipated that the manufacturer would fail in its bid to overturn a ruling to impose big tariffs on US imports of its C-Series jet. It was thought such an outcome could threaten thousands of jobs in the UK, many of which are based in Belfast. But the case, centred on a complaint by aerospace rival Boeing, was dismissed. The ruling, by the US International Trade Commission (ITC), means that a tax of almost 300% will not now be imposed on orders of C-Series planes by American carriers. ""I welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry. ""Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy."" ""The UK government has been working tirelessly to safeguard Bombardier jobs and argued from the very start this case was wholly unjustified. ""It is great that the company will continue to play a hugely important role in our economy as we build a Northern Ireland fit for the future."" ""The decision by the International Trade Commission confirms what the UK and Canadian Governments working hand-in-hand has maintained from the outset, that this case is unjustified. ""We are pleased that the ITC have now recognised this."" ""This is fantastic news for Bombardier and particularly for the firm's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland and the many more who form part of the supply chain here. ""This news means that the C-Series is fully ready for take-off and I firmly believe it can now maximise its huge potential."" ""[This] represents a welcome victory for Bombardier, the Belfast workforce and their representatives at Unite the Union. ""I hope that the matter is now closed and that the company can secure the future of the C-Series, and by extension the workforce in their new partnership with Airbus."" ""I hope it is the end of the matter, which has been highly disruptive to Bombardier and extremely stressful for local employees of the company and those working in the supply chain. ""We need to ensure the organisation can now proceed with the construction and supply of one of the most innovative aircraft on the global market."" ""I welcome the common sense approach from the ITC in rejecting the protectionist complaint brought by Boeing. ""This ruling is testament to the unwavering campaign by all involved in exposing the complaint from Boeing for what it really was - a bid to silence a competitor."" ""Workers at Bombardier will be delighted tonight - they and the company are wholly vindicated by the ITC decision. ""They will know that their unions - especially Steve Turner and all at Unite - worked incredibly hard to win this."" ""It is a right and just decision, which is in no small part down to the tireless campaign by Unite members - when the going got tough Unite did not throw the towel in. ""The C-Series is a world-beating aircraft made by world-class workers. There can be no backsliding from the US government on this decision."" ""This is great news for thousands of Bombardier workers, as well as workers in their supply chain. ""But we must not be complacent - the Trump administration has shown it wants to shut down Britain's ability to support good jobs in strategic industries."" ""These tariffs would have been nothing short of a disaster for the Northern Ireland economy. ""This whole saga must act as a warning to the UK government about the battles it faces to defend jobs and industries as we leave the EU and face the increasingly hostile territory of trade wars on our own.""

Gymnastics board told to quit over abuseMembers of the board are given six days to resign or the federation will be decertified.,"Nearly 160 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse The entire USA Gymnastics (USAG) board has said it will comply with a US Olympic Committee's (USOC) ultimatum to resign over an abuse scandal. The USOC earlier said the 18-member board must step down by 31 January or lose status as a sports governing body. The USOC outlined steps the board must take after ex-USAG doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexually abusing young athletes. Five directors of the USAG board have already resigned amid the fallout. Two Michigan State University (MSU) officials have also quit after the school became embroiled in the scandal. This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis stepped down on Friday following reports that the school knew of the abuse claims but failed to take action. He said he was ""brought to tears"" as he listened to Nassar's victims during his sentencing on Tuesday. ""My heart breaks thinking about the incomprehensible pain all of them and their families have experienced,"" he said in a statement. Nassar, 54, worked at MSU between 1997 and 2016 and served as national medical co-ordinator for USAG from 1996 to 2014. Nearly 160 women have accused him of sexual abuse. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony USAG has admitted dragging its feet on alerting the authorities when it learned of abuse allegations against Nassar in 2015. Multiple molestation complaints from young athletes against the physician between 1997 and 2014 were ignored by MSU. USOC CEO Scott Blackmun wrote in a letter on Thursday that USAG board directors had six days to resign and until 28 February to replace them with an interim panel. ""While the USOC encourages USAG to think and act broadly on reforming its culture, we also believe that reform must start with an entirely new board,"" Mr Blackmun wrote. Critics of Ms Simon say she failed to take action after learning of Nassar abuse claims He outlined six steps the sports body must take, including: Replace interim board members in the next 12 months USAG must co-operate with ""an independent investigation"" looking into whether the anyone knew of and ignored the abuse allegations against Nassar The board ""must substantially discuss"" plans for combating abuse In a statement on Thursday night, USAG said it ""completely embraces the requirements outlined"" in the letter and ""appreciates the opportunity to work with the USOC to accomplish change"". Michael Burns, the head men's gymnastics coach at the University of Minnesota, became at least the fifth member to resign from USAG's board on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

He confirmed in an email he submitted his resignation letter on Wednesday. Both USAG and MSU deny there was a cover-up, but some victims have criticised both organisations for not doing enough to prevent the abuse. Mr Hollis' resignation from the university comes a day after the Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon quit amid increasing calls for her resignation over the case. But it was revealed on Friday that Ms Simon can opt to return to a faculty position and take a 12-month leave of absence to conduct research, during which time she would receive her $750,000 (Â£529,000) salary,according to her contract, which was provided to CNN by Michigan State spokesman Jason Cody,external. Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who testified at Nassar's sentencing, slammed USOC in a tweet on Thursday.

Fallon warns Boeing,"This video can not be played About 1,000 jobs in Belfast are linked to the C-Series Boeing's trade dispute with Bombardier ""could jeopardise"" its defence contracts with the UK government, the UK's defence secretary has warned. Sir Michael Fallon made the comments after the US opted to impose a tax on the C-Series jet made by Bombardier. The proposed 220% import tariff could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. Rival Boeing had complained that Bombardier had received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. It claimed these subsidies helped the firm win a major order. In 2016,Boeing won a contract to supply 50 Apache helicopters,externalto the Army. Reaction to Bombardier tax ruling Analysis: Not the end of Bombardier row Why is company so important to NI? Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK's long-term partnership with Boeing was being undermined by its behaviour towards Bombardier. Mrs May said Boeing's behaviour was no way to operate in terms of such a long-term partnership. Theresa May said she was bitterly disappointed by the US ruling She said the preliminary judgement over Bombardier would cause uncertainty and that the government was doing everything it could to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. The prime minister said she had spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, and would be working with them both. Mrs May said she had spoken to US President Donald Trump ""more than once"" about the issue, as well as raising it during their recent meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Meanwhile, Bombardier said it would fight the ""absurd"" ruling. The firm is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers. Sir Michael said during a visit to Belfast that ""Boeing stands to gain from British defence spending"" but that ""this kind of behaviour could jeopardise our future relationship"" with the firm. The proposed tariff could threaten jobs at Bombardier in Belfast ""We don't want to do that. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom; an important employer in the United Kingdom. ""But we would prefer this kind of dispute to be settled on a negotiated basis and we will be redoubling our efforts with the Canadian government to bring about a negotiated settlement."" The UK government and trade unions fear the imposition of tariffs could make the Canadian firm question whether to remain in Northern Ireland, where it employs 4,100 of its 28,000-strong workforce. The ruling damaged the global aerospace industry and was ""frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK"", said a UK government spokesman, while emphasising this was just the first step in a lengthy process. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory at Queen's Island in Belfast. Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce ruling, which could triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the United States, could potentially jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta - a $5.6bn (Â£4.15bn) deal for up to 125 of the jets. Bombardier said the decision was ""divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes"". The Canadian firm said Boeing was seeking to use US trade laws ""to stifle competition"". By Julian O'Neill, Northern Ireland business correspondent The outcome was predicted - but not the severity of the penalty. The tariff could triple the cost of C-Series aircraft in the US, effectively killing the market for Bombardier. It also puts a major order with Delta Airlines at risk - and things could get worse before they get better. Washington's Department of Commerce is due to make a second tariff ruling on 5 October. But a more important date is next February when the US International Trade Commission will either uphold the penalty or remove it. This was always the focus for Bombardier and its allies. Bombardier said it had created a ""superior aircraft"" that is more efficient and comfortable but Boeing was trying to prevent ""US passengers from realising these benefits, irrespective of the harm that it would cause to the US aerospace industry and the cost to airlines and consumers"". This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today that Bombardier tariff may have 'devastating' economic consequences But Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"", and said its aim was to make sure that ""aerospace companies abide by trade agreements"". Delta, however, said there was no risk to US businesses as neither Boeing nor any other US firm produced 100-110 seat aircraft to compete with the C-Series. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said one reason for the tariff ruling was Bombardier's failure to cooperate with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

""The evidence we have to rely on is evidence not coming from Bombardier but evidence being proposed by Boeing and other outside parties,"" he said. The US government was ""not necessarily"" targeting Bombardier's Northern Ireland factory, he said, but added: ""If you're building wings for a plane that doesn't get built, that's a problem."" Analysts say that the ruling will increase tensions between the US government and Canada and the UK, both countries have dealsto supply military aircraft,externalworth billions of dollars with Boeing. The UK government and Northern Ireland Executive pledged to invest almost Â£135m in the establishment of the C-Series manufacturing site. The programme received Â£750m from Quebec's provincial government in 2015 when its fortunes appeared to be ailing. Critics say Boeing's complaints are unfounded as it does not make 100-110 seat aircrafts with which the C-Series would compete On Wednesday, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard called the tariffs ""unfair"" and an attack on the Canadian province where Bombardier has its headquarters and employs more than 17,000 people. ""Quebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist,""  he told journalists, adding that that Quebec remained committed to manufacturing the C-Series. ""Boeing may have won the battle but the war is far from over,"" he said. In 2016, Quebec invested US$1bn in the passenger jet. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to cancel the purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jet fighters from the US in retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a Boeing order from the US Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday that the government was disappointed in the decision. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - a machinists union - called the countervailing duty ""a protectionist and dangerous measure for the stability of the aerospace industry"". In Northern Ireland, CBI director Angela McGowan said the ruling put an important driver of Northern Ireland's economic growth at risk. Northern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government for nine months, and Ms McGowan said the situation reinforced the need for a return of a power-sharing executive. ""With jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected,"" she said.
