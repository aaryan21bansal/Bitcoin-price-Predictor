PM to face grassroots no-confidence vote,"Prime Minister Theresa May is to face an unprecedented no-confidence challenge - from Conservative grassroots campaigners. More than 70 local association chiefs - angry at her handling of Brexit - have called for an extraordinary general meeting to discuss her leadership. A non-binding vote will be held at that National Conservative Convention EGM. Dinah Glover, chairwoman of the London East Area Conservatives, said there was ""despair in the party"". She told the BBC: ""I'm afraid the prime minister is conducting negotiations in such a way that the party does not approve."" The Conservative Party's 800 highest-ranking officers, including those chairing the local associations, will take part in the vote. Theresa May 'not considering election' on walking break Amber Rudd: Leadership bid is 'entirely possible' Are Tory members 'taking back control'? Mrs Maysurvived a vote of confidenceof her MPs in December - although 117 Conservatives voted against her. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent Did you enjoy the Easter Brexit truce? Don't expect it to last. Westminster will return tomorrow with many familiar tensions. Some Conservatives are angry at the prime minister's Brexit strategy and angry that she's holding talks with Labour. Any vote of no-confidence by local party campaigners won't be binding. But if it did pass it would be another example of the pressure in the party. In Parliament, there are continued calls from some for a rule change to allow another confidence vote by MPs (at the moment Mrs May is safe until December, one year on from the unsuccessful challenge at the end of 2018). One well-placed Tory said many have had enough. Mrs May does still have backers and seems determined to get on with the job. But any Easter calm looks set to be short-lived. Under party rules, MPs cannot call another no-confidence vote until December 2019. However, an EGM has to convene if more than 65 local associations demand one via a petition. The current petition, which has passed the signature threshold, states: ""We no longer feel that Mrs May is the right person to continue as prime minister to lead us forward in the [Brexit] negotiations. ""We therefore, with great reluctance, ask that she considers her position and resigns, to allow the Conservative Party to choose another leader, and the country to move forward and negotiate our exit from the EU."" It is believed to be the first time the procedure has been used.

Campaign to tackle 'botched' cosmetic care,"There have been calls for more regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures, such as lip fillers A campaign to tackle ""botched"" cosmetic procedures is to be launched shortly by the government in England. It follows a rise in people seeking surgeries such as a ""Brazilian butt lift"" abroad,which has led to deaths. There have also been warnings about the rise in the use of self-injected dermal and lip fillers, with the risk of causing complications that then have to be treated on the NHS. One expert welcomed the campaign, but said better regulation was also needed. Men warned about cosmetic procedures England's Department of Health told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the campaign, scheduled to launch in the coming weeks, would look to ensure the public was fully informed about the importance of seeking professional advice regarding fillers, Botox and cosmetic surgery. Botox party mishap left woman housebound Second Brit dies after 'Brazilian butt lift' Is 'Brazilian butt lift' surgery a risk worth taking? It said it also hoped to tackle the number of ""botched"" procedures, and the resulting impact on a person's mental and physical health, as well as the cost to the NHS of treatment following such procedures. Nora Nugent, a member of the council of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps), said she welcomed the government campaign in principle. She said the estimated increase in people seeking cosmetic procedures had not been matched by improved education on what the public should expect when accessing treatments, or what could go wrong. While the rise of celebrities and influencers sharing their procedures online had led to increased uptake, she added, it was also due in part to ""rising availability, better awareness of procedures and relatively more affordability"". It comes as an online survey of 1,033 women aged 18 to 30, commissioned by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme and Newsbeat and conducted by Deltapoll, suggests 83% would change part of their body if money and health risks were not a concern. Of those, 63% would change their stomach and 53% their breasts. Of the 7% of those surveyed who had had a cosmetic procedure, mostly lip fillers and botox: 69% felt more confident 52% felt more attractive 24% felt less attractive ""Greg"" (not his real name) told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he became addicted to using dermal fillers - injections used to fill out wrinkles and creases in the skin, although they are also often used to increase the volume and definition of lips and cheeks. He bought them online - as well as Botox - and began self-injecting into his face three years ago. ""You can lose sight of reality of what your face looks like,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Greg' used to self-inject dermal fillers into his face, despite the dangers ""There was a point where I was doing it quite a lot and my mum was noticing that my face was very distorted, and I was losing a lot of my characteristics."" You do not have to be a medical practitioner to administer such treatments, as filler solutions are not regulated like medicines. But self-injecting can cause swelling and infection, and in rare cases may need to be treated with surgery or medication if it causes lumps to form under the skin. It can also cause blindness. One of Greg's self-injected lip fillers went wrong when he had an infection. ""I woke up the next morning, they were uneven - one side was bigger than the other,"" he said. ""I had blisters. It was incredibly, incredibly painful. ""I was embarrassed to seek help."" Greg said he would now advise people not to use fillers, as it is a ""slippery slope"". ""Knowing the complications now, you have to be incredibly careful."" Ms Nugent, a consultant plastic surgeon, said she had concerns regarding so-called ""cowboy injectors"", such as beauticians, who administer fillers without medical training. This poses a risk, she said, as many are not qualified to suitably assess patients safely or to spot when complications do arise. She called for restrictions as to who can perform injectable treatments to be brought in. The Department of Health said: ""Anyone considering a cosmetic procedure should take the time to find a reputable, safe, and qualified practitioner, and make sure they understand the impact of any treatment on their physical and mental health. ""We're working to improve the safety of cosmetic procedures, through better training and clear information so that people can make informed decisions about their care."" In March, the Welsh government said it ""may be appropriate in the future"" to consult on adding dermal fillers to the licensing system. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner have helped popularise lip fillers Save Face, a national register of accredited practitioners, said it received 934 patient complaints regarding unregistered practitioners in 2017-18. Of these, 616 related to dermal fillers. Ms Nugent said she was also concerned about people going abroad for cosmetic surgery - where patients may not see the surgeon until the day of the operation, and it is more difficult to have follow-up treatment that could be needed as a result of complications. She said this included - but was not limited to - Brazilian butt lift surgery, from which two British women have died.

Huge moorland blaze 'started by barbecue',"A fire broke out on Marsden Moor on Sunday evening A second blaze has broken out on moorland in West Yorkshire on one of the hottest days of the year. The fire at Marsden Moor started on Sunday and was ""likely"" to have been caused by a barbecue at Easter Gate, the National Trust said. It has now spread to Denshaw in Saddleworth, Greater Manchester, the fire service said. Firefighters also remain on Ilkley Moor damping down a blaze which spread over 25,000 sq metres on Saturday.

The National Trust said the Marsden fire, which started at about 19:00 BST on Sunday, was the sixth on its moorland this year and covers about 3 sq km of land. Thelast significant fire was on 27 February, with four separate smaller fires reported since. The trust's Marsden branch said the moor was a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area and a Special Area of Conservation due to the ground-nesting bird population and blanket bog habitat. It said a helicopter had been deployed since 09:00 to take water from nearby reservoirs to the fire. Smoke can be seen coming from the Marsden fire for miles around ""At present it is estimated that an investment of more than Â£200,000 in restoring this special habitat has been lost,"" the trust said. ""The deployment of the helicopter itself costs the trust, a conservation charity, Â£2,000 per hour. ""We're devastated to see the destruction caused. Please help us protect the moors and wildlife by calling the fire brigade immediately if you spot any signs of fire."" Fire crews were at the scene of the moor fire near Huddersfield overnight Three men were arrested on Sunday over the Ilkley Moor fire but two were later released pending further investigation. One manhas been since charged with arson. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service tweeted thatpeople were still being seen lighting barbecues,externalon Ilkley Moor, despite the fire continuing to burn. It said it was working with police and Bradford Council to deal with the issue. Firefighters remained on Ilkley Moor on Monday Another fire broke out near Arnfield Reservoir in Derbyshire Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service is assisting West Yorkshire firefighters at Marsden and also helping Derbyshire crews tackle a fire near Arnfield Reservoir in Glossop. It said on its Facebook page: ""If you live around Stalybridge, Oldham or Rochdale and can smell the smoke please keep windows and doors shut as a precaution.""

US to end Iran oil sanctions exemptions,"The sanctions on Iran's oil industry have led to a sharp downturn in the country's economy US President Donald Trump has decided to end exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying oil from Iran. The White House said waivers for China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey would expire in May, after which they could face US sanctions themselves. This decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue. Iran insisted the sanctions were illegal and that it had attached ""no value or credibility"" to the waivers. Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. Under the accord, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. Is petrol about to become more expensive? US sanctions on Iran come into force The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a ""new deal"" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its ""malign behaviour"" across the Middle East. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. In November, the US reimposed sanctions on Iran's energy, ship building, shipping, and banking sectors, which officials called ""the core areas"" of its economy. However, six-month waivers from economic penalties were granted to the eight main buyers of Iranian crude - China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Italy and Greece - to give them time to find alternative sources and avoid causing a shock to global oil markets. Mike Pompeo said the US was ""dramatically accelerating"" its pressure campaign Three of the eight buyers - Greece, Italy and Taiwan - have stopped importing Iranian oil. But the others had reportedly asked for their waivers to be extended. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Mr Trump's decision not to renew the waivers showed his administration was ""dramatically accelerating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well supplied global oil markets"". ""We stand by our allies and partners as they transition away from Iranian crude to other alternatives,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We have had extensive and productive discussions with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other major producers to ease this transition and ensure sufficient supply. This, in addition to increasing US production, underscores our confidence that energy markets will remain well supplied."" By Barbara Plett Usher, BBC state department correspondent In recent weeks, Japan and South Korea have either halted or sharply decreased Iranian oil imports. Both are heavily dependent on foreign oil and Mr Pompeo said the administration had been trying to find alternatives. But Monday's move could strain relations - already tested over issues of trade and US policy towards North Korea - with these close allies. It's an even bigger problem for India, which is also under American pressure to cut oil purchases from Venezuela. Iran is one of Delhi's main oil suppliers. But India also has deep cultural and political ties with Tehran, which make it difficult to join US efforts to isolate the Islamic Republic. China is Iran's other big customer: it has slammed the US decision, saying its trade is perfectly legal, and the US has no jurisdiction to interfere. The question is whether Beijing will try to skirt sanctions through companies not tied to the US financial system. Turkey was most outspoken in lobbying for a waiver extension. Ankara argues that it badly needs the oil, that as a neighbour it can't cut ties with Iran, and that the pressure campaign won't work anyway. Iranians describe impact of US sanctions Iran nuclear deal: Key details Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would co-ordinate with fellow oil producers to ensure ""the global oil market does not go out of balance"". Iranian exports are currently estimated to be below 1 million barrels per day (bpd), compared to more than 2.5 million bpd before Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear deal last May. The price of global benchmark Brent crude rose by 3.33% to $74.37a barrel in trading on Monday - the highest since 1 November. US oil - known as West Texas Intermediate - was meanwhile up 2.90% at $65.93. In recent months, the price of oil has risen due to an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) cartel and its allies, including Russia, to cut their output by 1.2 million bpd. A spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry dismissed Mr Trump's decision, saying the country ""did not and does not attach any value or credibility to the waivers"". But Abbas Mousavi added that because of the sanctions' negative effects, Iran was in ""constant contact"" with its international partners and would act accordingly. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted thatthe US move would ""not serve regional peace and stability, yet will harm Iranian people"",external. ""Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbours,"" he added. China said earlier that it opposed unilateral US sanctions. ""China-Iran co-operation is open, transparent and in accordance with law. It should be respected,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, was quoted by the Financial Times as sayingthere should be no ""negative effect on the operations of Japanese companies"",external. Its refineries reportedly halted Iranian imports in March. India's government was studying the implications of the US announcement, the PTI news agency cited sources as saying. The country had reportedly hoped to be allowed to continue to reduce its Iranian oil imports gradually. South Korea stopped buying Iranian oil for four months in response, but resumed in January.In March, it imported 284,600 bpd,external. Is it about to get more expensive to fill my car?

Broken screens delay Samsung Galaxy Fold launch,"The Samsung Galaxy Fold was supposed to be released on 26 April Samsung has postponed the release of its folding smartphone, days after several early reviewers said the screens on their devices had broken. The company said it had delayed the launch of the Galaxy Fold to ""fully evaluate the feedback and run further internal tests"". In April, several early reviewers found the display on the Galaxy Fold broke after just a few days. Samsung has not said when the Â£1,800 device will go on sale. A new launch date will be announced in the ""coming weeks"". In a statement, Samsung said it suspected the damage experienced by some of the reviewers was caused by ""impact on the top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge"". It also said it found ""substances"" inside one of the review devices that may have affected its performance. Launch events due to take place in Hong Kong and Shanghai this week have also been postponed. This video can not be played WATCH: Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Fold The Galaxy Fold was due to be released in the United States on 26 April, and in the UK on 3 May. The South Korean tech giant has said it is investigating what went wrong with the broken review units. In some cases, reviewers had peeled off a layer of the screen's coating, mistaking it for a disposable screen protector. ""We will also enhance the guidance on care and use of the display including the protective layer,"" Samsung said in a statement. Chinese rivals Huawei and Xiaomi are also developing foldable smartphones, but neither company has announced a release date yet. by Chris Fox, technology reporter A phone priced at Â£1,800 - or $1,980 in the US - was never supposed to be bought by the masses. But the launch of the Galaxy Fold was meant to showcase Samsung as an innovative and forward-thinking gadget maker, and draw people into its stores. Now it is turning into a bit of an embarrassment, evoking memories of another botched launch: the ""exploding"" Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Samsung has been in a race to launch a folding device ahead of Chinese rival Huawei, which has announced its phone but not let reviewers take one home yet. Both manufacturers say their folding screens can be opened and closed more than 100,000 times without breaking, based on laboratory tests. But in the real world, reviewers have destroyed Samsung's device in less than 48 hours. Perhaps the Galaxy Fold needed a little longer in testing.

Defiant 'church of miracles',"St Anthony's Church, the site of one of the deadliest Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, is renowned as a place of worship open to all faiths, but the attacks have shut its doors for now. For the first time in its 175-year history, people are being turned away. The road to the shrine in Colombo's Kochchikade district is a familiar one to many, who - regardless of their religion - would regularly come here to seek blessings. St Anthony's is a Roman Catholic church but its patron has acquired a reputation among the wider population for being a ""miracle worker"". No request, no matter how large, small or strangely specific, is left unanswered by St Anthony, people say. On Monday, however, a day after the bomb blast ripped through its entrance, things are very different. The attack here was one of eight across the country which killed 310 people and injured many more. Police are fanned out near the turn-off to the church, marked by its distinctive large statue of St Anthony, mounted on a pedestal. The perimeter of the church itself has been cordoned off with yellow tape and is being guarded by armed security officers. Security has been stepped up across the country in the wake of the attacks Despite this, a sizeable crowd is still gathered outside, veering as close to the perimeter as they dare, most just staring at the large white building. From a distance it looks untouched, but look harder and hints of the carnage that took place inside become more visible. Near its entrance, half hidden by a wall, you can see bits of rubble and shards of glass. The clock on its left tower is frozen at 8.45 - the time the blast took place. There were so many casualties here because such a large crowd had gathered. Even on a normal day, the church is filled with worshippers. For Easter Mass, the chief priest thought well over 1,000 people were in the congregation. This video can not be played Aftermath of deadly Sri Lanka explosions Scores are thought to have been killed at St Anthony's - it's not clear yet how many lost their lives. Among those gathered outside the church is Prabath Buddhika. Although Mr Buddhika is Buddhist by religion, like many others, he is a strong believer in the power of St Anthony. ""My house is right here,"" he said, adding that he'd been attending the church since he was a child and gone along with his family many times. Prabath Buddhika says he cannot describe the carnage he saw Like many others, Mr Buddhika ran to the church after hearing the explosions. The carnage he saw there could not be described, he says, but people fearlessly came forward from around the area in order to help. Among them was Peter Michael Fernando, a Catholic who lives close to the church. He was asleep when the blast occurred, he says, waking up after his ""bed shook"" with the force of the explosion. He ran towards the church after seeing plumes of smoke rising into the sky. Follow live updates here Who are the victims? ""There were bodies and parts of bodies everywhere. I saw there were two people who were still alive so I helped them to an ambulance. I was weeping."" Mr Fernando says what stayed with him was the number of children he saw among the dead and injured. ""They were screaming, they were bleeding. We tried to help as many as we could. I carried a little girl into one of the vans - she had lost a leg,"" he said, breaking down again. Peter Michael Fernando says the force of the blast shook him awake A little distance away stands Anuja Subasinghe, a nurse. She has been staring at the church for a long time. ""This church is for those who carry unbearable sadness - it gives them solace,"" she says with tears in her eyes. ""Who would do something like this? Why would they do this?"" She couldn't come for Sunday's Easter Mass because she had to report for duty, but on Monday morning she felt she needed to be there for the church. ""My husband died 12 years ago and the only thing that got me through that terrible tragedy was this church,"" she says. ""I didn't need any other man. St Anthony was enough for me."" Like Mr Buddhika, Ms Subasinghe was born a Buddhist, but converted to Christianity after discovering the church. So what is it about this church and St Anthony in particular that has captured the imagination of so many people? According to Father Leo Perera, a parish priest who serves nearby, part of it is to do with the fact St Anthony's Church has always been associated with miracles. In fact, its very origin has been attributed to one. Father Perera says the attacks will not erode faith in the church According to local legend and the written history of the archdiocesan archives, St Anthony's Church was built by a priest from Cochin in southern India, named Father Antonio. He secretly practised Catholicism during the Dutch rule of Colombo in the 18th Century, although it had been named a proscribed religion. He was able to build the church, the legend says, after performing a miracle. The locals had come to him in panic after seeing the sea rising and asked him to pray for it to recede. He did, and the sea not only receded, but a sand bank suddenly emerged from the waters. So he planted a cross there and built a small mud church, in which he remained until his death. The other reason, Father Leo says, is the fact that many people have testified that the church has answered prayers and restored faith. In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Eight Britons killed in Sri Lanka attacks ""Everyone who goes there comes away with the happy feeling that their prayers have been heard,"" he said, adding that on special celebratory feast days, the church was always full of grateful people who had come to give offerings as thanks for having their prayers heard. But what next, I ask him? Will the attacks erode people's faith in the power of this church? ""Absolutely not,"" he says with emotion. ""You cannot keep people away from here just because of something like this. They will keep coming back because this is the time they want the presence of God in their life. There is no way this will affect the power of this church and the faith of its believers."" This sentiment is echoed by Mr Buddhika. ""This is no ordinary church. Whoever did this didn't know what they were messing with - they cannot simply get away with something like this. ""They will pay for this over generations."" And this is because St Anthony's is so much more than just a place of worship. It is a symbol of Sri Lanka's plurality and tolerance. A reminder that in a country, still bruised by the memories of a brutal civil war and inter-religious violence, its diverse communities have traditionally lived together peacefully and embraced each other's beliefs and differences. That perhaps explains why so many of them still came together to stand in front of the church, to express sadness and horror at what took place within. In its darkest hour, the church continues to be a symbol of hope - with many Sri Lankans choosing to stand together despite the hatred that has unfolded among them.

New record for Easter Monday temperatureScotland's top temperature of 24.2C (75.5F) is recorded in Kinlochewe in Wester Ross.Scotland,"Families flocked to Portobello beach on the outskirts of Edinburgh Scotland has enjoyed its hottest Easter Monday on record with a top temperature of 24.2C (75.5F) in Kinlochewe in Wester Ross. The figure beat the previous high of 21.4C (70.5F) from 2014. It came 24 hours after a peak of 23.4C in Edinburgh broke Scotland's Easter Sunday record. This year, Easter fell on the latest date since 2011, meaning that warm weather is far more likely than those years when Easter is marked in March. Six-year-old Brodie Tait cools down in a fountain in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens The Met Office said all four of the UK nations had recorded their warmest Easter Monday on record. Hottest Easter Monday in all four UK nations Scotland basks in record Easter temperatures Why can't the date of Easter be fixed? The second highest temperature recorded in Scotland was  23.7C (74.6F) in Achnagart in the Highlands, followed by 23.5C (74.3F) in Kinloss in Moray. Temperatures are likely to fall back to the seasonal average later in the week. Temperatures across Scotland were warmer than many parts of the Mediterranean The Monday sunshine brought huge crowds to beaches and parks around the country. That caused some disruption on the roads, with long tailbacks around parts of Loch Lomond. Traffic was also heavy around Largs and other Ayrshire seaside towns. In the east there were reports of big delays near the Fife coast. Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow was a popular sun trap Matt Row, duty forecaster at the Met Office in Aberdeen, said much of Scotland had been warmer than the Mediterranean, which was ""quite remarkable"". BBC Scotland Weather Watcher Merlynhs took this picture of the glorious conditions on the Isle of Lewis The Isle of Harris got in on the act too, with this scene captured by BBC Scotland Weather Watcher Sharons travels He added: ""We've had wall-wall-wall sunshine, from Shetland all the way down to Galloway. ""Normally we expect 12C as an average for much of Scotland in April. But today the Balearics have been 15C and 17C in eastern Spain. ""It will be another warm day in the west of Scotland on Tuesday, with temperatures up to 22C. But it will be cooler in the east and we will see that cooler weather spreading across the whole of Scotland during the rest o the week. ""And, indeed, there will be some welcome rain for many of us by Thursday and Friday.""

Sri Lanka attacks 'linked to foreign network',"This video can not be played Aftermath of deadly Sri Lanka explosions A wave of bombings that killed 290 people in Sri Lanka on Sunday was carried out with the support of an international network, officials said. The government has blamed a little-known local jihadist group, National Thowheed Jamath, although no-one has yet admitted carrying out the bombings. Another 500 people were injured in the suicide attacks on churches and hotels. Police arrested 24 people in a series of raids and the president's office declared a state of national emergency. The emergency declaration, which comes into effect from midnight (18:30 GMT) on Monday, will give police and military extensive powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders. What we know so far Dispatch: St Anthony's, 'church of miracles' Who are the victims? The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath On Monday, another blast rocked a street near a church in the capital, Colombo. Police were attempting to defuse explosives in a vehicle used by the attackers when it blew up. It is not yet known if anyone was hurt. Sri Lankan authorities were warned about a bomb threat from National Thowheed Jamath a full two weeks before the attacks, cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said at a press conference. He said that the warnings were not passed on to the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, or his cabinet. Mr Wickremesinghe acknowledged that security services had been ""aware of information"" but had not acted on the information. This video can not be played A bomb exploded on Monday as police in Colombo tried to defuse it Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando told the BBC that the intelligence ""never indicated it was going to be an attack of this magnitude"". ""They were talking about isolated, one or two incidents. Not like this,"" he said. He said ""all important departments of the police"" were informed about the warning, but acknowledged that no action was taken. Mr Senaratne said that authorities believed the bombers had international support. ""We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country,"" he said, adding: ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded."" A later statement said President Maithripala Sirisena would ask for foreign help to track down the international links to the attackers. ""The intelligence reports [indicate] that foreign terrorist organisations are behind the local terrorists. Therefore, the president is to seek the assistance of the foreign countries,"" his office said. There were emotional scenes outside St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo A curfew is to be imposed from 20:00 (14:30 GMT) until 04:00 on Tuesday, the government said. A national day of mourning has been scheduled for Tuesday. Sri Lanka's National Security Council said a ""conditional state of emergency"" from midnight would target ""terrorism"" and would not limit freedom of expression. In another development, the US State Department issued revised travel advice urging greater caution, adding, ""Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka."" The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 local time with six blasts reported within a small space of time. Three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district were targeted during Easter services. Blasts also rocked the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the country's capital. Police did not release a breakdown of how many people were killed and wounded at each location. All the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, officials said. Police then carried out raids on two addresses and there were explosions at both. One was in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and the other was near the Colombo district of Dematagoda in which three officers were killed. British dad's tribute to family In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' An improvised explosive device - a 6ft-long [1.8m] plastic pipe packed with explosives - was also found and defused near the airport in Colombo. Police also recovered 87 low-explosive detonators from the Bastian Mawatha private bus station in Pettah, our correspondent reports. There was swirling speculation about who could be behind the attacks and the government restricted access to social media in the aftermath of the bombings. National Thowheed Jamath was later named by a government spokesman as the main suspect. This video can not be played Sri Lanka attacks: ""My heart shattered when I saw the bodies"" The group has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. Addressing reports that officials had had prior intelligence of forthcoming attacks, Mr Wickremesinghe said: ""We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the ministers were kept informed."" Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Very few here expected these massive attacks. The co-ordination, sophistication and timing may indicate international support, but it is not clear yet if National Thowheed Jamath, if it is indeed responsible, has links with global jihadist groups. It is thought that some Muslim youths in Sri Lanka were radicalised after clashes last year in Kandy district between the majority Sinhala Buddhists and Muslims. Videos posted on social media showed hardline Islamists and Sinhala hardliners promoting hatred. But why were the Christians targeted? They are also a minority in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan Muslims are baffled by the attacks, as well as nervous and afraid. Sri Lanka has experience of such attacks - suicide bombers were used by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war. But the ruthlessness of the these new atrocities is a shock, and the number of dead is a deep wound to the nation, a wound that will take much time to heal. The vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians who died at Easter church services. The ministry of foreign affairs said it had identified 31 foreign nationals among the dead, with 14 unaccounted for. The death toll included at least eight British citizens and at least eight citizens of India. They include three of the children of Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, a family spokesman confirmed to the BBC. Mr Povlsen owns the Bestseller clothing chain and holds a majority stake in clothing giant Asos. British lawyer Anita Nicholson died alongside her two children, Alex, 14, and Annabel, 11, when a suicide bomber detonated a device in the breakfast queue at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo. Her husband Ben Nicholson survived. ""I am deeply distressed at the loss of my wife and children,"" he said in a statement. ""Anita was a wonderful, perfect wife and a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children ... Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood.""

Sri Lanka faces bomb warnings scrutiny,"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe (C) arrives at one of the bomb sites Scrutiny fell on rifts in Sri Lanka's leadership on Monday after it emerged that authorities were warned about the group accused in Sunday's bombings. Attacks on churches and hotels killed 310 people and wounded nearly 500. Security agencies had been watching the National Thowheed Jamath jihadist group, reports said, and had notified police about a possible attack. But the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the cabinet were not informed, ministers said. On Tuesday, the country is observing a day to ""mourn the senseless loss of innocent lives,""Mr Wickremesinghe said in a statement posted to Twitter.,external ""It is imperative that we remain unified as Sri Lankans in the face of this unspeakable tragedy,"" he added. What we know so far Dispatch: St Anthony's - 'church of miracles' Who are the victims? The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath The prime minister was not privy to security briefings following a rift last year with President Maithripala Sirisena, cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told a press conference. Mr Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe and his cabinet in October and tried to install another prime minister, prompting a full-blown constitutional crisis. He was forced to reinstate Mr Wickremesinghe under pressure from the nation's supreme court, but apparently kept the prime minister from security briefings. Mr Senaratne said intelligence agencies had begun issuing warnings about the group on 4 April, after which the defence ministry sent a detailed warning to the chief of police; and on 11 April a memo was sent to the heads of several security divisions. He said information passed to police included a warning from a foreign intelligence agency about possible attacks by the group, as well as names of members. US media quote Sri Lankan officials as saying both Indian and US intelligence had warned the country about a threat in early April. Residents gather outside St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, a day after it was bombed It was not clear on Monday whether Mr Sirisena had been made aware of the warnings. ""Our understanding is that it was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to Mr Sirisena, told the BBC. He said that the president had appointed a special committee led by a supreme court judge to investigate what had happened. Rauff Hakeem, the minister for town planning, called the attacks a ""colossal failure of intelligence"". ""It is shameful for all of us. We are all ashamed of this,"" he said. Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando tweeted: ""Some intelligence officers were aware of this incidence. Therefore there was a delay in action. Serious action needs to be taken as to why this warning was ignored."" Sri Lankan authorities declared a state of emergency which came into effect at midnight (18:30 GMT) on Monday. The declaration gives police and the military sweeping powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders - powers that were last used during the nation's civil war. A curfew also came into effect at 20:00, leaving armed security forces patrolling largely deserted streets in Colombo on Monday night. The government blocked access to Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram after the attacks. Police arrested 24 suspects in a series of raids just hours after the blasts, and later said 87 bomb detonators had been found at the Bastian Mawatha private bus station in Petta. This video can not be played A bomb exploded on Monday as police in Colombo tried to defuse it On Monday, another blast rocked a street in the capital, Colombo, when a bomb went off while police attempted to defuse it, although no-one was hurt.

British dad's tribute to family,"Anita Nicholson and her son Alex, 14, and daughter Annabel, 11, died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing A British husband has paid tribute to his ""wonderful"" wife and their two ""amazing"" children who were among the 310 victims of a wave of bombings in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. Ben Nicholson survived the blast at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo but his wife Anita, 42, their son Alex, 14, and daughter Annabel, 11, were all killed. They had been visiting the country on holiday from their home in Singapore. Five other British citizens were among those killed in eight blasts. They include former firefighter Bill Harrop and his partner, Dr Sally Bradley, from Manchester who were also on holiday. Tributes were also paid to business student Daniel Linsey and his sister, Amelie Linsey, who attended Godolphin and Latymer School in west London. The school said it was ""obviously devastated and shocked"" by the news, while Westminster Kingsway College, which Daniel attended, said it was ""saddened"" to hear of his ""tragic death"". The suicide attacks on churches and hotels in Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa also left 500 people injured. Bill Harrop and his partner Sally Bradley were among those killed in the blasts In Sri Lanka,the first mass funeral has been heldas the nation marks a day of mourning for the victims. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath. The Islamic State (IS) group later claimed it carried out the attacks - but a BBC correspondent in Sri Lanka said the claim should be treated cautiously. Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack. A spokesman said they included a Syrian who was arrested ""after the interrogation of local suspects"". Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, has said that ""preliminary investigations"" indicate the bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. He did not give any details. The UK'sForeign Office has updated its travel advice for Sri Lanka,external, warning tourists to avoid crowded public areas, plan any movements carefully and avoid travelling during the newly-implemented nationwide curfew. Mr Nicholson, a partner with law firm Kennedys, said his family were killed at a table in the restaurant of the Shangri-La Hotel, in the capital Colombo. He said he was ""deeply distressed"" at his loss but ""mercifully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering"". In pictures: Sri Lanka's deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' He added that his wife, a lawyer for mining firm Anglo American, ""was a wonderful, perfect wife and a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children"". ""Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children, and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood. ""They shared with their mother the priceless ability to light up any room they entered and bring joy to the lives of all they came into contact with."" He thanked the medical teams in Colombo and the Sri Lankan people he had encountered since. The damaged Shangri-La hotel in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, after an explosion Assistant County Fire Officer Dave Keelan, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, has paid tribute to his former colleague Mr Harrop after hearing the ""devastating"" news. ""Bill served here for 30 years, retiring at the end of 2012. He was a much loved and respected colleague and friend. He will be greatly missed."" Dr Bradley, who moved to Western Australia in 2012, was the director of clinical services at Rockingham Peel Group in Perth. Executive director Kathleen Smith told 6PR radio: ""She absolutely loved living in Australia. She felt very at home here. ""They (Dr Bradley and Mr Harrop) were soul mates, they just lived for each other. ""He had two boys, which Sally took on as her step-sons. She talked about them as if they were her own."" The team from North Manchester General Hospital, where Sally had previously worked, added: ""Sally was a lovely, kind individual, extremely approachable and gave so much to the NHS in Manchester during her career."" It is not currently known which explosion killed the couple. Most of those killed in the explosions are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals but officials say at least 31 foreigners are among the dead including British, Indian, Danish, Saudi, Chinese and Turkish nationals. Details have started to emerge about some of them, including Sri Lankan celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne and her daughter Nisanga, and three children ofDanish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. The UK's High Commissioner, James Dauris, confirmed that eight British citizens were known to have died but said there were no further Britons with serious injuries. Mr Dauris said: ""We know there are a small number of foreign nationals who are unaccounted for. We don't know what the nationality of those people is."" He urged those still in the country to contact relatives and to follow instructions from local authorities. Manisha Gunasekera, Sri Lanka's High Commissioner, told the BBC that the large Sri Lankan community in the UK was ""very concerned"". The Queen has offered her condolences to Sri Lanka's president, saying her thoughts and prayers were with all Sri Lankans.

Parkinson's implant restores movement,"This video can not be played Gail Jardine: ""I can walk, I can turn... it's really helped me"" A treatment that has restored the movement of patients with chronic Parkinson's disease has been developed by Canadian researchers. Previously housebound patients are now able to walk more freely as a result of electrical stimulation to their spines. A quarter of patients have difficulty walking as the disease wears on, often freezing on the spot and falling. Parkinson's UK hailed its potential impact on an aspect of the disease where there is currently no treatment. Prof Mandar Jog, of Western University and associate scientific director, Lawson Health Research Institute in London, Ontario, told BBC News the scale of benefit to patients of his new treatment was ""beyond his wildest dreams"". Scientists monitor their patients' improvement using sensors on a specially made suit. ""Most of our patients have had the disease for 15 years and have not walked with any confidence for several years,"" he said. ""For them to go from being home-bound, with the risk of falling, to being able to go on trips to the mall and have vacations is remarkable for me to see."" Normal walking involves the brain sending instructions to the legs to move. It then receives signals back when the movement has been completed before sending instructions for the next step. The parts of the brain involved with movement (red on the left-hand scan) are not working properly, but three months into the trial those areas are now functioning Prof Jog believes Parkinson's disease reduces the signals coming back to the brain - breaking the loop and causing the patient to freeze. The implant his team has developed boosts that signal, enabling the patient to walk normally. However, Prof Jog was surprised that the treatment was long-lasting and worked even when the implant was turned off. He believes the electrical stimulus reawakens the feedback mechanism from legs to brain that is damaged by the disease. ""This is a completely different rehabilitation therapy,"" he said. ""We had thought that the movement problems occurred in Parkinson's patients because signals from the brain to the legs were not getting through. ""But it seems that it's the signals getting back to the brain that are degraded."" Brain scans showed that before patients received the electrical treatment, the areas that control movement were not working properly. But a few months into the treatment those areas were restored. Gail Jardine, 66, is among the patients who has benefited from the treatment. Before she received the implant two months ago, Gail kept freezing on the spot, and she would fall over two or three times a day. She lost her confidence and stopped walking in the countryside in Kitchener, Ontario - something she loved doing with her husband, Stan. Now she can walk with Stan in the park for the first time in more than two years. ""I can walk a lot better,"" she said. ""I haven't fallen since I started the treatment. It's given me more confidence and I'm looking forward to taking more walks with Stan and maybe even go on my own"". Guy Alden used to rely on a wheelchair but after his treatment he had his first holiday in seven years with his wife, Barb Another beneficiary is Guy Alden, 70, a deacon at a catholic church in London, Ontario. He was forced to retire in 2012 because of his Parkinson's disease. His greatest regret was that it curtailed his work in the community, such as his prison visits. ""I was freezing a lot when I was in a crowd or crossing a threshold in a mall. Everyone would be looking at me. It was very embarrassing,"" he told me. ""Now I can walk in crowds. My wife and I even went on holiday to Maui and I didn't need to use my wheelchair at any point. There were a lot of narrow roads and a lot of (slopes) and I did all of that pretty well."" Dr Beckie Port, research manager at Parkinson's UK, said: ""The results seen in this small-scale pilot study are very promising and the therapy certainly warrants further investigation. ""Should future studies show the same level of promise, it has the potential to dramatically improve quality of life, giving people with Parkinson's the freedom to enjoy everyday activities.""

Climate protesters stage museum 'die-in',"This video can not be played Protesters lie down underneath the giant whale skeleton in the museum's main hall Extinction Rebellion activists took over part of the Natural History Museum as the climate change protest entered its second week. About 100 people lay down under the blue whale skeleton at about 14:15 BST. It comes as more than 1,000 people have been arrested since the protests began in central London a week ago. The climate change group are now based in Marble Arch, after police moved protesters from Oxford Street, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square. Extinction Rebellion said it hoped the protest at the museum, which it called a ""die-in"", would raise awareness of what they call the ""sixth mass extinction"". Most of the protesters finished their lie-down protest after about half an hour. But some people wearing red face paint, veils and robes remained to give a performance to classical music on the steps underneath the whale skeleton. The ""die-in"" protest lasted about an hour and concluded with a performance by The Invisible Circus On Sunday, teenage activist Greta Thunberg told the rally in Marble Arch that they were ""making a difference"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the protest was taking ""a real toll"" on London's police and businesses. ""I'm extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer,"" he said. About 9,000 police officers have been responding to the protest since it began a week ago on 15 April. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally A total of 1,065 people have been arrested and 53 have been charged for various offences including breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police. Olympic gold medallist Etienne Stott was one of the activists arrestedas police moved to clear Waterloo Bridge on Sunday evening. The London 2012 canoe slalom champion was carried from the bridge by four officers as he shouted about the ""ecological crisis"". Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protesters 'making a difference' Who is Greta Thunberg? An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said there would be no escalation of activity on Easter Monday, but warned that the disruption could get ""much worse"" if politicians are not open to their negotiation requests. On Sunday, one organiser told the BBC the group were planning ""a week of activities"" including a bid to prevent MPs entering Parliament. The group said a ""people's assembly"" was due to be held later to decide what will happen in the coming week. Thousands of protesters have spent Monday at the Marble Arch site The protest group has been forced to focus its activities on its Marble Arch site On Sunday, Ms Thunberg was greeted with chants of ""we love you"" as she took to the stage in front of thousands of people at the rally. The 16-year-old, who is credited with inspiring an international movement to fight climate change, told the crowd ""humanity is standing at a crossroads"" and that protesters ""will never stop fighting for this planet"". Met Commissioner Cressida Dick has said that during her 36-year career she had never known a single police operation to result in so many arrests. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Three boats with 36 migrants found,"Border Force vessels were involved in the operations to bring migrants ashore on two of the three boats Three small boats with 36 migrants on board have been intercepted off the Kent coast, the Home Office said. A vessel with 11 men on board was spotted in the English Channel in the early hours and brought to Dover by a Border Force cutter. A second boat with 15 people, including children, was escorted by the RNLI into Dungeness a few hours later. Shortly afterwards a third boat with nine men and one woman was intercepted by Border Force and brought to Dover. A Home Office spokesman said all 36 migrants had claimed to be Iraqi or Iranian but their nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? All have been medically examined and passed to immigration officials for interview. At least 493 people, including more than 35 children, have crossed the Channel in small boats since 3 November 2018. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Canoeist dies during annual race,"The race is considered to be one of the world's toughest endurance challenges A canoeist has died during the annual Devizes to Westminster Canoe Race. Race directors said they were ""saddened"" to report a person had died in the final stages of the race on Monday. In a statement they added: ""We are co-operating with the relevant authorities in investigating the incident fully."" The four-day race is held every Easter over a course of 125 miles (201 km) and is considered to be one of the world's toughest endurance challenges. The race directors said their ""thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of the paddler"". David Joy, chief executive of British Canoeing, added: ""I'm sure our whole community will be deeply upset to hear the tragic news this morning that a paddler has lost their life whilst competing in the Devizes to Westminster Canoe Race.""

Amazon 'regrets' Game of Thrones leak,"Emilia Clarke plays Daenerys Targaryen in HBO's popular fantasy series The latest episode of Game of Thrones was uploaded to Amazon early due to an ""error"", the company has said. The second instalment of the eighth and final series was not supposed to be broadcast until Sunday evening. But some Amazon Prime members were able to watch it several hours before that. ""We regret that for a short time Amazon customers in Germany were able to access episode two of season eight of Game of Thrones,"" an Amazon spokesman said.

Who are National Thowheed Jamath?,"Officials inspect the damage caused by a bomb at St Sebastian's Church in Negombo A previously little-known group called the National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) is being accused of having carried out the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan officials pinned the blame on the NTJ at a news conference one day after the attacks. However, the NTJ has not admitted carrying out the wave of bombings which tore through the island, killing at least 250 people. On Tuesday, the Islamic State (IS) group said its militants had carried out the attacks. It did not provide any details. The IS claim should be treated cautiously. The group usually claims an attack very soon afterwards, publishing pictures of those who carried it out on its media portal, Amaq. But still, the allegation raises the question, what is the NTJ? Until Monday, when the Sri Lankan government spokesman mentioned its name, very few people had heard of the NTJ. The group is believed to have splintered off from another hardline Islamist group in the country, the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath (SLTJ). It was founded by Zahran Hashim, the suspected leader of the suicide bombers who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo. However, Hashim is said to have been expelled from the NTJ after making hate speeches and may, in turn, have founded another splinter group. While still relatively unknown, the SLTJ is a bit more established.Its secretary, Abdul Razik, was arrested in 2016,externalfor inciting hatred against Buddhists. He later issued an apology. What we know so far Who are the victims? Children of the Easter Sunday attacks What led to carnage? Some reports have also linked the NTJ to a spate of vandalism last December that targeted Buddhist temples in Mawanella, central Sri Lanka. The faces of Buddha statues that were on display outside the temples were attacked. But the NTJ is an extremist fringe group within an already small religious minority - only 9.7% of Sri Lanka's population of about 21 million are Muslim. Its social media presence is sparse, too. Although it has a Facebook page, it is only updated every few weeks or so. The NTJ Twitter feed has not been updated since March 2018. The group's website is also offline - although it is not clear if it was taken down before or after the attacks. Government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told reporters that there had been ""several warnings from foreign intelligence agencies about the impending attacks"". This is not the only claim that officials had been alerted. Sri Lankan Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando tweeted a document that was reportedly sent by Sri Lanka's police chief earlier in April. That document explicitly names the NTJ as well as a warning that the group was planning to attack churches and the Indian High Commission. The document also names Mohamed Zahran, the group's leader.

Alan Keenan, Sri Lanka director for the International Crisis Group think tank, also told BBC 5Live that the NTJ ""appears to be the same group"" as those behind the Mawanella vandalism. He added: ""The police eventually arrested a group of young men who were said to have been the students of a preacher who's named in the intelligence document that came out yesterday [Sunday]."" Government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne named the NTJ as suspects (file photo) But given how small NTJ are, officials suspect that it was not acting alone. ""We don't see that only a small organisation in this country can do all that,"" Mr Senaratne said. ""We're now investigating the international support for them, and their other links, how they produced the suicide bombers here, and how they produced bombs like this."" And while not naming the NTJ directly, the Sri Lankan president's office echoed this belief that whichever group was behind the attacks had help from abroad. ""The intelligence sections have reported that there are international terror groups which are behind the local terrorists,"" a statement from President Maithripala Sirisena said. ""International assistance will be sought to combat them.""

Eight Britons killed in Sri Lanka attacks,"Anita Nicholson and her son Alex, 14, and daughter Annabel, 11, died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing Eight British citizens are among the hundreds killed in explosions in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, the UK's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka has said. They include Anita Nicholson, 42, her 14-year-old son Alex and her 11-year-old daughter Annabel. Mrs Nicholson's husband Ben survived and paid tribute to his ""wonderful"" wife and their ""amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children"". Police say at least 290 people were killed in eight blasts in the country. 'International network' linked to bombings Follow live updates here Who are the victims? Mr Nicholson said his family were killed at a table in the restaurant of the Shangri-La Hotel, in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, while they were on holiday. He said he was ""deeply distressed"" at his loss but ""mercifully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering"". He added that his wife ""was a wonderful, perfect wife and a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children"". ""Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children, and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood. ""They shared with their mother the priceless ability to light up any room they entered and bring joy to the lives of all they came into contact with."" He thanked the medical teams in Colombo and the Sri Lankan people he had encountered since. A further 500 people were injured in the blasts - but the UK's High Commissioner, James Dauris, said there were no Britons with serious injuries. Officials in Sri Lanka believe at least 35 foreign nationals are among the dead. Mr Dauris said: ""We know there are a small number of foreign nationals who are unaccounted for. We don't know what the nationality of those people is."" This video can not be played Deadly explosions strike across Sri Lanka Danish, Indian, Turkish and Dutch citizens are also among those known to have died. Mr Dauris urged those still in the country to contact relatives and to follow instructions from local authorities.

There were also explosions at a hotel near Dehiwala zoo and in the residential district of Dematagoda. Further blasts took place in St Sebastian's Church in Negombo, a town approximately 20 miles north of Colombo, and at Zion Church in Batticaloa, on the east coast. Manisha Gunasekera, Sri Lanka's High Commissioner, told the BBC that the large Sri Lankan community in the UK was ""very concerned"". The Queen has offered her condolences to Sri Lanka's president, saying her thoughts and prayers were with all Sri Lankans. She said: ""Prince Philip and I were deeply saddened to learn of the attacks in Sri Lanka yesterday and send our condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives"". St Sebastian's Church in Negombo was severely damaged Kieran Arasaratnam, a professor at Imperial College London, was on his way to the breakfast room in the Shangri-La hotel when he heard the blast. He told the BBC he saw a young child, aged about eight or nine, being carried to an ambulance, and all around him, ""everyone's just running in panic"". ""The military was coming in. It's just total chaos. So I then just literally ran out and then I looked to the room on the right and there's blood everywhere."" Tourist Marisa Keller, from London, was also staying at the Shangri-La but wasn't in the hotel when it was attacked. She said she felt ""lucky to be alive"". ""There were lots of bodies, blood, ambulances, police. Swat teams were sent in. ""One side of the hotel was blocked off. They were letting people back in because of the hot sun,"" she said. One of the explosions hit the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo Julian Emmanuel and his family, from Surrey, were staying at the Cinnamon Grand when they were woken up by the explosion. ""There were ambulances, fire crews, police sirens,"" he told the BBC. ""I came out of the room to see what's happening, we were ushered downstairs. ""We were told there had been a bomb. Staff said some people were killed. One member of staff told me it was a suicide bomber."" A statue of the Virgin Mary, broken in St Anthony's Shrine The Sri Lankan government said on Monday that the bombings werecarried out with the support of an international network. It has blamed a little-known local jihadist group, National Thowheed Jamath, although no-one has yet admitted carrying out the attacks. Police have arrested 24 people in a series of raids. People caught up in the deadly blasts tell their story Sri Lanka profiled: Find out more about the country Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has condemned the attacks as ""utterly despicable destruction"" during his Easter address at Canterbury Cathedral.

Older women 'exploited' by IVF clinics,"Older women are being exploited by IVF clinics ""trading on hope"", the fertility watchdog has warned. Sally Cheshire, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA),told the Daily Telegraph,externalsome private clinics were using ""selective success rates"" to target older women. IVF is less likely to be successful as a woman gets older. Since 2004 the number of women in their 40s undergoing fertility treatment has doubled to 10,835 in 2017. The latest HFEA figures show that, among those using their own eggs, out of 2,265 embryo transfers in 2017, just 75 women aged 43 to 44 ended up with a baby. For those over 44, the success rate was even lower - amounting to 1% between 2004 and 2017. Mrs Cheshire told the BBC that some women were not being told their ""realistic chance of success"" when sold the treatment. She said all UK clinics needed to be ""transparent"" about the costs involved, as well as the likely outcome. Women 'need to know egg freezing risk' Women over 34 refused IVF treatment Mrs Cheshire added that the clinics giving ""selective statistics"" tended to be ""foreign"". ""If you have treatment in the UK, all those clinics are regulated by us - by and large it's a good sector,"" she said. ""What we're concerned about are more of the foreign clinics who are coming to the UK who are investing here... who absolutely are not being honest."" NHS guidelines,externalrecommend that women under 40 should be offered three full cycles of IVF, while those between 40 and 42 should be offered one full cycle. However eligibility criteria vary in different areas of the country. IVF is not usually recommended for women over the age of 42 because of low success rates. An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35 On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Mrs Cheshire said some parts of the sector were using ""blatant"" sales tactics to persuade ""vulnerable"" women to undergo treatment. The 50-year-old said she had even been offered IVF treatments herself, by staff who were unaware of her role with the regulator, at a visit to a fertility show in Manchester. ""We now see things like 'guaranteed baby or your money back','' she told the Telegraph. Mrs Cheshire also called for the watchdog to be given powers to regulate prices, saying that some private centres were charging up to Â£20,000 for cycles - four times as much as she said treatments should cost. She said prices were often inflated by the growing use of ""add-on treatments"", such as embryo glue and endometrial scratches, offered by clinics to boost chances of success. Caroline, 40, wishes someone had sat her down and given her a realistic cost for her IVF treatment but says that often medical staff do not know for sure. She was originally led to believe the cost would be Â£5,000 but it is now at least Â£16,000. ""The list of treatment costs is just jargon and there are so many options. I think I needed someone to sit me down and say to me 'this is you and this is what it will cost',"" she said. The cost is not the only downside of IVF treatment for Caroline - the hormones have added negatively to the experience. ""I am taking some time off from treatment as I find injecting all the hormones really messes with me emotionally. The injections have bowled me over and made me completely lose it."" Adding: ""When you're crying your eyes out at work it's not a good look."" However, Caroline, whose full name we are not using at her request, thinks she will continue with the treatment as she has two vials of sperm left and will likely spend another Â£10,000. However, earlier this year the watchdog, which regulates all fertility services in the UK,warned that these were being offered without conclusive evidence that they increase the chance of pregnancy,external. Its website now has a ""traffic light"" rating for such treatments. None have been given the green light, which indicates there is more than one quality trial showing the procedure is effective and safe.

Lawrence: Schools must help tackle racism,"Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racially motivated attack in 1993 Schools must teach pupils how to challenge racism from an early age, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has said. Marking the first Stephen Lawrence Day, Baroness Lawrence added children must learn to ""embrace inclusion"". Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death in a racially motivated attack in Eltham, south-east London, on 22 April 1993. Prime Minister Theresa May described the murder as a ""watershed moment for our country"". Last year, on the 25th anniversary of his death, Mrs May announced the creation of an annual Stephen Lawrence Day, to begin in 2019. The London Marathon, which is held on Sunday,has already announced that it will dedicate the 18-mile marker on the course in honour of Stephen. Writing in the Guardian,externalon Monday, Baroness Lawrence said: ""If we are to encourage future generations to build a better society, free from discrimination, I believe that we must teach tolerance and inclusion from an early age. ""Education is a powerful way of inspiring young people, and I would like to see British schools put the values of respect and fairness at the heart of the curriculum."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Knife crime plans 'criminalise' children Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Stephen was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham 26 years ago. Two of the group of up to six men who attacked the teenager and his friend Duwayne Brooks have been convicted of murder, but the rest have evaded justice. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Stephen's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police. Two decades after the publication of that report, the Metropolitan Police said the murder had been a ""catalyst for significant, positive changes to the way we police"". The force is marking Stephen Lawrence Day by sending cadets to work with the Lawrence family's charitable trust, in a programme ""aimed at helping young people live their best life"". Stephen's mother, Doreen, was made a peer by Labour in the House of Lords in 2013 Reflecting on the attack, Mr Brooks added: ""None of us have had justice. ""All those involved in the murderous attack on Steve have not been convicted and everyone knows who they are, but the justice system has not worked."" Dr Neville Lawrence - Stephen's father - said he no longer thinks about his son's killers facing justice. ""I don't think about my son's other killers being brought to justice any more. I am too busy trying to help the cause of reducing violence on our streets,"" he said. ""Instead of being angry I try to use my energy to motivate children and tell them that the can achieve whatever they want to achieve.""

It is understood the funeral service will be attended by political and faith leaders from across Northern Ireland. Writing on Facebook, Ms Canning called on attendees to wear Harry Potter and Marvel related items. Meanwhile, the Catholic bishop of Derry said the community in the nationalist area where Lyra McKee was shot dead needs to be ""liberated"" from dissident republicans.

Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left in the Creggan estate where she was shot Saoradh, which translates as liberation in Irish, has the support of the dissident republican group the New IRA.

He told the BBC's Sunday Sequence programme that people in the Creggan estate were ""disgusted at what happened"". ""The one liberation they require in that community is liberation from Saoradh,"" he said.

The blaze, at a rubber safety matting firm, is not thought to be suspicious and was under control by about 16:00. Train services will be disrupted for the rest of the day and nearby residents were advised to stay indoors. A number of bangs were heard across the city No injuries have been reported. Road closures were in place at Pride Park Way and Stores Road to the junction with the Vauxhall garage, and Mansfield Road to the junction with Alfreton Road and St Mary's Wharf police station was evacuated.

Lack of bank account 'costs ÃÂ£500 a year',"People who do not have access to a bank account pay an extra Â£485 a year for everyday bills and services, research from an account provider suggests. More than 1.2 million Britons do not have a bank account, so miss out on discounts reserved for those who pay bills by direct debit, said Pockit. This ramps up the cost of energy bills, broadband and phone contracts, it said. ""For many of us, having a bank account is a basic fact of life,"" said Pockit boss Virraj Jatania. ""Yet the unbanked face a banking poverty premium which can put a real strain on their finances."" UK Finance, which represents the UK banking industry, said banks took their financial inclusion responsibilities ""extremely seriously"". ""The banking industry is committed to ensuring banking is accessible to all. There are over seven million basic bank accounts in the UK, helping customers across the country access vital banking services,"" it said. FCA boss: 'No such thing as free banking' Bank account 'revolution' begins Traditional banks can reject customers applying for accounts if they do not have enough forms of ID, or if their credit rating is poor. But Pockit, which provides basic account services, said this meant many were being penalised. It analysed prices from leading service providers and found: Energy and broadband providers offer discounts to customers if they pay by direct debit - a saving which is not available to those without a bank account. Mobile phone companies offer better deals to those paying via direct debit rather than pay-as-you go customers. Those without accounts have limited options when looking for credit, and often turn to expensive cash-in-hand ""doorstep loans"". In one example, it found two of the UK's three largest broadband providers, BT and Virgin Media, offered a ""super line rental discount"" if you paid by direct debit. But customers without a current account had to pay using methods such as cash transfers, costing them Â£38 more a year on average. On electricity and gas, it analysed Ofgem data and found that those using pre-payment meters paid on average Â£141.57 more each year than those who paid by direct debit.

"Older women 'exploited' by IVF clinicsClinics are using ""selective success rates"" to target older women, the fertility watchdog warns.UK","Older women are being exploited by IVF clinics ""trading on hope"", the fertility watchdog has warned. Sally Cheshire, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA),told the Daily Telegraph,externalsome private clinics were using ""selective success rates"" to target older women. IVF is less likely to be successful as a woman gets older. Since 2004 the number of women in their 40s undergoing fertility treatment has doubled to 10,835 in 2017. The latest HFEA figures show that, among those using their own eggs, out of 2,265 embryo transfers in 2017, just 75 women aged 43 to 44 ended up with a baby. For those over 44, the success rate was even lower - amounting to 1% between 2004 and 2017. Mrs Cheshire told the BBC that some women were not being told their ""realistic chance of success"" when sold the treatment. She said all UK clinics needed to be ""transparent"" about the costs involved, as well as the likely outcome. Women 'need to know egg freezing risk' Women over 34 refused IVF treatment Mrs Cheshire added that the clinics giving ""selective statistics"" tended to be ""foreign"". ""If you have treatment in the UK, all those clinics are regulated by us - by and large it's a good sector,"" she said. ""What we're concerned about are more of the foreign clinics who are coming to the UK who are investing here... who absolutely are not being honest."" NHS guidelines,externalrecommend that women under 40 should be offered three full cycles of IVF, while those between 40 and 42 should be offered one full cycle. However eligibility criteria vary in different areas of the country. IVF is not usually recommended for women over the age of 42 because of low success rates. An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35 On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Mrs Cheshire said some parts of the sector were using ""blatant"" sales tactics to persuade ""vulnerable"" women to undergo treatment. The 50-year-old said she had even been offered IVF treatments herself, by staff who were unaware of her role with the regulator, at a visit to a fertility show in Manchester. ""We now see things like 'guaranteed baby or your money back','' she told the Telegraph. Mrs Cheshire also called for the watchdog to be given powers to regulate prices, saying that some private centres were charging up to Â£20,000 for cycles - four times as much as she said treatments should cost. She said prices were often inflated by the growing use of ""add-on treatments"", such as embryo glue and endometrial scratches, offered by clinics to boost chances of success. Caroline, 40, wishes someone had sat her down and given her a realistic cost for her IVF treatment but says that often medical staff do not know for sure. She was originally led to believe the cost would be Â£5,000 but it is now at least Â£16,000. ""The list of treatment costs is just jargon and there are so many options. I think I needed someone to sit me down and say to me 'this is you and this is what it will cost',"" she said. The cost is not the only downside of IVF treatment for Caroline - the hormones have added negatively to the experience. ""I am taking some time off from treatment as I find injecting all the hormones really messes with me emotionally. The injections have bowled me over and made me completely lose it."" Adding: ""When you're crying your eyes out at work it's not a good look."" However, Caroline, whose full name we are not using at her request, thinks she will continue with the treatment as she has two vials of sperm left and will likely spend another Â£10,000. However, earlier this year the watchdog, which regulates all fertility services in the UK,warned that these were being offered without conclusive evidence that they increase the chance of pregnancy,external. Its website now has a ""traffic light"" rating for such treatments. None have been given the green light, which indicates there is more than one quality trial showing the procedure is effective and safe.

Top climbers die in Canadian avalancheThe group had been missing since last Wednesday whilst climbing Howse Peake in Banff National Park.US & Canada,"From left: Jess Roskelley, HansjÃ¶rg Auer and David Lama on what is believed to be the summit of Howse Peak last Tuesday a day before they were reported missing Three professional mountaineers have been found dead after an avalanche at Canada's Banff National Park. Austrian climbers David Lama, 28, and HansjÃ¶rg Auer, 35, and US citizen Jess Roskelley, 36, had been attempting to climb the east face of Howse Peake. The group were reported missing last Wednesday and later presumed dead, but recovery efforts were hampered by weather conditions. The men were part of a team sponsored by outdoor clothing line North Face. Canadian authorities said air rescuers had seen ""signs of multiple avalanches"" where they were found. The mum and son who lived 'as tigers' How deadly is Mount Everest? In a statement, Parks Canada said it ""[extended its] sincere condolences to [the men's] families, friends and loved ones"". ""We would also like to acknowledge the impact that this has had on the tight-knit, local and international climbing communities,"" it added. During their expedition, the group had been taking a route up Howse Peake, known as M16, which has only been climbed once before. Howse Peak, Banff National Park Family members of the climbers told Parks Canada they believe the trio did summit the mountain, and that they descended Howse Peak along a similar route. Rescue efforts were delayed by the weather, and the three climbers were not wearing avalanche beacons when they were found. ""In this case the outcome wouldn't have changed, but it would have expedited the search and recovery,"" said Parks Canada incident manager Shelley Humphries. It took 28 staff members about five days to recover the bodies, which were located using a specially-trained avalanche dog attached to a long line from a helicopter. The bodies were located with the help of a specially-trained avalanche dog Brian Webster, safety manager for Parks Canada, said the three men were undoubtedly skilled enough to make the climb, but that an avalanche of that magnitude would be difficult to recover from. Parks Canada believes it was a level-3 avalanche, which is strong enough to knock over trees, bury vehicles or demolish small wooden buildings. All three were renowned within the mountaineering community. Mr Lama was part of a duo that carried out the first free ascent of Cerro Torre's Compressor route in Southern Patagonia. Recently, Mr Auer had also completed a solo ascent of Lupghar Sar West, a 23,559ft (7,181m) peak in Pakistan's Karakorum range. Jess Roskelley with his wife Alli in January 2019 In 2003, Mr Roskelly became the youngest American to climb Mount Everest - the world's highest peak - aged 20 at the time. His father, John, was also a mountaineer and climbed Howse Peak via a different route in the 1970s. ""It's just one of those routes where you have to have the right conditions or it turns into a nightmare,"",externalhe said in an interview last week with The Spokesman-Review newspaper.

'Running wildfire' brought under control,"This video can not be played 'The fire was rapidly spreading' Police are treating a forest fire in the foothills of the Mourne Mountains in County Down as suspicious. More than 50 firefighters battled the blaze, which started in Donard Forest, on Sunday night into Monday morning. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) have determined it was likely the fire was started deliberately. The fire front was a mile long and a total of eight appliances were at the scene. ""The fire caused widespread damage and led to a number of evacuations, including from a nearby caravan park,"" said Det Chief Insp Will Tate. Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward. The Newcastle Centre, a council-run leisure centre in the town, was opened for those evacuated. More than 200 people were at the centre, according to the NIFRS, most of whom were staying at Bonny's Caravan Park. Mats were set up in some of the rooms to allow for overnight stays. A resident on Tullybrannigan Road looks out at the fire Max Joyce of the NIFRS said the blaze was ""substantial"" when firefighters arrived at the scene on Sunday night. ""The fire was moving down towards the caravan park and we had 200 people evacuated, so I think that shows you the degree of severity,"" he said. ""At one stage we were concerned that the caravan park itself would be compromised with flames."" Mr Joyce said there was a ""pattern of hill fires in and around Easter"", some of which were started deliberately. ""If they set fire to a gorse and a mile away there's people's properties, or someone gets hurt, perhaps a child gets burned or one of the firefighters gets injured or worse..."" he said. ""These people really need to stop doing this. I can't understand the mentality.""

"Climate change protest arrest reach 1,000","This video can not be played Protesters lie down underneath the giant whale skeleton in the museum's main hall Extinction Rebellion activists took over part of the Natural History Museum as the climate change protest entered its second week. About 100 people lay down under the blue whale skeleton at about 14:15 BST. It comes as more than 1,000 people have been arrested since the protests began in central London a week ago. The climate change group are now based in Marble Arch, after police moved protesters from Oxford Street, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square. Extinction Rebellion said it hoped the protest at the museum, which it called a ""die-in"", would raise awareness of what they call the ""sixth mass extinction"". Most of the protesters finished their lie-down protest after about half an hour. But some people wearing red face paint, veils and robes remained to give a performance to classical music on the steps underneath the whale skeleton. The ""die-in"" protest lasted about an hour and concluded with a performance by The Invisible Circus On Sunday, teenage activist Greta Thunberg told the rally in Marble Arch that they were ""making a difference"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the protest was taking ""a real toll"" on London's police and businesses. ""I'm extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer,"" he said. About 9,000 police officers have been responding to the protest since it began a week ago on 15 April. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally A total of 1,065 people have been arrested and 53 have been charged for various offences including breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police. Olympic gold medallist Etienne Stott was one of the activists arrestedas police moved to clear Waterloo Bridge on Sunday evening. The London 2012 canoe slalom champion was carried from the bridge by four officers as he shouted about the ""ecological crisis"". Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protesters 'making a difference' Who is Greta Thunberg? An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said there would be no escalation of activity on Easter Monday, but warned that the disruption could get ""much worse"" if politicians are not open to their negotiation requests. On Sunday, one organiser told the BBC the group were planning ""a week of activities"" including a bid to prevent MPs entering Parliament. The group said a ""people's assembly"" was due to be held later to decide what will happen in the coming week. Thousands of protesters have spent Monday at the Marble Arch site The protest group has been forced to focus its activities on its Marble Arch site On Sunday, Ms Thunberg was greeted with chants of ""we love you"" as she took to the stage in front of thousands of people at the rally. The 16-year-old, who is credited with inspiring an international movement to fight climate change, told the crowd ""humanity is standing at a crossroads"" and that protesters ""will never stop fighting for this planet"". Met Commissioner Cressida Dick has said that during her 36-year career she had never known a single police operation to result in so many arrests. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Top climbers die in Canadian avalanche,"From left: Jess Roskelley, HansjÃ¶rg Auer and David Lama on what is believed to be the summit of Howse Peak last Tuesday a day before they were reported missing Three professional mountaineers have been found dead after an avalanche at Canada's Banff National Park. Austrian climbers David Lama, 28, and HansjÃ¶rg Auer, 35, and US citizen Jess Roskelley, 36, had been attempting to climb the east face of Howse Peake. The group were reported missing last Wednesday and later presumed dead, but recovery efforts were hampered by weather conditions. The men were part of a team sponsored by outdoor clothing line North Face. Canadian authorities said air rescuers had seen ""signs of multiple avalanches"" where they were found. The mum and son who lived 'as tigers' How deadly is Mount Everest? In a statement, Parks Canada said it ""[extended its] sincere condolences to [the men's] families, friends and loved ones"". ""We would also like to acknowledge the impact that this has had on the tight-knit, local and international climbing communities,"" it added. During their expedition, the group had been taking a route up Howse Peake, known as M16, which has only been climbed once before. Howse Peak, Banff National Park Family members of the climbers told Parks Canada they believe the trio did summit the mountain, and that they descended Howse Peak along a similar route. Rescue efforts were delayed by the weather, and the three climbers were not wearing avalanche beacons when they were found. ""In this case the outcome wouldn't have changed, but it would have expedited the search and recovery,"" said Parks Canada incident manager Shelley Humphries. It took 28 staff members about five days to recover the bodies, which were located using a specially-trained avalanche dog attached to a long line from a helicopter. The bodies were located with the help of a specially-trained avalanche dog Brian Webster, safety manager for Parks Canada, said the three men were undoubtedly skilled enough to make the climb, but that an avalanche of that magnitude would be difficult to recover from. Parks Canada believes it was a level-3 avalanche, which is strong enough to knock over trees, bury vehicles or demolish small wooden buildings. All three were renowned within the mountaineering community. Mr Lama was part of a duo that carried out the first free ascent of Cerro Torre's Compressor route in Southern Patagonia. Recently, Mr Auer had also completed a solo ascent of Lupghar Sar West, a 23,559ft (7,181m) peak in Pakistan's Karakorum range. Jess Roskelley with his wife Alli in January 2019 In 2003, Mr Roskelly became the youngest American to climb Mount Everest - the world's highest peak - aged 20 at the time. His father, John, was also a mountaineer and climbed Howse Peak via a different route in the 1970s. ""It's just one of those routes where you have to have the right conditions or it turns into a nightmare,"",externalhe said in an interview last week with The Spokesman-Review newspaper.

It said a helicopter had been deployed since 09:00 to take water from nearby reservoirs to the fire. Smoke can be seen coming from the Marsden fire for miles around ""At present it is estimated that an investment of more than Â£200,000 in restoring this special habitat has been lost,"" the trust said. ""The deployment of the helicopter itself costs the trust, a conservation charity, Â£2,000 per hour. ""We're devastated to see the destruction caused. Please help us protect the moors and wildlife by calling the fire brigade immediately if you spot any signs of fire."" Fire crews were at the scene of the moor fire near Huddersfield overnight Three men were arrested on Sunday over the Ilkley Moor fire but two were later released pending further investigation. One manhas been since charged with arson.

April was described by a detective who worked on the case as ""our Lord Lucan"". She had been cycling to her sister's house in a nearby village to deliver a birthday present to her brother-in-law. April's bike was found lying in a field, as pictured in this police reconstruction But an hour after she left home her bike was discovered abandoned in a field. No-one has ever been charged. Half a century after her disappearance, police renewed their appeal for anyone with information to come forward.

Thousands protest in Moroccan capitalIt come weeks after jail sentences were upheld for political activists who organised demonstrations.Africa,"Earlier this month, jail sentences were upheld for political activists Thousands of people have protested in Morocco's capital Rabat, demanding the release of 42 activists who had rallied against corruption and unemployment. Sunday's ""march of the Moroccan people"" was organised by political and civil rights groups, as well as the families of detainees. It comes weeks aftera court upheld prison sentences for the activists, who held protests in 2016 and 2017. Authorities accuse them of threatening the security of the country. Country profile Protesters have been pictured with flags, banners and pictures of the jailed activists, who are members of Hirak Rif - or the ""Rif Movement"". The demonstrations also called for the release of journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui, who is serving a three-year sentence for covering the protests in Morocco's northern Rif region. In June 2018, a court sentenced Nasser Zefzaki, the leader of Hirak Rif, to 20 years in prison. The same term was given to activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, while others were given sentences of up to 15 years. The Hirak Rif organised protests in 2016 and 2017 after the death of a fishmonger in Al-Hoceima, a town in Rif. Fishmonger Mohcine Fikri was crushed to death by a rubbish lorry whilst trying to recover his fish which had been confiscated by local police. The incident prompted a wave of anger and thousands took to the streets, accusing authorities of corruption and an abuse of power.

Lawrence: Schools must help tackle racismThe mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence calls for schools to teach tolerance at an early age.UK,"Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racially motivated attack in 1993 Schools must teach pupils how to challenge racism from an early age, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has said. Marking the first Stephen Lawrence Day, Baroness Lawrence added children must learn to ""embrace inclusion"". Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death in a racially motivated attack in Eltham, south-east London, on 22 April 1993. Prime Minister Theresa May described the murder as a ""watershed moment for our country"". Last year, on the 25th anniversary of his death, Mrs May announced the creation of an annual Stephen Lawrence Day, to begin in 2019. The London Marathon, which is held on Sunday,has already announced that it will dedicate the 18-mile marker on the course in honour of Stephen. Writing in the Guardian,externalon Monday, Baroness Lawrence said: ""If we are to encourage future generations to build a better society, free from discrimination, I believe that we must teach tolerance and inclusion from an early age. ""Education is a powerful way of inspiring young people, and I would like to see British schools put the values of respect and fairness at the heart of the curriculum."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Knife crime plans 'criminalise' children Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Stephen was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham 26 years ago. Two of the group of up to six men who attacked the teenager and his friend Duwayne Brooks have been convicted of murder, but the rest have evaded justice. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Stephen's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police. Two decades after the publication of that report, the Metropolitan Police said the murder had been a ""catalyst for significant, positive changes to the way we police"". The force is marking Stephen Lawrence Day by sending cadets to work with the Lawrence family's charitable trust, in a programme ""aimed at helping young people live their best life"". Stephen's mother, Doreen, was made a peer by Labour in the House of Lords in 2013 Reflecting on the attack, Mr Brooks added: ""None of us have had justice. ""All those involved in the murderous attack on Steve have not been convicted and everyone knows who they are, but the justice system has not worked."" Dr Neville Lawrence - Stephen's father - said he no longer thinks about his son's killers facing justice. ""I don't think about my son's other killers being brought to justice any more. I am too busy trying to help the cause of reducing violence on our streets,"" he said. ""Instead of being angry I try to use my energy to motivate children and tell them that the can achieve whatever they want to achieve.""

Sri Lanka death toll soars to 290,"This video can not be played Aftermath of deadly Sri Lanka explosions The death toll in Sri Lanka has soared to 290 after a wave of blasts hit churches and luxury hotels across the country on Sunday. Police said 24 people had been arrested, but it is not yet known who carried out the attacks. About 500 people are injured and at least 35 foreigners are among the dead. The Easter Sunday bombings were the deadliest violence Sri Lanka has witnessed since the end of the country's civil war in 2009. Follow live updates here Who are the victims? Late on Sunday, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said security services had been ""aware of information"" of possible attacks but that the information had not been acted upon. A local Islamist group known as National Thowheed Jamath is believed to be behind the attack, said cabinet spokeman Rajitha Senaratne. A curfew is to be imposed from 20:00 (14:30 GMT) until 04:00 on Tuesday, the government said. The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 local time with six blasts reported within a small space of time. This video can not be played Sri Lanka attacks: ""My heart shattered when I saw the bodies"" Three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district were targeted during Easter services. Blasts also rocked the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the country's capital. All the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, officials said. Police then carried out raids on two addresses and there were explosions at both. One was in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and the other was near the Colombo district of Dematagoda in which three officers were killed. In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Eight Britons killed in Sri Lanka attacks Three churches were targeted during Easter services The air force said an improvised explosive device - a 6ft-long [1.8m] plastic pipe packed with explosives - had been found and disposed of near the airport in the capital, Colombo. Police have not provided a breakdown of how many were killed and wounded at each location. The government has urged people not to speculate about who could be behind the attacks and restricted access to social media in the aftermath of the bombings. No information has been given on the identity of the 24 people arrested. However, the BBC's Azzam Ameen in Colombo says the bombers are thought to be part of a ""radical extremist Islamist group"" according to authorities. Addressing reports that officials had had prior intelligence of forthcoming attacks, Mr Wickremesinghe said: ""We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the ministers were kept informed."" A top Sri Lankan official later told the BBC that the government and intelligence services should not be blamed. Hemasari Fernando - who is also chief-of-staff to President Maithripala Sirisena, a political rival of Mr Wickremesinghe - said information received earlier this month was of only one or two possible attacks, and that he never expected anything of the magnitude of Sunday's bombings. The vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians who died at Easter church services. The ministry of foreign affairs says it believes 35 foreign nationals are among the dead. They include three of the children of Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, a family spokesman confirmed to the BBC. Mr Povlsen owns the Bestseller clothing chain and holds a majority stake in clothing giant Asos.

Nissan ex-boss Ghosn hit with fresh charge,"Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has been indicted by prosecutors in Japan on a fresh charge of aggravated breach of trust. It is the fourth charge brought against Mr Ghosn and relates to the alleged misuse of company funds. The 65-year-old is in detention in Tokyo and his lawyers have applied for bail. Mr Ghosn, who denies any wrongdoing, has said the allegations are a result of a plot against him. He was first arrested in November and spent 108 days in custody. While out on bail pending a trial, the former auto boss wasre-arrested in Tokyo on 4 April. Prosecutors allege that Mr Ghosn made a multi-million-dollar payment to a Nissan distributor in Oman, and that as much as $5m (Â£3.8m) was funnelled to an account controlled by Mr Ghosn. The company he once ran, Nissan, has filed its own criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn, accusing him of directing money from the company for his own personal enrichment. Mr Ghosn was first charged with under-reporting his pay package for the five years to 2015. In January, a new charge claimed he understated his compensation for another three years. He was also indicted on a fresh, more serious charge of breach of trust. Nissan ex-boss Ghosn released after 108 days CGhosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' The fall from grace for the industry titan has attracted global attention. The case has also put a spotlight on fighting within the carmaker alliance and on Japan's legal system.

He is credited with turning around the fortunes of Nissan and Renault over several years.

'Running wildfire' brought under controlMore than 50 firefighters battled the blaze on Sunday in the foothills of the Mourne Mountains.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played 'The fire was rapidly spreading' Police are treating a forest fire in the foothills of the Mourne Mountains in County Down as suspicious. More than 50 firefighters battled the blaze, which started in Donard Forest, on Sunday night into Monday morning. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) have determined it was likely the fire was started deliberately. The fire front was a mile long and a total of eight appliances were at the scene. ""The fire caused widespread damage and led to a number of evacuations, including from a nearby caravan park,"" said Det Chief Insp Will Tate. Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward. The Newcastle Centre, a council-run leisure centre in the town, was opened for those evacuated. More than 200 people were at the centre, according to the NIFRS, most of whom were staying at Bonny's Caravan Park. Mats were set up in some of the rooms to allow for overnight stays. A resident on Tullybrannigan Road looks out at the fire Max Joyce of the NIFRS said the blaze was ""substantial"" when firefighters arrived at the scene on Sunday night. ""The fire was moving down towards the caravan park and we had 200 people evacuated, so I think that shows you the degree of severity,"" he said. ""At one stage we were concerned that the caravan park itself would be compromised with flames."" Mr Joyce said there was a ""pattern of hill fires in and around Easter"", some of which were started deliberately. ""If they set fire to a gorse and a mile away there's people's properties, or someone gets hurt, perhaps a child gets burned or one of the firefighters gets injured or worse..."" he said. ""These people really need to stop doing this. I can't understand the mentality."" In Newcastle, residents of Tullybrannigan Road were also among those forced to leave their homes and several buses were brought in to help with the evacuation. The fire service said the blaze was ""substantial"" when firefighters arrived at the scene on Sunday night. Jim Beattie, who was on Tullybrannigan Road when the fire broke out and has a caravan in Bonny's Caravan Park, said the fire had spread so quickly it was ""unbelievable"". ""It was at the edge of the house here when it diverted and there are at least five fire crews here that I can see and they are starting to evacuate the homes,"" he said. Meanwhile, in the Republic of Irelandfirefighters are trying to control a large gorse fire in west Donegal.

"Lack of bank account 'costs ÃÂ£500 a year'People without a bank account pay more for energy, loans and mobile phone deals, research suggests.Business","People who do not have access to a bank account pay an extra Â£485 a year for everyday bills and services, research from an account provider suggests. More than 1.2 million Britons do not have a bank account, so miss out on discounts reserved for those who pay bills by direct debit, said Pockit. This ramps up the cost of energy bills, broadband and phone contracts, it said. ""For many of us, having a bank account is a basic fact of life,"" said Pockit boss Virraj Jatania. ""Yet the unbanked face a banking poverty premium which can put a real strain on their finances."" UK Finance, which represents the UK banking industry, said banks took their financial inclusion responsibilities ""extremely seriously"". ""The banking industry is committed to ensuring banking is accessible to all. There are over seven million basic bank accounts in the UK, helping customers across the country access vital banking services,"" it said. FCA boss: 'No such thing as free banking' Bank account 'revolution' begins Traditional banks can reject customers applying for accounts if they do not have enough forms of ID, or if their credit rating is poor. But Pockit, which provides basic account services, said this meant many were being penalised. It analysed prices from leading service providers and found: Energy and broadband providers offer discounts to customers if they pay by direct debit - a saving which is not available to those without a bank account. Mobile phone companies offer better deals to those paying via direct debit rather than pay-as-you go customers. Those without accounts have limited options when looking for credit, and often turn to expensive cash-in-hand ""doorstep loans"". In one example, it found two of the UK's three largest broadband providers, BT and Virgin Media, offered a ""super line rental discount"" if you paid by direct debit. But customers without a current account had to pay using methods such as cash transfers, costing them Â£38 more a year on average. On electricity and gas, it analysed Ofgem data and found that those using pre-payment meters paid on average Â£141.57 more each year than those who paid by direct debit.

Top climbers die in Canadian avalancheThe group had been missing since last Wednesday whilst climbing Howse Peake in Banff National Park.,"From left: Jess Roskelley, HansjÃ¶rg Auer and David Lama on what is believed to be the summit of Howse Peak last Tuesday a day before they were reported missing Three professional mountaineers have been found dead after an avalanche at Canada's Banff National Park. Austrian climbers David Lama, 28, and HansjÃ¶rg Auer, 35, and US citizen Jess Roskelley, 36, had been attempting to climb the east face of Howse Peake. The group were reported missing last Wednesday and later presumed dead, but recovery efforts were hampered by weather conditions. The men were part of a team sponsored by outdoor clothing line North Face. Canadian authorities said air rescuers had seen ""signs of multiple avalanches"" where they were found. The mum and son who lived 'as tigers' How deadly is Mount Everest? In a statement, Parks Canada said it ""[extended its] sincere condolences to [the men's] families, friends and loved ones"". ""We would also like to acknowledge the impact that this has had on the tight-knit, local and international climbing communities,"" it added. During their expedition, the group had been taking a route up Howse Peake, known as M16, which has only been climbed once before. Howse Peak, Banff National Park Family members of the climbers told Parks Canada they believe the trio did summit the mountain, and that they descended Howse Peak along a similar route. Rescue efforts were delayed by the weather, and the three climbers were not wearing avalanche beacons when they were found. ""In this case the outcome wouldn't have changed, but it would have expedited the search and recovery,"" said Parks Canada incident manager Shelley Humphries. It took 28 staff members about five days to recover the bodies, which were located using a specially-trained avalanche dog attached to a long line from a helicopter. The bodies were located with the help of a specially-trained avalanche dog Brian Webster, safety manager for Parks Canada, said the three men were undoubtedly skilled enough to make the climb, but that an avalanche of that magnitude would be difficult to recover from. Parks Canada believes it was a level-3 avalanche, which is strong enough to knock over trees, bury vehicles or demolish small wooden buildings. All three were renowned within the mountaineering community. Mr Lama was part of a duo that carried out the first free ascent of Cerro Torre's Compressor route in Southern Patagonia. Recently, Mr Auer had also completed a solo ascent of Lupghar Sar West, a 23,559ft (7,181m) peak in Pakistan's Karakorum range. Jess Roskelley with his wife Alli in January 2019 In 2003, Mr Roskelly became the youngest American to climb Mount Everest - the world's highest peak - aged 20 at the time. His father, John, was also a mountaineer and climbed Howse Peak via a different route in the 1970s. ""It's just one of those routes where you have to have the right conditions or it turns into a nightmare,"",externalhe said in an interview last week with The Spokesman-Review newspaper.

LiveSri Lanka reels from attacks,"Eight blasts hit locations including churches and hotels across Sri Lanka, leaving at least 290 people dead and 500 injured Congregations were taking part in Easter Sunday services at the churches when the blasts hit The five-star Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the heart of Colombo were targeted A local group named as National Thowheed Jamath are believed to be behind the attack Officials say 24 people have been arrested in connection with the attacks Gareth Evans and Mal Siret The measure is needed on security grounds, officials say, two years after the Easter Sunday attacks. Brothers transform expected win into stunning rout of the opposition, writes Anbarasan Ethirajan. The victory for the Sri Lanka People's Front seals the Rajapaksa brothers' grip on power. Nearly 270 people were killed by a group of suicide bombers on Easter Sunday last year. The brothers, who oversaw the controversial end to Sri Lanka's bitter civil war, are back in power. Anita Nicholson and her two children were among the victims on Easter Sunday. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is declared the winner in a poll that has split the country along ethnic lines. Minorities fearful as controversial ex-defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is elected president. Six months after one of the world's worst recent terror attacks, this town is fighting to recover. Five months after the Easter Sunday bombings, Sri Lanka is desperate for visitors to return. Life for many of Sri Lanka's Muslims has become tougher since April's Easter Sunday bombings. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the former defence chief who crushed the Tamil Tigers, is running for president. He is the allegedly leader of an Islamic State militant cell, federal investigators said. As night falls in Sri Lanka, we are pausing our live coverage of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings. Here's what we know:  Read the latest information on the attacks here. And for more information on the victims, you can read our piece here. US President Donald Trump called Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning to express condolences. Mr Wickremesinghe reportedly appreciated the president's concern and updated him on the progress of the investigation into the attacks. Mr Trump also pledged US support to Sri Lanka in bringing the perpetrators to justice, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the fight against global terrorism. The BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan writes from the capital, Colombo: Sri Lankans are yet to come to terms with this wave of
unprecedented bomb attacks. It is believed some Muslim youths were radicalised afterclashes between the majority Sinhala Buddhists and Muslimslast year in the central district of Kandy. There
have been videos on social media showing hardline Islamists and Sinhala
hardliners promoting hatred after that violence. But very few expected such
massive attacks a year later. And why were Christians targeted? They are also a minority in Sri Lanka. The country experienced suicide attacks by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war that ended in 2009. But the ruthlessness with which the latest attacks were carried out show that the country's task this time will be challenging. It is a different kind of battle. In the meantime, Sri Lankan Muslims are left nervous and afraid. Kandy in the centre of the country was the focus of clashes last year Anita Nicholson and her children Alex, 14, and Annabel, 11, died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing A British man has confirmed that his wife and two children, aged 14 and 11, were killed in the attacks. ""My family and I wish to confirm that my wife Anita, our son Alex (age 14) and our daughter Annabel (age 11) were killed in the bombing of the restaurant of the Shangri-la Hotel, Colombo on Sunday morning while sitting at our table,"" Ben Nicholson said in a statement. ""Mercifully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering."" Mr Nicholson added that he was ""deeply distressed at the loss of my wife and children."" He described Anita as a ""wonderful, perfect loving and inspirational mother"" and his two children as ""amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful"". ""We would ask that the media now respect our privacy and allow us to grieve together,"" the statement said. According to a social media profile, lawyer Anita Nicholson was based in Singapore, working as a managing counsel at mining and metals company Anglo American at the time of her death. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Catherine, haveshared a message for the people of Sri Lanka,external. ""We have been deeply saddened to learn of the devastating attacks in Sri Lanka this Easter Sunday. ""Senseless acts like these in places that people would expect to be at their safest are truly horrifying. ""Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives, to the Christian community, and to the people of Sri Lanka at this tragic time. You are all in our thoughts and prayers."" Anders Holch Povlsen is one of Denmark's richest men Three of the four children of Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen died in the attacks, a spokesman has told the BBC. The family were visiting Sri Lanka over the Easter holiday. The names of the children have not been made public. Mr Holch Povlsen owns the international clothing chain Bestseller.

"Older women 'exploited' by IVF clinicsClinics are using ""selective success rates"" to target older women, the fertility watchdog warns.","Older women are being exploited by IVF clinics ""trading on hope"", the fertility watchdog has warned. Sally Cheshire, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA),told the Daily Telegraph,externalsome private clinics were using ""selective success rates"" to target older women. IVF is less likely to be successful as a woman gets older. Since 2004 the number of women in their 40s undergoing fertility treatment has doubled to 10,835 in 2017. The latest HFEA figures show that, among those using their own eggs, out of 2,265 embryo transfers in 2017, just 75 women aged 43 to 44 ended up with a baby. For those over 44, the success rate was even lower - amounting to 1% between 2004 and 2017. Mrs Cheshire told the BBC that some women were not being told their ""realistic chance of success"" when sold the treatment. She said all UK clinics needed to be ""transparent"" about the costs involved, as well as the likely outcome. Women 'need to know egg freezing risk' Women over 34 refused IVF treatment Mrs Cheshire added that the clinics giving ""selective statistics"" tended to be ""foreign"". ""If you have treatment in the UK, all those clinics are regulated by us - by and large it's a good sector,"" she said. ""What we're concerned about are more of the foreign clinics who are coming to the UK who are investing here... who absolutely are not being honest."" NHS guidelines,externalrecommend that women under 40 should be offered three full cycles of IVF, while those between 40 and 42 should be offered one full cycle. However eligibility criteria vary in different areas of the country. IVF is not usually recommended for women over the age of 42 because of low success rates. An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35 On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Mrs Cheshire said some parts of the sector were using ""blatant"" sales tactics to persuade ""vulnerable"" women to undergo treatment. The 50-year-old said she had even been offered IVF treatments herself, by staff who were unaware of her role with the regulator, at a visit to a fertility show in Manchester. ""We now see things like 'guaranteed baby or your money back','' she told the Telegraph. Mrs Cheshire also called for the watchdog to be given powers to regulate prices, saying that some private centres were charging up to Â£20,000 for cycles - four times as much as she said treatments should cost. She said prices were often inflated by the growing use of ""add-on treatments"", such as embryo glue and endometrial scratches, offered by clinics to boost chances of success. Caroline, 40, wishes someone had sat her down and given her a realistic cost for her IVF treatment but says that often medical staff do not know for sure. She was originally led to believe the cost would be Â£5,000 but it is now at least Â£16,000. ""The list of treatment costs is just jargon and there are so many options. I think I needed someone to sit me down and say to me 'this is you and this is what it will cost',"" she said. The cost is not the only downside of IVF treatment for Caroline - the hormones have added negatively to the experience. ""I am taking some time off from treatment as I find injecting all the hormones really messes with me emotionally. The injections have bowled me over and made me completely lose it."" Adding: ""When you're crying your eyes out at work it's not a good look."" However, Caroline, whose full name we are not using at her request, thinks she will continue with the treatment as she has two vials of sperm left and will likely spend another Â£10,000. However, earlier this year the watchdog, which regulates all fertility services in the UK,warned that these were being offered without conclusive evidence that they increase the chance of pregnancy,external. Its website now has a ""traffic light"" rating for such treatments. None have been given the green light, which indicates there is more than one quality trial showing the procedure is effective and safe.

Unbanked 'pay ÃÂ£500 extra a year' on bills,"People who do not have access to a bank account pay an extra Â£485 a year for everyday bills and services, research from an account provider suggests. More than 1.2 million Britons do not have a bank account, so miss out on discounts reserved for those who pay bills by direct debit, said Pockit. This ramps up the cost of energy bills, broadband and phone contracts, it said. ""For many of us, having a bank account is a basic fact of life,"" said Pockit boss Virraj Jatania. ""Yet the unbanked face a banking poverty premium which can put a real strain on their finances."" UK Finance, which represents the UK banking industry, said banks took their financial inclusion responsibilities ""extremely seriously"". ""The banking industry is committed to ensuring banking is accessible to all. There are over seven million basic bank accounts in the UK, helping customers across the country access vital banking services,"" it said. FCA boss: 'No such thing as free banking' Bank account 'revolution' begins Traditional banks can reject customers applying for accounts if they do not have enough forms of ID, or if their credit rating is poor. But Pockit, which provides basic account services, said this meant many were being penalised. It analysed prices from leading service providers and found: Energy and broadband providers offer discounts to customers if they pay by direct debit - a saving which is not available to those without a bank account. Mobile phone companies offer better deals to those paying via direct debit rather than pay-as-you go customers. Those without accounts have limited options when looking for credit, and often turn to expensive cash-in-hand ""doorstep loans"". In one example, it found two of the UK's three largest broadband providers, BT and Virgin Media, offered a ""super line rental discount"" if you paid by direct debit. But customers without a current account had to pay using methods such as cash transfers, costing them Â£38 more a year on average. On electricity and gas, it analysed Ofgem data and found that those using pre-payment meters paid on average Â£141.57 more each year than those who paid by direct debit.
