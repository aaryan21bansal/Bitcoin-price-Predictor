World powers condemn new Libya fighting,"Forces loyal to the Tripoli government have reportedly come from Misrata to help defend the capital World powers and the United Nations have condemned fresh fighting in Libya as rebel forces from the east of the country march on the capital. The G7 group of rich countries urged all parties ""to immediately halt all military activity"". The UN Security council issued a similar call. Khalifa Haftar, leader of the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), has ordered the advance on Tripoli. The unrest comes ahead of a planned UN conference on possible new elections. Tripoli is the home of Libya's internationally recognised government, which has the backing of the UN. Why is Libya so lawless? Who is military strongman Khalifa Haftar? Violence and division have riven Libya since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. The LNA's leader Haftar ordered his forces to advance on Tripoli on Thursday, as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in the city to discuss the ongoing crisis. Gen Haftar spoke to Mr Guterres in Benghazi on Friday, and reportedly told him that his operation would not stop until his troops had defeated ""terrorism"". Gen Haftar has ordered his forces to march on Tripoli On Thursday, LNA forces took the town of Gharyan 100km (62 miles) south of Tripoli. There are now reports troops have taken the capital's airport, which has been closed since 2014 - although these are disputed. Residents of Misrata east of Tripoli told Reuters news agency that militias from their city had been sent to defend the capital. Armed groups allied to the Tripoli government told the news agency on Friday that they had taken a number of LNA fighters prisoner. LNA troops seized the south of Libya and its oil fields earlier this year. In a tweet,Mr Guterres said he left Libya ""with a heavy heart and deeply concerned"",external, saying he still hoped there was a way to avoid a battle around the capital. The G7 later responded to the fighting with a statement urging an end to military operations. ""We strongly oppose any military action in Libya,"" the statement read, reiterating their support for UN-led efforts to bring elections and calling on all countries to support the ""sustainable stabilisation of Libya"". The UN Security Council held a close-door meeting late on Friday. Afterwards the German UN ambassador Christoph Heusgen said members had ""called on LNA forces to halt all military movements"". ""There can be no military solution to the conflict,"" he said. A Russian spokesman earlier told reporters the Kremlin does not support Gen Haftar's advance and said it wants a solution by ""peaceful political means"". UN envoy Ghassan Salame said on Saturday that the conference planned for 14-16 April would still be held in time, despite the escalation - ""unless compelling circumstances force us not to"". By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor Khalifa Haftar's forces have met with mixed fortunes. To the south, they appear to have got close to the outskirts of the capital, at one point claiming to have taken the airport. But to the west, they appear to have been pushed back. It's still unclear how much this is a show of force to bolster Gen Haftar's position or a genuine effort to seize Tripoli. Libya country profile He returned during the revolution and he's subsequently become the most powerful military leader in a country rife with militias, allied to a rival government in the east. Despite the chorus of international concern over his actions, he has had support from powerful outside players, including the UAE and Egypt. Efforts towards a political resolution for Libya have foundered time after time. The most recent hopes may once again have been dashed. Born in 1943, the former army officer helped Colonel Muammar Gaddafi seize power in 1969 before falling out with him and going into exile in the US. He returned in 2011 after the uprising against Gaddafi began and became a rebel commander. In December Haftar met Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj from the UN-backed government at a conference but refused to attend official talks. He visited Saudi Arabia last week, where he met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for talks.

Dutch rail defends 'victim fashion' amid backlash,"ProRail hopes the controversial campaign will improve rail safety The Dutch rail infrastructure operator has defended its controversial ""fashion line"" featuring replicas of torn clothing worn by those killed and injured in railway accidents. ProRail launched ""Victim Fashion"" to encourage young people to be safer around railway lines. The campaign has faced backlash, with the Dutch infrastructure secretary saying it went too far. But ProRail told the BBC it was ""necessary"" amid rising fatalities. It says the number of people killed on and around railways has almost tripled since 2016, with 17 fatalities recorded last year. The ""fashion line"" features torn jackets, shirts, dresses and other items of clothing and is being promoted under the slogan ""Victim Fashion, made by accident"". The pieces are accompanied online by descriptions of what happened to the person wearing them. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

An image of a scuffed trainer has a caption explaining that a 14-year-old was reaching out for a phone she dropped on the track when a train hit her. Now almost 15, she is still in a coma. An orange dress was worn by a 15-year-old girl who followed her friends across the track while the barriers were closed and didn't see the train coming. Dutch infrastructure secretary Stientje van Veldhoven said the campaign was ""unnecessarily severe"", while the head of Dutch rail operator NS Marjan Rintel said it was important but not the right approach. ""I have expressed our surprise, displeasure and horror to the management of ProRail,"" she said. One train driver wrote on social media that the campaign had brought back memories of collisions. ""Wow, just wow. I've spent the past six months seeing a psychologist after my last collision and thought I was over it. Big mistake. Thanks very much,"" the train driver wrote.

Question Time rejects claims of bias over move,"The panel discussion was moved from Bolton to Dulwich ""due to ongoing Brexit votes"", the BBC said The BBC has been accused of bias after it moved live filming of Question Time from Bolton to London. The programme said Thursday's show was broadcast from Dulwich to allow politicians attending Brexit debates at Westminster to take part. Some social media users said moving filming from Bolton, where 58% voted to leave the EU, ensured a pro-EU audience in London, which voted to remain. The BBC said it was looking for a new date to return to Bolton. The weekly BBC One debate, which allows audience members to question a panel of politicians, journalists and public figures, had been due to air from Bolton's Albert Halls. Allow Twitter content?

Israeli breaks oldest footballer record,"Isaak Hayik, 73, is the oldest player to take part in a professional football match An Israeli footballer has entered the record books after becoming the world's oldest player to take part in a professional game at the age of 73. Isaak Hayik set the record by playing as a goalkeeper for Israeli team Ironi Or Yehuda on Friday afternoon. Despite his advanced years, Hayik said he was ""ready for another game"" after playing for the full 90 minutes. He received the Guinness World Records prize at a ceremony after the match, just days ahead of his 74th birthday. World's oldest pro football player 'King Kazu' Japanese, 51, striker gets new deal Ironi Or Yehuda play in Liga Bet South A, in the fourth tier of the Israeli league. Although his team were beaten 5-1 by Maccabi Ramat Gan, Iraqi-born Hayik is said to have made a series of impressive saves during the game.

One of his sons, 36-year-old Moshe Hayik, described his father's achievement as ""unbelievable"". He joked that he ""used to get tired before he did"" when they played together.

No change offered in Brexit talks - Labour,"The government has not proposed any changes to the PM's Brexit deal during cross-party talks, says shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. Meetings have been taking place between Tory and Labour politicians to find a proposal to put to the Commons before an emergency EU summit next week. But Sir Keir said the government was not ""countenancing any change"" on the wording of the existing plan. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We have made serious proposals."" The government was ""prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration"", a plan for the future relationship with the EU, to ""deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides"", the spokesman said. Sir Keir said the government's approach was ""disappointing"", and it would not consider any changes to the ""actual wording"" of the political declaration. ""Compromise requires change,"" he said. ""We want the talks to continue and we've written in those terms to the government, but we do need change if we're going to compromise."" Brexit: A really simple guide EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay' Sturgeon: Brexit delay not long enough Brexit explained in flowcharts The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by MPs. Theresa May has written to European Council President Donald Tusk torequest an extension to 30 June. But she says if the Commons agrees a deal in time, the UK should be able to leave before European parliamentary elections on 23 May. By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Both sides say they are serious about these talks, but there is little to show for that so far. Perhaps that's no surprise. After more than two years of negotiations with the EU and months of wrangling in parliament, the idea that the government could sit down with Labour and thrash out a deal that keeps both sides happy in a few days seems optimistic at best. There appears to be disagreement over what the talks can achieve; changes to the political declaration on the UK's future relationship with the EU, or an additional document to what has already been agreed? If a deal is done, it may or may not fly. Plenty of Tory MPs are uneasy about working with Labour and the closer ties to the EU it may lead to. Many Labour MPs want a further referendum regardless of what is agreed - something Jeremy Corbyn has been luke warm on so far. At this stage a deal looks doubtful. But this is Brexit and stranger things have happened. Prisons minister Rory Stewart told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that there were ""tensions"" but there was ""quite a lot of life"" left in the talks with Labour. ""In truth the positions of the two parties are very, very close and where there's goodwill it should be possible to get this done and get it done relatively quickly,"" he said. He insisted that ""of course we are prepared to compromise"" on the political declaration. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""The sense is that the government has only offered clarifications on what might be possible from the existing documents, rather than adjusting any of their actual proposals in the two documents."" She added that both sides agree the talks are not yet over, but there are no firm commitments for when further discussions might take place. In case no agreement has been reached by 23 May, the prime minister has said the UK would prepare to field candidates in European parliamentary elections. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU source that European Council President Donald Tusk will propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to Brexit, with the option of cutting it short if the UK Parliament ratifies a deal. But French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Friday that it was ""premature"" to consider another delay.

Boeing cuts 737 production after Max crashes,"This video can not be played The MCAS system explained Boeing is temporarily cutting production of its best-selling 737 airliner in the continuing fall-out from crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Production will drop from 52 planes a month to 42 from mid-April,external, Boeing has said in a statement. The decision is a response to a halt in deliveries of the 737 Max - the model involved in the two accidents. The plane is currently grounded as preliminary findings suggest its anti-stall system was at fault. An Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed only minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in March, killing all 157 people on board. The same type flown by the Indonesian airline Lion Air crashed into the sea only five months earlier, shortly after taking off from Jakarta. That accident claimed the lives of 189 people. Who were the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash? Boeing 737 Max: What went wrong? What do the crashes mean for Boeing? In both cases, preliminary findings showed the pilots had wrestled with the anti-stall system, known as MCAS, which caused the planes to nose-dive repeatedly. A report from the Ethiopian authorities issued on Thursday saidthe pilots of flight ET302 ""repeatedly"" followed procedures,externalrecommended by Boeing before the crash. ""We now know that the recent Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents were caused by a chain of events, with a common chain link being erroneous activation of the aircraft's MCAS function. We have the responsibility to eliminate this risk, and we know how to do it,"" the statement from Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said. He repeated that Boeing was making progress on updating the MCAS software and finalising new training for Max pilots. The Boeing CEO promises to fix the problem ""As we continue to work through these steps, we're adjusting the 737 production system temporarily to accommodate the pause in Max deliveries, allowing us to prioritise additional resources to focus on software certification and returning the Max to flight,"" he said. Current employment levels would be maintained, the statement said, and a new committee is being set up to look at ""policies and processes for the design and development of the airplanes we build"". The 10 March crash of Ethiopian Airlines ET302 led to airlines round the world grounding their 737 Max aircraft. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was one of the last major regulators to order the grounding of the Max, leading some to accuse it of being too close to Boeing. Questions are being asked about why the planes were not grounded earlier. Deliveries of the Max were halted, leading to an excess of the planes needing storage. After the statement, Boeing shares fell just over 1% in after-hours trading to $387.14 (Â£333). Boeing apologised on Thursday saying it was ""sorry for the lives lost"" in both accidents. But this has failed to satisfy many relatives who questioned why Boeing did not act earlier to take the planes out of service. The chief pilot's father, Dr Getachew Tessema, told the BBC the apology was ""too little, too late"". Dr Tessema blames Boeing Yared Getachew, 29, had more than 8,000 hours of flying experience when he was killed. ""I am very proud about my son and the other pilot, both of them,"" he told the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza. ""To the last minute they struggled as much as they could but unfortunately they were not able to stop it. ""I don't regret that he was a pilot. He died in the course of his duty."" Dr Tessema levels the blame squarely at Boeing, questioning why the company did not stop the 737 Max flying after the Indonesia crash. ""Why did they let them fly? Because they were in competition. They want to sell more. Human life has no meaning in some societies."" Relatives of an American passenger who died in the Ethiopian crash, 24-year-old Samya Stumo, filed the first lawsuit against Boeing on Thursday in Chicago.

Sturgeon: Delay not long enough,"Ms Sturgeon met EU workers living in Scotland during a visit to a building site in Glasgow on Friday morning Scotland's first minister has called for a lengthy delay to Brexit to allow time for some ""sensible ways forward"" to be found. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 12 April - but has asked for this to be extended until 30 June. EU leaders must agree unanimously whether to grant the request when they meet next week. Nicola Sturgeon said the ""short-term"" extension would merely set up another ""cliff edge"". Prime Minister Theresa May made her extension request in a letter to the EU after her proposed Brexit deal suffered three defeats in the House of Commons in recent weeks. She has proposed that if a deal is approved in time, the UK should be able to leave before European Parliamentary elections on 23 May. UK seeks new Brexit delay until 30 June EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay' Adler: Has Tusk found a solution? What are the Brexit sticking points? The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU source that European Council President Donald Tusk will propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to Brexit, with the option of cutting it short if the UK Parliament ratifies a deal. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Ms Sturgeon accused Mrs May of ""yet more short-termism and the setting up potentially of another cliff edge"". It came as she published an open letter assuring EU nationals living in Scotland that ""this is your home, you are welcome here and we want you to stay"". Allow Twitter content?

The first minister said: ""The sensible thing to do in my view, and it seems as if this might be the EU's view as well, is to have a longer extension to allow time for this issue to go back to the people in another referendum rather than continue to have these short-term cliff edges. ""The first priority, of course, must be to avoid a no deal exit at the end of next week - but beyond that give some time and space now for some sensible ways forward to be found."" Ms Sturgeon also said she believed it was now ""more likely than not"" that the UK will hold European elections in May, which she predicted would give ""some protection"" against a no-deal Brexit. She said the election would give people the opportunity to ""come out and cast a positive vote for Scotland and the UK as an internationalist country wanting to continue to play our part in Europe"". Theresa May made the request for an extension to Brexit in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk Ms Sturgeon said her preference was still for the UK to remain in the EU, but if that is not possible then she and the SNP would ""promote alternatives"" such as membership of the single market and customs union. She also said remaining in the EU ""will always be an option for Scotland with independence"". The first ministerpledged in Januaryto give an update on her plans for a second independence referendum ""in the coming weeks"" even if the Brexit deadline was extended - but has still not done so. Ms Sturgeon said this was because there was ""still no clarity in the immediate term about which path the UK is going to take"", and added: "" I had hoped that we would be at that point by now, but unfortunately I underestimated the incompetence of the UK government"". In her letter, the prime minister says the ""impasse cannot be allowed to continue"", as it was ""creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics"" in the UK. She said if cross-party talks with the Labour Party could not establish ""a single unified approach"" in the UK Parliament, MPs would be asked to vote on a series of options instead which the government ""stands ready to abide by"". She wrote that the UK proposed an extension to the process until 30 June and ""accepts the European Council's view that if the United Kingdom were still a member state of the European Union on 23 May 2019, it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections"". To this end, she says the UK is ""undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency"". But it said if a withdrawal agreement could be ratified by Parliament before then ""the government proposes that the period should be terminated early"" so the UK can leave the EU before then, and cancel preparations for the European Parliamentary elections.

Ten million face higher pension payments,"This video can not be played Minimum auto-enrolment pension contributions are rising Ten million workers in the UK will now see a bigger chunk of their wages automatically diverted to a pension, starting with their next pay packet. New rates taking effect on Saturday mean employees, employers and the government will all contribute more to these pension pots. That will mean less take-home pay for many people who are automatically enrolled into a workplace pension. However, workers have the option of opting out of the scheme at any time. This creates a choice between saving for the future or taking money now. Ten million people aged 22 and over, who earn more than Â£10,000 a year and who were not already in a company pension scheme, have beenautomatically enrolled,externalinto saving for old age through a scheme which began in 2012. More will be enrolled in the future as they start work or new jobs. This latest change marks the final increase in contribution rates designed under the scheme. For someone earning Â£30,000 a year who is in an auto-enrolment scheme, the change means putting an extra Â£32 a month from their pre-tax pay into their pension pot. But any dilemma on whether to continue with these contributions or opt-out of contributing to a pension has been eased by a tax cut which also takes effect from now. More than 30 million people now only have to pay income tax on earnings above Â£12,500 a year, rather than above Â£11,850. Analysts also say that by choosing to opt-out of this automatic pension saving, workers would actually lose out on the money their employer puts into their pension pot. ""Anyone who chooses to opt-out is basically taking a voluntary pay cut,"" said Tom Selby, of senior analyst at investment company AJ Bell. ""If you turn down the matched contribution [from an employer] you won't get it back elsewhere."" Women are more likely to work part-time, and typically earn less - a so-called motherhood penalty. That means the pension contribution change could have more of a noticeable impact in terms of pounds and pence. For example, someone earning Â£20,000 a year will see their contribution to a pension rise from Â£335 to Â£555 a year. Women face 'glaring' gender pension gap Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Gender pay: Fewer than half of UK firms narrow gap But for London hairdresser Chloe Cornwall, the long-term gain outweighs any short-term financial pain. ""This is a little bit of money that goes straight out of my wages before I even see it, that is for the future when I might need it,"" she said. There has also been some criticism of the system, as many women who work part-time do not earn the Â£10,000 a year required to qualify for these automatic pension contributions. Taneika Boyle says women working part-time are unfairly excluded That is true of Chloe's colleague, Taneika Boyle, who said that she used to be automatically enrolled until she went on maternity leave, returned part-time, and so no longer earned enough to be included to receive her employer's top-up too. ""Once you have a baby, you are put to the side,"" she said. Emma-Lou Montgomery, from Fidelity International, who wrote a report on the financial power of women, said: ""We need a system where as soon as women start earning anything they are automatically enrolled, encouraging women to save for their futures."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""The government is committed to removing the lower earnings limit and will consult on the best approach in due course."" But Martyn Maxey, who owns the hairdressing firm, argued that it was ""too big a burden"" for small businesses to cover these increasing pension contribution costs, rather than the government. Under the scheme, a 24-year-old earning Â£30,000 a year should build up a pension pot which would buy a retirement income of about Â£11,000 a year in today's money, according to Mr Selby, of AJ Bell. This makes a number of assumptions, so the actual result could be significantly different. Individuals will have a choice of various other ways to access the money at retirement, which would affect how much they get. The final total also depends on the performance of one of a number of pension companies that hold and invest people's savings. But figures compiled for the BBC by data company Defaqto show a wide variation in that performance. Over the past five years, pension pots with Standard Life have gained an average of 4.5% a year in value, compared with those with Nest - the biggest overseer of auto-enrolment pensions - which has seen an average return of 8.9% a year over the same period. Various other changes to our finances come into force on Saturday - the first day of the 2019-20 tax year - including: A rise in the state pension by 2.6%, meaning the basic state pension for most existing claimants is Â£129.20 a week A slight rise in the amount that can be saved into Junior Individual Savings Accounts A rise in the threshold at which taxpayers start paying the higher rate of tax to Â£50,000, except in Scotland where it remains at Â£43,430 State pension calculatorDepartment for Work and Pensions,external Combined state, workplace and DC calculator, fromStandard Life,external How much can I earn from a DC pot?Money Advice Service,external Pension contribution hike to see pay fall Women face 'glaring' gender pension gap Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Pension savers 'cash in, but lose out' Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

IRA call contributed to pub bomb deaths,"The blasts ripped apart the Mulberry Bush pub at base of the Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street An ""inadequate"" IRA warning call caused or contributed to the deaths of 21 people in the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, a jury has found. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Inquest jurors concluded there were no errors in the way police responded to the warning call and their actions did not contribute to the loss of life. Victims' families have called on police to bring the killers ""to justice"". This video can not be played Julie Hambleton called on police to bring the bombers to justice Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine died in the bombings, said: ""West Midlands Police have always told us when they get new evidence they will act on it, well here you go, you have the new evidence and I'm sure there is more to be had and more to be found."" She did not describe the inquests' conclusion of unlawful killing as ""vindication"", but said it ""gives us hope to move forward to get those who are still alive caught and for justice to be had"". West Midlands Police (WMP) said there continued to be an active criminal investigation. The victims of the 1974 bombings were aged between 16 and 51 Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC said the bombings were ""etched in the history"" of the city. Jurors at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre found the warning call was not adequate for the purposes of ensuring that lives were not lost in the explosions. The call, made to the Birmingham Post and Mail at 20:11, gave the bomb locations as the Rotunda building and the nearby Tax Office in New Street but made no mention of pubs, costing the police vital minutes. The first bomb, weighing between 25lb-30lb (11kg-14kg), detonated in the Mulberry Bush seven minutes later. The second bomb, weighing 30lb (14kg), exploded in the nearby Tavern in the Town two minutes later. Both pubs, popular with young people, were busy on the night of the bombings. It was a Thursday, which was payday for many, and also the day for late-night shopping. A third bomb was planted near the Barclays Bank on Hagley Road but failed to properly detonate that night. Ex-MP 'scum' for pub bomb name silence This video can not be played Birmingham pub bombings: The five men in the frame The jury at the six-week hearing said there was ""not sufficient evidence"" of any failings, errors or omissions in West Midlands Police's response to the bomb warning call, or in regards to two alleged tip-offs to the force giving advanced warning of the blasts. Following the conclusions, Sir Peter said the ""dreadful events will never be forgotten"". ""It would be not right to leave the inquest without paying tribute to those who helped that dreadful night,"" he added. ""We always expect our emergency services, particularly the police and firefighters to be there for us at the time of disaster and they were."" The coroner went on to thank the members of the public who ""just did the right thing and helped as best they could"". The first bomb was detonated at the Mulberry Bush pub Leslie Thomas QC, representing 10 of the bereaved families, added thanks on their behalf to those who helped on the night of the attacks. ""We just hope, in light of the jury's unequivocal finding that the IRA murdered 21 innocent people, that West Midlands Police will now redouble their efforts in terms of those bombers who may still be alive to bring them to justice,"" he said. 'I woke up amongst debris and dead people' Who were the pub bombings victims? Latest updates from the West Midlands The inquests came about after years of campaigning by families for a full account into what happened that night. A botched police investigation led to the 1975 jailing of the Birmingham Six, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991. The bombs detonated within two minutes of each other There was a dramatic twist towards the end of evidence at the inquests, when a former IRA member named the four the men he claimed were involved in the bombings as Seamus McLoughlin, Mick Murray, Michael Hayes and James Francis Gavin. The man, identified in court only as ""Witness O"", said he had been authorised to give those names by the current head of the IRA in Dublin. During the hearing Mr Thomas QC asked Witness O whether a previously named suspect, Michael Patrick Reilly, had been involved. The witness said: ""No, I don't remember him at all. Reilly? I would remember that."" Mr Reilly has always denied any involvement in the bombings. After the inquests, WMP Chief Constable Dave Thompson said the force was ""We are carrying out a number of active lines of inquiry"". ""Though my absolute statement is, if we could bring people to justice we would do and at the moment we have an active criminal investigation.""

New-build home complaints rise,"This video can not be played 'My house has taken over my life' When Justin Revell bought his new-build house near Norwich, he thought it was the dream home. ""I think currently it's actually taken over my life,"" he says. He shows us around, pointing out what he calls the ""endless list"" of problems he's encountered since October 2016 when he moved in. ""You find one problem and that escalates into another problem - it's like opening a can of worms."" Justin Revell and Lyn Whiteman helped each other manage their house trouble From substandard ceilings to badly-fitted fire-doors, missing insulation and condensation issues. Both his kitchen and a bathroom have had to be ripped out and replaced. He and his wife have moved out twice while repairs were done. It has been dealing with builder Taylor Wimpey, as well as the issues themselves, that have taken its toll. ""They make it deliberately difficult to contact them, they don't respond to you, they'll tell you something is fixed when it isn't."" Mr Revell says. ""A lot of people don't have the time or the knowledge to take the builders on."" He's joined forces with his neighbour Lyn Whiteman to help manage the problem. ""It's not a coincidence that two houses two doors down from each other with identical problems,"" she says. ""This is not isolated to this particular property or this estate - it's got to be national."" Taylor Wimpey says it apologises for the issues experienced by Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman and for the inconvenience caused. But could the two be right about a broader problem? The Homeowners Alliance says they have seen an increase in the number of people approaching them for help over the last two years because of serious defects with their new-build homes. Justin Revell and his wife moved into their ""dream"" home in Peter Pulling Drive in September 2016 Research from the organisation, which represents the interests of homeowners to the house building industry, suggest that only two-thirds of new homeowners are happy with the way their builder resolved any defects with their home. And even the developers themselves acknowledge the problem. The Home Builders Federation own satisfaction surveys show a rise in the number of customers reporting snags - from 93% in 2015 to 99% in 2018. That data comes just weeks after the government said they were considering removing Persimmon from the Help To Buy scheme after increasing concerns over the quality of its building work. And there is rising alarm from consumers and experts about the severity of these so-called snags. Timothy Waitt has become a specialist on construction cases at Anthony Gold solicitors. ""I'm not talking about dodgy kitchen units - I'm talking about major structural failings that affect health and safety."" Mr Waitt is getting enquiries on a near-daily basis on these kinds problems and is fearful a skills shortage in construction means that it is just the tip of the iceberg. ""I do not think we're talking about deliberate decisions to miss out on key expensive structural elements,"" he explains. ""This is about carelessness. I think what is arising is that people are making mistakes, potentially because they do not realise the significance of what they are doing, due to a lack of training, a lack of experience and a lack of supervision."" Taylor Wimpey, Britain's third largest homebuilder, reported profits up 19% to Â£810m for 2018, after selling 15,275 homes Like Mr Waitt, the BBC has spoken to a broad spectrum of homeowners across the country and across developers, whose ""snags"" go far beyond the kind of teething problems often anticipated with new builds. From Debbie, dealing with rising damp and poor drainage in East Sussex, to Saima in Wokingham where damp and mould drove her family out of their home or Robert in north London who has endured eight years of fighting to fix floors dipping in his home. What unites them all is the severe emotional strain it's placed on them. As a result, The Home Owners Alliance is campaigning to boost the rights or protection for buyers. ""There is no incentive for a builder to build right and move on,"" explains chief executive Paula Higgins. ""So that's why we're calling for a snagging retention so people can hold back some money and the builders will get things done properly."" Issues with snags occur across developers and building businesses. In this case, Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman's homes were built by Taylor Wimpey. ""I think currently it's actually taken over my life,"" Mr Revell says Taylor Wimpey says: ""We sincerely apologise to Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman for the issues experienced with their homes and for the inconvenience caused as we undertook remedial action. ""We are committed to delivering homes of the highest quality and service and we take our responsibilities to our customers extremely seriously. ""We have taken actions to put things right for these customers and all necessary works for both residents have now been completed as agreed. These works are in line with, and in some parts exceed, building regulations."" ""All our homes are subject to strict quality checks throughout construction, examined by the NHBC at key stages and are not handed over until a full quality inspection has taken place."" As well as a developer's guarantee for the first two years, warranties are provided on new build homes. The National House-Building Council protects 80% of them from years three to ten in a property, and they say the quality of new homes continues to improve. ""While we cannot be on site at all times, these visual, spot-check inspections are designed to target critical elements of the build process and allow us to highlight potential defects to the builder,"" says the NHBC. ""As most problems that arise in the first two years will be dealt with by the builder without reference to NHBC, we do not collect data on snagging; however, one barometer would be complaints received by NHBC, and these have not increased. ""In addition, new warranty claims continue to fall, with this trend being a clear sign that the quality of new homes covered by NHBC continues to improve."" A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson says the government wants to see more good quality homes:  ""We know more needs to be done to protect consumers, and our New Homes Ombudsman will protect the rights of homebuyers and hold developers to account.""

Woman who denies husband's murder released,"Sally Challen denies murdering her husband Richard in 2010 A woman whose sons campaigned against her conviction for murdering her husband has been released from prison ahead of a fresh trial. Sally Challen, 65, was found guilty of murdering 61-year-old Richard in a hammer attack in August 2010 and jailed for life in 2011. The conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in February. Appearing at the Old Bailey via video-link earlier, Mrs Challen, of Claygate in Surrey, denied murder. Mrs Challen wept in court as Mr Justice Edis granted bail and several hours later was released from HMP Bronzefield, Surrey. The judge set a further hearing for 7 June and a trial date for 1 July ""if necessary"". Sally Challen's son David (left) said earlier that his mother leaving prison would be a ""massive moment"" The appeal followed a campaign by her sons David, 31, and James, 35. Speaking outside court earlier, David said the family was looking forward to ""being together again after so long"". He said: ""We are overjoyed that bail has been granted for our mother and she will be now released back to us. Our mother now rejoins our family."" Mrs Challen's brother Chris Jenney added: ""The family are all supporting Sally. We have done from day one. Our strength's built and will build even further."" Sally and Richard Challen had two sons and had been married for 31 years During the two-day appeal hearing in February, the court heard evidence relating to Mrs Challen's state of mind at the time of the killing and the issue of ""coercive control"". Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. The murder conviction was overturned by three judges who said the evidence of a psychiatrist, that Mrs Challen was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing, was not available at the time of her trial and undermined the safety of her conviction. Lawyers for Mrs Challen, who has never denied killing her husband, asked for the murder conviction to be substituted to manslaughter but the panel of judges refused and ordered a retrial. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the conviction was quashed, David said: ""The abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account.""

'European Union' removed from UK passports,"Both passports were issued in the week following the UK's scheduled departure from the EU A British couple who applied for their passports on the same day received different versions - one with European Union on the cover, the other without. The new burgundy passports were introduced from 30 March, the day after the UK was supposed to leave the EU. Peter Brady said he was ""very happy"" he received one of the new passports and his partner was ""unhappy"" she did not. The Home Office said some people may still receive the old version until stocks run out. The decision to remove the European Union label was made in the expectation that the UK would be leaving the EU at the end of last month, as scheduled. Dark blue passports resembling the pre-EU British design are due to be issued from the end of the year. Mr Brady and his partner Jan both sent off their passport renewal applications on 21 March. His passport, which does not have any references to the European Union on the cover or inside, was printed on 1 April. His partner's passport, which was printed on 4 April, features the EU logo on the front and the inside. Mr Brady said he feels like he has his ""identity back"" as he was a great believer in the UK coming out of Europe, adding it was a ""shame"" his passport was not blue. ""For me to have the European Union wiped completely off my passport is good news,"" he said. His partner Jan was ""very unhappy"" as she too wanted a UK passport without the EU on it, according to Mr Brady. Should the British passport be blue? Blue passport to return after Brexit Could a no-deal hit my holiday plans?

"'European Union' removed from UK passportsDespite Brexit delays, the first passports without 'European Union' on the cover have been issued.UK","Both passports were issued in the week following the UK's scheduled departure from the EU A British couple who applied for their passports on the same day received different versions - one with European Union on the cover, the other without. The new burgundy passports were introduced from 30 March, the day after the UK was supposed to leave the EU. Peter Brady said he was ""very happy"" he received one of the new passports and his partner was ""unhappy"" she did not. The Home Office said some people may still receive the old version until stocks run out. The decision to remove the European Union label was made in the expectation that the UK would be leaving the EU at the end of last month, as scheduled. Dark blue passports resembling the pre-EU British design are due to be issued from the end of the year. Mr Brady and his partner Jan both sent off their passport renewal applications on 21 March. His passport, which does not have any references to the European Union on the cover or inside, was printed on 1 April. His partner's passport, which was printed on 4 April, features the EU logo on the front and the inside. Mr Brady said he feels like he has his ""identity back"" as he was a great believer in the UK coming out of Europe, adding it was a ""shame"" his passport was not blue. ""For me to have the European Union wiped completely off my passport is good news,"" he said. His partner Jan was ""very unhappy"" as she too wanted a UK passport without the EU on it, according to Mr Brady. Should the British passport be blue?

"Woman who denies husband's murder releasedSally Challen, whose murder conviction was quashed, is released from custody ahead of a fresh trial.Surrey","Sally Challen denies murdering her husband Richard in 2010 A woman whose sons campaigned against her conviction for murdering her husband has been released from prison ahead of a fresh trial. Sally Challen, 65, was found guilty of murdering 61-year-old Richard in a hammer attack in August 2010 and jailed for life in 2011. The conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in February. Appearing at the Old Bailey via video-link earlier, Mrs Challen, of Claygate in Surrey, denied murder. Mrs Challen wept in court as Mr Justice Edis granted bail and several hours later was released from HMP Bronzefield, Surrey. The judge set a further hearing for 7 June and a trial date for 1 July ""if necessary"". Sally Challen's son David (left) said earlier that his mother leaving prison would be a ""massive moment"" The appeal followed a campaign by her sons David, 31, and James, 35. Speaking outside court earlier, David said the family was looking forward to ""being together again after so long"". He said: ""We are overjoyed that bail has been granted for our mother and she will be now released back to us. Our mother now rejoins our family."" Mrs Challen's brother Chris Jenney added: ""The family are all supporting Sally. We have done from day one. Our strength's built and will build even further."" Sally and Richard Challen had two sons and had been married for 31 years During the two-day appeal hearing in February, the court heard evidence relating to Mrs Challen's state of mind at the time of the killing and the issue of ""coercive control"". Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. The murder conviction was overturned by three judges who said the evidence of a psychiatrist, that Mrs Challen was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing, was not available at the time of her trial and undermined the safety of her conviction. Lawyers for Mrs Challen, who has never denied killing her husband, asked for the murder conviction to be substituted to manslaughter but the panel of judges refused and ordered a retrial. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the conviction was quashed, David said: ""The abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account.""

"Fatal fight 'should never have taken place'An inquiry into boxer Mike Towell's death says he was not ""honest"" with doctors about a medical condition.Tayside and Central Scotland","Mike Towell died in hospital the day after the Glasgow fight in 2016 A Dundee boxer died following a fight that ""should never have taken place"", a fatal accident inquiry has concluded. Mike Towell died the day after losing in the fifth round to Welsh fighter Dale Evans in September 2016. The inquiry said,externalif he had been ""open and honest"" about a medical condition it was ""highly likely"" he would not have been allowed to box from 2014. It said the boxing governing body's rules were vulnerable to the concealing of relevant information by fighters. The 25-year-old, known as ""Iron Mike"" Towell, was diagnosed with severe bleeding and swelling to his brain following the 2016 fight in Glasgow. He was given medical treatment in the ring before being taken to hospital, but died 24 hours later. The inquiry was told that Mr Towellhad been advised by doctors not to boxthree years earlier after suspected seizures. It also heard details of his medical examinations with a qualified doctor appointed by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The notes showed that Mr Towell had said in the examinations that he had not suffered from headaches, blackouts or fits. The inquiry recommended: The BBBC should send a copy of each boxer's latest medical examination form to their GP It should seek confirmation from the GP or medical professional that the information is ""complete and accurate"" The GP should provide details of any relevant medical history of the boxer which may be relevant to his fitness to box. In his written judgement, Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull said: ""Regrettably, it appears that Mr Towell's love of boxing caused him to ignore the advice of doctors and not to accept the medical condition he had been diagnosed as suffering from. ""It is hard not to conclude that the very drive and commitment to boxing which Mr Towell demonstrated in his ascent to a final eliminator contest for the British welterweight championship in only his thirteenth professional fight is what led to his untimely death."" The sheriff concluded that the 2016 fight against Mr Evans ""should never have taken place"". He said: ""Had Mr Towell been open and honest with the doctors who carried out his annual BBBC medical examinations, it is highly likely that he would not have been licensed to box from at least 2014 onwards. ""Indeed, it is possible, although not certain, that he may never have been licensed to box professionally."" Sheriff Turnbull said he imagined that Mr Evans, who did not give evidence at the inquiry, would be haunted by the events ""for the rest of his life"". He said: ""Whilst I am sure that it will be of little comfort to him, it is important to record that Mr Evans is blameless.""

Boeing apology too late - pilot's father,"Dr Tessema - Boeing are to blame Boeing's apology for the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month is ""too little, too late"", the pilot's father has told the BBC. Dr Getachew Tessema was speaking a day after the US manufacturer admitted for the first time that the plane's anti-stall system was a factor in the crash. Boeing's chief executive officer also said the company was ""sorry for the lives lost"". The Boeing 737 Max crashed just after take-off killing all 157 on board. A preliminary report from the Ethiopian authorities issued on Thursday saidthe pilots of flight ET302 ""repeatedly"" followed procedures,externalrecommended by Boeing before the crash south of the capital, Addis Ababa. The pilots were responding to the plane nose-diving as the anti-stall system malfunctioned. Who are the victims of crash? What went wrong with the Boeing 737 Max? What do the 737 crashes mean for Boeing? Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said that despite their efforts, the pilots ""were not able to control the aircraft"". The accident came only five months after another 737 Max crashed. Lion Air flight JT 610 plunged into the sea off Indonesia killing all 189 people on board - again after the pilots encountered problems with the anti-stall system. Yared Getachew was one of the pilots on the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft which crashed Dr Tessema is grieving for Yared Getachew, the 29-year-old pilot who had more than 8,000 hours of flying experience when he was killed. Yared had been planning to marry another pilot this year. His father collapsed and was hospitalised when told of the accident as he struggled to grapple with what had happened. ""I am very proud about my son and the other pilot, both of them,"" he told the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza. ""To the last minute they struggled as much as they could but unfortunately they were not able to stop it. ""I don't regret that he was a pilot. He died in the course of his duty."" Dr Tessema levels the blame for the accident squarely at Boeing, questioning why the company did not stop the 737 Max flying after the Indonesia crash. ""Why did they let them fly? Because they were in competition. They want to sell more. Human life has no meaning in some societies."" Dr Tessema says he has not ruled out taking legal action, but will wait and speak to relatives and friends before making a decision. CEO Dennis Muilenburg issued a video statement on Thursday. On the human cost, he said: ""We at Boeing are sorry for the lives lost in the recent 737 accidents and are relentlessly focused on safety to ensure tragedies like this never happen again."" It was, he said, ""apparent"" that in both the Ethiopia and Indonesia flights, the software for the anti-stall system - or MCAS - was ""activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information"". He added: ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it."" Boeing is planning to release a software update for the MCAS, along with more pilot training for the 737 Max. At the same time, pilots will always be able to override MCAS and control the aircraft manually, Boeing says.

Dad ran over son in 'tragic' farm accident,"Evan Lloyd Williams died in October 2018 A three-year-old boy was accidentally killed falling from a Land Rover being driven by his father, an inquest has found. Evan Lloyd Williams fell on a farm near Llanybydder in Camarthenshire and died on 21 October 2018. The car door is thought to have opened while his father was reversing causing Evan to fall on the ground and tests showed he died from head injuries. Coroner Mark Layton described Evan's death as a ""terrible tragedy"". Evan's father Dewi Williams, from Gorsgoch in Ceredigion, had been reversing down a steep incline around a bend, with his wife Sian Elin Williams standing on the left hand side - following the correct procedure for a difficult manoeuvre, the inquest heard.

Sgt Shane Davies from Dyfed-Powys Police said it appeared Evan had fallen on the ground and then been run over, causing catastrophic injuries.

Amal Clooney takes Foreign Office role,"Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has been appointed as the government's special envoy on media freedom, the Foreign Office has announced. Ms Clooney and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will work to ""counter draconian laws that hinder journalists from going about their work"", the FCO said. Mr Hunt said violence against reporters had reached ""alarming levels globally"". Ms Clooney, who will not receive a fee for her work, said she was ""honoured"" to take on the role. ""Through my legal work defending journalists I have seen first-hand the ways in which reporters are being targeted and imprisoned in an effort to silence them and prevent a free media,"" added Ms Clooney, who last yearjoined the legal team defending two Reuters journalistsdetained in Myanmar. British-Lebanese barrister Ms Clooney is known for taking on high-profile human rights cases. Amal Clooney condemns 'charade' Myanmar trial In 2015, she was part of the legal team working towards the release of two Al Jazeera journalists jailed in Egypt. More recently, she represented Nadia Murad -a Nobel Peace Prize winnerwho was captured and tortured by so-called Islamic State. Mr Hunt said Ms Clooney's experience made her ""ideally placed"" to ensure the UK's efforts to protect global press freedom had ""real impact for journalists"".

Developer fined for destroying bat home,"Common pipistrelle bats often use buildings as a place to hibernate in winter and roost in summer Property developers who deliberately demolished a house containing protected bats have been fined Â£18,000. Jenna Kara, 29, and Tina Kara, 34, directors of Landrose Developments Ltd, started tearing down the bungalow in Stanmore, north-west London, in 2016. The company pleaded guilty at Willesden Magistrates' Court to damaging or destroying the breeding site. District Judge Denis Brennan said the punishment for ignoring environmental law would ""always outweigh"" gain. The court heard the developers had pressed ahead with the demolition despite an expert reporting the site was home to soprano pipistrelle bats - a protected species in the UK and Europe. Surveys at the site also indicated the presence of common pipistrelle bats, which are another protected species. Passing sentence, District Judge Brennan said: ""In my judgment, the act of demolition was clearly deliberate and flew in the face of advice and knowledge of the existence of the bat roost. ""The most obvious effect is local but it also has national implications because these bats are an endangered species by the very fact of being protected."" Pipistrelle bats are common throughout Britain Pipistrelles are tiny bats with reddish-brown coats and blackish-brown ears, nose and wing membranes They often use buildings as a place to hibernate in winter and roost in summer Like other bats, pipistrelles are nocturnal A single bat weighing up to 8g can eat 3,000 gnats in one night and they also eat moths and other small insects Source:RSPB,external The court heard that in a 2017 statement ecologist Jan Collins said the vast majority of offences against bats related to demolition and renovation of buildings. Landrose Developments Ltd pleaded guilty to damaging or destroying a breeding site or resting place of a wild animal of a European protected species between September 2016 and June 2017. The offence is contrary to the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and means the company will be barred from bidding to do certain projects.

Japanese spacecraft 'bombs' asteroid,"Artwork: Scientists want to retrieve a pristine sample of material from the crater The Japanese Hayabusa-2 spacecraft is thought to have detonated an explosive charge on the asteroid it is exploring. The idea was to create an artificial crater on the object known as Ryugu. If this is successful - and the early indications are positive - the probe will later return to gather samples from the gouged depression. Scientists believe these samples could help them better understand how Earth and the other planets were formed in the early Solar System. An apparent spray of debris is captured by the deployed camera The explosive device, called the Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI), was released from Hayabusa-2 on Friday. The SCI, a 14kg conical container, was packed with plastic explosive intended to punch a 10m-wide hole in the asteroid. Because of the debris that would have been thrown up in this  event, Hayabusa-2 manoeuvred itself before the detonation to the far side of 800m-wide Ryugu - out of harm's way and out of sight. But the probe left a small camera behind called DCAM3 to observe the explosion. Images returned to Earth later on Friday appeared to show a spray of debris emerging from the limb of the asteroid, indicating the experiment to excavate a crater very probably worked. Movie shows moment of asteroid landing Asteroid mission exploring a 'rubble pile' Metal world 'may have iron volcanoes' Hayabusa-2 will, in a few weeks, return to the crater to try to collect its pristine samples. Because they will come from within the asteroid, they will not have been exposed to the harsh environment of space. Bombardment with cosmic radiation over the aeons is thought to alter the surfaces of these planetary building blocks. So, scientists want to get at a fresh sample that hasn't been changed by this process. Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of space rock known as a C-type asteroid. It's a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System, and therefore records the conditions and chemistry of that time - some 4.5 billion years ago.

Speaking at last month's50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC),external, project scientist Sei-ichiro Watanabe said the experiment would also ""provide us with information of the strength of the surface layer of Ryugu"". This could help shed light on how the asteroid developed its characteristic ""spinning top"" shape. Ryugu has a characteristic ""spinning top"" shape Scientific resultssuggest Ryugu was formed from loose debris that was blasted off a bigger asteroid and then came back together to form a secondary object. At the LPSC meeting, held in The Woodlands in Texas, Yuichi Tsuda, the mission's project manager, told me how the team decided where on Ryugu to generate the artificial crater. ""There are two things: the first priority is to make a hole where we can easily identify a crater... so, easy observation, not too hard, not too bumpy,"" he said. ""Second, somewhere that's as feasible as possible in terms of landing... if those two don't meet together, we go with the first priority."" Scientists may command Hayabusa-2 to descend into the crater at a later date to collect a pristine sample of rock. But they will only do so if there is no risk of the spacecraft colliding with a boulder.

Fewer than half of firms narrow pay gap,"Fewer than half the UK's biggest employers have succeeded in narrowing their gender pay gap, analysis by the BBC has found. Across 45% of firms the discrepancy in pay increased in favour of men, while at a further 7% there was no change. Overall, 78% of companies had a pay gap in favour of men, 14% favoured women and the rest reported no difference. Firms had until midnight to file pay comparison data - by which time 10,428 had done so - or face legal action. Gender pay gap: Can it be fixed? Firms rush to meet gender pay deadline The total is roughly the same as last year, but it is unclear how many firms have failed to respond, since the government has no definitive list of companies required to file figures. Overall, the median pay gap in favour of men lowered slightly from 9.7% last year to 9.6% this year. The median pay gap is calculated by comparing the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and middle-ranking man in the same companies. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external By law, all companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it will take enforcement action against all firms that miss the deadline. It was unclear exactly how many companies had not reported, although it is thought about a quarter did so in the last 36 hours before the deadline. Ask gender pay specialists and they'll tell you there are many initiatives that companies can take - tackling unconscious bias, offering more flexible working and encouraging shared parental leave. But the issue doesn't end at the office door. The experts say society needs to change. Schools could encourage girls to take more STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths. There should be more flexible, affordable childcare options. And men could take on more of the household chores. But gender pay gap reporting may not be enough: the government may need to get tougher. Read more from Dharshini Among large firms reporting the biggest increases in pay gaps were garage chain Kwik Fit, Interserve FS (part of the Interserve Group), and car retailer Inchcape. Firms reporting the biggest improvement in narrowing the gap were Newsquest Media Group, Mitie, and DFDS Logistics. Large companies with the biggest gaps included Independent Vetcare at 48.3% (down from 50.5% last year) and EasyJet at 47.9% (45.5%). Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap at your company? Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of firms A spokesman for Interserve Group said: ""We are committed to addressing the issues on gender pay and through the leadership of our chief executive, Debbie White, we are making good progress."" A spokeswoman for Kwik Fit said it was committed to narrowing the gap and both recruit more female staff and promote from within. Easyjetsaid in March,externalthat the gap had widened from 45.5% as more female cabin crew had been recruited since the last pay snapshot. Most of the airline's pilots are male, and are more highly paid than cabin crew. The firm is making efforts to recruit more female pilots. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, described the figures as ""disappointing, but not surprising"". Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive, said: ""The regulations are not tough enough.  It's time for action plans, not excuses. ""Employers need to set out a five-year strategy for how they will close their gender pay gaps, monitoring progress and results. ""Government needs to require employers to publish action plans that we can hold them accountable to, with meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply."" Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive at the EHRC, said: ""The causes of the gender pay gap are complex and deeply entrenched. ""Meaningful change will take time and concerted effort, with some changes potentially increasing gaps in the short term, such as employing more women at junior levels before they rise into more senior positions. ""That is why it is vital that employers publish action plans to explain their figures and highlight where they will be targeting any inequality in their workplace."" Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you place all the men and women working at a company into two lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. The individual company data reflects information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the ""snapshot date"" - the previous year. 5 April is the snapshot date for businesses and charities. 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations.

UK seeks new Brexit delay until 30 June,"The prime minister has written another ""Dear Donald"" letter to the European Council president Theresa May has written to the European Union to request a further delay to Brexit until 30 June. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by MPs. The government has been in talks with the Labour Party to try and find a compromise to put to the Commons. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Tory negotiating team had offered no changes to Mrs May's original deal. The PM said from the outset she wanted to keep her withdrawal agreement as part of any plan, but was willing to discuss the UK's future relationship with the EU - addressed in the deal's political declaration. Sir Keir said the government was ""not countenancing any change to the actual wording of the political declaration"", adding: ""Compromise requires change."" What does Brexit delay letter say? EU's Tusk 'requests flexible Brexit delay' Sturgeon: Brexit delay not long enough The prime minister has proposed that if UK MPs approve a deal in time, the UK should be able to leave before European Parliamentary elections on 23 May. But she said the UK would prepare to field candidates in those elections in case no agreement is reached. It is up to the EU whether to grant an extension to Article 50, the legal process through which the UK is leaving the EU, after MPs repeatedly rejected the withdrawal agreement reached between the UK and the bloc. The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU source that European Council President Donald Tusk will propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to Brexit, with the option of cutting it short, if the UK Parliament ratifies a deal. But French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Friday that it was ""premature"" to consider another delay while French diplomatic sources described Mr Tusk's suggestion as a ""clumsy test balloon"". The prime ministerwrote to Mr Tusk,externalto request the extension ahead of an EU summit on 10 April, where EU leaders would have to unanimously agree on any plan to delay the UK's departure. Mrs May has already requested an extension to the end of June but this was rejected at a summit last month. Instead, she was offered a short delay to 12 April - the date by which the UK must say whether it intends to take part in the European Parliamentary elections - or until 22 May, if UK MPs had approved the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU. They voted it downfor a third time last week. A Downing Street spokesman said there were ""different circumstances now"" and the prime minister ""has been clear she is seeking a short extension"". The 30 June date is significant. It's the day before the new European Parliament will hold its first session. So the logic is, that it would allow the UK a bit longer to seal a deal - but without the need for British MEPs to take their seats in a parliament that the UK electorate had voted to leave as long ago as 2016. But, this being Theresa May, it's a plan she has previously proposed - and which has already been rejected. It's likely the EU will reject it again and offer a longer extension, with the ability to leave earlier if Parliament agrees a deal. But by asking for a relatively short extension - even if she is unsuccessful - the prime minister will be hoping to escape the ire of some of her Brexit-supporting backbenchers who are champing at the bit to leave. And she will try to signal to Leave-supporting voters that her choice is to get out of the EU as soon as is practicable - and that a longer extension will be something that is forced upon her, rather than something which she embraces. In her letter, the prime minister says she would continue to seek the ""rapid approval"" of the withdrawal agreement and a ""shared vision"" for the future relationship between the UK and EU. She said if cross-party talks with the Labour Party could not establish ""a single unified approach"" in the UK Parliament - MPs would be asked to vote on a series of Brexit options instead which the government ""stands ready to abide by"", if Labour commits to doing the same. The UK proposes an extension to the process until 30 June, she wrote, and ""accepts the European Council's view that if the United Kingdom were still a member state of the European Union on 23 May 2019, it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections"". How bad are things for the government? Brexit explained in flowcharts Brexit: A really simple guide To this end, she says the UK is ""undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency"". But she suggests the UK should be able to leave earlier, if the UK Parliament approves a withdrawal deal before then, and cancel preparations for the European Parliamentary elections. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels, said any extension granted should be the last and final offer, to maintain the EU's credibility. You could almost hear the sound of collective eye-rolling across 27 European capitals after Theresa May requested a Brexit extension-time that Brussels has already repeatedly rejected. Most EU leaders are leaning towards a longer Brexit delay, to avoid being constantly approached by the PM for a rolling series of short extensions, with the threat of a no-deal Brexit always just round the corner. Donald Tusk believes he has hit on a compromise solution: his ""flextension"" which would last a year, with the UK able to walk away from it, as soon as Parliament ratifies the Brexit deal. European leaders are awaiting the results of talks between the Conservatives and Labour But EU leaders are not yet singing from the same hymn sheet on this. Expect closed-door political fireworks - though it's unclear whether it'll be a modest display or an all-out extravaganza - at their emergency Brexit summit next week. Under EU law, they have to hammer out a unanimous position. Read Katya's blog Talks between Labour and the Conservatives are continuing on Friday. Speaking to Labour activists in Newport on Friday, Mr Corbyn said the government ""haven't appeared to have changed their opinions very much as yet"". He said Labour would push to maintain the UK's ""market relationship with Europe"", including defending rights and regulations. Labour chief whip Nick Brown is a member of the party's negotiating team Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK still hoped to leave ""in the next couple of months"" but it may have ""little choice"" but to accept a longer delay if Parliament could not agree a solution. But Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said the EU ""should be careful what it wishes for"". ""If we have EU elections, it is likely UKIP, Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage will do well,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. Another Tory Eurosceptic, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said he would prefer to stay in the EU for another year than for Britain to accept a ""humiliating defeat"" of a withdrawal agreement. The Scottish National Party's Stephen Gethins said that the prime minister's proposal ""demonstrates beyond doubt she is putting the interests of her fractured Tory Party above all else"". ""It is clear that with the UK Parliament unable to reach a consensus - coupled with everything we now know on the damaging impact Brexit will have on the UK economy, jobs and living standards - it must now be the priority that the issue is brought back to the people in a fresh second EU referendum, with the option to remain on the ballot paper.""

Brexit explained in flowcharts,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

This is the same date as the prime minister's original request last month, and just so happens to be two days before the new European Parliament meets for the first time. But such a relatively short extension may not be on offer - the talk in other EU capitals has been of a longer extension until the end of this year at the earliest. Mr Tusk is likely to suggest a one-year extension. The EU may well be more receptive, though, to the idea of a get-out clause: it would mean that if a deal were to be approved by MPs and ratified earlier, the UK could leave the EU straightaway. That would suit both sides, and it's another idea that Donald Tusk has been promoting behind the scenes. The PM still hopes a deal can be finalised before voting in the European elections begin on 23 May, but given the divisions in Westminster the timetable for that already looks really tight. It's also worth bearing in mind, given the initial reaction to Mrs May's letter from Paris and other capitals, that granting any extension is not yet a done deal. She is referring here to discussions between the government and Labour - and MPs more broadly - aimed at agreeing a Brexit plan which can be put to a currently deadlocked Parliament. This section is also a reminder for rebellious Conservative backbenchers and the DUP and its leader Arlene Foster: under this prime minister you can forget about reopening the withdrawal agreement and changing the wording of the Irish backstop. The EU has been ruling that out for months. Theresa May tried and failed to get them to change their minds (although her Tory critics say she didn't try hard enough), and now she's emphasised again that the focus for any new suggestions has to be the non-binding political declaration on what the future holds. The votes on various options in the House of Commons are designed to do that - but there's no cast-iron guarantee that a future government wouldn't opt for a change of course. The prime minister is making a promise to the EU that if the House of Commons backs any kind of compromise proposal, the government ""stands ready"" to abide by that decision - if Labour does the same. ""Stands ready"" isn't quite the same as ""will"" but it is pretty close. The dilemma for the PM, of course, is that backing a customs union would cross one of her red lines: that the UK must have a fully independent trade policy after Brexit. And membership of the single market, another option, would cross perhaps her reddest line of all - ending the free movement of people from the EU to the UK, and vice versa. Could that be a compromise too far for Theresa May? The prime minister really doesn't want to hold European elections, but here in black and white is a commitment to the EU that preparations for the elections are taking place. That includes making the legal order that sets the date of the poll on 23 May - something that needs to be done by 11 April. The government will hope that this provides reassurance to other EU countries that it will hold the elections if it has to. Downing Street will also hope that election preparations concentrate minds among MPs who are refusing to back the prime minister's deal. Brexit: What are the main sticking points? What does a soft Brexit mean? What Brexit deal did MPs reject? The language here is really important. The prime minister is saying that the UK will not try to block EU business or be obstructive to other countries - something backbench critics,such as Jacob Rees-Mogg,external, have already suggested could happen. The phrase ""duty of sincere co-operation"" carries some weight in Brussels, and is designed to reassure the EU that the UK will play by the rules as long as it remains a member state.

EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay',"Donald Tusk's plan would need to be agreed by EU leaders European Council President Donald Tusk is proposing to offer the UK a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to its Brexit date, according to a senior EU source. His plan, which would need to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit next week, would allow the UK to leave sooner if Parliament ratifies a deal. The UK's Conservatives and Labour Party are set to continue Brexit talks later. Theresa May has written to Mr Tusk with the UK's request for a further delay to Brexit until 30 June. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by MPs. Downing Street said ""technical"" talks between Labour and the Conservatives on Thursday had been ""productive"" and would continue on Friday. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has told the BBC that if they fail, the delay is ""likely to be a long one"". Cross-party Brexit talks end after 4.5 hours Germany 'stands with Ireland' over Brexit Labour chair offered to quit over referendum vote Germany: CDU leader hopes for second referendum Prime Minister Theresa May has said a further postponement to the Brexit date is needed if the UK is to avoid leaving the EU without a deal, a scenario both EU leaders and many British MPs believe would create problems for businesses and cause difficulties at ports. OnWednesday, MPs voted- by a majority of one - in favour of a backbench bill which would force Mrs May to ask the EU for a further extension. However, the PM wants to keep any delay as short as possible. To do that, she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would need to agree a proposal for MPs to vote on before 10 April, when EU leaders are expected to consider any extension request at an emergency summit. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""We will be having further discussions with the government"" If they cannot, Mrs May has said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". Mr Cox told theBBC's Political Thinking podcastthat particular scenario would involve accepting whatever postponement the EU offered, which was likely to be ""longer than just a few weeks or months"". But Conservative Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin said the EU was ""toying"" with the UK and the PM was under no obligation to accept the terms of any extension, even if mandated to by MPs. ""The government just wants cover,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""They want an excuse to do what they are going to do anyway, which is to take us into some kind of extension. The British people don't want that."" But he said an extension of a year or so would be better than leaving on the terms agreed by the PM, accusing her of being ""pretty dishonest"" about her willingness to countenance a no-deal exit. Europe's leaders have been split over whether, and how, to grant any extension. However, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU official that Mr Tusk ""believes he's come up with an answer"", after several hours of meetings in preparation for the summit. But his proposal would have to be agreed unanimously by EU leaders next week.The prime minister wrote to Mr Tusk,externalto request the extension ahead of Wednesday's meeting. You could almost hear the sound of collective eye-rolling across 27 European capitals after Theresa May requested a Brexit extension-time (till 30th June) that Brussels has already repeatedly rejected. Most EU leaders are leaning toward a longer Brexit delay to avoid being constantly approached by the PM for a rolling series of short extensions... with the threat of a no-deal Brexit always just around the corner. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, believes he has hit on a compromise solution: his ""flextension"", which would last a year with the UK able to walk away from it as soon as Parliament ratifies the Brexit deal. But EU leaders are not yet singing from the same hymn sheet on this. Expect closed-door political fireworks, although it's unclear whether it'll be a modest display or an all-out extravaganza - at their emergency Brexit summit next week. Under EU law, they have to hammer out a unanimous position. Read more from Katya Adler The EU has previously said that the UK must decide by 12 April whether it will stand candidates in May's European Parliamentary elections, or else the option of a long extension to Brexit would become impossible. Talks between Conservative ministers and Labour lasted nearly five hours on Thursday. Mr Corbyn has written to his MPs saying discussions included customs arrangements, single market alignment, internal security, the need for legal underpinning to any agreements and a ""confirmatory"" vote. The main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. Read more from Laura Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis told the BBC the party would not be talking to the government if a ""confirmatory referendum"" was not an option. But 25 Labour MPs - including a number representing Leave-voting seats - have written to Mr Corbyn, saying another referendum should not be included in any compromise Brexit deal. Asked whether another referendum on any final deal was a credible option, Mr Cox said: ""A good deal of persuasion might be needed to satisfy the government that a second referendum would be appropriate. But of course we will consider any suggestion that's made."" If the talks fail, the government faces an additional obstacle in the form of a backbench bill which would force the PM to seek a new delay. Passed by MPs by one vote on Wednesday, the bill is being scrutinised by the House of Lords, who will next consider the draft legislation on Monday. Ministers have argued it could increase ""the risk of an accidental no-deal"" in the event the EU agreed to an extension but argued for a different date than one specified by MPs. That would mean Mrs May having to bring the issue back to the Commons on 11 April, when European leaders would have returned home, the prime minister's spokesman said. After ameeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin,German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country still hoped for an ""orderly Brexit"". Angela Merkel visited Dublin for the first time in five years ""We will do everything in order to prevent... Britain crashing out of the European Union,"" she said.

Public should 'make call' on Brexit deal,"Labour's Tom Watson said about 80% of Labour MPs backed a so-called ""confirmatory ballot"" A public vote on any Brexit deal could ""solve the national crisis"" in the UK, Labour's deputy leader has said. Tom Watson said he was a ""reluctant convert"" to a confirmatory ballot but if MPs ""failed"" to do their job, the public could make the final call. Talks between Labour and the Tories on finding a way forward on Brexit are entering their third day. He suggested Labour MPs would find it ""a bit difficult"" to accept any outcome which excluded a referendum option. He also revealed that Labour has opened nominations for European elections to make sure the party was prepared if the polls do go ahead on 23 May. Theresa May announced earlier this week that she wanted to hold discussions with Jeremy Corbyn in order to find a proposal to put to MPs ahead of an emergency EU summit on 10 April. On a visit to Walesto celebrate Labour's victory in the Newport West by-election, Mr Corbyn said the issue of another referendum was still ""in the mix"", but Parliament had twice discussed and rejected the idea. Will Labour push for a public vote? EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay' Will cross-party Brexit talks go anywhere? If a proposal is passed, and agreed by the EU, it would stop the UK leaving the bloc on the 12 April with no deal. Mrs May has now written to European council President Donald Tusk to ask for an extension until 30 June - but said she still hopes to leave before 23 May so the UK does not have to take part in European elections taking place that month. Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's deal or talks end in no deal, there should be a general election. But if they cannot force one -Labour's attempt to call a no confidence vote in January failed- then the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". There is opposition to another referendum within Labour, with nine shadow cabinet members believed to remain sceptical and 25 Labour backbenchers writing to Mr Corbyn on Thursday, urging him to rule it out. They wrote: ""Delaying for many months in the hope of a second referendum will simply divide the country further and add uncertainty for business. ""A second referendum would be exploited by the far right, damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election."" And it has emerged that party chairman Ian Laveryoffered to quit the shadow cabinet, after twice defying orders to vote in favour of another referendum. But Mr Watson said about 80% of Labour MPs backed a confirmatory referendum of some sort, evidence that the party was ""holding it together"" in difficult circumstances. He BBC Radio 4's Today that his party was going into the talks ""with an open mind,"" but warned that if a confirmatory ballot was not part of an agreed plan, ""we would have a bit of difficulty in our parliamentary party"". ""We have got a strong policy on it,"" he said. ""People would say we don't like Theresa May's deal....That is why we are genuinely with open minds and good faith on both sides trying to see if we can work through a solution."" ""[But] it is pretty clear the people need to be part of that process and that is really a recognition of parliamentary failure. The argument has not been resolved in the chamber of the House of Commons."" This video can not be played Corbyn on Brexit talks: May meeting ""useful but inconclusive"" The public, he added, would be able to ""work out for themselves if this deal will work for them and their families"". ""People can take a look at the deal and they can make a call on it."" But Mr Watson did warn that the process of talks with the government would take time. ""From our point of view, we [just had] day two,"" he said. ""But we have had over 1,000 days being locked out of any discussions. ""We've had all this long delay, unnecessary delay. We think these talks are happening in good faith, but it is going to take a bit of time."" He added: ""A lot of us hope they can find a creative solution to this issue. The first part of the talks were to establish some clarity on everyone's position. Now we are looking at quite technical detail. ""We hope today [the government] can give some indication of where we can work more closely."" EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay' What are the Brexit sticking points?

Sturgeon: Brexit delay not long enough,"Ms Sturgeon met EU workers living in Scotland during a visit to a building site in Glasgow on Friday morning Scotland's first minister has called for a lengthy delay to Brexit to allow time for some ""sensible ways forward"" to be found. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 12 April - but has asked for this to be extended until 30 June. EU leaders must agree unanimously whether to grant the request when they meet next week. Nicola Sturgeon said the ""short-term"" extension would merely set up another ""cliff edge"". Prime Minister Theresa May made her extension request in a letter to the EU after her proposed Brexit deal suffered three defeats in the House of Commons in recent weeks. She has proposed that if a deal is approved in time, the UK should be able to leave before European Parliamentary elections on 23 May. UK seeks new Brexit delay until 30 June EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay' Adler: Has Tusk found a solution? What are the Brexit sticking points? The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU source that European Council President Donald Tusk will propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to Brexit, with the option of cutting it short if the UK Parliament ratifies a deal. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Ms Sturgeon accused Mrs May of ""yet more short-termism and the setting up potentially of another cliff edge"". It came as she published an open letter assuring EU nationals living in Scotland that ""this is your home, you are welcome here and we want you to stay"". Allow Twitter content?

The first minister said: ""The sensible thing to do in my view, and it seems as if this might be the EU's view as well, is to have a longer extension to allow time for this issue to go back to the people in another referendum rather than continue to have these short-term cliff edges. ""The first priority, of course, must be to avoid a no deal exit at the end of next week - but beyond that give some time and space now for some sensible ways forward to be found."" Ms Sturgeon also said she believed it was now ""more likely than not"" that the UK will hold European elections in May, which she predicted would give ""some protection"" against a no-deal Brexit. She said the election would give people the opportunity to ""come out and cast a positive vote for Scotland and the UK as an internationalist country wanting to continue to play our part in Europe"". Theresa May made the request for an extension to Brexit in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk Ms Sturgeon said her preference was still for the UK to remain in the EU, but if that is not possible then she and the SNP would ""promote alternatives"" such as membership of the single market and customs union. She also said remaining in the EU ""will always be an option for Scotland with independence"". The first ministerpledged in Januaryto give an update on her plans for a second independence referendum ""in the coming weeks"" even if the Brexit deadline was extended - but has still not done so. Ms Sturgeon said this was because there was ""still no clarity in the immediate term about which path the UK is going to take"", and added: "" I had hoped that we would be at that point by now, but unfortunately I underestimated the incompetence of the UK government"". In her letter, the prime minister says the ""impasse cannot be allowed to continue"", as it was ""creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics"" in the UK. She said if cross-party talks with the Labour Party could not establish ""a single unified approach"" in the UK Parliament, MPs would be asked to vote on a series of options instead which the government ""stands ready to abide by"". She wrote that the UK proposed an extension to the process until 30 June and ""accepts the European Council's view that if the United Kingdom were still a member state of the European Union on 23 May 2019, it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections"". To this end, she says the UK is ""undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency"". But it said if a withdrawal agreement could be ratified by Parliament before then ""the government proposes that the period should be terminated early"" so the UK can leave the EU before then, and cancel preparations for the European Parliamentary elections.

France bans breast implants linked to rare cancer,"Breast implants come with different fillings and different surfaces - smooth and textured France has become the first country to ban a type of breast implant that has been linked to a rare form of cancer. The ban covers several models of the implants with a textured surface, which are produced by six manufacturers. Those implants have been linked to a type of cancer that attacks the immune system. Some 70,000 women are believed to have received the implants, out of an estimated 400,000 women who have had breast implants in France. The ban was a ""precautionary measure"",externaltaken in light of the ""rare but serious danger"" posed by the implants, the National Agency for Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) said in a statement (in French). It said it had recorded 59 cases of the cancer among French implant wearers, of whom three had died. ""The more the implant is textured and rough the greater the risk of BIA-ALCL [anaplastic large-cell lymphoma],"" it said. The ANSM said it had noted a ""significant increase in cases of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma linked to the wearing of breast implants since 2011"". ""We have no scientific explanation for the development of ALCL, all we have are observations,"" Thierry Thomas, the agency's deputy director for health devices, told a press conference. The ANSM, however, did not recommend that the women who had received the implants undergo surgery to have them removed, because of the ""rarity of the risk"", it said. This video can not be played Janet Trelawny: ""I was devastated"" On Thursday, Canada also said it aimed to suspend the same type of implant. Health Canada said it was a ""precautionary measure"" following a safety review triggered by an increase in cases of BIA-ALCL. The agency has noted 28 cases in Canada - out of 457 cases of BIA-ALCL recorded in implant wearers worldwide, according to figures from the US Food and Drug Administration. The founder of a French company that was found to have used sub-standard silicone gel in its implants died on Thursday. Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), was 79. PIP created a popular brand of implant that was filled with a cheap industrial-grade silicone gel - rather than medical-grade silicone - resulting in implants rupturing. Q&A: Breast implants health scare Mas was sentenced to four years in prison for fraudin 2013. PIP exported 80% of its implants before the firm was shut down.

IRA call too late to stop pub bomb deaths,"The blasts ripped apart the Mulberry Bush pub at base of the Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street An ""inadequate"" IRA warning call caused or contributed to the deaths of 21 people in the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, a jury has found. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Inquest jurors concluded there were no errors in the way police responded to the warning call and their actions did not contribute to the loss of life. Victims' families have called on police to bring the killers ""to justice"". This video can not be played Julie Hambleton called on police to bring the bombers to justice Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine died in the bombings, said: ""West Midlands Police have always told us when they get new evidence they will act on it, well here you go, you have the new evidence and I'm sure there is more to be had and more to be found."" She did not describe the inquests' conclusion of unlawful killing as ""vindication"", but said it ""gives us hope to move forward to get those who are still alive caught and for justice to be had"". West Midlands Police (WMP) said there continued to be an active criminal investigation. The victims of the 1974 bombings were aged between 16 and 51 Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC said the bombings were ""etched in the history"" of the city. Jurors at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre found the warning call was not adequate for the purposes of ensuring that lives were not lost in the explosions. The call, made to the Birmingham Post and Mail at 20:11, gave the bomb locations as the Rotunda building and the nearby Tax Office in New Street but made no mention of pubs, costing the police vital minutes. The first bomb, weighing between 25lb-30lb (11kg-14kg), detonated in the Mulberry Bush seven minutes later. The second bomb, weighing 30lb (14kg), exploded in the nearby Tavern in the Town two minutes later. Both pubs, popular with young people, were busy on the night of the bombings. It was a Thursday, which was payday for many, and also the day for late-night shopping. A third bomb was planted near the Barclays Bank on Hagley Road but failed to properly detonate that night. Ex-MP 'scum' for pub bomb name silence This video can not be played Birmingham pub bombings: The five men in the frame The jury at the six-week hearing said there was ""not sufficient evidence"" of any failings, errors or omissions in West Midlands Police's response to the bomb warning call, or in regards to two alleged tip-offs to the force giving advanced warning of the blasts. Following the conclusions, Sir Peter said the ""dreadful events will never be forgotten"". ""It would be not right to leave the inquest without paying tribute to those who helped that dreadful night,"" he added. ""We always expect our emergency services, particularly the police and firefighters to be there for us at the time of disaster and they were."" The coroner went on to thank the members of the public who ""just did the right thing and helped as best they could"". The first bomb was detonated at the Mulberry Bush pub Leslie Thomas QC, representing 10 of the bereaved families, added thanks on their behalf to those who helped on the night of the attacks. ""We just hope, in light of the jury's unequivocal finding that the IRA murdered 21 innocent people, that West Midlands Police will now redouble their efforts in terms of those bombers who may still be alive to bring them to justice,"" he said. 'I woke up amongst debris and dead people' Who were the pub bombings victims? Latest updates from the West Midlands The inquests came about after years of campaigning by families for a full account into what happened that night. A botched police investigation led to the 1975 jailing of the Birmingham Six, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991. The bombs detonated within two minutes of each other There was a dramatic twist towards the end of evidence at the inquests, when a former IRA member named the four the men he claimed were involved in the bombings as Seamus McLoughlin, Mick Murray, Michael Hayes and James Francis Gavin. The man, identified in court only as ""Witness O"", said he had been authorised to give those names by the current head of the IRA in Dublin. During the hearing Mr Thomas QC asked Witness O whether a previously named suspect, Michael Patrick Reilly, had been involved. The witness said: ""No, I don't remember him at all. Reilly? I would remember that."" Mr Reilly has always denied any involvement in the bombings. After the inquests, WMP Chief Constable Dave Thompson said the force was ""We are carrying out a number of active lines of inquiry"". ""Though my absolute statement is, if we could bring people to justice we would do and at the moment we have an active criminal investigation.""

'I woke up amongst the dead',"The first of the bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush pub on 21 November 1974 On the night of 21 November 1974, hundreds of people were drinking in two Birmingham pubs. It was Thursday - payday for many and the day for late-night shopping in the city. Young couples gathered for drinks and others, many at the start of their adult lives, jostled for their favourite spots at the bar. But in the space of five minutes, their lives were changed forever. Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs, killing 21 people and injuring 220. More than 44 years later, inquests into the deaths have concluded the victims were unlawfully killed. Some of the survivors of the bombings have shared their stories. Maureen Mitchell would meet her then fiancÃ© at the Mulberry Bush pub ""most nights of the week"" About 50 people were enjoying a drink in the Mulberry Bush. The popular pub, located on the ground floor of the city's iconic Rotunda building, was a well-known meeting place and despite not being a weekend night, it was still busy - in 1974 Thursday was payday for many, and also the day of late-night shopping. For Maureen Mitchell, then 21, the pub was the perfect place to meet her then fiancÃ© Ian Lord, as they lived on different sides of Birmingham. It was a place they would meet ""most nights of the week"" and that night they gathered at a spot underneath the stairs while Maureen, who worked in an advertising agency, told Ian about her work Christmas party ""that he wasn't allowed to come to"", she remembers. This video can not be played Survivors who were at the pubs bombed in Birmingham recall that night At the nearby Tavern in the Town it was a similar picture. By 20:00 the basement pub, close to the Odeon cinema on New Street, was about two thirds full, with around 200 customers inside. Among them were Carol Bates and Kevin Burgess. The teenagers, aged 18 and 17 respectively, had known each other for just three weeks and were on one of their first dates. An excited Kevin had skipped college early to see her. In 1974, the West Midlands was in the grip of an IRA bombing campaign. There had been 53 separate explosive and incendiary devices used between 1973 and 21 November. But the young couple had no concerns about being in the city centre. Indeed, Carol's father, who was a policeman, had advised her to be careful, but ""there was no warnings or any feelings of anything amiss - it was a social night out"", she said. Carol and Kevin Burgess were aged 18 and 17 and on one of their first dates that night After meeting outside the Odeon, they headed down to the Tavern, grabbed a drink from the bar and stood near a pillar chatting about Kevin's college work. Also inside was Les Robinson, then 22, who was a regular at the Tavern. It was ""simply the best pub in Birmingham"", he said. He remembers it being busy that night, and by 20:10, when he arrived, there were already many workers from the city centre shops - the ""Rackhams crew"", as he called them, after the city's department store. One of those workers was Carol Pearce, then Eaglesfield, who had finished her shift at the clothing shop Etams across the road and had met her friend Heather Turner for a drink. The pub was packed, remembers Carol, who then aged 18 was dressed in the fashions of the day - brown trousers with tights, a cream floral blouse and a long purple and cream tweed coat that reached almost down to her ankles. As they enjoyed their drinks that Thursday night, customers in both pubs were completely oblivious to the events that would unfold. The second blast took place at the Tavern in the Town What they were not aware of was that at 20:11, a man called the Birmingham Post and Mail newspaper from a telephone box. During the call, taken by a telephonist, he spoke of a bomb in the Rotunda building and one in the tax office in New Street, which was then located in King Edward House, part of a seven-storey building above the Tavern in the Town. The warning was accompanied with the code ""Double X"", the wording given with telephoned bomb warnings to distinguish them from hoaxes. The police were informed and officers were sent to carry out a search of the Rotunda. But just minutes later, some time between 20:15 and 20:20, two bombs went off. Victims and survivors were hit by shrapnel during the explosions ""I don't remember hearing anything,"" says Maureen Mitchell, who was in the Mulberry Bush as the first bomb exploded. ""It was like the lights just went out and next thing I just felt as if I was - well I was - floating through the air. I don't remember hitting the ground again, then I remember Ian calling to me and I was just going 'my leg, my leg, I can't move my leg'. ""I remember Ian calling to me. Ian was trying to get me up. There was a lot of rubble on my legs and he was trying to get that off."" The blast in the Mulberry Bush was so violent that the 25lb (11kg) device left a metre-wide crater and blew out the staircase and bar. The interior of the pub was destroyed, the ceiling collapsed and broken glass, bottles, tables and chairs littered the scene. Fire crews search through debris at the scene of one of the bombings Other survivors told of seeing a ""bright flash"" and hearing a ""very loud bang"", while a passenger on a bus driving past the Mulberry Bush at the time of the explosion described the front of the building disintegrating and flying towards the vehicle. Maureen was carried away by a security guard from the Rotunda who laid her down outside the wall by New Street station, before she was put in one of the first ambulances that arrived. Others have spoken of crawling over bodies to get out of the pub. ""I didn't think I would make it because my whole stomach was in a mess,"" Maureen said. ""Once we got to the hospital they just took me straight to theatre and the next few days after that are quite hazy because I was in intensive care for five days."" Shrapnel had gone through Maureen's hip and lodged in her bowel, part of which was removed. Her condition was so serious she was given the last rites. Maureen Mitchell remembers ""floating through the air"" after the bombing Some 150 yards away, the Tavern in the Town shook. It was only looking back that Carol Pearce realised this was the impact of the first blast at the Mulberry Bush. ""We were sitting talking and the whole place shook. We didn't hear a bang, but it shook,"" said the mother of three. Unnerved by the sensation, Carol and her friend Heather decided to leave. Heather had already pointed out a man she thought looked suspicious, whom Carol says put down a holdall in the pub before disappearing. But just as they were about to go, everything went black. Survivors say there was a flash, smoke and then silence, before people started to scream and moan. ""I don't remember the bang, I just remember the shaking of the pub and everywhere went quiet,"" said Carol, who was blown by the force of the blast into the neighbouring HMV shop. ""I woke up amongst debris and dead people."" Survivors spoke of climbing over people to make their way out of the Tavern Les Robinson described hearing a ""roar"". ""It was inside you,"" he said. ""I remember it was as though a big hand picked me up and I did a somersault and it threw me into the wall, and when I landed it had thrown me on the bottom of the stairs."" The 30lb (13.5kg) device at the Tavern had been packed with large amounts of explosives, similar to the type used in quarries. It blasted a 3ft by 3ft crater through the pub's 10-inch thick concrete flooring, brought down the ceiling and flung debris up the stairs and out on to the street. Carol and Heather managed to struggle out, seeing a ""sobbing policeman"" who helped them flee, and they were taken to the General Hospital. Carol had serious burns to her legs - the tights she had been wearing under her trousers to keep herself warm in the November weather had burnt to her skin - shrapnel had torn a hole in her back, she had burns to her face, hair and hands and both of her eardrums were perforated, leading to lasting hearing problems. Her friend Heather needed a blood transfusion and had burns to her face. The pair spent a short time in hospital together, but after that night lost touch and would never see each other again. Carol Pearce was pictured in the Birmingham Mail in hospital during a visit by the Duke of Edinburgh following the bombings The blast knocked Kevin Burgess off his feet. ""I called out for Carol, she answered, we got together, got ourselves up,"" he said. ""It was darkness, that's what made it surreal. The screams, people's voices of agony - you could see very little because it was all black and you were stumbling around."" ""We realised that the wall and pillar behind us had come straight down behind us and the back wall had been blown out, which in effect turned out to be the only way out as the stairs had blown up,"" remembers Carol Burgess. The pair started to help others out and were forced to climb over people, ""listening to the screams and making our way out of the pub"", Kevin said. They had suffered mostly superficial injuries - cuts, bruises and hearing loss - for which they were treated at the General Hospital. Forty-four years on, Carol and Kevin Burgess both remain wary of travelling into the city centre The blast had blown ""glass, wood and everything else"" into Les Robinson's body. His trousers were ripped off and the nylon jumper he was wearing had melted to his shoulder. ""I couldn't see a thing, obviously all the lights had blown,"" said Les, who worked as a Co-op Dairy plumber. ""We couldn't hear anything because of burst eardrums, the only thing that really worked was your smell. ""Although I didn't know it at the time, but it was the people who had been burned. My whole leg had been burned, all my hair had burned off, I could smell me, I could smell everyone and then I thought: 'I've got to get out of here'."" Despite his injuries, Les managed to make his way out of the pub and struggled the mile-and-a-half journey home, clinging to parking meters and cars to support him along the way. Les Robinson described the Tavern as ""simply the best pub in Birmingham"" Outside the Tavern there was ""uproar"". People staggered or were carried to the Magnum Hotel opposite, some screaming, some just waiting to be taken to hospital. But the realisation of what had happened was yet to hit them. ""I don't think anyone in the whole pub knew what it was,"" said Les. ""Last thing on my mind was a bomb, a terrorist bomb."" Carol Burgess added: ""We didn't quite believe it to start with. You know these things go on but you don't believe it could happen to you."" The victims of the 1974 bombings were aged between 16 and 51 A total of 21 people were killed by the two bombs. Nineteen died on the night - eight in the Mulberry Bush and nine in the Tavern in the Town. Two more died later from their injuries. The seven women and 14 men killed were aged between 16 and 51. Thirteen of the victims were under 30, including five in their teens. Some 44 years after the pub bombings, no-one has been convicted in connection with the atrocity. Six men were wrongly jailed but finally released in 1991. During the near 17 years they spent behind bars, the case of the Birmingham Six became infamous as one of the worst miscarriages of justice seen in Britain. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out the bombings - a third device was planted near the Barclays Bank on Hagley Road but failed to detonate properly. For the survivors, life has gone on, but the events of that night have never been forgotten. The Mulberry Bush pub underneath the Rotunda in 1974, and the site as it looks in 2019 Despite her injuries, Maureen slowly recovered and she and Ian married seven months later, although the couple would go on to divorce. ""You try not to let it make any difference to your life,"" she said. ""Our wedding was already planned so we carried on and got married seven months later and I suppose we just tried to get on with it, really, ""I've always tried not to be bitter because I always felt that being bitter wasn't helping me or anyone else."" The bombings made Maureen ""appreciate life more"" and she became involved with peace and reconciliation work. She suffered from survivor guilt, but said meeting others bereaved and affected by the Troubles had helped her cope. And while she bears the scars from her injuries ""physically they don't affect me in any way"", she said. Les Robinson sustained significant shrapnel injuries in the bombing of the Tavern in the Town For Les, now 67, the impact of that night means he cannot be anywhere near an unattended parcel. ""Even to this day it gives me the most uncomfortable feeling in the world. I will ask if I'm in a place with an unattended bag, I will ask whose is that bag and if I can't find out I'm out of there."" But he says the events enabled him to ""meet and marry the woman that I did"". ""Her name is Roz,"" he said. ""Roz was in there as well that night. We'd fell out so weren't really together - like all courting couples you have your moments - but it got us back together. ""From there we married, from there we had the two best daughters you want and a further three grandchildren. It made my life. The Tavern didn't take away anything from me, but it gave me everything."" A buffet restaurant now occupies the site of the former Tavern in the Town Carol and Kevin Burgess, who had been on one of their early dates, went on to marry. The bombings ""brought us closer together"", says Kevin. But 44 years on, both say they remain wary of travelling into the city centre. Over the years Kevin suffered flashbacks and found it difficult to accept that he escaped with relatively minor injuries. ""I was very, very lucky,"" he said. ""People lost arms, legs - died. Why wasn't it me? That's affected me over a number of years."" He added: ""The one thing that will always stick with me for the rest of my life is the smell of flesh, hair. That will never ever go from me."" Carol Pearce says she is grateful for the life she has lived Carol Pearce became a Christian ""that night"", she says. She later befriended a girl in her street and was a bridesmaid at her wedding. The best man was Roy Pearce - whom Carol, now 62, went on to marry. The couple have been married for 42 years. ""For me, everything changed because if I hadn't have been in the bombing I don't know what would have happened, but I certainly wouldn't have met Roy, but I did, so things changed dramatically,"" she said. The couple took over running a youth club and then she ran an arts and crafts charity and did play scheme work. While she did not go back to her job at Etams, and trips into the city centre became infrequent, in 2004 she would return to work in the centre of Birmingham as a receptionist at the National Trust's Back to Backs attraction, a ""big step"" that eventually gave her the confidence to travel into the city on her own. ""I've thoroughly enjoyed my life,"" she added. ""I'm grateful for the life I've got.""

UK productivity continues lost decade,"UK workers' productivity fell again in the final three months of last year, down by 0.1% compared with the same quarter a year ago. It was the second year-on-year quarterly fall in a row, after a 0.2% drop in the July-to-September period. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the ""productivity puzzle"" had been a problem for years. It said labour productivity was lower over the past decade than at any time in the 20th Century. ""It has taken the UK a decade to deliver 2% growth, which historically was achieved in a single year,"" said ONS deputy chief economist Richard Heys. What wine has to do with our productivity problem Although it was down compared with the final quarter of 2017, productivity over the final three months of 2018 was 0.3% higher than in the July-to-September period. Productivity - as measured by the amount of work produced per working hour - is the main driver of long-term economic growth and higher living standards. However, growth has been sluggish over the past decade as the UK economy has recovered from the downturn triggered by the financial crisis. The ONS said productivity in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 18.3% below its pre-downturn trend. Jonty Bloom, business correspondent It has been going on for more than 10 years now, but the productivity puzzle does not seem like ending any time soon. It is vastly important, as we can only really pay ourselves more if we make more, and in the last decade we have achieved productivity growth of just 2%, a rate we used to manage regularly each and every year. The causes are also not clear. While it is true we are employing more people, it seems that they are going into unproductive jobs. This is called the car wash problem: 20 years ago, car washes were already fully automated, but now they consist of five men and a bucket - less productive, not more. You would expect the top firms in the UK - the elite, highly competitive engineering, pharmaceutical and high-tech industries - to be storming ahead with new technologies and digital working, but that doesn't seem to show up in the figures either. Also, their expertise is not trickling down into smaller businesses like it used to. Multiple factors are at work, but one thing is clear: this has all happened since the credit crunch. That huge economic shock seems to have created a permanent long-term change to how our economy develops, and not in a good way. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The UK's 'productivity puzzle' is a source of much debate and analysis. ""Part of the UK's recent poor labour productivity performance has undoubtedly been that low wage growth has increased the attractiveness of employment for companies. This helped employment to hold up well during the 2008-09 downturn and to pick up as growth returned."" He added: ""It is also probable that many companies took on labour rather than committing to costly investment, given the highly uncertain economic and political outlook. The low cost of labour relative to capital has certainly supported employment over investment.""

Drab block behind Starbucks was spy base,"The unremarkable office block is sandwiched between a Starbucks and a pub A drab office block sandwiched between a pub and a branch of Starbucks was a secret base of spy agency GCHQ, it has been confirmed. The anonymous building opposite St James's Park Tube station in central London was used by British spooks for 66 years. Despite the covert goings-on within, neighbours said the address's purpose was an open secret among locals. GCHQ acknowledged the location after moving out of its home. Director Jeremy Fleming said the site in Palmer Street, used by intelligence officers since 1953, had been part of ""a history full of amazing intelligence"". The government-leased building has been used by the intelligence service since 1953 The entrance is through a nondescript black door opposite St James's Park Tube station GCHQ, known as Britain's listening post, was set up on 1 November 1919 as a peacetime ""cryptanalytic"" unit. During World War Two, staff were moved to Bletchley Park to decrypt German messages including, most famously of all, the Enigma communications. GCHQ sets up all-female training classes Why real-life spooks love spy dramas Inside GCHQ's operations centre When the service moved its headquarters to Cheltenham from the London suburb of Eastcote in the 1950s, the Ministry of Works provided the Palmer Street building as a centre to handle secret paperwork and a base for its director. By Joseph Lee, BBC News It turns out that it's hard to put a spy HQ with frosted glass windows in the middle of central London without someone asking questions. And at the Adam and Eve pub at the end of Palmer Street, the answers were surprisingly accurate. Asked if she knew what the building next door was, a barmaid said: ""It's Mâ¦ MI6?"" The secretive neighbours were just a fact of life and she could not remember how she found out, she said. ""We don't really talk about it."" She suggested that the landlord might know more, but the BBC's inquiries fell foul of the pub chain's operational security - press enquiries have to go through head office, the landlord said, before disappearing through a door marked ""The Hideaway"". Staff at Starbucks on the other side of the office building either knew less or refused to crack under interrogation. Regina Toth, who had worked in the coffee shop for two years, said: ""It was very mysterious."" At Pall Mall Barbers, Jack Holden knew it was ""secret service or something"". He'd worked opposite the GCHQ building for six years, but seeing police cars come with lights flashing to move on a loiterer in the street convinced him that ""it's legit"". ""It was just common knowledge,"" he said. ""It looks suspect, doesn't it? With those blacked-out windows. It's a very secure building."" The spy agency said the unremarkable building, which is between a coffee shop and the Adam and Eve pub, had ""played its part in significant events over the years, such as the 2012 London Olympics"". It has been sold privately but future plans for it are not currently known. The spy agency is known as Britain's listening post Despite the sale, GCHQ said it would maintain a presence in the capital, in addition to its Cheltenham HQ and other offices in Bude in Cornwall, Scarborough, Lincolnshire and Harrogate. A new secure facility is also set to open in Manchester later in the year.

Question Time accused of bias over move,"The panel discussion was moved from Bolton to Dulwich ""due to ongoing Brexit votes"", the BBC said The BBC has been accused of bias after it moved live filming of Question Time from Bolton to London. The programme said Thursday's show was broadcast from Dulwich to allow politicians attending Brexit debates at Westminster to take part. Some social media users said moving filming from Bolton, where 58% voted to leave the EU, ensured a pro-EU audience in London, which voted to remain. The BBC said it was looking for a new date to return to Bolton. The weekly BBC One debate, which allows audience members to question a panel of politicians, journalists and public figures, had been due to air from Bolton's Albert Halls. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile Wigan Labour MP Lisa Nandy and Rachel Reeves, the MP for Leeds West, have written to the BBC director general Tony Hall to complain about the decision, arguing it reflects a capital-centric outlook in the corporation's output and deprived non-Londoners of a voice at a crucial moment in the Brexit debate. Ms Nandy said: ""The decision to move last night's Question Time from Bolton to London has been met with real anger in the north. Too often people in our constituencies are cut out of the national debate.""

Labour wins Newport West by-election,"This video can not be played Ruth Jones wants to reconnect with the people who did not vote Labour has held on to the Newport West parliamentary seat with a reduced majority following a by-election. Union official Ruth Jones won the south Wales seat, which fell vacant with thedeath of veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn in February. Labour saw its majority over the Conservatives fall to 1,951 from 5,658 at the 2017 general election. Mr Flynn had held the seat since 1987. Eleven candidates stood, with the 37% turnout higher than some had predicted. In her victory speech, Ms Jones, 56, said the by-election had taken place because of ""the sad passing of Paul Flynn, our friend"". ""There have been many tributes to him over the weeks but one saying stood out to me - 'everyone knew somebody who was helped by Paul Flynn',"" she said. Lion Mama: The woman who fought off her daughterâs rapists Sala pilot 'not qualified to fly at night' The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill ""These words have been an inspiration to me throughout the campaign.  That's what we're here for - to do our best to help others."" She added: ""Now that you've elected me to go to Parliament, I will do what I promise to do on the doorstep: I will stand up for the people, the jobs and the economy of Newport West."" Renew candidate June Davies (left) and Neil Hamilton of UKIP congratulate Ruth Jones Born and brought up in the constituency, Ms Jones, a NHS physiotherapist, has been a full-time union official with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy since 2016. She stood as the Labour candidate in Monmouth at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. ""Who knows what the next few days, weeks and months will bring,"" she added. ""But what I do know is that people have had enough after a decade of austerity."" ""They've had enough of cuts that have taken police off our streets, they've had enough of being made to feel worthless by universal credit and the bedroom tax. If I'm going to parliament it's with those people in my heart and Newport in my mind."" Newport West by-election: As it happened The result saw a swing from Labour to the Conservative of 2.4%. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Ms Jones would be a ""fantastic successor to Paul Flynn and will take up the tireless work he carried out for this community"". ""Tonight's result sends a clear message that the people of Newport and Wales are fed up of austerity which has robbed the Welsh economy of Â£1bn through needless cuts and shows support for Labour's alternative,"" he added. Conservative candidate Matthew Evans said he had ""never seen such anger and frustration"" on the doorstep as what he encountered over Brexit. ""People just want clarity and I've seen no appetite for another referendum or a general election,"" he said. Ruth Jones with her husband David after her win UKIP candidate Neil Hamilton, an AM for the party, came third with 2,023 votes. He campaigned saying the by-election was a chance to send a message to Westminster over its handling of the UK's departure from the EU. He said: ""To nearly quadruple our vote, I regard a success in itself even though we didn't win the election. ""I regard this as the start of a new era for my party and I look forward to the next election, whenever that may come."" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor This is a good hold for Labour and Ruth Jones will be pleased to be heading for Westminster with a majority of nearly 2,000 at a time of such an unpredictability. The Conservatives will be pleased to have held off the UKIP challenge for second place when the UK government is under such pressure over Brexit. But UKIP is taking encouragement from a vote share of more than 8%, which would be their baseline for keeping a presence in the Senedd at the next Welsh Assembly elections. What happened in this by-election should not be taken as a barometer for for future elections - politics is a rollercoaster right now. Ruth Jones will need to fasten her seat belt.

'I woke up amongst debris and dead people',"The first of the bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush pub on 21 November 1974 On the night of 21 November 1974, hundreds of people were drinking in two Birmingham pubs. It was Thursday - payday for many and the day for late-night shopping in the city. Young couples gathered for drinks and others, many at the start of their adult lives, jostled for their favourite spots at the bar. But in the space of five minutes, their lives were changed forever. Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs, killing 21 people and injuring 220. More than 44 years later, inquests into the deaths have concluded the victims were unlawfully killed. Some of the survivors of the bombings have shared their stories. Maureen Mitchell would meet her then fiancÃ© at the Mulberry Bush pub ""most nights of the week"" About 50 people were enjoying a drink in the Mulberry Bush. The popular pub, located on the ground floor of the city's iconic Rotunda building, was a well-known meeting place and despite not being a weekend night, it was still busy - in 1974 Thursday was payday for many, and also the day of late-night shopping. For Maureen Mitchell, then 21, the pub was the perfect place to meet her then fiancÃ© Ian Lord, as they lived on different sides of Birmingham. It was a place they would meet ""most nights of the week"" and that night they gathered at a spot underneath the stairs while Maureen, who worked in an advertising agency, told Ian about her work Christmas party ""that he wasn't allowed to come to"", she remembers. This video can not be played Survivors who were at the pubs bombed in Birmingham recall that night At the nearby Tavern in the Town it was a similar picture. By 20:00 the basement pub, close to the Odeon cinema on New Street, was about two thirds full, with around 200 customers inside. Among them were Carol Bates and Kevin Burgess. The teenagers, aged 18 and 17 respectively, had known each other for just three weeks and were on one of their first dates. An excited Kevin had skipped college early to see her. In 1974, the West Midlands was in the grip of an IRA bombing campaign. There had been 53 separate explosive and incendiary devices used between 1973 and 21 November. But the young couple had no concerns about being in the city centre. Indeed, Carol's father, who was a policeman, had advised her to be careful, but ""there was no warnings or any feelings of anything amiss - it was a social night out"", she said. Carol and Kevin Burgess were aged 18 and 17 and on one of their first dates that night After meeting outside the Odeon, they headed down to the Tavern, grabbed a drink from the bar and stood near a pillar chatting about Kevin's college work. Also inside was Les Robinson, then 22, who was a regular at the Tavern. It was ""simply the best pub in Birmingham"", he said. He remembers it being busy that night, and by 20:10, when he arrived, there were already many workers from the city centre shops - the ""Rackhams crew"", as he called them, after the city's department store. One of those workers was Carol Pearce, then Eaglesfield, who had finished her shift at the clothing shop Etams across the road and had met her friend Heather Turner for a drink. The pub was packed, remembers Carol, who then aged 18 was dressed in the fashions of the day - brown trousers with tights, a cream floral blouse and a long purple and cream tweed coat that reached almost down to her ankles. As they enjoyed their drinks that Thursday night, customers in both pubs were completely oblivious to the events that would unfold. The second blast took place at the Tavern in the Town What they were not aware of was that at 20:11, a man called the Birmingham Post and Mail newspaper from a telephone box. During the call, taken by a telephonist, he spoke of a bomb in the Rotunda building and one in the tax office in New Street, which was then located in King Edward House, part of a seven-storey building above the Tavern in the Town. The warning was accompanied with the code ""Double X"", the wording given with telephoned bomb warnings to distinguish them from hoaxes. The police were informed and officers were sent to carry out a search of the Rotunda. But just minutes later, some time between 20:15 and 20:20, two bombs went off. Victims and survivors were hit by shrapnel during the explosions ""I don't remember hearing anything,"" says Maureen Mitchell, who was in the Mulberry Bush as the first bomb exploded. ""It was like the lights just went out and next thing I just felt as if I was - well I was - floating through the air. I don't remember hitting the ground again, then I remember Ian calling to me and I was just going 'my leg, my leg, I can't move my leg'. ""I remember Ian calling to me. Ian was trying to get me up. There was a lot of rubble on my legs and he was trying to get that off."" The blast in the Mulberry Bush was so violent that the 25lb (11kg) device left a metre-wide crater and blew out the staircase and bar. The interior of the pub was destroyed, the ceiling collapsed and broken glass, bottles, tables and chairs littered the scene. Fire crews search through debris at the scene of one of the bombings Other survivors told of seeing a ""bright flash"" and hearing a ""very loud bang"", while a passenger on a bus driving past the Mulberry Bush at the time of the explosion described the front of the building disintegrating and flying towards the vehicle. Maureen was carried away by a security guard from the Rotunda who laid her down outside the wall by New Street station, before she was put in one of the first ambulances that arrived. Others have spoken of crawling over bodies to get out of the pub. ""I didn't think I would make it because my whole stomach was in a mess,"" Maureen said. ""Once we got to the hospital they just took me straight to theatre and the next few days after that are quite hazy because I was in intensive care for five days."" Shrapnel had gone through Maureen's hip and lodged in her bowel, part of which was removed. Her condition was so serious she was given the last rites. Maureen Mitchell remembers ""floating through the air"" after the bombing Some 150 yards away, the Tavern in the Town shook. It was only looking back that Carol Pearce realised this was the impact of the first blast at the Mulberry Bush. ""We were sitting talking and the whole place shook. We didn't hear a bang, but it shook,"" said the mother of three. Unnerved by the sensation, Carol and her friend Heather decided to leave. Heather had already pointed out a man she thought looked suspicious, whom Carol says put down a holdall in the pub before disappearing. But just as they were about to go, everything went black. Survivors say there was a flash, smoke and then silence, before people started to scream and moan. ""I don't remember the bang, I just remember the shaking of the pub and everywhere went quiet,"" said Carol, who was blown by the force of the blast into the neighbouring HMV shop. ""I woke up amongst debris and dead people."" Survivors spoke of climbing over people to make their way out of the Tavern Les Robinson described hearing a ""roar"". ""It was inside you,"" he said. ""I remember it was as though a big hand picked me up and I did a somersault and it threw me into the wall, and when I landed it had thrown me on the bottom of the stairs."" The 30lb (13.5kg) device at the Tavern had been packed with large amounts of explosives, similar to the type used in quarries. It blasted a 3ft by 3ft crater through the pub's 10-inch thick concrete flooring, brought down the ceiling and flung debris up the stairs and out on to the street. Carol and Heather managed to struggle out, seeing a ""sobbing policeman"" who helped them flee, and they were taken to the General Hospital. Carol had serious burns to her legs - the tights she had been wearing under her trousers to keep herself warm in the November weather had burnt to her skin - shrapnel had torn a hole in her back, she had burns to her face, hair and hands and both of her eardrums were perforated, leading to lasting hearing problems. Her friend Heather needed a blood transfusion and had burns to her face. The pair spent a short time in hospital together, but after that night lost touch and would never see each other again. Carol Pearce was pictured in the Birmingham Mail in hospital during a visit by the Duke of Edinburgh following the bombings The blast knocked Kevin Burgess off his feet. ""I called out for Carol, she answered, we got together, got ourselves up,"" he said. ""It was darkness, that's what made it surreal. The screams, people's voices of agony - you could see very little because it was all black and you were stumbling around."" ""We realised that the wall and pillar behind us had come straight down behind us and the back wall had been blown out, which in effect turned out to be the only way out as the stairs had blown up,"" remembers Carol Burgess. The pair started to help others out and were forced to climb over people, ""listening to the screams and making our way out of the pub"", Kevin said. They had suffered mostly superficial injuries - cuts, bruises and hearing loss - for which they were treated at the General Hospital. Forty-four years on, Carol and Kevin Burgess both remain wary of travelling into the city centre The blast had blown ""glass, wood and everything else"" into Les Robinson's body. His trousers were ripped off and the nylon jumper he was wearing had melted to his shoulder. ""I couldn't see a thing, obviously all the lights had blown,"" said Les, who worked as a Co-op Dairy plumber. ""We couldn't hear anything because of burst eardrums, the only thing that really worked was your smell. ""Although I didn't know it at the time, but it was the people who had been burned. My whole leg had been burned, all my hair had burned off, I could smell me, I could smell everyone and then I thought: 'I've got to get out of here'."" Despite his injuries, Les managed to make his way out of the pub and struggled the mile-and-a-half journey home, clinging to parking meters and cars to support him along the way. Les Robinson described the Tavern as ""simply the best pub in Birmingham"" Outside the Tavern there was ""uproar"". People staggered or were carried to the Magnum Hotel opposite, some screaming, some just waiting to be taken to hospital. But the realisation of what had happened was yet to hit them. ""I don't think anyone in the whole pub knew what it was,"" said Les. ""Last thing on my mind was a bomb, a terrorist bomb."" Carol Burgess added: ""We didn't quite believe it to start with. You know these things go on but you don't believe it could happen to you."" The victims of the 1974 bombings were aged between 16 and 51 A total of 21 people were killed by the two bombs. Nineteen died on the night - eight in the Mulberry Bush and nine in the Tavern in the Town. Two more died later from their injuries. The seven women and 14 men killed were aged between 16 and 51. Thirteen of the victims were under 30, including five in their teens. Some 44 years after the pub bombings, no-one has been convicted in connection with the atrocity. Six men were wrongly jailed but finally released in 1991. During the near 17 years they spent behind bars, the case of the Birmingham Six became infamous as one of the worst miscarriages of justice seen in Britain. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out the bombings - a third device was planted near the Barclays Bank on Hagley Road but failed to detonate properly. For the survivors, life has gone on, but the events of that night have never been forgotten. The Mulberry Bush pub underneath the Rotunda in 1974, and the site as it looks in 2019 Despite her injuries, Maureen slowly recovered and she and Ian married seven months later, although the couple would go on to divorce. ""You try not to let it make any difference to your life,"" she said. ""Our wedding was already planned so we carried on and got married seven months later and I suppose we just tried to get on with it, really, ""I've always tried not to be bitter because I always felt that being bitter wasn't helping me or anyone else."" The bombings made Maureen ""appreciate life more"" and she became involved with peace and reconciliation work. She suffered from survivor guilt, but said meeting others bereaved and affected by the Troubles had helped her cope. And while she bears the scars from her injuries ""physically they don't affect me in any way"", she said. Les Robinson sustained significant shrapnel injuries in the bombing of the Tavern in the Town For Les, now 67, the impact of that night means he cannot be anywhere near an unattended parcel. ""Even to this day it gives me the most uncomfortable feeling in the world. I will ask if I'm in a place with an unattended bag, I will ask whose is that bag and if I can't find out I'm out of there."" But he says the events enabled him to ""meet and marry the woman that I did"". ""Her name is Roz,"" he said. ""Roz was in there as well that night. We'd fell out so weren't really together - like all courting couples you have your moments - but it got us back together. ""From there we married, from there we had the two best daughters you want and a further three grandchildren. It made my life. The Tavern didn't take away anything from me, but it gave me everything."" A buffet restaurant now occupies the site of the former Tavern in the Town Carol and Kevin Burgess, who had been on one of their early dates, went on to marry. The bombings ""brought us closer together"", says Kevin. But 44 years on, both say they remain wary of travelling into the city centre. Over the years Kevin suffered flashbacks and found it difficult to accept that he escaped with relatively minor injuries. ""I was very, very lucky,"" he said. ""People lost arms, legs - died. Why wasn't it me? That's affected me over a number of years."" He added: ""The one thing that will always stick with me for the rest of my life is the smell of flesh, hair. That will never ever go from me."" Carol Pearce says she is grateful for the life she has lived Carol Pearce became a Christian ""that night"", she says. She later befriended a girl in her street and was a bridesmaid at her wedding. The best man was Roy Pearce - whom Carol, now 62, went on to marry. The couple have been married for 42 years. ""For me, everything changed because if I hadn't have been in the bombing I don't know what would have happened, but I certainly wouldn't have met Roy, but I did, so things changed dramatically,"" she said. The couple took over running a youth club and then she ran an arts and crafts charity and did play scheme work. While she did not go back to her job at Etams, and trips into the city centre became infrequent, in 2004 she would return to work in the centre of Birmingham as a receptionist at the National Trust's Back to Backs attraction, a ""big step"" that eventually gave her the confidence to travel into the city on her own. ""I've thoroughly enjoyed my life,"" she added. ""I'm grateful for the life I've got.""

Adler: Has Tusk found a solution?,"This video can not be played Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer: ""Brexit has been a strain on all of us"" ""Have you heard about the British party guest? He's the one who announces he's leaving, then you find him hours later wandering around the house with no money for a taxi. When he finally goes, he takes two bottles of wine with him."" European stereotype depictions tend to portray Germans as lacking a sense of humour. But in political cartoons and on satire shows like Extra 3, Germany is finding plenty to laugh about Brexit. ""Fisch und TschÃ¼ss"" is a slogan for the satirical news programme, The Heute [today] Show - a play on words for the traditional UK dish, fish and chips. Except TschÃ¼ss in German means goodbye. Chief whip attacks cabinet's Brexit strategy EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Brexit: A really simple guide After initially mourning the UK's vote to leave, then following every twist and turn of negotiations for a while, many Germans now feel alienated from the process. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (right) is very close to Angela Merkel (left) and is widely tipped to be the next German chancellor They can't keep up with what's going on in the House of Commons. ""I no longer care so much how Brexit ends,"" you often hear. ""As long as it ends."" ""Brexit has been a strain on all of us. In some ways it has paralysed us,"" Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told me in Berlin in a UK exclusive interview. She's the leader of Germany's CDU party, very close to Angela Merkel and widely tipped to be the next German chancellor. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer - also known as AKK - is far from detached when it comes to Brexit. She and a number of other German politicians penned a letter to the Times newspaper back in January, appealing to the UK to change its mind. Now, the EU's determined attempt to show unity at all times over Brexit means it has been frustratingly difficult to get EU leaders to agree to in-depth, on-the-record Brexit interviews . But AKK is not the German chancellor. She had no qualms about laying bare her Brexit regret. ""Anything that keeps the UK close to the EU and best of all, in the EU, would make me personally very happy"" she told me. ""Maybe that could result from the current talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn."" She hopes for a second referendum - but only, she said, if the majority of UK citizens felt it would heal the country rather than exacerbate divisions further. Remain supporters have been staging rallies in London With the deadline for a Brexit decision looming next week on 12 April, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer believes the risk of the UK leaving without a deal have ""risen dramatically"". This is something German business find no laughing matter. A recent poll suggested 100,000 German jobs could be affected by a no-deal Brexit. The BDI Federation of German Industry warned Germany would lose at least 0.5% of its GDP - and this at a time when the German economy is already heading south. That, I think, is why there is a sudden, noticeable softening in tone when EU leaders speak about Brexit. At a press conference in Dublin on Thursday, Chancellor Merkel struck a determinedly encouraging note. Instead of ""no-deal is the most likely scenario"" or ""if Theresa May requests a longer extension, we'll attach really tough conditions"", which we've got used to hearing by now, Mrs Merkel chose the words: ""Where there's a will, there's a way."" Peering into the abyss of a no-deal Brexit over the last few days, EU leaders have had a short, sharp reality check. What impact would that have on them and their countries, they wonder? And what are they be prepared to do to avoid it? There is no common EU position on this yet. That's putting it politely. Verbal fisticuffs are predicted at next week's emergency Brexit summit when the 27 EU leaders come face-to-face. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The man who represents all of them here in Brussels, President of the European Council Donald Tusk, thinks he may have found a solution. However, it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. He's proposing what he calls a ""flextension"", which could see the UK signing up to a one-year-long Brexit delay with the option to cut it short as soon as parliament ratified the Brexit deal. Mr Tusk believes the arrangement would suit the EU and the UK - and as one EU official put it to me, it would avoid Brussels potentially being faced with ""endless"" UK requests for repeated short extensions every few weeks. EU leaders will discuss Mr Tusk's proposal at next Wednesday's summit. By law, their decision must be unanimous. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer suggested something else the EU could do: take another look at the controversial backstop guarantee to keep the Irish border open after Brexit. ""If the UK now came to us and said, 'let's spend five days negotiating non-stop on how to avoid the backstop', I can't imagine anyone in Europe saying 'No'. If the UK had new watertight proposals for the border, I don't think anyone in the EU would say, 'We don't want to talk about it.'"" Far from official EU Brexit policy, but it gives us a taster of the kind of conversations going on behind closed EU political doors.

Delay not long enough - Sturgeon,"Ms Sturgeon met EU workers living in Scotland during a visit to a building site in Glasgow on Friday morning Scotland's first minister has called for a lengthy delay to Brexit to allow time for some ""sensible ways forward"" to be found. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 12 April - but has asked for this to be extended until 30 June. EU leaders must agree unanimously whether to grant the request when they meet next week. Nicola Sturgeon said the ""short-term"" extension would merely set up another ""cliff edge"". Prime Minister Theresa May made her extension request in a letter to the EU after her proposed Brexit deal suffered three defeats in the House of Commons in recent weeks. She has proposed that if a deal is approved in time, the UK should be able to leave before European Parliamentary elections on 23 May. UK seeks new Brexit delay until 30 June EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible Brexit delay' Adler: Has Tusk found a solution? What are the Brexit sticking points? The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU source that European Council President Donald Tusk will propose a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to Brexit, with the option of cutting it short if the UK Parliament ratifies a deal. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Ms Sturgeon accused Mrs May of ""yet more short-termism and the setting up potentially of another cliff edge"". It came as she published an open letter assuring EU nationals living in Scotland that ""this is your home, you are welcome here and we want you to stay"". Allow Twitter content?

The first minister said: ""The sensible thing to do in my view, and it seems as if this might be the EU's view as well, is to have a longer extension to allow time for this issue to go back to the people in another referendum rather than continue to have these short-term cliff edges. ""The first priority, of course, must be to avoid a no deal exit at the end of next week - but beyond that give some time and space now for some sensible ways forward to be found."" Ms Sturgeon also said she believed it was now ""more likely than not"" that the UK will hold European elections in May, which she predicted would give ""some protection"" against a no-deal Brexit. She said the election would give people the opportunity to ""come out and cast a positive vote for Scotland and the UK as an internationalist country wanting to continue to play our part in Europe"". Theresa May made the request for an extension to Brexit in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk Ms Sturgeon said her preference was still for the UK to remain in the EU, but if that is not possible then she and the SNP would ""promote alternatives"" such as membership of the single market and customs union. She also said remaining in the EU ""will always be an option for Scotland with independence"". The first ministerpledged in Januaryto give an update on her plans for a second independence referendum ""in the coming weeks"" even if the Brexit deadline was extended - but has still not done so. Ms Sturgeon said this was because there was ""still no clarity in the immediate term about which path the UK is going to take"", and added: "" I had hoped that we would be at that point by now, but unfortunately I underestimated the incompetence of the UK government"". In her letter, the prime minister says the ""impasse cannot be allowed to continue"", as it was ""creating uncertainty and doing damage to faith in politics"" in the UK. She said if cross-party talks with the Labour Party could not establish ""a single unified approach"" in the UK Parliament, MPs would be asked to vote on a series of options instead which the government ""stands ready to abide by"". She wrote that the UK proposed an extension to the process until 30 June and ""accepts the European Council's view that if the United Kingdom were still a member state of the European Union on 23 May 2019, it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections"". To this end, she says the UK is ""undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency"". But it said if a withdrawal agreement could be ratified by Parliament before then ""the government proposes that the period should be terminated early"" so the UK can leave the EU before then, and cancel preparations for the European Parliamentary elections.

"Fewer than half of firms narrow pay gapAcross 45% of UK firms the gender pay gap increased in favour of men, analysis by the BBC finds.Business","Fewer than half the UK's biggest employers have succeeded in narrowing their gender pay gap, analysis by the BBC has found. Across 45% of firms the discrepancy in pay increased in favour of men, while at a further 7% there was no change. Overall, 78% of companies had a pay gap in favour of men, 14% favoured women and the rest reported no difference. Firms had until midnight to file pay comparison data - by which time 10,428 had done so - or face legal action. Gender pay gap: Can it be fixed? Firms rush to meet gender pay deadline The total is roughly the same as last year, but it is unclear how many firms have failed to respond, since the government has no definitive list of companies required to file figures. Overall, the median pay gap in favour of men lowered slightly from 9.7% last year to 9.6% this year. The median pay gap is calculated by comparing the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and middle-ranking man in the same companies. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external By law, all companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it will take enforcement action against all firms that miss the deadline. It was unclear exactly how many companies had not reported, although it is thought about a quarter did so in the last 36 hours before the deadline. Ask gender pay specialists and they'll tell you there are many initiatives that companies can take - tackling unconscious bias, offering more flexible working and encouraging shared parental leave. But the issue doesn't end at the office door. The experts say society needs to change. Schools could encourage girls to take more STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths. There should be more flexible, affordable childcare options. And men could take on more of the household chores. But gender pay gap reporting may not be enough: the government may need to get tougher. Read more from Dharshini Among large firms reporting the biggest increases in pay gaps were garage chain Kwik Fit, Interserve FS (part of the Interserve Group), and car retailer Inchcape. Firms reporting the biggest improvement in narrowing the gap were Newsquest Media Group, Mitie, and DFDS Logistics. Large companies with the biggest gaps included Independent Vetcare at 48.3% (down from 50.5% last year) and EasyJet at 47.9% (45.5%). Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap at your company? Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of firms A spokesman for Interserve Group said: ""We are committed to addressing the issues on gender pay and through the leadership of our chief executive, Debbie White, we are making good progress."" A spokeswoman for Kwik Fit said it was committed to narrowing the gap and both recruit more female staff and promote from within. Easyjetsaid in March,externalthat the gap had widened from 45.5% as more female cabin crew had been recruited since the last pay snapshot. Most of the airline's pilots are male, and are more highly paid than cabin crew. The firm is making efforts to recruit more female pilots. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, described the figures as ""disappointing, but not surprising"". Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive, said: ""The regulations are not tough enough.  It's time for action plans, not excuses. ""Employers need to set out a five-year strategy for how they will close their gender pay gaps, monitoring progress and results. ""Government needs to require employers to publish action plans that we can hold them accountable to, with meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply."" Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive at the EHRC, said: ""The causes of the gender pay gap are complex and deeply entrenched. ""Meaningful change will take time and concerted effort, with some changes potentially increasing gaps in the short term, such as employing more women at junior levels before they rise into more senior positions. ""That is why it is vital that employers publish action plans to explain their figures and highlight where they will be targeting any inequality in their workplace."" Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you place all the men and women working at a company into two lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. The individual company data reflects information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the ""snapshot date"" - the previous year. 5 April is the snapshot date for businesses and charities. 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

"'You're a Gypsy - are you leaving school?'An MPs' committee hears about inequalities faced by Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children.","Teachers' ""entrenched"" attitudes could lead them to write off Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children, ""enabling prejudice to continue"", MPs have said. Throughout her time in education, one woman told the Women and Equalities Committee, teachers had said: ""You're a Gypsy - are you going to leave school?"" These children were underachieving, it said, and more likely to drop out or be temporarily or permanently excluded. And almost half of them were missing at least a month of lessons every year. The MPs' report said: ""Some Gypsy and Traveller children are taken out of school as early as the end of primary school, some persistently do not attend and some never register at school at all. ""Where these children end up is unclear, although we have heard of successful and unsuccessful home education, children starting work at as young as 10 years old, and children who simply stay at home without any formal education. ""Local authorities must serve a notice on parents they believe are not educating their children."" But the MPs acknowledged that many local authorities, despite their best efforts, were unable to reach children who may be missing from education. This video can not be played Traveller communities 'suffering discrimination' ""Consequently, there is very little, if any, oversight of how Gypsy and Traveller children are being educated at home,"" the report said. And, with three out of four of their families living in settled accommodation, most of them were not missing lessons because of time spent actually travelling. ""Parents have told us that they take their children out of education for reasons ranging from bullying that they experience in school, schools not taking their children's needs into account, and not seeing the relevance of education, to, most worryingly, feeling that schools do not educate their children in a way that they would find acceptable,"" the MPs said. Maria Miller, who chairs the committee, said these children had been comprehensively failed by policy-makers and public services. She said: ""The government must stop filing this under 'too difficult' and set out how it intends to improve health, education and other outcomes for these very marginalised communities who are all too often 'out of sight and out of mind'."" Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton urged all agencies to redouble their efforts over the education of Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children. But he said the reports of teachers making inappropriate remarks based on assumptions about pupils' backgrounds were ""anomalous and does not reflect the normal practice in schools, which is highly attuned to promoting an inclusive environment to children of all backgrounds"". ""Similarly, schools have robust policies in place to prevent bullying and discrimination and to act upon any incidents that occur.""

What are the sticking points?,"Cross-party talks between the Conservatives and Labour, aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock, are continuing. Theresa May has said she wants to negotiate a ""joint plan"" with Jeremy Corbyn. If that is agreed, it would then be put to MPs in the hope that a Brexit deal could finally be voted through Parliament. Both leaders have agreed a ""programme of work"" for their negotiating teams to work on. So, what are the main differences likely to be when it comes to Brexit and where might possible compromise be found? Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU - it's one of her so-called red lines. As a member of the European Union, the UK is part of the EU customs union. Its members have an agreement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around the area. This can be particularly advantageous for businesses whose goods cross multiple EU borders. But critics of the system say it has several drawbacks. For one, members of the customs union cannot negotiate their own trade deals, on goods, with other countries - such as the United States. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. As recently as 25 March, the prime minister rejected the idea of a customs union, saying it ""does not deliver on [an] independent trade policy"". Labour says it wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, after Brexit. But it also says it wants the UK to ""have a say"" when the EU strikes future trade deals. The level of UK involvement would depend on what Labour means by ""have a say"" but EU law currently prevents a non-EU member from influencing or vetoing its trade negotiations. But Labour says its policy cannot be ruled out until it has had a chance to negotiate this with the EU. Membership of the single market is another area where there are differences. The EU single market requires members to follow the same regulations and standards to keep trade flowing freely. It is based on four freedoms: goods, services, money and people (this last one allows EU citizens to live and work in the UK, and vice versa). When Theresa May first set out her Brexit negotiating objectives, she said failing to leave the single market ""would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all"". That's because the UK would have to continue to pay into the EU budget, follow all the rules, and continue to allow freedom of movement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Labour's policy, on the other hand, is to have ""close alignment with the single market"". But the EU has previously said the UK cannot cherry-pick only the parts of the single market it likes. So, it's unclear what the EU would accept as ""close alignment"", which Labour is calling for. Theresa May has always been firm that Brexit must mean the end to freedom of movement. In her 2017 election manifesto, she set out plans for an immigration system designed to ""reduce and control"" the number of people coming to the UK from the EU - and she hasn't wavered from this pledge. Like the Conservatives, Labour also pledged at the 2017 election to end freedom of movement. So, on the surface, this looks like something on which the two party leaders could agree. What is Labour customs union policy? What are the soft Brexit options? But in January, when it came to voting on the Immigration Bill, which would put an end to freedom of movement, Labour encouraged its MPs to vote against it. A big unknown is whether Labour's policy of ""close alignment"" with the single market might restrict the UK's ability to set its own immigration policy. Its Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer,previously told BBC Newsthe party would be willing to accept some EU workers but with restrictions. ""If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say, 'I accept that,'"" he said. A Labour spokesperson said: ""We support fair rules and the reasonable management of migration."" Theresa May has said she's made it clear in the political declaration - the part of her deal agreed with the EU concerning the future relationship - that the UK agrees to not going backwards in terms of workers' rights. But she has not guaranteed that when the EU introduces a new right or protection for workers, the UK will also adopt it. In Prime Minister's Questions last week, though, Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to use EU standards, including any introduced in the future, as a minimum for the UK to improve on. He accused the prime minister's deal of involving a ""race to the bottom"" on workers' rights - something he said Labour's proposals would prevent.

Will cross-party talks work?,"The Labour Party's negotiating team consists of Rebecca Long Bailey and Sir Keir Starmer plus officials It is almost the end of another very long and fractious week in Westminster (although their lordships look like they'll be going for quite some time yet). But the main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. I'm told there might be more contact tonight between the two sides, although not more face to face talks until Friday. Cross-party Brexit talks end after 4.5 hours What are the Brexit sticking points? Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' And there is scepticism in Labour circles over whether the government is doing more so far than trying to explain merits of its deal, rather than suggest areas where they might be willing to budge. Sources involved in the process suggest that there is yet to be the promise of a big move from Theresa May, a promise about the price she is willing to pay for Labour support. But the talks are not just a stunt and there are suggestions it might be clear by Friday afternoon, if the process will actually be able to deliver an outcome. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is part of the government's negotiating team Talks, as we know, often turn to more talks, and more talks, and more talks. You don't need me to remind you, when Theresa May has the option of playing something long, which choice she makes. There is, though, the obvious deadline of the prime minister's trip to Brussels next week, where she has to present something to her EU counterparts, in order to justify asking for another delay. But presenting something is not the same as having to deliver a fully worked-out deal with every ""i"" dotted, every ""t"" crossed. It would be an enormous political turnaround if a fully worked out cross-party compromise emerges by then, that can last. Will Labour push for a public vote? Labour chair offered to quit over Brexit How did my MP vote on Brexit options? But after months of Brussels pondering openly why the UK has not been able to work in a cross-party way, if Theresa May can show evidence that that process is under way, perhaps that will be enough. One cabinet minister suggested to me today that, if they can show there isn't a ""permanent standoff"" in Parliament between the two main parties, then the EU will give the UK more time. Don't forget though, behind the scenes, some Brexiteers are still trying to organise to push for departure from the EU next week. Labour has a problem too - a big split over whether they could accept compromise to deliver Brexit, without the promise of another referendum. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn may have a lot of gaps to bridge between them, but they have gaps among their own sides too.

House prices 'subdued' amid Brexit impasse,"UK house price growth will continue to be ""subdued"" during Brexit uncertainty - particularly in London, according to the Halifax. The UK's biggest mortgage lender said that property prices had fallen by 1.6% in March compared with the previous month. However, prices were 2.6% higher in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2018. It said the price of the average home was Â£233,181. A lack of activity from both buyers and sellers meant that prices were unlikely to fall sharply, the Halifax said. However, this meant it was still difficult for many potential first-time buyers to raise a deposit. ""These conflicting challenges, when combined with the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, have had an impact across the country but most notably in London, meaning that we continue to expect subdued price growth for the time being,"" said Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax. Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, said: ""For the past couple of years March was flagged up as the date when we would get Brexit [but] people have been too busy watching the political shenanigans on television to go out and view houses. ""The Brexit saga is such a debacle and until it gets sorted, one way or another, few people are going to do anything."" A week ago, rival lender the Nationwide said that UK house price in March were up 0.7% compared with the same month a year earlier, although property values in England had fallen over the same period.

EU's Tusk 'suggests flexible delay',"Donald Tusk's plan would need to be agreed by EU leaders European Council President Donald Tusk is proposing to offer the UK a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to its Brexit date, according to a senior EU source. His plan, which would need to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit next week, would allow the UK to leave sooner if Parliament ratifies a deal. The UK's Conservatives and Labour Party are set to continue Brexit talks later. Theresa May has written to Mr Tusk with the UK's request for a further delay to Brexit until 30 June. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by MPs. Downing Street said ""technical"" talks between Labour and the Conservatives on Thursday had been ""productive"" and would continue on Friday. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has told the BBC that if they fail, the delay is ""likely to be a long one"". Cross-party Brexit talks end after 4.5 hours Germany 'stands with Ireland' over Brexit Labour chair offered to quit over referendum vote Germany: CDU leader hopes for second referendum Prime Minister Theresa May has said a further postponement to the Brexit date is needed if the UK is to avoid leaving the EU without a deal, a scenario both EU leaders and many British MPs believe would create problems for businesses and cause difficulties at ports. OnWednesday, MPs voted- by a majority of one - in favour of a backbench bill which would force Mrs May to ask the EU for a further extension. However, the PM wants to keep any delay as short as possible. To do that, she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would need to agree a proposal for MPs to vote on before 10 April, when EU leaders are expected to consider any extension request at an emergency summit. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""We will be having further discussions with the government"" If they cannot, Mrs May has said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". Mr Cox told theBBC's Political Thinking podcastthat particular scenario would involve accepting whatever postponement the EU offered, which was likely to be ""longer than just a few weeks or months"". But Conservative Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin said the EU was ""toying"" with the UK and the PM was under no obligation to accept the terms of any extension, even if mandated to by MPs. ""The government just wants cover,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""They want an excuse to do what they are going to do anyway, which is to take us into some kind of extension. The British people don't want that."" But he said an extension of a year or so would be better than leaving on the terms agreed by the PM, accusing her of being ""pretty dishonest"" about her willingness to countenance a no-deal exit. Europe's leaders have been split over whether, and how, to grant any extension. However, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler has been told by a senior EU official that Mr Tusk ""believes he's come up with an answer"", after several hours of meetings in preparation for the summit. But his proposal would have to be agreed unanimously by EU leaders next week.The prime minister wrote to Mr Tusk,externalto request the extension ahead of Wednesday's meeting. You could almost hear the sound of collective eye-rolling across 27 European capitals after Theresa May requested a Brexit extension-time (till 30th June) that Brussels has already repeatedly rejected. Most EU leaders are leaning toward a longer Brexit delay to avoid being constantly approached by the PM for a rolling series of short extensions... with the threat of a no-deal Brexit always just around the corner. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, believes he has hit on a compromise solution: his ""flextension"", which would last a year with the UK able to walk away from it as soon as Parliament ratifies the Brexit deal. But EU leaders are not yet singing from the same hymn sheet on this. Expect closed-door political fireworks, although it's unclear whether it'll be a modest display or an all-out extravaganza - at their emergency Brexit summit next week. Under EU law, they have to hammer out a unanimous position. Read more from Katya Adler The EU has previously said that the UK must decide by 12 April whether it will stand candidates in May's European Parliamentary elections, or else the option of a long extension to Brexit would become impossible. Talks between Conservative ministers and Labour lasted nearly five hours on Thursday. Mr Corbyn has written to his MPs saying discussions included customs arrangements, single market alignment, internal security, the need for legal underpinning to any agreements and a ""confirmatory"" vote. The main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. Read more from Laura Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis told the BBC the party would not be talking to the government if a ""confirmatory referendum"" was not an option. But 25 Labour MPs - including a number representing Leave-voting seats - have written to Mr Corbyn, saying another referendum should not be included in any compromise Brexit deal. Asked whether another referendum on any final deal was a credible option, Mr Cox said: ""A good deal of persuasion might be needed to satisfy the government that a second referendum would be appropriate. But of course we will consider any suggestion that's made."" If the talks fail, the government faces an additional obstacle in the form of a backbench bill which would force the PM to seek a new delay. Passed by MPs by one vote on Wednesday, the bill is being scrutinised by the House of Lords, who will next consider the draft legislation on Monday. Ministers have argued it could increase ""the risk of an accidental no-deal"" in the event the EU agreed to an extension but argued for a different date than one specified by MPs. That would mean Mrs May having to bring the issue back to the Commons on 11 April, when European leaders would have returned home, the prime minister's spokesman said. After ameeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin,German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country still hoped for an ""orderly Brexit"". Angela Merkel visited Dublin for the first time in five years ""We will do everything in order to prevent... Britain crashing out of the European Union,"" she said.

Can cross-party talks make headway?,"The Labour Party's negotiating team consists of Rebecca Long Bailey and Sir Keir Starmer plus officials It is almost the end of another very long and fractious week in Westminster (although their lordships look like they'll be going for quite some time yet). But the main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. I'm told there might be more contact tonight between the two sides, although not more face to face talks until Friday. Cross-party Brexit talks end after 4.5 hours What are the Brexit sticking points? Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' And there is scepticism in Labour circles over whether the government is doing more so far than trying to explain merits of its deal, rather than suggest areas where they might be willing to budge. Sources involved in the process suggest that there is yet to be the promise of a big move from Theresa May, a promise about the price she is willing to pay for Labour support. But the talks are not just a stunt and there are suggestions it might be clear by Friday afternoon, if the process will actually be able to deliver an outcome. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is part of the government's negotiating team Talks, as we know, often turn to more talks, and more talks, and more talks. You don't need me to remind you, when Theresa May has the option of playing something long, which choice she makes. There is, though, the obvious deadline of the prime minister's trip to Brussels next week, where she has to present something to her EU counterparts, in order to justify asking for another delay. But presenting something is not the same as having to deliver a fully worked-out deal with every ""i"" dotted, every ""t"" crossed. It would be an enormous political turnaround if a fully worked out cross-party compromise emerges by then, that can last. Will Labour push for a public vote? Labour chair offered to quit over Brexit How did my MP vote on Brexit options? But after months of Brussels pondering openly why the UK has not been able to work in a cross-party way, if Theresa May can show evidence that that process is under way, perhaps that will be enough. One cabinet minister suggested to me today that, if they can show there isn't a ""permanent standoff"" in Parliament between the two main parties, then the EU will give the UK more time. Don't forget though, behind the scenes, some Brexiteers are still trying to organise to push for departure from the EU next week. Labour has a problem too - a big split over whether they could accept compromise to deliver Brexit, without the promise of another referendum. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn may have a lot of gaps to bridge between them, but they have gaps among their own sides too.

Labour wins Newport West by-electionUnion official Ruth Jones wins the seat which was vacated by the death of Labour veteran Paul Flynn.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Ruth Jones wants to reconnect with the people who did not vote Labour has held on to the Newport West parliamentary seat with a reduced majority following a by-election. Union official Ruth Jones won the south Wales seat, which fell vacant with thedeath of veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn in February. Labour saw its majority over the Conservatives fall to 1,951 from 5,658 at the 2017 general election. Mr Flynn had held the seat since 1987. Eleven candidates stood, with the 37% turnout higher than some had predicted. In her victory speech, Ms Jones, 56, said the by-election had taken place because of ""the sad passing of Paul Flynn, our friend"". ""There have been many tributes to him over the weeks but one saying stood out to me - 'everyone knew somebody who was helped by Paul Flynn',"" she said. Lion Mama: The woman who fought off her daughterâs rapists Sala pilot 'not qualified to fly at night' The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill ""These words have been an inspiration to me throughout the campaign.  That's what we're here for - to do our best to help others."" She added: ""Now that you've elected me to go to Parliament, I will do what I promise to do on the doorstep: I will stand up for the people, the jobs and the economy of Newport West."" Renew candidate June Davies (left) and Neil Hamilton of UKIP congratulate Ruth Jones Born and brought up in the constituency, Ms Jones, a NHS physiotherapist, has been a full-time union official with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy since 2016. She stood as the Labour candidate in Monmouth at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. ""Who knows what the next few days, weeks and months will bring,"" she added. ""But what I do know is that people have had enough after a decade of austerity."" ""They've had enough of cuts that have taken police off our streets, they've had enough of being made to feel worthless by universal credit and the bedroom tax. If I'm going to parliament it's with those people in my heart and Newport in my mind."" Newport West by-election: As it happened The result saw a swing from Labour to the Conservative of 2.4%. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Ms Jones would be a ""fantastic successor to Paul Flynn and will take up the tireless work he carried out for this community"". ""Tonight's result sends a clear message that the people of Newport and Wales are fed up of austerity which has robbed the Welsh economy of Â£1bn through needless cuts and shows support for Labour's alternative,"" he added. Conservative candidate Matthew Evans said he had ""never seen such anger and frustration"" on the doorstep as what he encountered over Brexit. ""People just want clarity and I've seen no appetite for another referendum or a general election,"" he said. Ruth Jones with her husband David after her win UKIP candidate Neil Hamilton, an AM for the party, came third with 2,023 votes. He campaigned saying the by-election was a chance to send a message to Westminster over its handling of the UK's departure from the EU. He said: ""To nearly quadruple our vote, I regard a success in itself even though we didn't win the election. ""I regard this as the start of a new era for my party and I look forward to the next election, whenever that may come."" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor This is a good hold for Labour and Ruth Jones will be pleased to be heading for Westminster with a majority of nearly 2,000 at a time of such an unpredictability. The Conservatives will be pleased to have held off the UKIP challenge for second place when the UK government is under such pressure over Brexit. But UKIP is taking encouragement from a vote share of more than 8%, which would be their baseline for keeping a presence in the Senedd at the next Welsh Assembly elections. What happened in this by-election should not be taken as a barometer for for future elections - politics is a rollercoaster right now. Ruth Jones will need to fasten her seat belt.

"Fatal fight 'should never have taken place'An inquiry into the death of Mike Towell says the boxer was not ""open and honest"" with doctors about a medical condition.Tayside and Central Scotland","Mike Towell died in hospital the day after the Glasgow fight in 2016 A Dundee boxer died following a fight that ""should never have taken place"", a fatal accident inquiry has concluded. Mike Towell died the day after losing in the fifth round to Welsh fighter Dale Evans in September 2016. The inquiry said,externalif he had been ""open and honest"" about a medical condition it was ""highly likely"" he would not have been allowed to box from 2014. It said the boxing governing body's rules were vulnerable to the concealing of relevant information by fighters. The 25-year-old, known as ""Iron Mike"" Towell, was diagnosed with severe bleeding and swelling to his brain following the 2016 fight in Glasgow. He was given medical treatment in the ring before being taken to hospital, but died 24 hours later. The inquiry was told that Mr Towellhad been advised by doctors not to boxthree years earlier after suspected seizures. It also heard details of his medical examinations with a qualified doctor appointed by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The notes showed that Mr Towell had said in the examinations that he had not suffered from headaches, blackouts or fits. The inquiry recommended: The BBBC should send a copy of each boxer's latest medical examination form to their GP It should seek confirmation from the GP or medical professional that the information is ""complete and accurate"" The GP should provide details of any relevant medical history of the boxer which may be relevant to his fitness to box. In his written judgement, Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull said: ""Regrettably, it appears that Mr Towell's love of boxing caused him to ignore the advice of doctors and not to accept the medical condition he had been diagnosed as suffering from. ""It is hard not to conclude that the very drive and commitment to boxing which Mr Towell demonstrated in his ascent to a final eliminator contest for the British welterweight championship in only his thirteenth professional fight is what led to his untimely death."" The sheriff concluded that the 2016 fight against Mr Evans ""should never have taken place"". He said: ""Had Mr Towell been open and honest with the doctors who carried out his annual BBBC medical examinations, it is highly likely that he would not have been licensed to box from at least 2014 onwards. ""Indeed, it is possible, although not certain, that he may never have been licensed to box professionally."" Sheriff Turnbull said he imagined that Mr Evans, who did not give evidence at the inquiry, would be haunted by the events ""for the rest of his life"". He said: ""Whilst I am sure that it will be of little comfort to him, it is important to record that Mr Evans is blameless.""

Sally Challen admits killing husband,"Sally Challen denies murdering her husband Richard in 2010 A woman whose sons campaigned against her conviction for murdering her husband has been released from prison ahead of a fresh trial. Sally Challen, 65, was found guilty of murdering 61-year-old Richard in a hammer attack in August 2010 and jailed for life in 2011. The conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in February. Appearing at the Old Bailey via video-link earlier, Mrs Challen, of Claygate in Surrey, denied murder. Mrs Challen wept in court as Mr Justice Edis granted bail and several hours later was released from HMP Bronzefield, Surrey. The judge set a further hearing for 7 June and a trial date for 1 July ""if necessary"". Sally Challen's son David (left) said earlier that his mother leaving prison would be a ""massive moment"" The appeal followed a campaign by her sons David, 31, and James, 35. Speaking outside court earlier, David said the family was looking forward to ""being together again after so long"". He said: ""We are overjoyed that bail has been granted for our mother and she will be now released back to us. Our mother now rejoins our family."" Mrs Challen's brother Chris Jenney added: ""The family are all supporting Sally. We have done from day one. Our strength's built and will build even further."" Sally and Richard Challen had two sons and had been married for 31 years During the two-day appeal hearing in February, the court heard evidence relating to Mrs Challen's state of mind at the time of the killing and the issue of ""coercive control"". Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. The murder conviction was overturned by three judges who said the evidence of a psychiatrist, that Mrs Challen was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing, was not available at the time of her trial and undermined the safety of her conviction. Lawyers for Mrs Challen, who has never denied killing her husband, asked for the murder conviction to be substituted to manslaughter but the panel of judges refused and ordered a retrial. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the conviction was quashed, David said: ""The abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account.""

Video app TikTok fails to remove online predators,"Video-sharing app TikTok is failing to suspend the accounts of people sending sexual messages to teenagers and children, a BBC investigation has found. Hundreds of sexually explicit comments have been found on videos posted by children as young as nine. While the company deleted the majority of these comments when they were reported, most users who posted them were able to remain on the platform, despite TikTok's rules against sexual messages directed at children. The BBC collected and reported hundreds of sexually explicit comments TikTok says that child protection is an ""industry wide-challenge"" and that promoting a ""safe and positive app environment"" remains the company's top priority. England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says she will request a meeting with TikTok to discuss the findings of the BBC's investigation. ""I want children to be able to enjoy everything that the app can offer, but we need to make sure that those responsibilities are taken seriously,"" she says. TikTok has become hugely popular with teenagers. It allows people to post short videos of themselves lip-syncing and dancing to their favourite songs, performing short comedy skits or completing challenges. The company says it has more than 500 million monthly active users around the world, but TikTok refused to tell the BBC how many of those are in the UK. TikTok ran a huge advertising campaign in the UK earlier this year Over three months,BBC Trendingcollected hundreds of sexual comments posted on videos uploaded by teenagers and children. We reported the comments to TikTok using the same tools available to any user of the app. The language used ranged from sexually suggestive to extremely explicit TikTok's community guidelines,externalforbid users from using ""public posts or private messages to harass underage users"" and say that if the company becomes ""aware of content that sexually exploits, targets, or endangers children"" it may ""alert law enforcement or report cases"". While the majority of sexual comments were removed within 24 hours of being reported, TikTok still failed to remove a number of messages that were clearly inappropriate for children. And even though many of the comments themselves were taken down, the vast majority of accounts that had sent sexual messages were still active on the app. The NSPCC has aseries of guidelines about keeping children safe online,external They promote the acronymTEAM:Talk about staying safe online;Explore the online world together;Agree rules about what's OK and what's not; andManage your family's settings and controls. There are even more resources on theBBC Stay Safe site. The BBC was also able to identity a number of users who, again and again, approached teenage girls online to post sexually explicit messages on their videos. Some users repeated their sexual comments across a number of TikTok videos ""These are individuals who are using these platforms to try to get access in some way to young children,"" says Ms Longfield, the children's commissioner. While many users hide behind anonymous profiles to send disturbing messages, others (often adult men) use what appear to be their real names and photos and upload their own videos on the app. Some users tried to lure children with offers of holidays And while our investigation focused on sexually explicit comments, we also found instances where children were sent threatening or violent messages. The BBC has also come across misogynist, racist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic messages on TikTok Chris has a 10-year-old son who went on TikTok in January, without his parents' knowledge. One day, TikTok messages began popping up on his son's phone. ""They were like 'do not ignore me', swearing... 'I know who you are and I'll come and get you',"" Chris recalls. The sender was an adult male. While he had not included any sexual content in his messages, Chris wonders: ""If [my son] had started engaging in conversation, what could have been next?"" Chris has since deleted the app from his son's phone and informed his school of the incident. ""It's disgusting,"" he says. ""TikTok's got a responsibility now and if people are getting on there and seeing messages like this should be contacting the police at the very least."" YouTube child protection mechanism 'failing' Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external ""I hunt trolls"" TikTok: Where gummy bears singing Adele rule online Emily Steers and Lauren Kearns, from Northamptonshire, are both 15 years old. Together, they run a TikTok channel with more than a million followers. Emily and Lauren dancing as they film themselves on TikTok ""People come up to us and ask for pictures... It's really weird"", Lauren says. They say most of the messages they get from their fans online are harmless, but among the hundreds of comments posted on their videos, we also found sexual messages. As part of our investigation, we reported one of them to TikTok, but after 24 hours the company had failed to take down the comment or remove the user who posted it. ""It is a bit worrying,"" says Emily's father, Mark. ""When they do catch people saying bad things or sexual things, they should have the power to block them or actually take them away straightaway."" Emily's dad, Mark, says he won't let his daughter go on TikTok without supervision until she's older More from BBC Trending Download our podcast - from the BBC World Service Earlier this year,TikTok was hit with a $5.7m (Â£4.3m) finein the US after it was found to have illegally collected personal information of children under 13 who had been using the app. The case highlighted how easy it had become for young children to join TikTok, despite the company'sterms of use,externalwhich say that 13 is the minimum age to join the platform. As a result of the fine, TikTok has been asking some users in the US to verify their age by sending the company identification. In the course of our investigation, the BBC came across several accounts run by children under 13 - some as young as nine. TikTok has no plans to start verifying the age of users in the UK. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC it is investigating TikTok, but did not provide further details about the focus of their investigation. And in India,a court ruling on Wednesday asked the government to ban TikTok,externalbecause of concerns about ""pornography"" and child protection. Children under age 13 use TikTok despite the company's rules ""We need to have robust age verification tools in place,"" says Damian Collins MP, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. ""The age policies are meaningless if they don't have the ability to really check whether people are the age or not. ""We've been discussing content regulation with a number of different social media companies and will certainly be taking a good look at what's been happening at TikTok,"" he says. Damian Collins: ""This is really serious abuse and it needs to be stopped."" TikTok declined the BBC's request for an interview. In a statement, the company said: ""We are committed to continuously enhancing our existing measures and introducing additional technical and moderation processes in our ongoing commitment to our users."" ""We take escalating actions ranging from restricting certain features up to banning account access, based on the frequency and severity of the reported content. In addition, we have multiple proactive approaches that look for potentially problematic behaviour and take action including terminating accounts that violate our Terms of Service."" TikTok says it uses a combination of technology and human moderation to remove content. The company refused to say how many moderators it employs. The Children's Commissioner for England told the BBC that she will seek a meeting with TikTok to discuss the findings of our investigation. And she also says parents have a key role to play in keeping their children safe online. Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says she will write to the company ""So much is often hid in the comments for many of these things and that's actually where the danger can lie,"" Anne Longfield says. ""Be very proactive, complain about it to the company and demand action.""

"One drink a day 'increases stroke risk'This goes against previous claims that moderate drinking might protect the heart, researchers say.HealthComments","Even light-to-moderate drinking increases blood pressure and the chances of having a stroke, according to a large genetic study in The Lancet, countering previous claims that one or two drinks a day could be protective. The UK and Chinese researchers followed 500,000 Chinese people for 10 years. They say the findings are relevant to all populations and the best evidence yet on the direct effects of alcohol. Experts said people should limit their alcohol consumption. It is already known that heavy drinking is harmful to health and increases stroke risk - but some studies have suggesteddrinking small amounts can be good for the health, while others indicate there isno safe level of alcohol consumption. The researchers, from the University of Oxford, Peking University and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, found that: drinking one to two alcoholic drinks every day increased stroke risk by 10-15% drinking four drinks every day increased the risk of having a stroke by 35% For the purposes of their study, one drink was defined as either: a small glass of wine a bottle of beer a single measure of spirits About 16 in 100 men and 20 in 100 women will have a stroke in their lifetime in the UK. So, if a group of 100 non-drinkers started drinking a glass or two every day, there would be an extra two strokes - a small increase. According to Prof David Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, that's an increase in total stroke risk of 38% for every half a bottle of wine drunk per day. He said: ""It is very roughly the opposite effect of taking a statin"", which are drugs prescribed by doctors to help lower cholesterol levels in the blood and prevent heart attacks and strokes. The study,externalalso found no evidence of light or moderate drinking having a protective effect, in other words, reducing the risk of stroke. When it came to the effect of alcohol on heart attack risk, the researchers said the effects were not clear cut and more data needed to be collected over the next few years. ""Claims that wine and beer have magical protective effects is not borne out,"" said study author Prof Richard Peto, professor of medical statistics and epidemiology at the University of Oxford. How many cigarettes in a bottle of wine? East Asian countries are useful places to study the effects of alcohol. Many people with Chinese ancestry have a combination of genes that puts them off drinking alcohol. It causes an unpleasant reaction and makes them feel unwell. As a result, there is a wide variation of alcohol intake in China - one in three men doesn't drink and very few women do. But by comparing the health outcomes of drinkers and non-drinkers according to their genetic profile, scientists say they have been able to assess - with much more certainty than before - the direct effects of alcohol on stroke risk, distinct from any other factors. Western populations don't possess these genes, so it would be impossible to carry out a similar study here. And most studies are observational, which makes it's difficult to judge which factor is causing what effect. Dr Iona Millwood, study author and senior epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, said: ""Our genetic analyses have helped us understand the cause and effect relationships."" The researchers say their key message is that there is now clear evidence of no protective effect of moderate drinking on stroke. That means drinking even small amounts of alcohol each day can increase the chances of having a stroke. This is reflected in the current UK guidance -which advises a limit of 14 units of alcohol a week, with several alcohol-free days to keep health risks low. Dr Stephen Burgess, from the University of Cambridge, said there were some limitations to the study - that it only looked at a Chinese population and focused mainly on the drinking of spirits and beer, not wine. But he said the research reflected the culmination of many years of research into the impact of alcohol consumption. ""It strongly suggests that there is no cardiovascular benefit of light drinking and that risk of stroke increases even with moderate light alcohol consumption,"" he said. ""Risk of stroke increases proportionally with the amount of alcohol consumed, so if people do choose to drink, then they should limit their alcohol consumption."" Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said the study didn't answer every question. ""It has certainly advanced what we know about the role of alcohol in some diseases but it can't be the last word,"" he said. ""The new study doesn't tie down exactly how alcohol works to increase stroke risk but doesn't appear to increase heart attack risk."" Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk, at the University of Cambridge, said the study was making him waver. ""I have always been reasonably convinced that moderate alcohol consumption was protective for cardiovascular disease, but now I am having my doubts,"" he said.

"Woman admits killing husbandSally Challen, whose murder conviction was quashed, is granted bail after pleading guilty to manslaughter.Surrey","Sally Challen denies murdering her husband Richard in 2010 A woman whose sons campaigned against her conviction for murdering her husband has been released from prison ahead of a fresh trial. Sally Challen, 65, was found guilty of murdering 61-year-old Richard in a hammer attack in August 2010 and jailed for life in 2011. The conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in February. Appearing at the Old Bailey via video-link earlier, Mrs Challen, of Claygate in Surrey, denied murder. Mrs Challen wept in court as Mr Justice Edis granted bail and several hours later was released from HMP Bronzefield, Surrey. The judge set a further hearing for 7 June and a trial date for 1 July ""if necessary"". Sally Challen's son David (left) said earlier that his mother leaving prison would be a ""massive moment"" The appeal followed a campaign by her sons David, 31, and James, 35. Speaking outside court earlier, David said the family was looking forward to ""being together again after so long"". He said: ""We are overjoyed that bail has been granted for our mother and she will be now released back to us. Our mother now rejoins our family."" Mrs Challen's brother Chris Jenney added: ""The family are all supporting Sally. We have done from day one. Our strength's built and will build even further."" Sally and Richard Challen had two sons and had been married for 31 years During the two-day appeal hearing in February, the court heard evidence relating to Mrs Challen's state of mind at the time of the killing and the issue of ""coercive control"". Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. The murder conviction was overturned by three judges who said the evidence of a psychiatrist, that Mrs Challen was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing, was not available at the time of her trial and undermined the safety of her conviction. Lawyers for Mrs Challen, who has never denied killing her husband, asked for the murder conviction to be substituted to manslaughter but the panel of judges refused and ordered a retrial. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the conviction was quashed, David said: ""The abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account.""

'You're a Gypsy - are you leaving school?',"Teachers' ""entrenched"" attitudes could lead them to write off Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children, ""enabling prejudice to continue"", MPs have said. Throughout her time in education, one woman told the Women and Equalities Committee, teachers had said: ""You're a Gypsy - are you going to leave school?"" These children were underachieving, it said, and more likely to drop out or be temporarily or permanently excluded. And almost half of them were missing at least a month of lessons every year. The MPs' report said: ""Some Gypsy and Traveller children are taken out of school as early as the end of primary school, some persistently do not attend and some never register at school at all. ""Where these children end up is unclear, although we have heard of successful and unsuccessful home education, children starting work at as young as 10 years old, and children who simply stay at home without any formal education. ""Local authorities must serve a notice on parents they believe are not educating their children."" But the MPs acknowledged that many local authorities, despite their best efforts, were unable to reach children who may be missing from education. This video can not be played Traveller communities 'suffering discrimination' ""Consequently, there is very little, if any, oversight of how Gypsy and Traveller children are being educated at home,"" the report said. And, with three out of four of their families living in settled accommodation, most of them were not missing lessons because of time spent actually travelling. ""Parents have told us that they take their children out of education for reasons ranging from bullying that they experience in school, schools not taking their children's needs into account, and not seeing the relevance of education, to, most worryingly, feeling that schools do not educate their children in a way that they would find acceptable,"" the MPs said. Maria Miller, who chairs the committee, said these children had been comprehensively failed by policy-makers and public services. She said: ""The government must stop filing this under 'too difficult' and set out how it intends to improve health, education and other outcomes for these very marginalised communities who are all too often 'out of sight and out of mind'."" Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton urged all agencies to redouble their efforts over the education of Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children. But he said the reports of teachers making inappropriate remarks based on assumptions about pupils' backgrounds were ""anomalous and does not reflect the normal practice in schools, which is highly attuned to promoting an inclusive environment to children of all backgrounds"". ""Similarly, schools have robust policies in place to prevent bullying and discrimination and to act upon any incidents that occur.""

Does UK need to hold European polls?,"It is becoming a key question in this complex Brexit process. If the UK was to request, or be offered, a lengthy extension of its membership of the European Union (EU), would there be an obligation to take part in May's European elections? Both the UK government and the European Commission (EC) say that there would; but legal opinion is divided, and many lawyers argue that a satisfactory fix could be found. The elections are taking place between 23 and 26 May, although the new parliament will not sit, and new members will not be sworn in, until  2 July. That is why it has been argued thatan extension of Article 50 until the end of Junewould not prove to be a problem. But what about a much longer extension - potentially as long as 21 months until the end of 2020? That takes the debate into much trickier legal and political territory. The issue has taken on renewed relevance afterthe President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, wrote in a tweet,externalthat he will appeal to the 27 other EU leaders over the next few days ""to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy"". Theresa May has indicated that she would only favour a ""short technical extension"" to the UK's EU membership, if that was necessary in order to turn a last-minute agreement into law. But a longer extension, she told MPs, ""would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019"". Yes - as the ""guardian of the treaties"", the Commission has strong views on this. In a letter to Mr Tusk on March 11,,externalJean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said that if the UK is still part of the EU at the end of May ""it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all Member States as set out in the Treaties"". There is no question that the UK would be in breach of those treaty obligations if it failed to hold elections. But how much would that matter, if the UK was on a path out of the EU anyway? That is an unresolved debate that may eventually have to be tested in court. A legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag's Europe Department says that Article 50 cannot be extended beyond the end of May unless the UK holds elections. It suggests that the European Commission might choose to begin treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying the vote to UK or EU citizens in the UK. The UK'sDepartment for Exiting the European Union argues,externalthat the UK would have to take part in the elections because ""the EU Treaties provide that EU citizens have the right to be represented"" and the European Parliament ""needs to be properly constitutedâ¦ with duly elected representatives from all Member States"" in order to perform its functions. How can Article 50 be extended? Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? But others disagree. A confidential legal opinion, written by the European Parliament's own legal service and seen by the BBC, argues that the new parliament could be legally constituted even if the UK had not taken part in the elections. ""The potential infringement by a Member State of its duties and responsibilities under the Treaties and the Electoral Act cannot amount,"" the opinion says, ""to an absolute bar to the regular functioning of the Institution."" If the UK didn't take part in the elections, there would be considerable concern about legal challenges, either from those who might argue that their right to be represented was being denied, or from those who might argue that the UK was paying money into the EU budget without receiving all the benefits. But representation is not necessarily the same thing as holding elections. When countries join the EU, there have been periods when national MPs have been appointed to serve as representatives in the European Parliament until the next European elections take place. This happened with Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. Could a similar temporary measure apply as an existing EU member seeks to leave? Perhaps. Another alternative that has been suggested is that the UK's current MEPs could continue to sit in the next European Parliament until the end of the Article 50 period, or they could be granted some form of observer status. All of this is uncharted legal territory. Jean-Claude Juncker says the UK ""will be legally required to hold these elections"" if it is still part of the EU at the end of May But the UK's most senior lawyer at the European Court of Justice, Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston, seems convinced that a solution can be found. There would be a need, she wrote on Twitter, ""to arrange for British MEPs to sit in the new (parliament) as additional members on a temporary 'Brexit-limited' basis"". Any suggestion that the European elections represent an ""insuperable obstacle"" to a longer extension of Article 50 is, she added, ""an oversimplified and ultimately fallacious presentation of the facts"". Ms Sharpston emphasised that she was writing in a personal capacity, but her opinion clearly carries some weight. ""If the political will to agree a longer extension of Article 50 is there, she concluded, ""a legal mechanism can be found to accommodate that desire and 'deal with' the issue of the EP elections."" A legal solution could be found within Article 50 itself. It is already being used to offer the UK an extensive transition period after Brexit, even though it does not mention transition explicitly. ""An argument could be made that extending existing MEPs also qualifies as a transitional arrangement,"" says Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, ""The formal position is that the UK would need to hold elections,"" Prof Barnard says. ""But it is likely that those MEPs would only serve for a maximum of two years, so it would be in the interest of both sides to find a creative solution. ""One possibility is to see how far Article 50 can be stretched."" Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external How does another Brexit delay work?

Kuenssberg: Can cross-party talks get anywhere?,"The Labour Party's negotiating team consists of Rebecca Long Bailey and Sir Keir Starmer plus officials It is almost the end of another very long and fractious week in Westminster (although their lordships look like they'll be going for quite some time yet).

Germany finds plenty to laugh about Brexit,"This video can not be played Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer: ""Brexit has been a strain on all of us"" ""Have you heard about the British party guest? He's the one who announces he's leaving, then you find him hours later wandering around the house with no money for a taxi. When he finally goes, he takes two bottles of wine with him."" European stereotype depictions tend to portray Germans as lacking a sense of humour. But in political cartoons and on satire shows like Extra 3, Germany is finding plenty to laugh about Brexit. ""Fisch und TschÃ¼ss"" is a slogan for the satirical news programme, The Heute [today] Show - a play on words for the traditional UK dish, fish and chips. Except TschÃ¼ss in German means goodbye. Chief whip attacks cabinet's Brexit strategy EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Brexit: A really simple guide After initially mourning the UK's vote to leave, then following every twist and turn of negotiations for a while, many Germans now feel alienated from the process. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (right) is very close to Angela Merkel (left) and is widely tipped to be the next German chancellor They can't keep up with what's going on in the House of Commons. ""I no longer care so much how Brexit ends,"" you often hear. ""As long as it ends."" ""Brexit has been a strain on all of us. In some ways it has paralysed us,"" Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told me in Berlin in a UK exclusive interview. She's the leader of Germany's CDU party, very close to Angela Merkel and widely tipped to be the next German chancellor. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer - also known as AKK - is far from detached when it comes to Brexit. She and a number of other German politicians penned a letter to the Times newspaper back in January, appealing to the UK to change its mind. Now, the EU's determined attempt to show unity at all times over Brexit means it has been frustratingly difficult to get EU leaders to agree to in-depth, on-the-record Brexit interviews . But AKK is not the German chancellor. She had no qualms about laying bare her Brexit regret. ""Anything that keeps the UK close to the EU and best of all, in the EU, would make me personally very happy"" she told me. ""Maybe that could result from the current talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn."" She hopes for a second referendum - but only, she said, if the majority of UK citizens felt it would heal the country rather than exacerbate divisions further. Remain supporters have been staging rallies in London With the deadline for a Brexit decision looming next week on 12 April, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer believes the risk of the UK leaving without a deal have ""risen dramatically"". This is something German business find no laughing matter. A recent poll suggested 100,000 German jobs could be affected by a no-deal Brexit. The BDI Federation of German Industry warned Germany would lose at least 0.5% of its GDP - and this at a time when the German economy is already heading south. That, I think, is why there is a sudden, noticeable softening in tone when EU leaders speak about Brexit. At a press conference in Dublin on Thursday, Chancellor Merkel struck a determinedly encouraging note. Instead of ""no-deal is the most likely scenario"" or ""if Theresa May requests a longer extension, we'll attach really tough conditions"", which we've got used to hearing by now, Mrs Merkel chose the words: ""Where there's a will, there's a way."" Peering into the abyss of a no-deal Brexit over the last few days, EU leaders have had a short, sharp reality check. What impact would that have on them and their countries, they wonder? And what are they be prepared to do to avoid it? There is no common EU position on this yet. That's putting it politely. Verbal fisticuffs are predicted at next week's emergency Brexit summit when the 27 EU leaders come face-to-face. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The man who represents all of them here in Brussels, President of the European Council Donald Tusk, thinks he may have found a solution. However, it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. He's proposing what he calls a ""flextension"", which could see the UK signing up to a one-year-long Brexit delay with the option to cut it short as soon as parliament ratified the Brexit deal. Mr Tusk believes the arrangement would suit the EU and the UK - and as one EU official put it to me, it would avoid Brussels potentially being faced with ""endless"" UK requests for repeated short extensions every few weeks. EU leaders will discuss Mr Tusk's proposal at next Wednesday's summit. By law, their decision must be unanimous. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer suggested something else the EU could do: take another look at the controversial backstop guarantee to keep the Irish border open after Brexit. ""If the UK now came to us and said, 'let's spend five days negotiating non-stop on how to avoid the backstop', I can't imagine anyone in Europe saying 'No'. If the UK had new watertight proposals for the border, I don't think anyone in the EU would say, 'We don't want to talk about it.'"" Far from official EU Brexit policy, but it gives us a taster of the kind of conversations going on behind closed EU political doors.

The Brexit sticking points?,"Cross-party talks between the Conservatives and Labour, aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock, are continuing. Theresa May has said she wants to negotiate a ""joint plan"" with Jeremy Corbyn. If that is agreed, it would then be put to MPs in the hope that a Brexit deal could finally be voted through Parliament. Both leaders have agreed a ""programme of work"" for their negotiating teams to work on. So, what are the main differences likely to be when it comes to Brexit and where might possible compromise be found? Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU - it's one of her so-called red lines. As a member of the European Union, the UK is part of the EU customs union. Its members have an agreement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around the area. This can be particularly advantageous for businesses whose goods cross multiple EU borders. But critics of the system say it has several drawbacks. For one, members of the customs union cannot negotiate their own trade deals, on goods, with other countries - such as the United States. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. As recently as 25 March, the prime minister rejected the idea of a customs union, saying it ""does not deliver on [an] independent trade policy"". Labour says it wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, after Brexit. But it also says it wants the UK to ""have a say"" when the EU strikes future trade deals. The level of UK involvement would depend on what Labour means by ""have a say"" but EU law currently prevents a non-EU member from influencing or vetoing its trade negotiations. But Labour says its policy cannot be ruled out until it has had a chance to negotiate this with the EU. Membership of the single market is another area where there are differences. The EU single market requires members to follow the same regulations and standards to keep trade flowing freely. It is based on four freedoms: goods, services, money and people (this last one allows EU citizens to live and work in the UK, and vice versa). When Theresa May first set out her Brexit negotiating objectives, she said failing to leave the single market ""would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all"". That's because the UK would have to continue to pay into the EU budget, follow all the rules, and continue to allow freedom of movement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Labour's policy, on the other hand, is to have ""close alignment with the single market"". But the EU has previously said the UK cannot cherry-pick only the parts of the single market it likes. So, it's unclear what the EU would accept as ""close alignment"", which Labour is calling for. Theresa May has always been firm that Brexit must mean the end to freedom of movement. In her 2017 election manifesto, she set out plans for an immigration system designed to ""reduce and control"" the number of people coming to the UK from the EU - and she hasn't wavered from this pledge. Like the Conservatives, Labour also pledged at the 2017 election to end freedom of movement. So, on the surface, this looks like something on which the two party leaders could agree. What is Labour customs union policy? What are the soft Brexit options? But in January, when it came to voting on the Immigration Bill, which would put an end to freedom of movement, Labour encouraged its MPs to vote against it. A big unknown is whether Labour's policy of ""close alignment"" with the single market might restrict the UK's ability to set its own immigration policy. Its Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer,previously told BBC Newsthe party would be willing to accept some EU workers but with restrictions. ""If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say, 'I accept that,'"" he said. A Labour spokesperson said: ""We support fair rules and the reasonable management of migration."" Theresa May has said she's made it clear in the political declaration - the part of her deal agreed with the EU concerning the future relationship - that the UK agrees to not going backwards in terms of workers' rights. But she has not guaranteed that when the EU introduces a new right or protection for workers, the UK will also adopt it. In Prime Minister's Questions last week, though, Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to use EU standards, including any introduced in the future, as a minimum for the UK to improve on. He accused the prime minister's deal of involving a ""race to the bottom"" on workers' rights - something he said Labour's proposals would prevent.

City of Chicago to sue Jussie Smollett,"Jussie Smollett will be sued by the City of Chicago after ""refusing to reimburse"" the cost of investigating an alleged assault on him in the city. Prosecutors say a homophobic and racist attack was staged to boost the actor's career, but Smollett has always maintained his innocence. The 36-year-old was given seven days to pay $130,000 (Â£99,000) to cover the investigation's cost. The deadline passed on Thursday and now a civil complaint will be filed. The City of Chicago's law department said it will ""pursue the full measure of damages allowed"", adding in a statement that the lawsuit will be filed ""in the near future"". After initially being treated as a victim Smollett was accused of staging the attack and became the subject of the police investigation, but the charges against the actor were dropped last week. Prosecutors say they still believe the Empire star faked the attack. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says: ""At the end of the day, it is Mr Smollett who committed this hoax"" The charges were dropped because Smollett forfeited a $10,000 (Â£7,600) bond payment and carried out community service, according to Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel called it a ""a whitewash of justice"" and claimed Smollett had dragged the city's reputation ""through the mud"". How the Jussie Smollett drama unfolded Five big questions about Jussie Smollett In the initial letter demanding $130,000, which includes overtime hours police used on the case, the City of Chicago said: ""As part of the investigation, Chicago police reviewed video and physical evidence and conducted several interviews, expending resources that could have been used for other investigations. ""Ultimately, the Chicago police investigation revealed that you knowingly filed a false police report and had in fact orchestrated your own attack."" A new Mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, was elected on Wednesday and will be sworn in on 20 May. She told MSNBC following her victory that there needs to be a ""much more fulsome explanation"" as to why the charges against Smollett were dropped. ""We cannot create the perception that if you're rich or famous or both that you get one set of justice, and for everybody else it's something much harsher,"" she said. ""That won't do and we need to make sure that we have a criminal justice system that has integrity.""

Pay gap widens at almost half of firms,"Fewer than half the UK's biggest employers have succeeded in narrowing their gender pay gap, analysis by the BBC has found. Across 45% of firms the discrepancy in pay increased in favour of men, while at a further 7% there was no change. Overall, 78% of companies had a pay gap in favour of men, 14% favoured women and the rest reported no difference. Firms had until midnight to file pay comparison data - by which time 10,428 had done so - or face legal action. Gender pay gap: Can it be fixed? Firms rush to meet gender pay deadline The total is roughly the same as last year, but it is unclear how many firms have failed to respond, since the government has no definitive list of companies required to file figures. Overall, the median pay gap in favour of men lowered slightly from 9.7% last year to 9.6% this year. The median pay gap is calculated by comparing the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and middle-ranking man in the same companies. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external By law, all companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it will take enforcement action against all firms that miss the deadline. It was unclear exactly how many companies had not reported, although it is thought about a quarter did so in the last 36 hours before the deadline. Ask gender pay specialists and they'll tell you there are many initiatives that companies can take - tackling unconscious bias, offering more flexible working and encouraging shared parental leave. But the issue doesn't end at the office door. The experts say society needs to change. Schools could encourage girls to take more STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths. There should be more flexible, affordable childcare options. And men could take on more of the household chores. But gender pay gap reporting may not be enough: the government may need to get tougher. Read more from Dharshini Among large firms reporting the biggest increases in pay gaps were garage chain Kwik Fit, Interserve FS (part of the Interserve Group), and car retailer Inchcape. Firms reporting the biggest improvement in narrowing the gap were Newsquest Media Group, Mitie, and DFDS Logistics. Large companies with the biggest gaps included Independent Vetcare at 48.3% (down from 50.5% last year) and EasyJet at 47.9% (45.5%). Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap at your company? Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of firms A spokesman for Interserve Group said: ""We are committed to addressing the issues on gender pay and through the leadership of our chief executive, Debbie White, we are making good progress."" A spokeswoman for Kwik Fit said it was committed to narrowing the gap and both recruit more female staff and promote from within. Easyjetsaid in March,externalthat the gap had widened from 45.5% as more female cabin crew had been recruited since the last pay snapshot. Most of the airline's pilots are male, and are more highly paid than cabin crew. The firm is making efforts to recruit more female pilots. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, described the figures as ""disappointing, but not surprising"". Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive, said: ""The regulations are not tough enough.  It's time for action plans, not excuses. ""Employers need to set out a five-year strategy for how they will close their gender pay gaps, monitoring progress and results. ""Government needs to require employers to publish action plans that we can hold them accountable to, with meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply."" Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive at the EHRC, said: ""The causes of the gender pay gap are complex and deeply entrenched. ""Meaningful change will take time and concerted effort, with some changes potentially increasing gaps in the short term, such as employing more women at junior levels before they rise into more senior positions. ""That is why it is vital that employers publish action plans to explain their figures and highlight where they will be targeting any inequality in their workplace."" Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you place all the men and women working at a company into two lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. The individual company data reflects information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the ""snapshot date"" - the previous year. 5 April is the snapshot date for businesses and charities. 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations.

Mental health tests for NZ attack suspectMembers of Christchurch's Muslim community were at the hearing of the man accused of murdering 50 people.Asia,"The suspect made an earlier court appearance in March (file photo) The man accused of killing 50 people in last month's attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, has been ordered to undergo mental health tests. He would be seen by experts to decide if he was fit to stand trial or insane, said high court judge Cameron Mander. The suspect faces 50 murder charges and 39 attempted murder charges. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in the courtroom - packed with relatives of some of the victims - via video link from prison. He was not required to enter a plea. It is the deadliest mass shooting attack New Zealand has ever seen. Christchurch shootings: How the attacks unfolded Members of Christchurch's Muslim community attended the court hearing New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arderncalled it one of New Zealand's ""darkest days"". She hasvowed to ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. On Friday morning, Judge Mander ordered that two assessments would be carried out to determine the state of the suspect's mental health. The suspect listened intently during the short court hearing. He made no comments. The suspect was able to see the judge and lawyers and hear the proceedings - but the camera was turned away from the public gallery. The judge remanded him in custody, and his next court appearance is now due on 14 June. Omar Nabi who lost a relative in the attack was at the court Omar Nabi lost his father in the attack on the Al Noor mosque. Speaking to reporters outside the court he said ""we don't want to kill him. We want him to suffer here"". ""We want him to be punished, you know, a punishment for a crime of killing 50 people and injuring how many."" Tofazzal Alam who survived the attack on the Linwood mosque also spoke to reporters outside the court. ""I lost 50 friends whom I use to see in the mosque every Friday. And during the shooting, I couldn't see him. I want to see how he feels after killing 50 people, so that's why I'm here today."" Fifty people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city. The child, the father, the aspiring footballer Video: 'The attacker killed my whole family' UK survivor 'cradled young woman' killed at mosque The suspect was arrested on 15 March for his involvement in the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre, both located in Christchurch. He had allegedly first driven to the Al Noor mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance. What is known about NZ shooting suspect? He allegedly fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. He live-streamed the attack from a head-mounted camera and identified himself in the footage. Smashed windows at Linwood Mosque The suspect is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to the Linwood mosque where the second shooting occurred. The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines - the part of the gun which stores ammunition - so they could hold more bullets. He is currently being kept in isolation at the Auckland Prison in Paremoremo, considered New Zealand's toughest. Less than a week after the attacks, Ms Ardern announced that New Zealand would ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. She said she expected new legislation to be in place by 11 April. An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. Many in the country are still coming to terms with the mass killings. The people killed as they prayed Brother hails NZ mosque victim 'hero' 'A leader with love on full display' More than 20,000 people had earlier last month attended a memorial service honouring the 50 victims of the shootings. Thousands turned up to a vigil in remembrance of the victims All 50 names of the victims who died in the attacks were read out at the event by members of the city's Muslim community. The victims included men, women and children from across the world. The youngest victim was just three years old.

Parents 'being misled over kids' snacks',"Parents are at risk of being misled by ""manipulative marketing campaigns"" and ""crafty messaging"" on children's snacks, a child health expert has said. Dr Max Davie said that given levels of obesity, it was crucial for parents to know what their children were eating. It comes as University of Glasgow researchers examined seemingly healthy children's snacks sold in UK shops. They found some snacks labelled as containing one portion of fruit or veg did not live up to the claim. Scientists and doctors say more stringent regulation is needed. The team examined more than 300 products aimed at children (with cartoons on packing for example), including 41 different brands, sold at seven major UK supermarkets between 2016 and 2017 . They included many snacks with healthy messages on them such as fruit snacks, fruit drinks, cereal bars and cereals, but excluded obviously unhealthy choices such as cakes and confectionery. One of five a day- may contain only a small amount of fruit or veg Unsweetened fruit juice- when juiced the sugar in the fruit is released, which can damage teeth and may cause tooth decay 100% fruit snacks- check for highly processed fruit (eg puree) or any concentrated fruit juice that could contribute to tooth damage. The report found many with an average of 48g of sugar per 100g of product Healthy fruit juice- check portion size. Many exceededthe daily limit of 150ml of fruit juice a day,external Healthy children's yoghurt- check for unexpected sugars from added fruit puree, for example Source: NHS and Dr Ada Garcia Researcher Dr Ada Garcia told the BBC: ""At the moment some companies are using health messaging to make products more attractive to people, but they do not always live up to those claims. ""It is important parents don't look at the claims in isolation but look at all the ingredients on the pack and judge the whole quality of the food."" The report highlighted a number of concerns. One was the packaging on 80 fruit-based drinks and snacks claiming to contain no added sugar, but more than 40 had concentrated fruit juice or fruit puree as added ingredients. Dr Garcia added: ""Some people will see processed fruits as a healthy alternative snack but the sugars in highly processed fruit and fruit juice are already broken down and socan be absorbed by the body more quickly.,external ""This means children may become hungrier more quickly and these free sugars also contribute to tooth damage and tooth decay."" She said the public needed clearer information on packaging. And while researchers acknowledge there is no standard portion size for children's fruit and vegetables, they say many fruit-based products had insufficient amounts of fruit and vegetables in them, despite claims they contained one of the government-recommended five portions a day. Meanwhile, Dr Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""Given the UK's rising levels of childhood obesity, is it essential that parents and children know precisely what is in the products they consume and are not misled by manipulative marketing campaigns. ""This study reveals concerning findings, particularly the disappointing levels of fruit and veg in products claiming to contain at least one portion of the government's recommended five-a-day. ""It is clear that families are being influenced by surreptitious food packaging. We strongly support the researchers' call for stricter regulations on composition and labelling. ""Alongside, there needs to be better education and advice available for parents so that they can see through crafty messaging and make their own decisions about what they consider to be healthy products for their families."" Kate Halliwell, from the Food and Drink Federation, said a large proportion of products labelled as giving one of your five a day were also classed as healthy under advertising rules. ""The fact that many are high in sugar is no surprise given fruit contains naturally occurring sugars,"" she said. ""The weight of dried fruit and purees required to count as one of your five-a-day is based on being equivalent to 80g of the fresh product. Products containing dried fruit can therefore legitimately label 'five a day' if they have 30g of dried fruit."" She said the vast majority of companies provided more nutrition information than they were legally obliged to on the front of packs. The work is published in the journal the Archives of Disease in Childhood.

Cross-party Brexit talks end after 4.5 hours,"Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""We will be having further discussions with the government"" Talks between Conservative and Labour teams have taken place for a second day, in a bid to end Brexit deadlock. The discussions, which lasted 4.5 hours, were described as ""detailed and productive"" by the government. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said earlier that the idea of a ""confirmatory"" referendum on any Brexit deal would be discussed. MPs backed a bill on Wednesday which would force the PM to seek a new delay to Brexit. The House of Lords are debating it in general terms -  but detailed line-by-line scrutiny, when they will have the chance to propose changes to the bill, will not take place until Monday. Will Labour push for a public vote? How would another Brexit delay work? What are the Brexit sticking points? Merkel visiting Dublin for Brexit talks Leaving the cross-party talks, Sir Keir did not answer questions about what had been discussed, telling reporters: ""We have had further discussions and we will be having further discussions with the government."" A Labour spokesman said the talks ""are continuing and the teams are planning to meet again"". A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Today both sets of negotiating teams met for four and a half hours of detailed and productive technical talks in the Cabinet Office, supported by the civil service."" The talks were attended on the Labour side by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey. The government's negotiating team was senior cabinet minister David Lidington, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, chief whip Julian Smith, Business Secretary Greg Clark and Gavin Barwell - the prime minister's chief of staff. Thursday's meeting followed discussions between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday. Friday:More talks between Labour and the government expected to take place Wednesday 10 April:Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek - or the EU does not grant - further delay The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April, and as yet, no withdrawal deal is in place. But ministers have warned that the backbench bill - put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper - could increase ""the risk of an accidental no-deal"". No 10 says Ms Cooper's bill, passed by the Commons with a majority of one vote on Wednesday, would deny the PM the power to agree a deal with EU leaders on April 10, as MPs would have to agree to any new Brexit date. Any Brexit delay will require the unanimous backing of all 28 EU leaders at a summit next Wednesday. If they agree - but suggest a different date to the one backed by MPs - the prime minister would have to bring it back to the Commons for further approval on Thursday 11 April. ""By April 11, the European Council will have concluded and the leaders will have returned to their member states. In the words of the secretary of state, the bill could increase the risk of an accidental no-deal exit,"" the prime minister's spokesman said. The main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. Read more from Laura The backbench bill, which was steered through the Commons in one day, will need the approval of the House of Lords if it is to become law. Peers were expected to sit late into the night on Thursday as they hold their second reading debate on the bill. The government's chief whip in the Lords, Lord Taylor said: ""The proceedings on Monday the 8th should be concluded in a timely fashion to allow the House of Commons to consider any amendments made by this House."" It is the EU which decides whether to grant an extension, and German ChancellorAngela Merkel has met Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar for talks in Dublin. Mr Varadkar said any further extension ""must require and must have a credible and realistic way forward"". Mrs Merkel said she still hoped for an ""orderly Brexit"" adding: ""I can say this from the German side - we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit; Britain crashing out of the European Union. ""But we have to do this together with Britain and with their position that they will present to us."" Labour chair offered to quit over Brexit May and Corbyn: Brexit talks 'constructive' Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' 'I can't sleep because of Brexit' Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Labour would not be talking to the government if a ""confirmatory referendum"" wasn't an option. But it has emerged that party chairman Ian Laveryoffered to quit the shadow cabinet, after twice defying orders to vote in favour of another referendum. And 25 Labour MPs - including former minister Caroline Flint and a number MPs for Leave-voting seats in the North and Midlands - have written to Jeremy Corbyn, saying another referendum should not be included in any compromise Brexit deal. This video can not be played 'No guarantee' UK won't fight EU elections Meanwhile, Downing Street has announced a series of ministerial appointments, to replace ministers who quit over the government's Brexit strategy and Brexit votes. Among them, party deputy chairman James Cleverly has been made a Brexit minister; Justin Tomlinson has been appointed as a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions; and Seema Kennedy has been made a health minister.

Will cross-party Brexit talks go anywhere?,"The Labour Party's negotiating team consists of Rebecca Long Bailey and Sir Keir Starmer plus officials It is almost the end of another very long and fractious week in Westminster (although their lordships look like they'll be going for quite some time yet). But the main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. I'm told there might be more contact tonight between the two sides, although not more face to face talks until Friday. Cross-party Brexit talks end after 4.5 hours What are the Brexit sticking points? Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' And there is scepticism in Labour circles over whether the government is doing more so far than trying to explain merits of its deal, rather than suggest areas where they might be willing to budge. Sources involved in the process suggest that there is yet to be the promise of a big move from Theresa May, a promise about the price she is willing to pay for Labour support. But the talks are not just a stunt and there are suggestions it might be clear by Friday afternoon, if the process will actually be able to deliver an outcome. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is part of the government's negotiating team Talks, as we know, often turn to more talks, and more talks, and more talks. You don't need me to remind you, when Theresa May has the option of playing something long, which choice she makes. There is, though, the obvious deadline of the prime minister's trip to Brussels next week, where she has to present something to her EU counterparts, in order to justify asking for another delay. But presenting something is not the same as having to deliver a fully worked-out deal with every ""i"" dotted, every ""t"" crossed. It would be an enormous political turnaround if a fully worked out cross-party compromise emerges by then, that can last. Will Labour push for a public vote? Labour chair offered to quit over Brexit How did my MP vote on Brexit options? But after months of Brussels pondering openly why the UK has not been able to work in a cross-party way, if Theresa May can show evidence that that process is under way, perhaps that will be enough. One cabinet minister suggested to me today that, if they can show there isn't a ""permanent standoff"" in Parliament between the two main parties, then the EU will give the UK more time. Don't forget though, behind the scenes, some Brexiteers are still trying to organise to push for departure from the EU next week. Labour has a problem too - a big split over whether they could accept compromise to deliver Brexit, without the promise of another referendum. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn may have a lot of gaps to bridge between them, but they have gaps among their own sides too.

'One drink a day increases stroke risk',"Even light-to-moderate drinking increases blood pressure and the chances of having a stroke, according to a large genetic study in The Lancet, countering previous claims that one or two drinks a day could be protective. The UK and Chinese researchers followed 500,000 Chinese people for 10 years. They say the findings are relevant to all populations and the best evidence yet on the direct effects of alcohol. Experts said people should limit their alcohol consumption. It is already known that heavy drinking is harmful to health and increases stroke risk - but some studies have suggesteddrinking small amounts can be good for the health, while others indicate there isno safe level of alcohol consumption. The researchers, from the University of Oxford, Peking University and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, found that: drinking one to two alcoholic drinks every day increased stroke risk by 10-15% drinking four drinks every day increased the risk of having a stroke by 35% For the purposes of their study, one drink was defined as either: a small glass of wine a bottle of beer a single measure of spirits About 16 in 100 men and 20 in 100 women will have a stroke in their lifetime in the UK. So, if a group of 100 non-drinkers started drinking a glass or two every day, there would be an extra two strokes - a small increase. According to Prof David Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, that's an increase in total stroke risk of 38% for every half a bottle of wine drunk per day. He said: ""It is very roughly the opposite effect of taking a statin"", which are drugs prescribed by doctors to help lower cholesterol levels in the blood and prevent heart attacks and strokes. The study,externalalso found no evidence of light or moderate drinking having a protective effect, in other words, reducing the risk of stroke. When it came to the effect of alcohol on heart attack risk, the researchers said the effects were not clear cut and more data needed to be collected over the next few years. ""Claims that wine and beer have magical protective effects is not borne out,"" said study author Prof Richard Peto, professor of medical statistics and epidemiology at the University of Oxford. How many cigarettes in a bottle of wine? East Asian countries are useful places to study the effects of alcohol. Many people with Chinese ancestry have a combination of genes that puts them off drinking alcohol. It causes an unpleasant reaction and makes them feel unwell. As a result, there is a wide variation of alcohol intake in China - one in three men doesn't drink and very few women do. But by comparing the health outcomes of drinkers and non-drinkers according to their genetic profile, scientists say they have been able to assess - with much more certainty than before - the direct effects of alcohol on stroke risk, distinct from any other factors. Western populations don't possess these genes, so it would be impossible to carry out a similar study here. And most studies are observational, which makes it's difficult to judge which factor is causing what effect. Dr Iona Millwood, study author and senior epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, said: ""Our genetic analyses have helped us understand the cause and effect relationships."" The researchers say their key message is that there is now clear evidence of no protective effect of moderate drinking on stroke. That means drinking even small amounts of alcohol each day can increase the chances of having a stroke. This is reflected in the current UK guidance -which advises a limit of 14 units of alcohol a week, with several alcohol-free days to keep health risks low. Dr Stephen Burgess, from the University of Cambridge, said there were some limitations to the study - that it only looked at a Chinese population and focused mainly on the drinking of spirits and beer, not wine. But he said the research reflected the culmination of many years of research into the impact of alcohol consumption. ""It strongly suggests that there is no cardiovascular benefit of light drinking and that risk of stroke increases even with moderate light alcohol consumption,"" he said. ""Risk of stroke increases proportionally with the amount of alcohol consumed, so if people do choose to drink, then they should limit their alcohol consumption."" Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said the study didn't answer every question. ""It has certainly advanced what we know about the role of alcohol in some diseases but it can't be the last word,"" he said. ""The new study doesn't tie down exactly how alcohol works to increase stroke risk but doesn't appear to increase heart attack risk."" Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk, at the University of Cambridge, said the study was making him waver. ""I have always been reasonably convinced that moderate alcohol consumption was protective for cardiovascular disease, but now I am having my doubts,"" he said.

"Pay gap widens at almost half of firmsAcross 45% of UK firms the gender pay gap increased in favour of men, analysis by the BBC finds.","Fewer than half the UK's biggest employers have succeeded in narrowing their gender pay gap, analysis by the BBC has found. Across 45% of firms the discrepancy in pay increased in favour of men, while at a further 7% there was no change. Overall, 78% of companies had a pay gap in favour of men, 14% favoured women and the rest reported no difference. Firms had until midnight to file pay comparison data - by which time 10,428 had done so - or face legal action. Gender pay gap: Can it be fixed? Firms rush to meet gender pay deadline The total is roughly the same as last year, but it is unclear how many firms have failed to respond, since the government has no definitive list of companies required to file figures. Overall, the median pay gap in favour of men lowered slightly from 9.7% last year to 9.6% this year. The median pay gap is calculated by comparing the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and middle-ranking man in the same companies. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external By law, all companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it will take enforcement action against all firms that miss the deadline. It was unclear exactly how many companies had not reported, although it is thought about a quarter did so in the last 36 hours before the deadline. Ask gender pay specialists and they'll tell you there are many initiatives that companies can take - tackling unconscious bias, offering more flexible working and encouraging shared parental leave. But the issue doesn't end at the office door. The experts say society needs to change. Schools could encourage girls to take more STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths. There should be more flexible, affordable childcare options. And men could take on more of the household chores. But gender pay gap reporting may not be enough: the government may need to get tougher. Read more from Dharshini Among large firms reporting the biggest increases in pay gaps were garage chain Kwik Fit, Interserve FS (part of the Interserve Group), and car retailer Inchcape. Firms reporting the biggest improvement in narrowing the gap were Newsquest Media Group, Mitie, and DFDS Logistics. Large companies with the biggest gaps included Independent Vetcare at 48.3% (down from 50.5% last year) and EasyJet at 47.9% (45.5%). Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap at your company? Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of firms A spokesman for Interserve Group said: ""We are committed to addressing the issues on gender pay and through the leadership of our chief executive, Debbie White, we are making good progress."" A spokeswoman for Kwik Fit said it was committed to narrowing the gap and both recruit more female staff and promote from within. Easyjetsaid in March,externalthat the gap had widened from 45.5% as more female cabin crew had been recruited since the last pay snapshot. Most of the airline's pilots are male, and are more highly paid than cabin crew. The firm is making efforts to recruit more female pilots. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, described the figures as ""disappointing, but not surprising"". Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive, said: ""The regulations are not tough enough.  It's time for action plans, not excuses. ""Employers need to set out a five-year strategy for how they will close their gender pay gaps, monitoring progress and results. ""Government needs to require employers to publish action plans that we can hold them accountable to, with meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply."" Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive at the EHRC, said: ""The causes of the gender pay gap are complex and deeply entrenched. ""Meaningful change will take time and concerted effort, with some changes potentially increasing gaps in the short term, such as employing more women at junior levels before they rise into more senior positions. ""That is why it is vital that employers publish action plans to explain their figures and highlight where they will be targeting any inequality in their workplace."" Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you place all the men and women working at a company into two lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. The individual company data reflects information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the ""snapshot date"" - the previous year. 5 April is the snapshot date for businesses and charities. 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

Small garden birds 'hit by Beast from East',"Sightings of long-tailed tits were down 27% on last year Fewer of the UK's smallest birds have been spotted this year by volunteers in the Big Garden Birdwatch, an annual survey run by the RSPB. Long-tailed tits were down by 27% and wrens by 17% after being seen in large numbers in 2018. Last year's very cold spell brought by the Beast from the East is thought to be a factor, as smaller birds would have been hardest hit by the blast. House sparrows, meanwhile, are making a comeback after years in decline. Their fortunes appear to have turned after falling by more than a half (56%) since the Big Garden Birdwatch began 40 years ago. In the last 10 years however, their numbers appear to have increased by 10%, suggesting at least a ""partial recovery"" is happening over time, experts said. An RSPB spokesman said: ""Over its long lifetime, the survey has shown the increasing good fortunes of birds such as the goldfinch and wood pigeon and the alarming declines of the house sparrow and starling. ""But there appears to be good news for one of these birds."" He said the figures for sparrows over the past decade gave experts hope that ""at least a partial recovery may be happening"". 1.House sparrow:Cheerful exploiters of human rubbish who have managed to colonise most of the world. 2.Starling:Looks black at a distance but is glossy with a purple and green sheen up close. Noisy and gregarious, its flight is fast and direct and it walks and runs confidently. 3.Blue tit:In winter, family flocks join other tits as they search for food. A garden with four or five blue tits at a feeder at any one time may be be feeding 20 or more. Every January, thousands of people across the UK spend an hour of their weekend watching the comings and goings in their garden or local park. As well as birds, people were asked to look out for badgers, foxes, grey and red squirrels, muntjac deer, roe deer, frogs and toads. Over the years, the survey has documented the boom in sightings of wood pigeons and long-tailed tits, as well as influxes of bramblings and waxwings. This year, the charity is releasing a specially created track of birdsong called Let Nature Sing to coincide with the publication of the birdwatch findings. RSPB director of conservation Martin Harper said: ""Birds are such iconic parts of human culture but many of us no longer have the time or opportunity to enjoy them. ""Without nature, our lives are so less complete."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drab block behind Starbucks was spy baseGCHQ confirms the office building in central London was used by intelligence officers for 66 years.London,"The unremarkable office block is sandwiched between a Starbucks and a pub A drab office block sandwiched between a pub and a branch of Starbucks was a secret base of spy agency GCHQ, it has been confirmed. The anonymous building opposite St James's Park Tube station in central London was used by British spooks for 66 years. Despite the covert goings-on within, neighbours said the address's purpose was an open secret among locals. GCHQ acknowledged the location after moving out of its home. Director Jeremy Fleming said the site in Palmer Street, used by intelligence officers since 1953, had been part of ""a history full of amazing intelligence"". The government-leased building has been used by the intelligence service since 1953 The entrance is through a nondescript black door opposite St James's Park Tube station GCHQ, known as Britain's listening post, was set up on 1 November 1919 as a peacetime ""cryptanalytic"" unit. During World War Two, staff were moved to Bletchley Park to decrypt German messages including, most famously of all, the Enigma communications. GCHQ sets up all-female training classes Why real-life spooks love spy dramas Inside GCHQ's operations centre When the service moved its headquarters to Cheltenham from the London suburb of Eastcote in the 1950s, the Ministry of Works provided the Palmer Street building as a centre to handle secret paperwork and a base for its director. By Joseph Lee, BBC News It turns out that it's hard to put a spy HQ with frosted glass windows in the middle of central London without someone asking questions. And at the Adam and Eve pub at the end of Palmer Street, the answers were surprisingly accurate. Asked if she knew what the building next door was, a barmaid said: ""It's Mâ¦ MI6?"" The secretive neighbours were just a fact of life and she could not remember how she found out, she said. ""We don't really talk about it."" She suggested that the landlord might know more, but the BBC's inquiries fell foul of the pub chain's operational security - press enquiries have to go through head office, the landlord said, before disappearing through a door marked ""The Hideaway"". Staff at Starbucks on the other side of the office building either knew less or refused to crack under interrogation. Regina Toth, who had worked in the coffee shop for two years, said: ""It was very mysterious."" At Pall Mall Barbers, Jack Holden knew it was ""secret service or something"". He'd worked opposite the GCHQ building for six years, but seeing police cars come with lights flashing to move on a loiterer in the street convinced him that ""it's legit"". ""It was just common knowledge,"" he said. ""It looks suspect, doesn't it? With those blacked-out windows. It's a very secure building."" The spy agency said the unremarkable building, which is between a coffee shop and the Adam and Eve pub, had ""played its part in significant events over the years, such as the 2012 London Olympics"". It has been sold privately but future plans for it are not currently known. The spy agency is known as Britain's listening post Despite the sale, GCHQ said it would maintain a presence in the capital, in addition to its Cheltenham HQ and other offices in Bude in Cornwall, Scarborough, Lincolnshire and Harrogate. A new secure facility is also set to open in Manchester later in the year.

Labour win Newport West by-election,"This video can not be played Ruth Jones wants to reconnect with the people who did not vote Labour has held on to the Newport West parliamentary seat with a reduced majority following a by-election. Union official Ruth Jones won the south Wales seat, which fell vacant with thedeath of veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn in February. Labour saw its majority over the Conservatives fall to 1,951 from 5,658 at the 2017 general election. Mr Flynn had held the seat since 1987. Eleven candidates stood, with the 37% turnout higher than some had predicted. In her victory speech, Ms Jones, 56, said the by-election had taken place because of ""the sad passing of Paul Flynn, our friend"". ""There have been many tributes to him over the weeks but one saying stood out to me - 'everyone knew somebody who was helped by Paul Flynn',"" she said. Lion Mama: The woman who fought off her daughterâs rapists Sala pilot 'not qualified to fly at night' The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill ""These words have been an inspiration to me throughout the campaign.  That's what we're here for - to do our best to help others."" She added: ""Now that you've elected me to go to Parliament, I will do what I promise to do on the doorstep: I will stand up for the people, the jobs and the economy of Newport West."" Renew candidate June Davies (left) and Neil Hamilton of UKIP congratulate Ruth Jones Born and brought up in the constituency, Ms Jones, a NHS physiotherapist, has been a full-time union official with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy since 2016. She stood as the Labour candidate in Monmouth at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. ""Who knows what the next few days, weeks and months will bring,"" she added. ""But what I do know is that people have had enough after a decade of austerity."" ""They've had enough of cuts that have taken police off our streets, they've had enough of being made to feel worthless by universal credit and the bedroom tax. If I'm going to parliament it's with those people in my heart and Newport in my mind."" Newport West by-election: As it happened The result saw a swing from Labour to the Conservative of 2.4%. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Ms Jones would be a ""fantastic successor to Paul Flynn and will take up the tireless work he carried out for this community"". ""Tonight's result sends a clear message that the people of Newport and Wales are fed up of austerity which has robbed the Welsh economy of Â£1bn through needless cuts and shows support for Labour's alternative,"" he added. Conservative candidate Matthew Evans said he had ""never seen such anger and frustration"" on the doorstep as what he encountered over Brexit. ""People just want clarity and I've seen no appetite for another referendum or a general election,"" he said. Ruth Jones with her husband David after her win UKIP candidate Neil Hamilton, an AM for the party, came third with 2,023 votes. He campaigned saying the by-election was a chance to send a message to Westminster over its handling of the UK's departure from the EU. He said: ""To nearly quadruple our vote, I regard a success in itself even though we didn't win the election. ""I regard this as the start of a new era for my party and I look forward to the next election, whenever that may come."" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor This is a good hold for Labour and Ruth Jones will be pleased to be heading for Westminster with a majority of nearly 2,000 at a time of such an unpredictability. The Conservatives will be pleased to have held off the UKIP challenge for second place when the UK government is under such pressure over Brexit. But UKIP is taking encouragement from a vote share of more than 8%, which would be their baseline for keeping a presence in the Senedd at the next Welsh Assembly elections. What happened in this by-election should not be taken as a barometer for for future elections - politics is a rollercoaster right now. Ruth Jones will need to fasten her seat belt.

Half of firms fail to narrow gender pay gap,"Fewer than half the UK's biggest employers have succeeded in narrowing their gender pay gap, analysis by the BBC has found. Across 45% of firms the discrepancy in pay increased in favour of men, while at a further 7% there was no change. Overall, 78% of companies had a pay gap in favour of men, 14% favoured women and the rest reported no difference. Firms had until midnight to file pay comparison data - by which time 10,428 had done so - or face legal action. Gender pay gap: Can it be fixed? Firms rush to meet gender pay deadline The total is roughly the same as last year, but it is unclear how many firms have failed to respond, since the government has no definitive list of companies required to file figures. Overall, the median pay gap in favour of men lowered slightly from 9.7% last year to 9.6% this year. The median pay gap is calculated by comparing the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and middle-ranking man in the same companies. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work?

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said it will take enforcement action against all firms that miss the deadline. It was unclear exactly how many companies had not reported, although it is thought about a quarter did so in the last 36 hours before the deadline. Ask gender pay specialists and they'll tell you there are many initiatives that companies can take - tackling unconscious bias, offering more flexible working and encouraging shared parental leave. But the issue doesn't end at the office door. The experts say society needs to change. Schools could encourage girls to take more STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths. There should be more flexible, affordable childcare options. And men could take on more of the household chores. But gender pay gap reporting may not be enough: the government may need to get tougher.

Firms reporting the biggest improvement in narrowing the gap were Newsquest Media Group, Mitie, and DFDS Logistics.

The game is rooted in ancient mythology and stars Kratos, the former Greek god of war, and his son Atreus. Fortnite, released in 2017, was named best evolving game. Despite receiving six nominations, UK-made western adventure Red Dead Redemption 2 walked away empty-handed at the glitzy ceremony in central London. This video can not be played Forza Horizon 4 won Best British Game The first God of War game was released in 2005. This eighth instalment in the series, developed by Santa Monica Studio, sees its iconic lead character Kratos - son of Zeus - as a struggling single parent. Cory Barlog, director of God of War, told the BBC winning the awards was ""amazing, overwhelming, and scary"". He said the win showed that story-led games could be as ""relevant"" as the presently popular Battle Royale style titles. Nintendo's Labo won two awards, one for best family game and the other for innovation. It is the cardboard toolkit that lets players explore the interactivity of the firm's Switch console, for example by creating a piano.

""A game of such depth and innovation (whether you finished it or not!) - their loss is the independent sector's gain. Tonight shows titles from smaller teams that manage to speak a certain truth to players can be just as successful (in awards terms - not cash!) as the big guns,"" he tweeted. Presenter Dara O'Briain told the BBC the event celebrates the diversity of the games industry and the award results can be surprising. ""Like the movie industry suddenly going indie and choosing all indie and not choosing the blockbusters, Bafta has a tendency to do that,"" he said.

"'You're a Gypsy - are you leaving school?'An MPs' committee hears about inequalities faced by Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children.Family & Education","Teachers' ""entrenched"" attitudes could lead them to write off Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children, ""enabling prejudice to continue"", MPs have said. Throughout her time in education, one woman told the Women and Equalities Committee, teachers had said: ""You're a Gypsy - are you going to leave school?"" These children were underachieving, it said, and more likely to drop out or be temporarily or permanently excluded. And almost half of them were missing at least a month of lessons every year. The MPs' report said: ""Some Gypsy and Traveller children are taken out of school as early as the end of primary school, some persistently do not attend and some never register at school at all. ""Where these children end up is unclear, although we have heard of successful and unsuccessful home education, children starting work at as young as 10 years old, and children who simply stay at home without any formal education. ""Local authorities must serve a notice on parents they believe are not educating their children."" But the MPs acknowledged that many local authorities, despite their best efforts, were unable to reach children who may be missing from education. This video can not be played Traveller communities 'suffering discrimination' ""Consequently, there is very little, if any, oversight of how Gypsy and Traveller children are being educated at home,"" the report said. And, with three out of four of their families living in settled accommodation, most of them were not missing lessons because of time spent actually travelling. ""Parents have told us that they take their children out of education for reasons ranging from bullying that they experience in school, schools not taking their children's needs into account, and not seeing the relevance of education, to, most worryingly, feeling that schools do not educate their children in a way that they would find acceptable,"" the MPs said. Maria Miller, who chairs the committee, said these children had been comprehensively failed by policy-makers and public services. She said: ""The government must stop filing this under 'too difficult' and set out how it intends to improve health, education and other outcomes for these very marginalised communities who are all too often 'out of sight and out of mind'."" Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton urged all agencies to redouble their efforts over the education of Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller children. But he said the reports of teachers making inappropriate remarks based on assumptions about pupils' backgrounds were ""anomalous and does not reflect the normal practice in schools, which is highly attuned to promoting an inclusive environment to children of all backgrounds"". ""Similarly, schools have robust policies in place to prevent bullying and discrimination and to act upon any incidents that occur.""

"Asos threatens to block serial returnersThe online fashion giant will ""deactivate"" accounts if it thinks clothes are being worn and returned.","Online fashion giant Asos has changed its returns policy. It is lengthening the time allowed for returns of unwanted items, but is threatening to investigate and ""take action"" if it notices anything unusual. It says if it suspects someone is actually wearing and returning goods or ordering and returning ""loads"", it might deactivate the account. Late last year, the company, the biggest online retailer in the UK, warned profits growth was slowing. Asos stocks more than 850 brands and ships all over the world. It said in November that ""unprecedented"" discounting had hit its trading, adding that cutting prices to match rivals had not shifted more clothes. Online shoppers tend to overorder as a rulebecause size and fit differs between brands and they have the time and space to experiment with potential purchases in their homes. The BBC spoke last year to a shopper who regularly ordered Â£400 worth of clothes and generally returned half of them. Adding to the returns pile is the ""snap and send back"" trend, whereby customers post pictures on social media of themselves in new outfits. Certain users do not like being seen in the same outfit twice, making it tempting to use an outfit once and return it. The company's note to customers, sent this week, states: ""If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn't sit right: eg we suspect someone is actually wearing their purchases and then returning them or ordering and returning loads - way, waaay more than even the most loyal Asos customer would order - then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated accounts. ""If this happens to you and you think we've made a mistake, please get in touch with customer care and we'll be happy to discuss it with you. ""We also need to make sure our returns remain sustainable for us and for the environment, so if we notice an unusual pattern, we might investigate and take action. ""It's unlikely to affect you, but we wanted to give you a heads up (more deets below). Thanks for being a great Asos shopper!""

"Parents 'being misled over kids' snacks'Snacks said to contain one portion of fruit may not live up to these claims, researchers say.Health","Parents are at risk of being misled by ""manipulative marketing campaigns"" and ""crafty messaging"" on children's snacks, a child health expert has said. Dr Max Davie said that given levels of obesity, it was crucial for parents to know what their children were eating. It comes as University of Glasgow researchers examined seemingly healthy children's snacks sold in UK shops. They found some snacks labelled as containing one portion of fruit or veg did not live up to the claim. Scientists and doctors say more stringent regulation is needed. The team examined more than 300 products aimed at children (with cartoons on packing for example), including 41 different brands, sold at seven major UK supermarkets between 2016 and 2017 . They included many snacks with healthy messages on them such as fruit snacks, fruit drinks, cereal bars and cereals, but excluded obviously unhealthy choices such as cakes and confectionery. One of five a day- may contain only a small amount of fruit or veg Unsweetened fruit juice- when juiced the sugar in the fruit is released, which can damage teeth and may cause tooth decay 100% fruit snacks- check for highly processed fruit (eg puree) or any concentrated fruit juice that could contribute to tooth damage. The report found many with an average of 48g of sugar per 100g of product Healthy fruit juice- check portion size. Many exceededthe daily limit of 150ml of fruit juice a day,external Healthy children's yoghurt- check for unexpected sugars from added fruit puree, for example Source: NHS and Dr Ada Garcia Researcher Dr Ada Garcia told the BBC: ""At the moment some companies are using health messaging to make products more attractive to people, but they do not always live up to those claims. ""It is important parents don't look at the claims in isolation but look at all the ingredients on the pack and judge the whole quality of the food."" The report highlighted a number of concerns. One was the packaging on 80 fruit-based drinks and snacks claiming to contain no added sugar, but more than 40 had concentrated fruit juice or fruit puree as added ingredients. Dr Garcia added: ""Some people will see processed fruits as a healthy alternative snack but the sugars in highly processed fruit and fruit juice are already broken down and socan be absorbed by the body more quickly.,external ""This means children may become hungrier more quickly and these free sugars also contribute to tooth damage and tooth decay."" She said the public needed clearer information on packaging. And while researchers acknowledge there is no standard portion size for children's fruit and vegetables, they say many fruit-based products had insufficient amounts of fruit and vegetables in them, despite claims they contained one of the government-recommended five portions a day. Meanwhile, Dr Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""Given the UK's rising levels of childhood obesity, is it essential that parents and children know precisely what is in the products they consume and are not misled by manipulative marketing campaigns. ""This study reveals concerning findings, particularly the disappointing levels of fruit and veg in products claiming to contain at least one portion of the government's recommended five-a-day. ""It is clear that families are being influenced by surreptitious food packaging. We strongly support the researchers' call for stricter regulations on composition and labelling. ""Alongside, there needs to be better education and advice available for parents so that they can see through crafty messaging and make their own decisions about what they consider to be healthy products for their families."" Kate Halliwell, from the Food and Drink Federation, said a large proportion of products labelled as giving one of your five a day were also classed as healthy under advertising rules. ""The fact that many are high in sugar is no surprise given fruit contains naturally occurring sugars,"" she said. ""The weight of dried fruit and purees required to count as one of your five-a-day is based on being equivalent to 80g of the fresh product. Products containing dried fruit can therefore legitimately label 'five a day' if they have 30g of dried fruit."" She said the vast majority of companies provided more nutrition information than they were legally obliged to on the front of packs. The work is published in the journal the Archives of Disease in Childhood.
