US rolls back Trump-era tariffs on UK steel,"The UK had hoped for a free trade deal with the US The US has agreed to ease Trump-era tariffs on UK steel and aluminium shipments, resolving an issue that had strained relations between the allies. The move follows earlier deals with the European Union and Japan over the controversial taxes, which were imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018 in the name of national security. In exchange, the UK will suspend extra taxes it had put on US products such as bourbon and Levi's jeans. Business groups welcomed the decision. Under the agreement, the US will replace the 25% tariffs on steel with a quota system. The policy will let UK metal imports into the country duty-free up to a certain level - the quota - before taxes kick in again. The deal will come into effect on 1 June. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the deal had removed a ""very frustrating irritant"", calling the agreement ""good news for the steel and aluminium sectors, which support the jobs of over 80,000 people across the UK"". ""It means our manufacturers can now enjoy a high level of tariff-free access to the US market once again,"" she said. ""Hopefully we can now move forward and focus on deepening our thriving trading relationship with the US."" US officials also welcomed the suspension of the UK retaliatory tariffs, which they said affected about $500m (Â£377m) worth in annual trade. ""The historical deal announced today delivers on President Biden's vision to repair relationships with our allies while also helping to ensure the long-term viability of our steel and aluminium industries,"" said Ambassador Katherine Tai. However, in an interview with the BBC, Ms Tai, the top US trade negotiator, refused to be drawn as to when or if discussions for a formal free trade agreement might start. ""I think the issue is what kind of collaboration is going to be fit for the purpose of addressing the challenges that we have today,"" she said. ""I'm not going to exclude any options."" The Biden administration has prioritised domestic goals ahead of trade, said economist Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. While that could change as the US seeks stronger relations with allies in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he said there's no evidence of that happening yet. ""The US administration has not made any signs that they want to do trade agreements with anybody anytime soon,"" he said. ""That would be a big change."" The Biden administration's low prioritisation of trade matters marks a major shift from former president Donald Trump, who made it a signature area of focus, using tariffs as bargaining chips in diplomacy. He set off a firestorm of criticism in the US and abroad when he announced the 25% tax on foreign steel shipments and 15% tax on foreign aluminium, citing a need to preserve America's manufacturing base and rejecting concerns that tariffs raise prices. After allies, including the UK, hit US products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles in retaliation, Mr Trump backed off the duties for certain countries, including Canada, opting for quotas instead. US President Joe Biden later reached similar deals with the European Union and Japan. The approach has won praise in the US, including from groups like United Steel Workers for responding to the concerns of allies while still providing protection for US manufacturers. With many steel plants located in key election states, maintaining support from those workers is important for Mr Biden. On Tuesday the union praised the new deal for measures it said would help safeguard against unfairly subsidised steel production, such as mandatory annual audits of British Steel, which has a Chinese parent company. Business lobby UK Steel also praised the deal, saying it would be ""felt by steel companies and their employees right across the UK and is immensely welcome"". But with the quotas in place, consumers are unlikely to see benefits like lower prices, said Phil Levy, economist for Flexport. ""Replacing tariffs with a system of quotas is actually moving away from transparency on these things and it does not get you the benefits of free trade,"" he said. American spirits exporters toasted the deal, which should make their bourbon whiskeys cheaper for UK shoppers. ""Distillers throughout the United States are cheering the end of this long tariff nightmare,"" Distilled Spirits Council President Chris Swonger said. The US and UK traded more than $260bn worth of goods last year, of which the majority were exports from the US such as metals, aircraft parts, oil and gas. While America accounts for nearly one fifth of total UK trade, the UK market represents just 5% of US exports. Mr Bown said the US imports too little British steel for a deal to have significant impact on prices. For UK consumers of American products, the impact on prices is also likely to be marginal, he said. ""It can't hurt the consumer, so it will make them better off, but by how much is I think unclear,"" he said. With America buying Â£1 in every Â£6 of British exports, the cooling of tensions over steel has raised hopes of a reheating of the wider transatlantic trade relationship. Levi's jeans, Harley Davidson motorbikes, steel bars and bourbon whiskey became unlikely weapons in a painful battle that has waged since 2018, with their producers and consumers paying a hefty price. For them this ceasefire will be welcome, if overdue. At the heart of the dispute was the protection of American jobs. And if - and it's by no means certain - these developments are the first step towards the resumption of wider free-trade talks, that theme will continue to loom large, even if the man in the White House has changed. The Biden administration struck a deal with the EU over steel almost five months ago. There's been speculations that the UK was made to wait due to unease over the way Boris Johnson's government has handled post-Brexit trading arrangements in Ireland. The UK is keen to demonstrate its Brexit-era agility by notching up more trade agreements - but the US will be keen to continue showing it's calling the shots .

Oligarch says he ditched mansions before sanctions,"Alisher Usmanov shakes hands with Vladimir Putin in 2018 A Russian billionaire sanctioned by the UK says he no longer owns many former properties, potentially putting them beyond the reach of the law. Ex-Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov's Â£82m London home and Surrey mansion were put into trusts linked to the oligarch. This raises questions over the effectiveness of sanctions imposed since the invasion of Ukraine began. The UK government says Mr Usmanov ""cannot access his assets"". On 3 March, seven days after Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, Alisher Usmanov was added to the list of sanctioned Russian businessmen. His assets were frozen, he was banned from visiting the UK, and British citizens and businesses were banned from dealing with him. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: âWe will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.â The government said sanctions would cut him off from âsignificant UK interests including mansions worth tens of millionsâ. But this is now in doubt because Mr Usmanovâs spokesman says he is no longer the legal owner of many of those assets. Born in Uzbekistan in the Soviet Union, Alisher Usmanov, 68, owns USM Holdings, a huge conglomerate involved in mining and telecoms, including Russia's second biggest mobile network MegaFon. Beechwood House in Highgate, North London His wealth has been estimated at $18.4bn (Â£14bn), including ""Beechwood House in Highgateâ¦ and the 16th Century Sutton Place estate in Surreyâ,the UK government said,external. BBC research estimates that Beechwood House could now be worth about Â£82m. But a spokesman for Mr Usmanov said that most of the billionaireâs UK property, as well as his yacht, had already been âtransferred into irrevocable trustsâ. Those are trusts which cannot usually be amended, modified, or revoked after theyâre created. When the assets were transferred, Mr Usmanov no longer owned them, his spokesman said. âNor was he able to manage them or deal with their sale, but could only use them on a rental basis.â âMr Usmanov withdrew from the beneficiaries of the trusts, donating his beneficial rights to his family,"" he said. The spokesman was answering questions about Mr Usmanovâs wealth put to him as part of an investigation into the assets of 35 oligarchs close to Putin. TheRussian Asset Tracker,externalis a global partnership involving 27 media organisations includingthe Guardian,external, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BBC Panorama. The project identified $3.4bn (Â£2.6bn) worth of specific assets whichit says belong to Mr Usmanov,external. But if Mr Usmanov is not the beneficial owner of much of this property, it could be beyond the reach of UK sanctions. And the same could be true for other oligarchs. According to lawyer and sanctions expert Michael OâKane, âitâs very common for high net worth individualsâ¦ to structure both their commercial enterprises and their personal wealth in a way that gives them maximum tax efficiency. Quite often that results in structures whereby they release ownership and control in return for more tax efficiency.â âIn order for an entity to be designated under sanctions it needs to be owned or controlled by a sanctioned person. The more opaque and complex the structures of ownership the more difficult that is to establish.â Sutton Place in Surrey Tracing the ownership of the two houses targeted by the UK government is extremely difficult. They have been held through a complex web of trusts and companies registered in places like the British Virgin Islands, which have until recently not required the ultimate owner to be disclosed. This illustrates the difficulty investigators will have in working out which assets should be subject to sanctions. Despite offshore secrecy the BBC has been able to identify two trusts that have owned the properties, and the involvement of one of Mr Usmanovâs closest business associates. Farhad Moshiri watching Everton Football Club They involve a long-time associate of Mr Usmanov, Farhad Moshiri, the owner of Everton football club, who is not subject to sanctions. Heâs a shareholder in Mr Usmanovâs company USM, which sponsored Everton until the club terminated the relationship in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Leaked documents obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland other corporate records show Mr Moshiri was the shareholder of a company in the British Virgin Islands called Coney Holdings Limited. Until 2014 it owned the shares of the corporate trustees of the Sutton Place Property Unit Trust, which owns the Surrey Mansion, drawing a direct link between Mr Moshiri and the house. After Sutton Place Property Unit Trust was set up in 2005, Mr Usmanov was given a Â£6m loan facility secured against the trust. Mr Usmanov was also the beneficiary of the Pauillac Trust, the owner of Hanley Limited, the Isle of Man company that owns Beechwood, the other property targeted by the government. Once again, Mr Moshiri was involved, this time as a director of Pauillac Properties Limited, a company owned by the trust, that held shares in Hanley Limited. Mr Usmanov declined to respond to questions about his relationship with the two trusts, or whether he had ceased to have a beneficial interest in them. While the evidence confirms he was once involved, exactly who stands behind the two trusts now, and therefore owns the properties, is a mystery. A spokesman for Mr Moshiri told the BBC that he âceased to be a director of Pauillac in 2016â and that Mr Moshiri âhas never been nor is he now involved in the management and/or control of the Sutton Place Property Unit Trustâ. In relation to USM, Mr Moshiri's spokesman said he had sold 50% of his stake in the company but is prevented from selling the rest by the Russian government. He has resigned from the board. Alisher Usmanov watching an Arsenal game Mr Moshiri owns another property identified by our investigation. Mr Usmanov bought a luxury property in north London for Â£15.8m in 2011. In 2014 Russia invaded Crimea. In March that year Western sanctions targeting those closest to President Putin were imposed, and calls were made for Mr Usmanovâs UK assets to be frozen. A month later shares in the company that owned the property, Oakhill Avenue Limited, were transferred to a company owned by Mr Moshiri, for what his spokesman said was ""north of Â£18m."" He told the BBC Oakhill Avenue ""is 100% owned by Mr Moshiri and has been since 2014 when Mr Moshiri acquired the house."" He said âNeither Mr Usmanov, nor any entities related to him, have any current connection to the house or indeed the company that owns the house.â But thatâs not the only property Mr Moshiri obtained from Mr Usmanov. In 2004 Mr Usmanov had bought another property in north London for Â£2 million. Five years later the property, on Tercelet Terrace in Hampstead, was transferred to Mr Moshiri ânot for moneyâ. In June 2010, it was transferred, again ânot for moneyâ, this time to Mr Moshiriâs sister. Itâs not the first time Mr Moshiri has faced questions over his complex financial relationship with Mr Usmanov, such as hisinvestments in Arsenal and Everton FC. Farhad Moshiri at Everton Asked why Mr Usmanov had handed the property to Mr Moshiri ânot for moneyâ Mr Moshiriâs spokesman declined to comment. The use of offshore entities makes it hard for governments to build a clear picture of what someone they have sanctioned actually owns. âBritainâs offshore financial centres, such as the British Virgin Islands, have long been a destination of choice for Kremlin cronies and kleptocrats,â says Steve Goodrich, Head of Research and Investigations at Transparency International UK (TIUK). âComplex networks of secretive shell companies in these jurisdictions means the UK government is attempting to enforce these sanctions with one arm tied behind its back.â TIUK says the UK government should work with the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to increase the pace of their own transparency reforms. A spokesman for Mr Usmanov said that âto characterise the source of his money as ânon-transparentâ is inherently incorrect and damages Mr Usmanovâs reputation as an honest entrepreneur and philanthropist.â âThe entirety of Mr Usmanovâs capital was built through successful, sometimes risky investments, as well as through the effective management of his assets.â The government says its sanctions are having an impact with $250bn (Â£189bn) wiped off the Russian stock market. âThe sanctions against Alisher Usmanov were enacted with immediate effectâ said a spokesperson for the Foreign Office. âIt is now illegal for any person or company in the UK to do business with him.â Additional reporting: Ben King and Will Dahlgreen Everton-linked Usmanov has assets frozen What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

Sunak to give Spring Statement amid price pressures,"The Treasury shared pictures of Chancellor Rishi Sunak preparing his statement Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Spring Statement later, against a backdrop of rising energy, fuel and food costs. He is expected to announce measures to help people with the cost of living, including a cut to fuel tax. He has come under increasing pressure to act, with prices rising by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - thefastest for 30 years. Labour wants him to go further and scrap a planned tax hike next month. National Insurance is set to rise by 1.25p in the pound to pay for healthcare - but the party has said the increase is the wrong way to fund investment. Mr Sunak has ruled out scrapping the increase to NI, but there is speculation he could allow people to earn more before they have to start paying it. However, the full details of Mr Sunak's speech will not be known until he takes to the dispatch box at 12:30 GMT. What to expect from Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement How could the chancellor's plans affect you? How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you? Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? The Spring Statement, one of two financial statements the chancellor makes every year, does not normally see big tax and spending decisions announced. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. Millions of households are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government'sprice cap to contain recent rises is set to go up. Petrol prices have also soared in recent weeks, while inflation is also pushing up the price of household food items. On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said surging oil and gas prices would lead to ""inevitable"" rises in food prices this year, with the increasing price of wheat also feeding through into higher prices for products such as chicken. The chancellor is expected to say the war in Ukraine will make these price pressures worse - but add that a stronger British economy is vital in responding to the ""challenge to our values"" presented by Russian President Vladimir Putin. His statement is also expected to set out government plans ""to create a new culture of enterprise"", including more training and investment. Expectation has been more muted than normal - given the horror of events in Ukraine - but the Spring Statement is still a significant event that matters for all of us. The decisions he announces at the dispatch box will affect the prices we pay; the pound in our pocket. Before the conflict, there was already a squeeze on everyone's wallet coming. Since the outbreak, day by day, the uncertainty around the economy, and the impact of what's unfolding, has only become more acute. Although every day brings new calls for more help with rocketing energy bills, the Treasury has been reluctant to move from the extra support they promised already, which was only announced last month. That's in part because the Treasury is instinctively cautious with cash. But also because price rises are so hard to predict and may go on for many, many months. Read more from Laura here Labour has criticised Mr Sunak ahead of his speech, branding him ""the high-tax chancellor"" and saying there is no evidence to believe his frequent claims that he wants to cut taxes in the long term. The SNP has also called for the National Insurance rise to be scrapped, dubbing Mr Sunak ""the poverty chancellor"" forremoving the Â£20 uplift for universal creditandbreaking his pledge to keep the pension triple lock. Some Conservative MPs have also called for the NI rise to be cancelled, with the official budget watchdog expected to say the UK's deficit - the difference between the government's income and what it spends - is better than last predicted in the autumn. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said this would give Mr Sunak room to help households with costs, but he would not be able to help people on ""average sorts of incomes"" with the increases. A cut to fuel duty has also been a key demand of Tory MPs in recent weeks, with more 50 Tory writing to Mr Sunak last week to make the demand. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who led the charge, said the country was ""heading to a de facto lockdown, where parents can't afford to take their kids to school [and] where workers can't afford to commute by car and have to stay at home"". But the Green Party said cutting fuel duty would not fix the cost of living crisis, and would be the wrong policy at the time of a climate emergency. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: ""We absolutely know people need help right now - but cuts to fuel duty aren't targeted to support the poorest and the greatest numbers of people."" Instead, the party wants a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to pay for the restoration and doubling of the universal credit uplift, and to extend emergency fuel payments. The Conservative Environment Network of Tory MPs is also making its own request, calling on Mr Sunak to cut VAT for energy-saving products and home installation to 5%. The group said the move would cut the cost of installing cavity insulation by Â£142 and loft insulation by Â£120 for the average household, helping to lower energy bills by up to Â£399 and Â£493 at the current energy price cap - and going even further when the rise kicks in. Tory MP Stephen Crabb said: ""Insulating homes is one of the quickest ways to lower people's energy bills and reduce our reliance on imported energy. ""With millions of draughty British homes and soaring energy bills, we should cut this tax on energy efficiency."" Inflation hits new 30-year high in February Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter?

Actress Amanda Bynes released from conservatorship,"Amanda Bynes, pictured in 2011, said she had ""been working hard to improve my health"" Former actress Amanda Bynes has been released from her nine-year conservatorship by a judge in California. The one-time child star was placed under the legal guardianship - similar tothat of Britney Spears- in 2013, while undergoing psychiatric care. Bynes, now 35, was known for The Amanda Show and films like What a Girl Wants, She's the Man and Easy A, but suffered drug and mental health problems. On Tuesday, Judge Roger L Lund said the conservatorship was no longer required. ""She's done everything the court has asked over a long period of time,"" he said,according to the New York Times,external. A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions. Under the arrangement, Bynes' mother supervised her daughter's financial and personal affairs including her medical decisions. In a statement to People,external, Bynes thanked fans ""for their love and well wishes during this time"". ""I would also like to thank my lawyer and my parents for their support over the last nine years,"" she said. ""In the last several years, I have been working hard to improve my health so that I can live and work independently, and I will continue to prioritize my well-being in this next chapter."" Bynes' drug use started with marijuana at the age of 16, but her problems deepened when she started taking Adderall, a prescription medicine used to treat people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). She retired from acting in 2010, and the conservatorship came about after Bynes was taken to hospital for a mental health assessment, having thought to havestarted a small fire in the drive of a home in California. There had also been erratic behaviour and brushes with the law including charges of drink-driving, hit and run and driving with a suspended licence. She waseventually sentenced to three years probation. Bynes also made headlines for her Twitter rants, which she later said left her ""ashamed and embarrassed"".

Ed Sheeran awaits verdict in 'traumatising' trial,"Shape of You won the Grammy Award for best pop solo performance in 2018 Ed Sheeran faces a wait of ""days and weeks"" to learn the outcome of a High Court trial over his hit Shape of You. The star has been accused of copying part of the song from another artist. In closing arguments, grime artist Sami Chokri's barrister said there was an ""indisputable similarity between the works"". But Mr Sheeran's lawyer said the case against him was ""so strained as to be logically unintelligible"". Mr Justice Zacaroli said he would ""take some time to consider my judgment"". The 11-day trial ended on Tuesday. Ian Mill QC, representing Mr Sheeran, said it had been ""deeply traumatising"" for the star and his co-writers, Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac. He described the dispute as ""terribly, terribly unfortunate"" and argued that the case ""should never have gone to trial"". Music experts disagree in Ed Sheeran court case Songwriter says he 'feels robbed' by Ed Sheeran Ed Sheeran sings Nina Simone during copyright case Mr Sheeran, who has attended the court throughout, listened attentively to the closing arguments with his hands clasped together. During the trial, the superstar has been described as a ""magpie"" who ""borrows"" ideas from other artists. The dispute revolves around similarities between Shape of You and Oh Why by Mr Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch. The contentious part is the ""Oh I, oh I, oh I"" hook that follows the chorus in Shape of You. Mr Chokri and his co-writer Ross O'Donoghue say it is almost identical to the chorus of their song, which was released two years earlier. Allow YouTube content?

Their barrister Andrew Sutcliffe QC suggested the chances of the two songs being written independently were ""minutely small"" and accused Mr Sheeran of ""inconsistencies"" and ""evasiveness"" in his testimony. Mr Sutcliffe also claimed ""material documents"" linked to the writing of Shape of You ""have been lost or deleted, with no adequate explanation"". Mr Sheeran and his co-authors said they had disclosed all relevant material at their disposal. The court heard how Shape of You was written ""extraordinarily quickly"" in October 2016, with the basic track completed in under an hour. Mr Sutcliffe claimed this meant Mr Sheeran had entered the studio with the melody from Oh Why ""consciously or unconsciously in his head"". ""Such speed is indicative of copying,"" he said in a written closing statement. Sami Chokri has described the High Court case as ""the worst few weeks of my life"" Mr Sheeran's lawyer disagreed. ""Speed is indicative of the genius of Mr Sheeran and his ability to work at a speed no-one else can,"" he told the court. He added that all three writers ""were categorically clear that they went into the writing session"" with ""no preconceived ideas as to whatever it was that they would write that day"". Mr Mill also argued that the similarities between the two songs were too ""generic"" to be protected by copyright. ""They comprise, in substance, the use of the first four notes of the minor pentatonic scale combined with the use of octaves and harmonies in a vocal chant,"" he argued. However, Mr Sutcliffe argued that Oh Why's chorus was ""extremely memorable"" and an ""earworm"". If Mr Sheeran did not consciously copy it, he said, a likely explanation was that it became ""part of the echo chamber of references, songs and ideas that [he] holds in his mind, which re-surfaced in October 2016 without him realising it"". At the heart of the trial was the issue of whether Mr Sheeran had ever heard Oh Why. On the witness stand, he and his co-writers all denied prior knowledge of the song, saying they only became aware of it when the legal proceedings began. The defendants insisted Mr Sheeran would have had the chance to hear it, describing a ""concerted plan"" to get the track into his hands in the hope of an endorsement. To that end, they promoted Oh Why to several people in Mr Sheeran's circle, although not the star himself. Giving evidence, Mr Chokri said he was certain one of them would have played Oh Why to the musician - but ""I can't tell you exactly which because I don't know"". Sheeran's writing partner Johnny McDaid is also a member of chart-topping band Snow Patrol Mr Sutcliffe said the chance that Mr Sheeran was not aware of Mr Chokri in 2016 was ""vanishingly small"" because they had both appeared on YouTube channel SBTV in 2010, they shared friends, and Mr Chokri had tweeted him and allegedly met him. Mr Mill countered that there was no evidence that anyone had ever played Oh Why to Mr Sheeran. Furthermore, he noted that no-one who had been sent the track had been specifically asked to pass it on to the star. He claimed there were ""hundreds of videos"" on SBTV that Mr Sheeran ""never saw or watched"", and that Oh Why itself had never featured on the channel. The implication that the star had ""remembered, followed and sought out Sami Switch on another platform"" six years after they had appeared on SBTV was a ""preposterous jump"", he said, adding: ""It is quite clear from all the evidence that the promotion of Oh Why was an absolute failure"". Shape of You was the biggest hit of 2017 and remains the most-streamed song of all time on Spotify, with more than three billion plays. It earns Mr Sheeran, Mr McDaid and Mr Mac about Â£5m a year, the court heard, despite almost 10% of the payments being frozen due to the ongoing dispute. The case dates back to 2018, when the writers asked the High Court to declare they had not infringed Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue's copyright. In July 2018, the pair issued their own claim for ""copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement"". As the trial ended on Tuesday, Mr Justice Zacaroli told both sides he would deliver his judgment ""as soon as I can"". Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Sunak to give Spring Statement amid price pressuresThe chancellor will give his economic update to the Commons as the cost of living crisis continues.UK Politics,"The Treasury shared pictures of Chancellor Rishi Sunak preparing his statement Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Spring Statement later, against a backdrop of rising energy, fuel and food costs. He is expected to announce measures to help people with the cost of living, including a cut to fuel tax. He has come under increasing pressure to act, with prices rising by 6.2% in the 12 months to February - thefastest for 30 years. Labour wants him to go further and scrap a planned tax hike next month. National Insurance is set to rise by 1.25p in the pound to pay for healthcare - but the party has said the increase is the wrong way to fund investment. Mr Sunak has ruled out scrapping the increase to NI, but there is speculation he could allow people to earn more before they have to start paying it. However, the full details of Mr Sunak's speech will not be known until he takes to the dispatch box at 12:30 GMT. What to expect from Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement How could the chancellor's plans affect you? How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you? Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? The Spring Statement, one of two financial statements the chancellor makes every year, does not normally see big tax and spending decisions announced. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation. Millions of households are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government'sprice cap to contain recent rises is set to go up. Petrol prices have also soared in recent weeks, while inflation is also pushing up the price of household food items. On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice said surging oil and gas prices would lead to ""inevitable"" rises in food prices this year, with the increasing price of wheat also feeding through into higher prices for products such as chicken. The chancellor is expected to say the war in Ukraine will make these price pressures worse - but add that a stronger British economy is vital in responding to the ""challenge to our values"" presented by Russian President Vladimir Putin. His statement is also expected to set out government plans ""to create a new culture of enterprise"", including more training and investment. Expectation has been more muted than normal - given the horror of events in Ukraine - but the Spring Statement is still a significant event that matters for all of us. The decisions he announces at the dispatch box will affect the prices we pay; the pound in our pocket. Before the conflict, there was already a squeeze on everyone's wallet coming. Since the outbreak, day by day, the uncertainty around the economy, and the impact of what's unfolding, has only become more acute. Although every day brings new calls for more help with rocketing energy bills, the Treasury has been reluctant to move from the extra support they promised already, which was only announced last month. That's in part because the Treasury is instinctively cautious with cash. But also because price rises are so hard to predict and may go on for many, many months. Read more from Laura here Labour has criticised Mr Sunak ahead of his speech, branding him ""the high-tax chancellor"" and saying there is no evidence to believe his frequent claims that he wants to cut taxes in the long term. The SNP has also called for the National Insurance rise to be scrapped, dubbing Mr Sunak ""the poverty chancellor"" forremoving the Â£20 uplift for universal creditandbreaking his pledge to keep the pension triple lock. Some Conservative MPs have also called for the NI rise to be cancelled, with the official budget watchdog expected to say the UK's deficit - the difference between the government's income and what it spends - is better than last predicted in the autumn. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said this would give Mr Sunak room to help households with costs, but he would not be able to help people on ""average sorts of incomes"" with the increases. A cut to fuel duty has also been a key demand of Tory MPs in recent weeks, with more 50 Tory writing to Mr Sunak last week to make the demand. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who led the charge, said the country was ""heading to a de facto lockdown, where parents can't afford to take their kids to school [and] where workers can't afford to commute by car and have to stay at home"". But the Green Party said cutting fuel duty would not fix the cost of living crisis, and would be the wrong policy at the time of a climate emergency. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: ""We absolutely know people need help right now - but cuts to fuel duty aren't targeted to support the poorest and the greatest numbers of people."" Instead, the party wants a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to pay for the restoration and doubling of the universal credit uplift, and to extend emergency fuel payments. The Conservative Environment Network of Tory MPs is also making its own request, calling on Mr Sunak to cut VAT for energy-saving products and home installation to 5%. The group said the move would cut the cost of installing cavity insulation by Â£142 and loft insulation by Â£120 for the average household, helping to lower energy bills by up to Â£399 and Â£493 at the current energy price cap - and going even further when the rise kicks in. Tory MP Stephen Crabb said: ""Insulating homes is one of the quickest ways to lower people's energy bills and reduce our reliance on imported energy. ""With millions of draughty British homes and soaring energy bills, we should cut this tax on energy efficiency."" Inflation hits new 30-year high in February Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter?

"Becker used business account as piggy bank, court toldThe former tennis champion is accused of spending the money on school fees and designer clothes.","Boris Becker, the six-time Grand Slam tennis champion, was using his business account as a ""piggy bank"" to pay for personal expenses, a court has heard. He spent money from his business account on his children's school fees, designer clothes and shopping at the luxury store, Harrods, jurors heard. The 54-year-old, who commentated for the BBC last year, is on trial at Southwark Crown Court charged with 24 offences under the Insolvency Act. He denies all charges. The charges relate to his June 2017 bankruptcy over a Â£3.5m bank loan for a property in Mallorca, Spain. He is accused of hiding, or failing to hand over, assets before and after his bankruptcy. As the second day of Mr Becker's trial got under way, the jury heard the former world number one spent hundreds of pounds at Harrods, bought online groceries at Ocado and treated himself to Ralph Lauren clothes. The German national is alleged to have hidden â¬1.13 million (Â£940,000) from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into his Boris Becker Private Office (BBPOL) account. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said: ""It is the prosecution case that Mr Becker used the BBPOL sterling account as an extension of his own account, effectively as his own piggy bank, for everyday personal expenses such as school fees for the children and such like."" She said payments in 2017 included Â£643 to Polo Ralph Lauren, Â£7,600 in school fees, Â£976 at Harrods and more than Â£1,000 at Ocado. Ms Chalkley told jurors Mr Becker paid his ex-wife Barbara Becker â¬23,000 (Â£19,000), estranged wife Sharell ""Lilly"" Becker â¬100,000 (Â£83,000) and transferred Â£225,000 to a friend. The prosecutor added that he also transferred â¬300,000 (Â£249,000) to his own account, while other funds went into an account he jointly held with his son. Mr Becker is also accused of failing to hand over assets including trophies he received as a result of his 1985 and 1989 Wimbledon men's singles title, his Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996 and his 1992 Olympic gold medal. He also allegedly failed to declare two German properties, as well as his interest in a flat in Chelsea, west London, and hid a â¬825,000 (Â£686,000) bank loan. The prosecution is being brought by the Insolvency Service on behalf of the business secretary. On Monday at the start of the trial, Judge Deborah Taylor instructed the jury of 11 men and one woman to ignore Mr Becker's celebrity. ""You must treat him in exactly the same way you would treat someone you have not heard of and is not in the public eye,"" she said. The 24 charges include: Nine counts of failing to deliver up trophies and other awards; Seven counts of concealing property totalling more than â¬1.5m Five counts of failing to disclose estate, including the properties in Germany and London, shares and a bank account Two of removal of property amounting to almost â¬500,000 One of concealing â¬825,000 of debt The trial, expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

US removes Trump-era tariffs on UK steel,"The UK had hoped for a free trade deal with the US The US has agreed to ease Trump-era tariffs on UK steel and aluminium shipments, resolving an issue that had strained relations between the allies. The move follows earlier deals with the European Union and Japan over the controversial taxes, which were imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018 in the name of national security. In exchange, the UK will suspend extra taxes it had put on US products such as bourbon and Levi's jeans. Business groups welcomed the decision. Under the agreement, the US will replace the 25% tariffs on steel with a quota system. The policy will let UK metal imports into the country duty-free up to a certain level - the quota - before taxes kick in again. The deal will come into effect on 1 June. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the deal had removed a ""very frustrating irritant"", calling the agreement ""good news for the steel and aluminium sectors, which support the jobs of over 80,000 people across the UK"". ""It means our manufacturers can now enjoy a high level of tariff-free access to the US market once again,"" she said. ""Hopefully we can now move forward and focus on deepening our thriving trading relationship with the US."" US officials also welcomed the suspension of the UK retaliatory tariffs, which they said affected about $500m (Â£377m) worth in annual trade. ""The historical deal announced today delivers on President Biden's vision to repair relationships with our allies while also helping to ensure the long-term viability of our steel and aluminium industries,"" said Ambassador Katherine Tai. However, in an interview with the BBC, Ms Tai, the top US trade negotiator, refused to be drawn as to when or if discussions for a formal free trade agreement might start. ""I think the issue is what kind of collaboration is going to be fit for the purpose of addressing the challenges that we have today,"" she said. ""I'm not going to exclude any options."" The Biden administration has prioritised domestic goals ahead of trade, said economist Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. While that could change as the US seeks stronger relations with allies in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he said there's no evidence of that happening yet. ""The US administration has not made any signs that they want to do trade agreements with anybody anytime soon,"" he said. ""That would be a big change."" The Biden administration's low prioritisation of trade matters marks a major shift from former president Donald Trump, who made it a signature area of focus, using tariffs as bargaining chips in diplomacy. He set off a firestorm of criticism in the US and abroad when he announced the 25% tax on foreign steel shipments and 15% tax on foreign aluminium, citing a need to preserve America's manufacturing base and rejecting concerns that tariffs raise prices. After allies, including the UK, hit US products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles in retaliation, Mr Trump backed off the duties for certain countries, including Canada, opting for quotas instead. US President Joe Biden later reached similar deals with the European Union and Japan. The approach has won praise in the US, including from groups like United Steel Workers for responding to the concerns of allies while still providing protection for US manufacturers. With many steel plants located in key election states, maintaining support from those workers is important for Mr Biden. On Tuesday the union praised the new deal for measures it said would help safeguard against unfairly subsidised steel production, such as mandatory annual audits of British Steel, which has a Chinese parent company. Business lobby UK Steel also praised the deal, saying it would be ""felt by steel companies and their employees right across the UK and is immensely welcome"". But with the quotas in place, consumers are unlikely to see benefits like lower prices, said Phil Levy, economist for Flexport. ""Replacing tariffs with a system of quotas is actually moving away from transparency on these things and it does not get you the benefits of free trade,"" he said. American spirits exporters toasted the deal, which should make their bourbon whiskeys cheaper for UK shoppers. ""Distillers throughout the United States are cheering the end of this long tariff nightmare,"" Distilled Spirits Council President Chris Swonger said. The US and UK traded more than $260bn worth of goods last year, of which the majority were exports from the US such as metals, aircraft parts, oil and gas. While America accounts for nearly one fifth of total UK trade, the UK market represents just 5% of US exports. Mr Bown said the US imports too little British steel for a deal to have significant impact on prices. For UK consumers of American products, the impact on prices is also likely to be marginal, he said. ""It can't hurt the consumer, so it will make them better off, but by how much is I think unclear,"" he said. With America buying Â£1 in every Â£6 of British exports, the cooling of tensions over steel has raised hopes of a reheating of the wider transatlantic trade relationship. Levi's jeans, Harley Davidson motorbikes, steel bars and bourbon whiskey became unlikely weapons in a painful battle that has waged since 2018, with their producers and consumers paying a hefty price. For them this ceasefire will be welcome, if overdue. At the heart of the dispute was the protection of American jobs. And if - and it's by no means certain - these developments are the first step towards the resumption of wider free-trade talks, that theme will continue to loom large, even if the man in the White House has changed. The Biden administration struck a deal with the EU over steel almost five months ago. There's been speculations that the UK was made to wait due to unease over the way Boris Johnson's government has handled post-Brexit trading arrangements in Ireland. The UK is keen to demonstrate its Brexit-era agility by notching up more trade agreements - but the US will be keen to continue showing it's calling the shots .

Everton-linked Usmanov has assets frozen,"Alisher Usmanov is a former Arsenal part-owner The Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who has commercial ties to Everton, has had his assets frozen by the European Union as it announced further sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Restrictions include a ""prohibition from making funds available"" and an EU travel ban. The Usmanov-owned company USM Holdings sponsors Everton's training ground. Usmanov also has an exclusive naming-rights option on Everton's new stadium. Everton owner Farhad Moshiri is the chairman of USM Holdings.

What sanctions are imposed on Russia?,"The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine. The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war. Announcing500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals. President Biden said the measures wouldalso target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp. The UKhas frozen the assets of six bosses at the prisonand banned them from travelling to the UK. The UK has also imposed new bans on Russianmetal, diamond and energy exports. The EU hasannounced sanctions on 200 organisations and people,externalwhich it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes. The sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia. Alexei Navalny: What we know about his death Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, haveimposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia,external. Their main target has been Russia's money. Foreign currency reserves worth $350bn (Â£276bn)- about half its total reserves - were frozen. About70% of the assets of Russian banks,externalwere also frozen, the EU says, and some wereexcluded from Swift, a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions. Western nations have also: banned exports of technology Russia might use for making weapons banned imports of gold and diamonds from Russia banned flights from Russia sanctioned oligarchs - the wealthy business people linked with the Kremlin  - and impounded their yachts Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea FC, is one oligarch who has been sanctioned Russia's oil industry has been another major target. The US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports. The G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies - has imposeda maximum price of $60 (Â£47) a barrel,externalon Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings. Hundreds of major firms, includingMcDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken,have stopped selling and making goods in Russia. However, some still do business in Russia. PepsiCo, for example, has been accused ofcontinuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered thatUS cosmetics firm Avonwas making goods in a factory near Moscow. President Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying:""We have growth, and they have decline."",external Russia has managed to selloil abroad for more than the G7's price cap,external, according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a""shadow fleet"" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it,external. The International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting8.3 million barrels of oil a day,external- having increased supplies to India and China. Russiais also able to import many sanctioned Western goods,externalby buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London. China has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,"" she says. ""Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help.""

However, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024. Nevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia,having cut 5% from the economic growth,externalit might have had over the past two years. But Dr Snegovaya suggests: ""Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come"".

Petrol prices stabilise after weeks at record highs,"Fuel prices have stabilised for the first time this month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a surge. Average fuel prices slipped from record highs on Monday, with petrol at nearly Â£1.67 a litre and diesel at Â£1.79. Crude oil surged to $139 per barrel in the first week of March, then slid back the following week. The RAC said the settling of prices could be an indication that retailers may have ""finished"" passing on their higher wholesale costs to customers. However, it is unclear if and when the cost of fuel will go down. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said Monday's prices had ""steadied with very slight reductions in both petrol and diesel"". UK fuel prices have increased at the fastest rate on record in recent weeks, with petrol rising 13p since the start of the month and diesel increasing by nearly 21p. How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you? Petrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highs Fuel prices, which were already rising as global economies recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, surged after the war in Ukraine pushed up oil prices. Changes in prices at the pump are mainly determined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Russia is one of the world's major oil exporters and it is being targeted by economic and trading sanctions. After Brent crude oil - a global benchmark for prices - hit a near 14-year high of $139 a barrel during the early stages of the conflict, prices fell back to around $100, but have since risen again to $115 on Tuesday. The most recent increase was driven by the European Union discussing a ban on the purchase of Russian oil, which countries in the bloc rely heavily on. Some countries, such as the US and Canada, have already banned on Russian oil imports, but the EU has so far stopped short of that action. Meanwhile, the UK government has vowed to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year. The UK only imports about 6% of its crude oil from Russia, but is affected by the global shifts in price. Mr Williams said the wholesale price of petrol for retailers currently stands at Â£1.30 a litre for petrol and Â£1.48 for diesel. ""With prices this high before retailer margin and 20% VAT are added it's clear we are in a tough place when it comes to being able to afford to drive,"" he said. ""This is why it's crucial the chancellor takes decisive and meaningful action in his Spring Statement that helps hard-pressed drivers and businesses."" More than 50 Conservative MPs have called for a cut in fuel duty, which is currently 57.95p per litre, and has VAT of 20% applied on top. Several newspapers have also reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a temporary cut of as much as 5p per litre, but some opposition MPs have questioned whether this would go far enough. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there were warnings of potential global oil supply problems. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said high commodity prices and sanctions against Russia were ""threatening to create a global oil supply shock"". It estimated three million barrels per day of Russian oil could be taken out of the global market as a result of international sanctions. The agency warned only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have enough spare production capacity to offset the shortfall in Russian output. Why are petrol prices going back up?

No survivors found at China plane crash siteCrash investigators do not yet know why a flight carrying 132 people plunged out of the sky.China,"Search and rescue workers trawling the slopes near the crash site are yet to find passengers Rescuers have found no survivors so far from a jet carrying 132 people which crashed in hills in southern China. Crash investigators also had no information on why China Eastern flight MU5735 plummeted out of the sky on Monday. Recovery work at the site of the Boeing 737-800 crash in Guangxi province is being hampered by difficult terrain. There has been an outpouring of grief in China, where families of passengers and crew are waiting for news. Hundreds of responders have been scouring the steeply forested slopes in Wuzhou where debris from the plane was strewn after it broke apart and set fire to the hillside. There had been no official word on casualties until China's Civil Aviation Administration held its news briefing, some 36 hours after the disaster. ""Up to now, search and rescue work has not found any survivors,"" Zhu Tao, aviation safety office director at the CAA, told reporters. ""Given the information currently available, we still do notÂ have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash."" Air controllers had repeatedly called theÂ aircraft during its descent but had received noÂ response, he added. Rescuers have so far found parts of the 737's burnt wreckage. State broadcasters showed images of the charred remains of letters, bags, wallets and identity cards belonging to those on board. Meanwhile, the families and friends of the 123 passengers and nine crew have gathered at each end of the flight - with relatives visiting China Eastern's offices in Yunnan province and waiting at Guangzhou International Airport. The China Eastern Airlines flight from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, had been due to land in Guangzhou on Monday afternoon. China Eastern has grounded all its Boeing 737-800s and set up a hotline for people seeking information on those on board. Authorities have yet to identify passengers and crew members, but some relatives have spoken to local media or shared their grief online. One woman reported the loss of her newly-wed husband on her WeChat account. Her earlier posts included videos of the couple's holiday trips. Other passengers included a group of six people, one of them a teenager, who were on their way to Guangzhou to attend a funeral, a local newspaper reported. Families waiting for news at Guangzhou International Airport on Monday night Another woman interviewed said her sister and close friends were part of that group, adding that she had also been booked on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very anguished,"" she told Jiemian News. Boeing jets under 'surveillance' after China crash How does a plane's black box work? Air disasters timeline Reuters quoted a man at the airport who said he was the colleague of a passenger named Mr Tan. After confirming that Mr Tan was on board, he had to break the news to Mr Tan's family. ""They were sobbing. His mother couldn't believe this had happened,"" he told the news agency. ""Her boy was only 29 years old."" He added that arrangements were being made by the airline to bring families to the crash site in Wuzhou. Pictures show distraught families waiting in a cordoned-off area at Guangzhou airport, being assisted by airline staff. One unverified clip circulating widely on Chinese social media shows a man slumped in his seat crying and lamenting the loss of his three children who were on the flight. This accident took place in China and involved a Chinese airline. As such, the investigation will be led by the country's civil aviation administration. But under international standards, the US will also be entitled to appoint an accredited representative because the Boeing 737 was designed and built in the US. The National Transportation Safety Board has already appointed a senior air safety investigator to fulfil this role. Representatives from Boeing itself, the engine maker CFM International and the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, will serve as technical advisers. The priority now will be to gather evidence from the crash site and search for the ""black boxes"", the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. If they can be found, and the data they contain is readable, then the immediate cause of the crash could become apparent quite quickly. But the investigation as a whole will take time. Flight MU5735 had been in the air for more than an hour and was nearing its destination when it suddenly plummeted from its cruising height. Chinese state TV outlets have broadcast footage which appears to show a jet in a near nosedive to the ground. The footage was captured by a car's dashcam. The BBC has not yet been able to verify the clip. Flight tracker data showed the Boeing 737-800 jet dropped thousands of metres in under three minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 model has a strong safety record, with thousands in service around the world. The aircraft that crashed was less than seven years old. Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes - including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision.

UK to compensate postmasters who exposed scandalStaff who uncovered the Post Office IT scandal but missed out on full compensation will get payouts.Business,"Subpostmasters who helped uncover the Post Office IT scandal but missed out on full compensation are to get payouts under a new government scheme. The 555 workers won a landmark civil case against the Post Office in 2019, but saw most of their settlements swallowed up by legal fees. They will now get the same level of compensation as other subpostmasters who were wrongly convicted. The announcement comes as a public inquiry into the scandal continues. Between 2000 and 2014, hundreds of subpostmasters and mistresses were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to faults in the Horizon computer software being used at branches across the UK. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Post Office scandal: I considered ending my life In 2019, a group of 555 subpostmasters and mistresses successfully challenged the Post Office over the accusations in the High Court. That case set a legal precedent and paved the way for a series of cases in which 72 people had criminal convictions overturned. The Post Office opened a historic shortfall scheme to compensate more than 700 wrongfully convicted former branch managers who had personally covered shortfalls in branch accounts caused by the Horizon software. But the 555 people who won the High Court case could not participate in the scheme, and despite winning nearly Â£43m in compensation in 2019, the group's funds were swallowed up due to a ""no win, no fee"" agreement with Therium, the company which funded the litigation. The group only got a ""small fraction"" of the settlement equating to around Â£20,000 each, the Treasury said. Therium has agreed to waive its rights to any claim on the new pot of compensation. Business minister Paul Scully told the BBC's Today programme that the compensation paid to the 555 people would be ""absolutely parallel"" to the other Post Office workers who had been compensated through the historic shortfall scheme. He said the group were ""pioneers"" and had ""broken open"" the scandal. ""I want to make sure they get that full compensation,"" he said. ""It is a massive scandal and it's something I am absolutely determined to put right."" Asked if the families of 32 out of the 555 people who have since died would be able to receive the compensation, Mr Scully said he would look into it. This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Scully said he envisaged the compensation scheme as running alongside the historic shortfall scheme ""on the basis of losses, and looking at ongoing losses as well"". ""I'd love to say I've got a blank cheque from the Treasury, but that's clearly not going to happen from this place - but the Treasury know that we need to sort it out. ""I want to make sure that the scheme has the confidence of [subpostmasters],"" he added. Following the government's announcement, the Post Office said it welcomed the move. ""Since it came to light through media reports that around Â£46m of the compensation provided to group litigation claimants was directed to the funders of their case, we have continually urged the government to address this unfairness,"" a statement said. It's hard to overstate the importance of the legal precedent set by the victory of 555 subpostmasters two and a half years ago. That was the moment that evidence came into the public domain about the flaws with the Post Office's Horizon system, and back-end access to the software. The judge did not hold back in his opinion of the Post Office, saying the system was not remotely robust, but that getting that information out of the Post Office had taken subpostmasters years, and many tens of millions of pounds in costs. It was the moment where the tables turned against a crown institution which had been wrongly convicting, bankrupting, and sacking its own employees for decades. Their David v. Goliath legal battle has proved the ammunition needed for 706 branch managers who were convicted or sent to prison have been able to get those convictions quashed. It also forced the Post Office to agree to refund 2,500 others for huge financial losses they suffered as result, although most still haven't received a penny of that money. The 555 original legal trailblazers stood and cheered as their legal victory snowballed, but were left with very little in compensation themselves. This new scheme is promising to set that right. Full details of how to claim have not yet been published, and there's still a lot of nervousness from those who had to fight the Post Office and the government at every turn, but this is the clearest statement yet that a fairer payment is on the way. The new compensation scheme comes as High Court judge Sir Wyn Williams leads a public inquiry into the Post Office scandal, which has heard testimonies from Post Office staff, some of which were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes they didn't commit. A total of 72 have had their names cleared so far. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - is examining whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system, Horizon, which was developed by Japanese company Fujitsu. It will also ask how and why they were left to shoulder the blame. The Post Office has previously said it is ""sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families and we are in no doubt about the human cost"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. The Department for Business has previously said it is ""eager to see all Horizon-related issues resolved fairly and quickly, including for the 555, who played a crucial role in bringing this scandal to light"".

Why Mariupol is so important to Russia's plan,"Mariupol has become the most heavily bombed and damaged city in Ukraine's war with Russia - having suffered the brunt of sustained Russian attacks. It is key to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. But why? There are four main reasons why taking the port city would be such a strategic win for Russia - and a major blow for Ukraine. Geographically, the city of Mariupol occupies only a tiny area on the map but it now stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula. They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. General Sir Richard Barrons - former commander of UK Joint Forces Command - says capturing Mariupol is vital to Russia's war effort. ""When the Russians feel they have successfully concluded that battle, they will have completed a land bridge from Russia to Crimea and they will see this as a major strategic success."" If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline - cutting-off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. By holding out against advancing forces for the past three weeks, the defending Ukrainians have managed to preoccupy a large number of Russian troops. But that failure by Russia to secure a rapid capture of the city, has prompted Russian commanders to resort to a 21st Century version of mediaeval siege tactics. They have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying over 90% of the city. They have also cut off access to electricity, heating, fresh water, food and medical supplies - creating a man-made humanitarian catastrophe which Moscow now blames on Ukraine for refusing to surrender by an 05:00 deadline on Monday. A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of ""trying to starve Mariupol into surrender"". Ukraine has vowed to defend the city down to the last soldier. It may well come to that. Russian troops are slowly pushing into the centre and, in the absence of any kind of workable peace deal, Russia is now likely to intensify its bombardment - drawing little if any distinction between its armed defenders and the beleaguered civilian population which still numbers over 200,000. If, and when, Russia takes full control of Mariupol this will free up close to 6,000 of its troops - organised into 1,000-strong battalion tactical groups - to then go and reinforce other Russian fronts around Ukraine. There are a number of possibilities as to where they could be redeployed: to the north-east to join the battle to encircle and destroy Ukraine's regular armed forces fighting pro-Kremlin separatists in the Donbas region to the west to push towards Odesa, which would be Ukraine's last remaining major outlet to the Black Sea to the north-west towards the city of Dnipro Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion Mariupol has long-been a strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, part of the Black Sea. With its deep berths, it is the biggest port in the Azov Sea region and home to a major iron and steel works. In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond. Ukrainian concrete defences on a beach by Mariupol port, 17 February For eight years now, since Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the city has been sandwiched uncomfortably between Russian forces on that peninsula and the pro-Kremlin separatists in the breakaway self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, named after the Sea of Azov which links Mariupol to the rest of the Black Sea. The Azov Brigade contains far-right extremists, historically including neo-Nazis. Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has been a useful propaganda tool for Moscow, giving it a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis. Azov Battalion training camp at a former holiday resort near Mariupol, February 2019 If Russia manages to capture alive significant numbers of Azov Brigade fighters it is likely they will be paraded on Russian state-controlled media as part of the ongoing information war to discredit Ukraine and its government. The capture of Mariupol by Russia, if it happens, will be psychologically significant for both sides in this war. A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. For President Putin, for whom this war appears to be personal, there is a historical significance to all this. He sees Ukraine's Black Sea coastline as belonging to something called Novorossiya (New Russia) - Russian lands that date back to the 18th Century empire. Putin wants to revive that concept, ""rescuing Russians from the tyranny of a pro-western government in Kyiv"" as he sees it. Mariupol currently stands in the way of him achieving that aim. But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow - not just militarily and economically - but also to the minds of the men and women fighting on the ground, defending their country. Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to the Russians after Kherson, a strategically much less important city that was barely defended. There is another morale aspect here and that is of deterrence. Digging graves by the roadside in Mariupol, 20 March Mariupol has put up fierce resistance - but look at the cost. The city is decimated, it lies largely in ruins. It will go down in history alongside Grozny and Aleppo, places that Russia eventually bombed and shelled into submission, reducing them to rubble. The message to other Ukrainian cities is stark - if you choose to resist like Mariupol did then you can expect the same fate. ""The Russians couldn't walk into Mariupol,"" says Gen Sir Richard Barrons, ""they couldn't drive in with their tanks, so they've pounded it to rubble. And that's what we should expect to see anywhere else that really matters to them.""

Hard choices for surrogate mothers and parents,"A nurse with a baby in Kyiv's underground nursery On the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Svetlana found it hard to believe that what she was watching on the news was really happening. Things were calm in her home town, Bila Tserkva, a historic city on a winding river 80km (50 miles) south of Kyiv. Then the explosions began. Svetlana and her husband dragged their mattresses into the corridor of their apartment building and huddled there with their three children. The noise of the sirens was constant and they didn't sleep for days. Thousands of miles away in Australia, Emma Micallif was frantically messaging. The two women are intimately connected because Svetlana is pregnant with Emma's second child. As rockets fell on Bila Tserkva Emma felt angry and helpless. For six months the two mums had chatted back and forth using a translation app. They shared pictures of their children, discussed the things they liked to bake with their kids or moaned about the stress of pandemic home-schooling. Now they were trying to co-ordinate an evacuation. ""I thought having cancer was stressful or having a baby while having treatment was stressful or having round after round of IVF and it not working was stressful,"" Emma says. ""But it just does not compare."" With the help of the surrogacy agency, Emma got in touch with two other parents who had surrogates in Ukraine. They found a bus that would take the three women and their 10 children on an 18-hour trip to the Moldovan border. When they finally got to the Moldovan capital they were crammed into a small apartment. Emma was horrified when she heard that there weren't enough beds. ""Our lovely, pregnant Svetlana was sleeping on the floor,"" she says. But Svetlana was too devastated to care. She had left her husband behind in Ukraine and her mother had fled to Germany. When her mother calls she just cries down the phone. ""It hurts so much that this war is tearing families apart,"" she told me. ""I feel safe in Moldova but my heart is in Ukraine."" More than 2,000 children are born through surrogacy every year in Ukraine, the majority to foreign couples. The country has around 50 reproductive clinics and many agencies and middle-men who match couples - known as ""intended parents"" - to surrogates. Ukraine is a popular choice because of the way its laws on surrogacy are written. In many European countries, including the UK, when a surrogate gives birth she is listed as the mother on the birth certificate. If she is married, her husband will be listed as the father. In Ukraine the intended parents are listed as mother and father. That means getting the baby a passport and bringing them home is much simpler. The agency that Emma and Svetlana are using is small - it is currently managing nine surrogacies - but Ukraine's biggest agency currently has 500 surrogates at different stages of pregnancy. This video can not be played Watch: Surrogate babies waiting for parents in a bomb shelter in Kyiv, Ukraine Forty-one babies in its care are stranded in Kyiv, because their intended parents, from all over the world, have been prevented from collecting them by the war. Many of these children are being cared for in a basement nursery in Kyiv as Russian forces sit outside the city and shell it. Every day more children are born, but since the invasion only nine sets of parents have risked the journey to Kyiv to pick up their babies. Another five have arranged remote pick-ups. ""If nothing changes in the near future, we may have 100 babies under our care,"" says Denys Herman, the agency's legal adviser. The company has been grappling with whether to move the babies out of Kyiv to a safer location in western Ukraine, but transporting them in a war zone also carries risks. It's not just Denys Herman who has a problem with stranded babies. Nastya was saving up to buy a house in Kharkiv, where she lives with her two young boys, and coming to the end of her second surrogate pregnancy. When the war broke out she was only weeks from her due date and went into labour to give birth to twins a few days later. A Ukrainian territorial defence soldier examines a burnt-out Russian military vehicle in Kharkiv ""We spent the entire time in the hospital in a bomb shelter,"" she says. Kharkiv was under heavy bombardment and the hospital's basement was packed from wall to wall with mattresses and baby cribs. She camped out in a storage room with her two children, sleeping on sofa cushions on the floor, underneath shelves piled high with files and paperwork. ""But the doctors were wonderful, I am very grateful to them,"" she says. She gave birth to two healthy boys. A week later she left the hospital. Kharkiv was still under attack and the foreign parents couldn't get there to collect the twins. So, together with some staff from her agency, Nastya, her two sons and the new-born twins travelled across Ukraine. She cared for the babies while delivering them to their parents at the border. That was more than a week ago, and she hasn't heard from them since. When Emma envisages the family she wants, she thinks of the drive from her home in Canberra to her parent's place in Sydney. She imagines looking into the back seat and seeing a gaggle of children. Instead, she has one. ""It just feels like a hole in my life,"" she says. Five years ago while she was pregnant with her son, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. The tumour was growing at an alarming rate, helped along by the hormones she produced in pregnancy. It was a rare medical event and when her son was born doctors crowded into the delivery room to observe. ""He came out perfect, he didn't have to go into the neonatal ICU, so I felt very lucky,"" she says. When her son was only five weeks old, she started intense radiation and chemotherapy which damaged her reproductive organs. ""I went into early menopause at 29. So that was delightful,"" she says wryly. In the five years since her cancer diagnosis, Emma's every waking moment has been consumed by thoughts of how to conceive her second child. She and her husband went through 13 cycles of IVF which were traumatic and expensive, but none of the embryos would ultimately take. ""Surrogacy is never anyone's first pick but it comes as a result of a deep loss beforehand,"" she says. Emma and her husband, Alex, struggled to find a surrogate in Australia where only altruistic surrogacy is allowed. When they first heard about the option of Ukraine they were hesitant but they were reassured by other Australians who'd had a good experience. With their first surrogate, two attempts at pregnancy didn't take, causing further heartbreak. When they were matched with Svetlana and she got pregnant right away it felt like the battle was finally over. ""It was such a relief that we could stop fighting. We'd been in a state of fight or flight, as husband and wife, for so long."" Emma Micallif, Alex and their son Before the war, the whole family had planned to travel to Ukraine. Emma had hoped to spend time with Svetlana so that she could tell her new child about her birth mother. With the baby due in a month that's unlikely to happen now. But for some intended parents the war is making the relationship with their surrogates even closer. Christine (not her real name) woke up on the day of the invasion and felt sick. Her surrogate was in Zaporizhzhia, in the south-east of Ukraine, which would make headlines a few days later when its nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, was attacked by Russian forces. Her surrogate, Tatiana (also not her real name) left for Poland that day with her six-year-old son. Christine marvels at her strength. When she asked Tatiana if she was interested in coming to England Christine wasn't sure how she would react. But she was delighted. ""We can come next week,"" she said. She is one of only four or five women applying for a bespoke visa created by the Home Office for surrogate mothers. ""The past few days have been unbearably traumatic in what's already been a traumatic year,"" Christine says. Last January she and her husband lost a child, a daughter who was born prematurely and died at five weeks old. At one point during the delivery her husband was told he might have to choose between Christine and the baby. She was advised not to try again but she did and miscarried again. ""Because I was impatient and grieving and wanting it now, we looked abroad."" They found out Tatiana was pregnant in January this year. ""It was kind of too good to be true,"" she says. On Sunday Christine flew to Poland to meet Tatiana for the first time. Both were nervous, but relaxed when a Polish doctor said the results of the first scan were good. Now they are working hard to get to know each other, using Google translate. ""Yesterday, we had a discussion about our spiritual beliefs, whether we believe in clairvoyance and all those things. It's not just all about pregnancy,"" she says. The visa will last three years and Christine and her husband have invited Tatiana to stay with them for as long as she wants to, beyond the birth of their child. In Mariupol, children bear the brunt of Putin's war Pregnant woman and baby die after hospital shelled 'We try to tell them the truth' - parenting in wartime Surrogacy is legal in the UK, but under English law the surrogate's name will be on the birth certificate, along with Christine's husband's. Legal parenthood will then have to be transferred from Tatiana to Christine. If the baby is born in a third country there are even more legal complications. And that's left Svetlana, Emma and Alex with a dilemma. Surrogacy is not permitted in Moldova. If the baby is born there, Svetlana will be its legal guardian. She could place it for adoption but then it could be years before Emma and Alex are allowed to take their child home. So together they have come up with a plan for Svetlana to deliver the baby in a city close to the border. Svetlana has mixed feelings about going back to Ukraine. ""There's shooting everywhere, homes are being reduced to rubble and the Russians are shelling maternity hospitals, kindergartens and schools,"" she says. On the other hand, she is desperate to see her husband, who can't leave the country under the terms of Ukraine's martial law. A mother waits to give birth in a hospital basement in Mykolaiv For Emma, the idea of Svetlana returning to a war zone is hard to take. ""If you'd asked me a year ago, I'd say 'No, I wouldn't do that.' Because it's just not what we should be doing. It's not what should be happening,"" she says. One possible snag is that it could take weeks for the baby's birth certificate to be issued. If that happens Emma and Alex are not sure what they will do. The war has left thousands of surrogates and intended parents in equally terrible positions. Cyrille, who is French, struggled to get in touch with his surrogate in Kharkiv for two weeks after the invasion. When eventually he did, he helped her to come to Paris where he hopes she will stay until she gives birth in August. But she has left her children in western Ukraine with their father, who didn't want them to leave. Natasha, a surrogate in Cherkasy is 10 weeks pregnant with the baby of a couple in the US. She is tormented by sirens, shelling and morning sickness. ""This is not life, it's a nightmare,"" she says. Just a few days before the war, I spoke to another surrogate who is pregnant with a baby girl for a couple in Spain. Maryna lived close to Svetlana in the town of Uzyn. When we spoke she was getting ready to move to Kyiv for the last two months of her pregnancy. ""Kyiv is always going to be a safe place because it's so far from the Donbas,"" she said. Even after Russia invaded she struggled to imagine how bad things could get. ""I really hope that a brain will appear in Putin's head and he will start to withdraw his troops. Because Ukrainian and Russian mothers didn't give birth to children so that they would fight."" Just after Svetlana arrived safely in Moldova, Emma felt a moment of bittersweet relief. ""She sent me a photo of her youngest daughter with a soft-serve ice cream from McDonalds and a balloon and the biggest smile on her face. And I just completely broke down,"" Emma says. It reminded her of what every child should be doing, enjoying her life safely, with her family.

No survivors found at China plane crash site,"Search and rescue workers trawling the slopes near the crash site are yet to find passengers Rescuers have found no survivors so far from a jet carrying 132 people which crashed in hills in southern China. Crash investigators also had no information on why China Eastern flight MU5735 plummeted out of the sky on Monday. Recovery work at the site of the Boeing 737-800 crash in Guangxi province is being hampered by difficult terrain. There has been an outpouring of grief in China, where families of passengers and crew are waiting for news. Hundreds of responders have been scouring the steeply forested slopes in Wuzhou where debris from the plane was strewn after it broke apart and set fire to the hillside. There had been no official word on casualties until China's Civil Aviation Administration held its news briefing, some 36 hours after the disaster. ""Up to now, search and rescue work has not found any survivors,"" Zhu Tao, aviation safety office director at the CAA, told reporters. ""Given the information currently available, we still do notÂ have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash."" Air controllers had repeatedly called theÂ aircraft during its descent but had received noÂ response, he added. Rescuers have so far found parts of the 737's burnt wreckage. State broadcasters showed images of the charred remains of letters, bags, wallets and identity cards belonging to those on board. Meanwhile, the families and friends of the 123 passengers and nine crew have gathered at each end of the flight - with relatives visiting China Eastern's offices in Yunnan province and waiting at Guangzhou International Airport. The China Eastern Airlines flight from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, had been due to land in Guangzhou on Monday afternoon. China Eastern has grounded all its Boeing 737-800s and set up a hotline for people seeking information on those on board. Authorities have yet to identify passengers and crew members, but some relatives have spoken to local media or shared their grief online. One woman reported the loss of her newly-wed husband on her WeChat account. Her earlier posts included videos of the couple's holiday trips. Other passengers included a group of six people, one of them a teenager, who were on their way to Guangzhou to attend a funeral, a local newspaper reported. Families waiting for news at Guangzhou International Airport on Monday night Another woman interviewed said her sister and close friends were part of that group, adding that she had also been booked on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very anguished,"" she told Jiemian News. Boeing jets under 'surveillance' after China crash How does a plane's black box work? Air disasters timeline Reuters quoted a man at the airport who said he was the colleague of a passenger named Mr Tan. After confirming that Mr Tan was on board, he had to break the news to Mr Tan's family. ""They were sobbing. His mother couldn't believe this had happened,"" he told the news agency. ""Her boy was only 29 years old."" He added that arrangements were being made by the airline to bring families to the crash site in Wuzhou. Pictures show distraught families waiting in a cordoned-off area at Guangzhou airport, being assisted by airline staff. One unverified clip circulating widely on Chinese social media shows a man slumped in his seat crying and lamenting the loss of his three children who were on the flight. This accident took place in China and involved a Chinese airline. As such, the investigation will be led by the country's civil aviation administration. But under international standards, the US will also be entitled to appoint an accredited representative because the Boeing 737 was designed and built in the US. The National Transportation Safety Board has already appointed a senior air safety investigator to fulfil this role. Representatives from Boeing itself, the engine maker CFM International and the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, will serve as technical advisers. The priority now will be to gather evidence from the crash site and search for the ""black boxes"", the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. If they can be found, and the data they contain is readable, then the immediate cause of the crash could become apparent quite quickly. But the investigation as a whole will take time. Flight MU5735 had been in the air for more than an hour and was nearing its destination when it suddenly plummeted from its cruising height. Chinese state TV outlets have broadcast footage which appears to show a jet in a near nosedive to the ground. The footage was captured by a car's dashcam. The BBC has not yet been able to verify the clip. Flight tracker data showed the Boeing 737-800 jet dropped thousands of metres in under three minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 model has a strong safety record, with thousands in service around the world. The aircraft that crashed was less than seven years old. Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes - including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision.

Global music spending surges to $26bn,"BTS were the biggest-selling act in the world last year Global music revenues grew at the fastest rate in more than two decades last year, with help from artists like BTS, Taylor Swift and Adele. Revenues surged by 18.5% to $25.9bn (Â£19.5bn) in 2021, the highest level since records began in the 1990s. The growth was driven by streaming, with 523 million paid subscribers, up from 443 million in 2020. Streaming now accounts for 65% of total revenues, with CDs, vinyl and cassettes making up 19% and downloads 4%. The remaining 11% comes from a mixture of royalty payments and licensing music to films, TV shows and adverts. The figures mean the industry has enjoyed a seventh consecutive year of growth, according to trade body the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). ""It's hugely encouraging,"" chief executive Frances Moore told the BBC. ""We lived through that dire period after 1999 where the industry declined by 40%. ""We didn't envisage we'd be in a situation [this year] where we report on 60 or 70 countries and every single one is in growth."" BTS were the top-selling act in the world last year Vinyl sales soared again in 2021, thanks to Abba Adele and The Weeknd had the biggest hits of 2021 Although streaming is the engine of the industry's recovery, revenues were up in every format except digital downloads last year. Sales of CDs increased for the first time this millennium, and vinyl revenues were up by 51%. Total streaming - including both paid subscriptions and advertising-supported listening - grew and is now worth $16.9bn (Â£12.75bn) But while the figures are good news for record labels, the independent sector warned that profits were not being shared equally. ""It is good to see continued growth across the global music market... but it serves as an important reminder that not everyone is feeling the benefit,"" said Paul Pacifico of the Association of Independent Music. Without ""clear support"" for up-and-coming musicians, he added, ""it will remain very difficult to reconcile the positive numbers in the market as a whole with the hard reality of making a life in music at an individual, human level"". Adele (pictured at the Brit Awards) had the biggest-selling album of 2021 All of the record labels represented by the IFPI have suspended operations in Russia, the fifth biggest music market in Europe, since the invasion began last month. Although significant, Russia only accounts for 1.3% of global revenues (about $336m), Moore said, meaning the move would have little impact on the global industry. ""We just want to get back to a situation where people in Russia and Ukraine can enjoy music in a peaceful, non-violent environment,"" she added. The UK music industry grew at a slightly slower rate than the global average, with revenues up 12.8% to Â£1.3bn, according to the BPI - but it remains the third biggest music market in the world, behind the US and Japan. Revenues in the US outpaced the rest of the world, rising by 22%; while lockdown-bound Australia was the world's slowest-growing market, on 3.4%. The IFPI report highlighted the increasingly global nature of music consumption, with artists from Latin America, Africa and Asia featuring among the year's top 100 artists. South Korean band BTS were the biggest-selling act for the second year running after topping the US Billboard chart three times and earning a Grammy nomination for their Michael Jackson-inspired single Butter. ""Who could have imagined that 20 years ago?"" Moore asked. ""It's a phenomenon."" US songwriter Taylor Swift was the year's second best-seller, the same position she held last year, while Adele came third. Adele's fourth album, 30, was the most popular record overall, selling 4.7 million copies; while The Weeknd's Save Your Tears was the year's biggest single. Allow YouTube content?

""I really do deeply believe that this is a transformative moment for the continent."" However, she said more needs to be done to reflect the diversity of Africa's musicians.

Cost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options,"Rishi Sunak is set to make a statement against a backdrop of rising prices Conservative MPs have been breaking ranks with the government to demand action on the rising cost of living as the global economy reels from shocks including the war in Ukraine. They have been appealing to Chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of his spring economic statement on 23 March. The BBC understands Mr Sunak is considering options to ease the squeeze on budgets before a rise in energy bills and a tax hike from April. As MPs pressure him to act, we assess some of their proposals, and their likelihood of being adopted. A record rise in global gas prices, driven by high demand and tight supplies, has sent energy costs skyrocketing. One consequence is a new UK price cap, whichwill increase energy bills by about Â£700 a year from 1 April. Energy regulator Ofgem estimates,externalabout 8% of those bills will go towards environmental taxes, which fund home insulation and renewable power. A campaign to scrap these so-called green levies is being led by Craig Mackinlay, the chairman of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group,which is urging the government to rethink its climate policies. Can the UK afford its net zero policies? Keeping green levies, Mr Mackinlay told the BBC, would be ""politically very bad"" because voters will ""think the government isn't really on my side"". Government insiders have suggested this was ""not a go-er"". The money raised from green levies is tied up in contracts to curb carbon emissions in partnership with the private sector. One government source argued that the taxpayer would have to cover the costs of these contracts if they were cancelled. While sceptics have pointed to Germany, whose coalition of Greens, Social Democrats and liberals has moved to scrap a renewables levy, government sources stress they are still committed to the UK's net-zero target. Fuel prices have soared to record highs since the invasion of Ukraine, leaving motorists astonished by ever-high prices at petrol pumps. On 1 March, the average price for a litre of unleaded petrol was 151.67p - compared to 123.58 on that date a year earlier,according to motoring services firm RAC,external. This video can not be played ""A year's worth of petrol price rises in six days"" This dramatic increase ""is not hurtling down the track, it is here already"", Tory MP and fuel campaigner Robert Halfon has warned. He said surging fuel costs would have consequences for businesses, public services and the increasing price of everyday items, known as inflation. Mr Halfon has urged the chancellor to: Cut fuel duty, which currently stands at 57.95p per litre and has been frozen by Conservative chancellors for years Introduce a Pumpwatch monitor to ""protect motorists from the rapaciousness of big oil companies that jack up the price"" when global demand is high The murmurings about increasing pump prices are getting louder among MPs - and ministers are noticing. One government source claimed it was now being raised more with them than energy bills. The transport industry has also lobbied for a cut to fuel duty. The official line from the Treasury is that all taxes are kept under review, and the existing 2022-23 fuel duty freeze saves consumers ""almost Â£8bn over the next five years"". But some government insiders admit the arguments against a cut are less clear and they are watching how prices develop over the year closely. Tax policy will not be updated in the chancellor's spring statement, but the door to further intervention on fuel prices isn't necessarily completely shut. For almost six million people claiming universal credit, a Â£20 top-up to help families through the pandemic was withdrawn last October. The cut was an emotive issue that,according to one think tank,external, would determine whether 500,000 more people fell into poverty or not. EXPLAINED:Why are energy bills so high? PRICES:Cost of petrol hits fresh record WARNING:UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades APPEAL:Campaigner says families need urgent help Before the top-up was abolished, some Tory MPs joined Labour in calling for the extra Â£20 to be made permanent. Among them was Peter Aldous who, in August last year,told the BBCthe cut would ""cause an awful lot of problems to a lot of people"". More recently, Conservative peer Lord Forsyth said the uplift should be restored ""in the name of humanity"". The government's response to these calls was to cut the universal credit taper rate, which meant people on benefits could keep more of what they earn. This appeased some vocal Tory MP critics at the time, some of whom felt this struck a balance between incentivising work and making benefits more generous. Facing fresh calls to pull this lever further, government insiders have stressed they are conscious of the financial squeeze on those on middle incomes, as well as the poorest households. That was the thinking behind the recently announced energy bills rebate, which about 80% of households will receive. Mr Sunak has attempted to position himself as a ""tax-cutting"" Conservative in the mould of his political idol, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But his Thatcherite credentials have been under scrutiny followinga Â£12bn hike in National Insurance(NI). In April, the policy will see NI contributions rise by 1.25% to fund social care and health services in England. Tory critics who hold seats in Labour heartlands in northern England have said the increase will have a disproportionate impact on the lower-paid. The first Â£12,570 of their income should be exempt from NI, the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs - led by Jake Berry - has suggested. Several veteran Conservative MPs have been more vociferous in their opposition to the tax. One, former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, has said the increase would slow down the economy, while another David Davis,has told the BBCthe tax would be ""a disincentive to work"". While nothing can ever be ruled out in politics, we can be pretty certain this is not going to happen. Both the prime minister and chancellor have been definitive that they will not backtrack on this policy, and government sources say it is ""off the table"". As the Bank of England warnedof the biggest fall in living standards in decades, the chancellor announced a plan he said would ""take the sting"" out of higher bills. In February, Sunak promised a Â£150 council tax rebate for properties in bands A to D, and a Â£200 cut to energy bills in October, to be repaid over five years. Tory MP Stephen McPartland told the BBC the schemes were ""obviously a step forward as it is some support, but we have to find a way to insulate families from these huge costs"". One solution, he said, would involve keeping the energy price cap at the current level. This could be done by offering loans worth Â£25bn to energy firms. These loans would ""smooth out the volatility"" in energy prices and allow them to spread the rise in bills over time. The BBC understands Mr McPartland has raised this idea with cabinet ministers. No 10 asked the business secretary to come forward with a series of proposals to ease energy bills. These included changes to the chancellor's rebate scheme, such as doubling the loan, delaying repayments or making it more generous for poorer households. But Treasury sources have rejected calls to tweak the existing scheme. While some ministers have been more receptive to Mr McPartland's idea of a ""credit facility"", government sources have steered away from this. On the opposition benches, one idea that has been floated is a one-off tax on profits made by oil and gas firms. Dubbed a ""windfall tax"", the measure has been backed in various forms by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and some Tory MPs. Labour's version involves increasing corporation tax by 10 percentage points for North Sea oil and gas producers from April. This, Labour says, would raise Â£1.2bn, which could be used to help households struggling to cope with the 54% rise in energy bills from April. Labour would do this by: Getting rid of VAT on domestic fuel bills (currently 5%) Increasing the warm homes discount from Â£140 to Â£400 Extend this discount to nine million families, up from the 2.2 million that currently receive it Some Tories support slashing VAT on energy bills, and making the warm homes discount more generous. Lib Dems meanwhile have backed the latter, and also demanded an emergency 2.5% cut to VAT, which they say would ""put an average of Â£600 back into the pockets of UK families"". Cut VAT to tackle cost-of-living, Lib Dems tell Sunak The Treasury is not keen on cutting VAT on energy bills because it is untargeted - and believes it would only help people out to the tune of Â£7 when the energy price gap goes up in April. One government source said it would be ""politically"" difficult to backtrack on this given it has already been publicly ruled out. Its proponents argue VAT raised from rising fuel or energy prices could be put towards cutting this, but a Treasury spokesperson said there ""has been no 'VAT windfall' and receipts this year are forecasted to be Â£2 billion below the amount collected directly before the pandemic"". Ministers also are not keen on a windfall tax for energy firms because they fear it would ""deter investment"" in North Sea energy production at a time when the government is trying to source more energy domestically.

How could the Chancellor's plans affect you?,"Everyone across the UK is facing the sharpest rise in their cost of living for decades. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement is primarily an update on the current state, and future expectations, of the nation's finances. But he also announced some big, new policies that will affect our personal budgets in the coming months and years. Bringing together expected changes in earnings, reforms to taxes, and the recently announced energy measures, a middle earner on Â£27,500 per year can expect to be about Â£360 worse off this year than they were last, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Many of the necessities we buy - notably food, fuel and energy - have been rising in price. On Wednesday, official figures revealed that the cost of a whole host of goods and services, from furniture to toys, have also been increasing sharply. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidprices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February- the fastest for 30 years. The chancellor's Spring Statement confirmed that consumers should be braced for things getting more expensive at a faster rate later in the year. Official forecasts, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest inflation (which charts the rising cost of living) will average 7.4% this year, peaking at around 9% at the end of the year. The big question for anyone with a job is whether their pay will rise in line with prices. We already knew that the minimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from Â£8.91 to Â£9.50. Inflation-matching wage rises in themselves could create a problem for the economy as a whole, by creating an inflationary spiral. It remains highly unlikely that employers will put up wages by that much when facing their own cost pressures, particularly their firm's energy bills. In September, the government announced that employees will pay 1.25p more in the pound from their pay packet in National Insurance contributions from this April. In a significant move, he has now said that the earnings threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance will rise. What will National Insurance changes cost me? At present, most workers start paying National Insurance contributions when their income hits Â£9,568. They pay 12% of earnings between Â£9,568 and Â£50,270, then 2% on any earnings above Â£50,270. Now the chancellor has said, from July, National Insurance will be paid on income over Â£12,570 a year - the same level as income tax starts being paid. In practice, the two measures will mean that anyone earning less than about Â£35,000 a year will pay less National Insurance during the year. That is about 70% of all workers. Those who earn more will see a tax rise, albeit smaller than they would have expected. For an employee earning Â£20,000 a year, it means an annual National Insurance cut of Â£180 in 2022-23, instead of an Â£89 rise expected before the announcement, according to accountancy firm Deloitte For a Â£40,000 earner, it means a rise of Â£70, instead of a previously expected Â£339 rise For a Â£60,000 earner, it means a Â£320 rise, instead of a previously expected Â£589 rise Self-employed people, who pay at a different rate, will see slightly less of a benefit from the chancellor's decision. Over time, this threshold is frozen, which will steadily mean more low-earners will have to pay. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. At the end of his speech, he pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Millions of households are facing a Â£693 (54%) rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about Â£2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The latest analysis from Cornwall Insight suggests there will be a further Â£541 a year (27%) rise in October, before falling back. The OBR has predicted a Â£850 rise in October. Mr Sunak said he had already taken ""decisive action"", in helping people with their bills. This includes a Â£150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a Â£200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid, and an expansion to a support scheme for vulnerable people. In a longer-term move, he said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. Prices to fill up the car with fuel were rising before the war in Ukraine - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. The average price of petrol has risen by more than 40p per litre since last year's Spring Statement. The chancellor announceda 5p a litre reduction in fuel dutyfor the next year, which takes some of the sting out of rising prices, The RAC motoring organisation said that move would knock Â£3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55 litre family car. Benefits and the state pension are rising by 3.1% in April, well below the rising cost of living. This prompted many charities to call on the chancellor to go further. Mr Sunak did not agree, saying nothing new about benefit and pension levels. However, if inflation does reach the levels predicted by the OBR. then benefits and the state pension could see a significant rise in April 2023 - as the increases are usually linked to the inflation rate in the preceding autumn. Local councils will be given another Â£500m in the Household Support Fund, which supports vulnerable people with payments and grants such as vouchers to help pay their bills.

People 'facing choice between food and energy',"Bills are rising sharply in April for millions of people Millions of people face the dilemma of cutting spending on food and clothing to pay their energy bill, one supplier's boss has said. Bill Bullen, chief executive of Utilita - which serves prepayment meter customers - said government financial support was not directed sufficiently to those who needed it most. He said ministers should spend money on ""insulating the hell out of Britain"". There are growing calls for help on bills ahead of the Spring Statement. On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the statement - an update on the state of the UK economy, and an opportunity to outline further policies on tackling the rising cost of living. The government is also preparing a UK energy strategy in light of the war in Ukraine and the impact it is having on global supply and prices. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Cost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options Millions of households are facing a 54% rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about Â£2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The price rise for prepayment meter customers, who can include some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society, is slightly higher. The increase for prepayment meter customers is typically Â£708 a year. The war in Ukraine has heightened concern about a similar increase in October, when the next cap is set. The government has said it is taking ""decisive action"" in helping people with their bills. This includes a Â£150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a Â£200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid. However, Mr Bullen argued that the rise was inadequately focussed, leaving millions of people facing tough choices on their family budgets. ""They just do not have the money,"" he said. He said that the ""path of no regret"" for the government was to find ways to cut energy consumption, and therefore bills, over the long term with a massive home insulation programme. It was relatively easy, he said, to cut consumption by 20%. Some people who agree with the criticism of a non-targeted approach to the government's financial assistance have chosen to donate their Â£150 council rebate to charities helping those struggling to pay their fuel bills. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm, dry homes and runs a helpline and hardship funds, said that 40% of its donations in February came from people wishing to donate their rebate. Grocery prices are also rising adding to the pressure on people's finances Ahead of the Spring Statement, a string of charities have called on the chancellor to step up support for those struggling to pay their bills, given the rising cost of basics such as food and fuel. The debt charity Christians Against Poverty said calls to its helpline went up by 47% in January compared with the same month last year. It said requests for emergency fuel vouchers had doubled in the first two months of this year compared with the same period last year. As well as a more generous increase in benefit payments, the charity wants the chancellor to announce a full review of the cost of living to ensure everyone has a sufficient income for their basic needs. Citizens Advice estimated that five million people would be unable to afford the April energy price rise. The prospect of more price rises in October could mean that one in four UK adults would be unable to pay their bills. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation argued that the minimum requirement from the chancellor to tackle the cost of living issue was to increase benefits in line with inflation - close to doubling the 3.1% increase set for April.

Unions to push on pay amid cost of living worries,"Unions are set to push for pay rises of around 10% this year. Unison, the UK's biggest union, urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to fund an above-inflation pay rise in the public sector. And another union, Prospect, predicted ""conflict"" with firms and the government if there were large falls in real-terms earnings for workers. The government said public sector pay rises would be ""proportionate"" to those in the private sector. The CBI, which represents the UK's biggest companies, has been contacted for a comment on the situation facing the private sector. Official figures show wage growth is alreadyfailing to keep pace with price rises. Why are prices rising so quickly? I will help with costs where I can, says Sunak Chancellor must do more for poorest, says charity The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation hit 5.5% in January, its highest rate since 1992, with the Bank of Englandexpecting it to reach around 8%,externalthis spring and possibly ""even higher"" later in the year, before falling again in 2023 and 2024. Some experts say the peak figure could run into double digits, as food, energy and fuel cost rises, exacerbated by the Ukraine war, hit households. National Insurance payments will go up by 1.25 pence in the pound next month and council tax is increasing. The TUC's Frances O'Grady says families need long-term financial security Ahead of Mr Sunak's Spring Statement on Wednesday, Unison general secretary Christina McAnea told the BBC the chancellor must use the opportunity ""to fund an above-inflation pay rise across the entire public sector"". ""A wage increase falling short of spiralling prices is a pay cut in all but name,"" she added. ""Essential workers won't hang around [in the public sector] if their salary boost won't help them weather the prices storm."" Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, which covers the private and public sectors, said disposable incomes were ""about to fall off a cliff"". ""[Pay demands are] entirely different in normal circumstances to when it's rising at 7%, or 8%, or even 10%,"" he added. ""The cost-of-living crisis effectively backs people into a corner. ""If inflation hits 8%, 9% or 10%, how can you credibly put in claims for half that? You simply can't. There's no rational basis for that at all."" And Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shop workers' union Usdaw, said he would be ""calling for the positive contribution our members make to the business and the economy to be properly reflected in their pay and conditions"". The RCN union has already called for nurses to get apay rise of 5% above inflation,externalthis year. EXPLAINED:Why are energy bills so high? PRICES:Cost of petrol hits fresh record WARNING:UK faces biggest income squeeze in decades APPEAL:Campaigner says families need urgent help Aroundhalf of all public-sector workers,,externalincluding NHS staff, the armed forces, police officers and teachers, have their salaries decided by ministers. Civil Service pay awards are decided by departments based on advice from the Cabinet Office, while the National Joint Council - made up of unions and local government employers - sets council salaries. The situation across the private sector is also varied, with some companies and organisations having more union involvement than others. According to thelatest Office for National Statistics,,externalaverage annual growth in regular pay was 3.8% - 5.3% in the private sector and 2.4% in the public sector. The TUC, the umbrella group for UK unions, says overall average wages are still lower, in real terms, than when the financial crisis struck in 2008. General secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""This cost-of-living storm has not come out of the blue. The last 14 years have been the worst period for real wage growth in more than two centuries."" The CBI has joined Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP in calling for the National Insurance rise - being brought in to deal with the NHS backlog caused by Covid - to be postponed by a year in the Spring Statement. It is also being widely reported that Mr Sunak will cut fuel duty to help motorists. A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we reward our hard-working public sector workers and the Independent Pay Review Process will make its recommendations in due course. ""Pay increases need to be proportionate to the pay rises in the wider economy, balanced with the need to manage the country's long-term economic health and protect public sector finances.""

How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you?,"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges. Watch your speed:The RAC says 45-50mph is the most efficient speed to drive for fuel efficiency Switch off the air conditioning: Extra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10%, according to the AA Check your tyre pressure:Underinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

Food costs rise as farmers struggle with increase,"Farmers across Wales are concerned with the rising costs, with some ""struggling to pay bills"" Farmers have said they are struggling to absorb rising costs as food prices for consumers continue to climb. NFU Cymru, which represents many farmers and growers in Wales, said fertiliser costs had doubled in a year, leaving some farmers ""struggling to pay bills"". Price rises are already reaching customers, withone firm warning of 15% increased in food pricesthis year. The Welsh government said price rises for famers were ""concerning"". NFU Cymru said the price of fertiliser had risen 200% in the past year, while animal feed had increased 60%, with the war in Ukraine now limiting the supply of raw ingredients. Households face being Â£600 worse off this year Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food prices Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' Its deputy president, Abi Reader, said: ""It genuinely feels quite desperate. ""There are farmers who are struggling to pay bills, as I'm sure there are people and households [struggling with] paying bills. ""This is about trying to get our ducks in a row, we are going to have to get a little bit of coordination here as a nation to make sure we can control, as best we can, the food supply, and make sure that people anywhere can afford food, regardless of the price."" Farmer Abi Reader wants groups formed to help supply during the Covid pandemic to be resurrected NFU Cymru wants the Welsh government to coordinate a response to rising prices and shortages of some products. Ms Reader said the response to the pandemic had shown how Welsh government could coordinate supply chains and some of the groups it formed should be ""reincarnated"". ""We learned a lot of lessons, we had a lot of dialogue - we need to reincarnate that, these groups need to get going again."" The Welsh government said it was monitoring the situation via theUK Agriculture Market Monitoring Group,externaland would continue itsBasic Payment Scheme,externalfor farmers until the end of 2023. ""We have been clear collaborative working is vital in achieving our goals for the industry, and the minister for rural affairs holds regular discussions with unions, farmers and producers, as well as the UK government and counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, who she also spoke with again on Monday,"" a spokesman said. The recovery of global economies following the worst of the pandemic has increased demand for fertiliser and oil, sending prices higher. But, the war in Ukraine is likely to further increase food prices - Russia and Ukraine are among the world's main suppliers of wheat and the conflict is expected to reduce exports. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries Soaring energy costs are also contributing to higher prices for farms and food processors. The boss of food processing firm 2 Sisters said the cost of food could rise by 15% this year, with a jump in the cost of chicken from farms. Rising bills have forced the Williams family from Whitchurch in Cardiff to reconsider what they spend their money on. Mother Sally said: ""We can definitely see a difference in food bills, having a family of two children who eat a lot, prices have gone up - and they are quite big eaters."" Richard and Sally have spoken with their children Phoebe and Ben about the need to cut back on the family spending Phoebe, 14, said she and her brother Ben, 11, would have to do their bit. ""We have to do things like switch lights off more and when we have charged our phones we have to not leave the plug switched on,"" she added. ""There is stuff that we are doing to try and help, we get a lift home from school most days and now that it is becoming nicer weather, we are going to have to start walking."" Ben added: ""I don't think I am going to have as much money to go out at weekends and buy food and stuff."" Rising prices have taken the family by surprise.

"What to expect from Rishi Sunak's Spring StatementHow could the Chancellor's plans affect you?How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you?Food costs rise as farmers struggle with increaseChancellor must do more for poorest, says charity","The chancellor is under pressure to address the rising cost of living There is a very big question hanging over tomorrow's Spring Statement: just how much do the public expect the government to give a helping hand at a time of international emergency? The instinct of the chancellor, is that he can only do so much. In my travels from Ayrshire to Derbyshire over the past week, trying to take the temperature of the economy at the time of a seismic price shock, it's clear that the public expects more than it used to. Whether it was Milligan's coach company, unable to work out if it can price its trips at a profit because of rising diesel costs; or the farm owner in Ashover, unprotected by energy caps, facing ""open-ended"" price increases from heating oil. Over the period of the pandemic, the chancellor repeatedly rolled out ever expanding multi-billion pound economic rescues, with mainly borrowed money. But Rishi Sunak does not want expanded government spending to define his tenure at Number 11. How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you? What's the pension triple lock and why's it being suspended? Spring Statement: What to expect on fuel, pensions and benefits The statement that is coming on Wednesday was originally intended to be no more than an economic update, alongside the new forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Plans have changed since then to reflect the acute challenges for household budgets, but it would be wrong to see this as a mini-Budget. Perhaps not even a micro-Budget. There is still not enough for the traditional ""red book"" of measures. The big takeaway from the chancellor's words over the weekend was not about a significant rescue package, but that he can not protect the country from all the pressures arising out of the global wave of surging prices. The most important text ahead of the chancellor's statement, is hisMais lecture,externalfrom last month. He used it to push back against the idea that the size of the British state would be left bigger forever. This is an area of political judgement as well as economic strategy. The main area of household economic stress - domestic gas and electricity bills - will be dealt with at a later date. The official cost of the government package designed to lessen the burden of next month's record rise, will be revealed. But whether the further rise will be another few hundred pounds a year or over a thousands pounds a year for an average household can not yet be known with certainty. The original Â£9bn package helped mitigate less than half of the Â£21bn rise in energy prices until January, and that was mostly through loans. But the total value of price rises is on course to more than double to over Â£43bn. There is scope to cut back fuel duty on petrol and diesel by a few pence - however, pump prices will still feel like they are at a record, with an average diesel tank costing close to Â£100. The really stark fact in here is that amid these global pressures arising from the pandemic bounce-back and the invasion, the government is further squeezing households with significant new tax rises. It is remarkable this is all hitting at the same time. It is difficult to think that the government would have devised policy in this way, had the price surge occurred earlier. The effect of some of the national insurance rise on low and middle earners could be unpicked by a rise in the threshold over which it is paid. But, to be clear, these are slightly smaller rises in taxes, not tax cuts. The problem for the exchequer is that acknowledging the reality of 8% inflation rates for national insurance thresholds, points to doing the same for universal credit and for public sector pay. Indeed the Bank of England are now projecting that inflation could be at double digit levels at the end of the year. While some increase in the generosity of universal credit could come, public sector pay is being left to the pay review bodies. In April at least there will be immediate real terms pay cuts, as wages fail to match inflation. Some of this might be undone by the summer, but the government's position so far is that public sector should pay more attention to the 2% inflation target for setting interest rates, than actual rates of inflation. And all the while, the Treasury would rather be talking about long term plans to raise investment, productivity, growth, living standards and tax revenues. The current cost of living crisis threatens to turn into an emergency. And although this could be a new normal lasting years, don't expect a pandemic-style rescue, this time.

"How could the Chancellor's plans affect you?How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you?Food costs rise as farmers struggle with increaseChancellor must do more for poorest, says charity","Everyone across the UK is facing the sharpest rise in their cost of living for decades. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement is primarily an update on the current state, and future expectations, of the nation's finances. But he also announced some big, new policies that will affect our personal budgets in the coming months and years. Bringing together expected changes in earnings, reforms to taxes, and the recently announced energy measures, a middle earner on Â£27,500 per year can expect to be about Â£360 worse off this year than they were last, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Many of the necessities we buy - notably food, fuel and energy - have been rising in price. On Wednesday, official figures revealed that the cost of a whole host of goods and services, from furniture to toys, have also been increasing sharply. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidprices rose by 6.2% in the 12 months to February- the fastest for 30 years. The chancellor's Spring Statement confirmed that consumers should be braced for things getting more expensive at a faster rate later in the year. Official forecasts, from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggest inflation (which charts the rising cost of living) will average 7.4% this year, peaking at around 9% at the end of the year. The big question for anyone with a job is whether their pay will rise in line with prices. We already knew that the minimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from Â£8.91 to Â£9.50. Inflation-matching wage rises in themselves could create a problem for the economy as a whole, by creating an inflationary spiral. It remains highly unlikely that employers will put up wages by that much when facing their own cost pressures, particularly their firm's energy bills. In September, the government announced that employees will pay 1.25p more in the pound from their pay packet in National Insurance contributions from this April. In a significant move, he has now said that the earnings threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance will rise. What will National Insurance changes cost me? At present, most workers start paying National Insurance contributions when their income hits Â£9,568. They pay 12% of earnings between Â£9,568 and Â£50,270, then 2% on any earnings above Â£50,270. Now the chancellor has said, from July, National Insurance will be paid on income over Â£12,570 a year - the same level as income tax starts being paid. In practice, the two measures will mean that anyone earning less than about Â£35,000 a year will pay less National Insurance during the year. That is about 70% of all workers. Those who earn more will see a tax rise, albeit smaller than they would have expected. For an employee earning Â£20,000 a year, it means an annual National Insurance cut of Â£180 in 2022-23, instead of an Â£89 rise expected before the announcement, according to accountancy firm Deloitte For a Â£40,000 earner, it means a rise of Â£70, instead of a previously expected Â£339 rise For a Â£60,000 earner, it means a Â£320 rise, instead of a previously expected Â£589 rise Self-employed people, who pay at a different rate, will see slightly less of a benefit from the chancellor's decision. Over time, this threshold is frozen, which will steadily mean more low-earners will have to pay. Early last year Mr Sunak said the thresholds at which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands. At the end of his speech, he pledged to reduce the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound before the end of the Parliament in 2024. Millions of households are facing a Â£693 (54%) rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about Â£2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April. The latest analysis from Cornwall Insight suggests there will be a further Â£541 a year (27%) rise in October, before falling back. The OBR has predicted a Â£850 rise in October. Mr Sunak said he had already taken ""decisive action"", in helping people with their bills. This includes a Â£150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a Â£200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid, and an expansion to a support scheme for vulnerable people. In a longer-term move, he said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. Prices to fill up the car with fuel were rising before the war in Ukraine - and the fallout from Russia's invasion has made things worse. The average price of petrol has risen by more than 40p per litre since last year's Spring Statement. The chancellor announceda 5p a litre reduction in fuel dutyfor the next year, which takes some of the sting out of rising prices, The RAC motoring organisation said that move would knock Â£3.30 off the cost of filling a typical 55 litre family car. Benefits and the state pension are rising by 3.1% in April, well below the rising cost of living. This prompted many charities to call on the chancellor to go further. Mr Sunak did not agree, saying nothing new about benefit and pension levels. However, if inflation does reach the levels predicted by the OBR. then benefits and the state pension could see a significant rise in April 2023 - as the increases are usually linked to the inflation rate in the preceding autumn. Local councils will be given another Â£500m in the Household Support Fund, which supports vulnerable people with payments and grants such as vouchers to help pay their bills.

"How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you?Food costs rise as farmers struggle with increaseChancellor must do more for poorest, says charity","Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges. Watch your speed:The RAC says 45-50mph is the most efficient speed to drive for fuel efficiency Switch off the air conditioning: Extra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10%, according to the AA Check your tyre pressure:Underinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

"Food costs rise as farmers struggle with increaseChancellor must do more for poorest, says charity","Farmers across Wales are concerned with the rising costs, with some ""struggling to pay bills"" Farmers have said they are struggling to absorb rising costs as food prices for consumers continue to climb. NFU Cymru, which represents many farmers and growers in Wales, said fertiliser costs had doubled in a year, leaving some farmers ""struggling to pay bills"". Price rises are already reaching customers, withone firm warning of 15% increased in food pricesthis year. The Welsh government said price rises for famers were ""concerning"". NFU Cymru said the price of fertiliser had risen 200% in the past year, while animal feed had increased 60%, with the war in Ukraine now limiting the supply of raw ingredients. Households face being Â£600 worse off this year Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food prices Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' Its deputy president, Abi Reader, said: ""It genuinely feels quite desperate. ""There are farmers who are struggling to pay bills, as I'm sure there are people and households [struggling with] paying bills. ""This is about trying to get our ducks in a row, we are going to have to get a little bit of coordination here as a nation to make sure we can control, as best we can, the food supply, and make sure that people anywhere can afford food, regardless of the price."" Farmer Abi Reader wants groups formed to help supply during the Covid pandemic to be resurrected NFU Cymru wants the Welsh government to coordinate a response to rising prices and shortages of some products. Ms Reader said the response to the pandemic had shown how Welsh government could coordinate supply chains and some of the groups it formed should be ""reincarnated"". ""We learned a lot of lessons, we had a lot of dialogue - we need to reincarnate that, these groups need to get going again."" The Welsh government said it was monitoring the situation via theUK Agriculture Market Monitoring Group,externaland would continue itsBasic Payment Scheme,externalfor farmers until the end of 2023. ""We have been clear collaborative working is vital in achieving our goals for the industry, and the minister for rural affairs holds regular discussions with unions, farmers and producers, as well as the UK government and counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, who she also spoke with again on Monday,"" a spokesman said. The recovery of global economies following the worst of the pandemic has increased demand for fertiliser and oil, sending prices higher. But, the war in Ukraine is likely to further increase food prices - Russia and Ukraine are among the world's main suppliers of wheat and the conflict is expected to reduce exports.

Rising bills have forced the Williams family from Whitchurch in Cardiff to reconsider what they spend their money on.

"Becker used business account as piggy bank, court told","Boris Becker, the six-time Grand Slam tennis champion, was using his business account as a ""piggy bank"" to pay for personal expenses, a court has heard. He spent money from his business account on his children's school fees, designer clothes and shopping at the luxury store, Harrods, jurors heard. The 54-year-old, who commentated for the BBC last year, is on trial at Southwark Crown Court charged with 24 offences under the Insolvency Act. He denies all charges. The charges relate to his June 2017 bankruptcy over a Â£3.5m bank loan for a property in Mallorca, Spain. He is accused of hiding, or failing to hand over, assets before and after his bankruptcy. As the second day of Mr Becker's trial got under way, the jury heard the former world number one spent hundreds of pounds at Harrods, bought online groceries at Ocado and treated himself to Ralph Lauren clothes. The German national is alleged to have hidden â¬1.13 million (Â£940,000) from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into his Boris Becker Private Office (BBPOL) account. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said: ""It is the prosecution case that Mr Becker used the BBPOL sterling account as an extension of his own account, effectively as his own piggy bank, for everyday personal expenses such as school fees for the children and such like."" She said payments in 2017 included Â£643 to Polo Ralph Lauren, Â£7,600 in school fees, Â£976 at Harrods and more than Â£1,000 at Ocado. Ms Chalkley told jurors Mr Becker paid his ex-wife Barbara Becker â¬23,000 (Â£19,000), estranged wife Sharell ""Lilly"" Becker â¬100,000 (Â£83,000) and transferred Â£225,000 to a friend. The prosecutor added that he also transferred â¬300,000 (Â£249,000) to his own account, while other funds went into an account he jointly held with his son. Mr Becker is also accused of failing to hand over assets including trophies he received as a result of his 1985 and 1989 Wimbledon men's singles title, his Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996 and his 1992 Olympic gold medal. He also allegedly failed to declare two German properties, as well as his interest in a flat in Chelsea, west London, and hid a â¬825,000 (Â£686,000) bank loan. The prosecution is being brought by the Insolvency Service on behalf of the business secretary. On Monday at the start of the trial, Judge Deborah Taylor instructed the jury of 11 men and one woman to ignore Mr Becker's celebrity. ""You must treat him in exactly the same way you would treat someone you have not heard of and is not in the public eye,"" she said. The 24 charges include: Nine counts of failing to deliver up trophies and other awards; Seven counts of concealing property totalling more than â¬1.5m Five counts of failing to disclose estate, including the properties in Germany and London, shares and a bank account Two of removal of property amounting to almost â¬500,000 One of concealing â¬825,000 of debt The trial, expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

Borrowing figures 'give Rishi Sunak wiggle room',"The chancellor has ""wiggle room"" to help tackle the rising cost of living, an influential economist has said. Sir Charlie Bean told the BBC that Rishi Sunak may have as much as Â£50bn ""to play with"", ahead of the Spring Statement on Wednesday. New official data also show that the government is borrowing less than expected so far this year. It comes as pressure mounts on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to take action to tackle soaring costs. Calls from charities and politicians have been growing for the chancellor to address the increasing pressure on household budgets at the Spring Statement on Wednesday, where he will deliver an update on how the economy is faring as well as some policy updates. But Mr Sunak has said the priority has to be shrinking the amount that the government has to borrow to make up the shortfall between what it borrows and what it earns in receipts. Where does the government borrow billions from? Donât expect much from Sunakâs Spring Statement How could Rishi Sunak's plans affect you? TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthat government borrowing in the financial year to February was Â£138.4bn. It marks the third-highest since records began in 1993, although it is still Â£21.2bn less than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Sir Charlie Bean, who was responsible for economic forecasts at the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility until December, told the BBC's Today programme that rising inflation and improved tax receipts would mean that the chancellor might have more ""wiggle room"" at Wednesday's spring statement. According to the new figures, the government collected Â£53.7bn in taxes this February, up by more than Â£4bn in comparison with last year. He suggested that could mean that Mr Sunak could even have between Â£25 and Â£50bn ""to play with"", depending on how the independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks the cost of living will change over the next few years. The amount the government borrows to make up the difference between what it spends and what it collects is known as ""public sector net borrowing"". It will borrow because it spends more than it gets in income, which mainly comes in from taxes like VAT or income tax. It does this by selling bonds - a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates - essentially an interest-paying ""IOU"". Find out more about government borrowing and how it works here. Surging food prices, energy bills and fuel prices have pushed costs up for households, but rising inflation also means the government is paying more in interest payments on its debt. Rising inflation led to government interest payments hitting a fresh record in February, the ONS figures also show. Interest payments reached Â£8.2bn last month, the highest amount for a February since records for them began in April 1997 and up Â£1bn on last year. The payments are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - which reached 7.8% in January. The government has borrowed billions of pounds to spend on measures designed to limit the impact of the Covid pandemic, such as the furlough scheme, over the last couple of years. New data showed that public sector debt, excluding public sector banks, remains at a level not seen since the early 1960s. In response to the figures, Mr Sunak said: ""The ongoing uncertainty caused by global shocks means it's more important than ever to take a responsible approach to the public finances. ""With inflation and interest rates still on the rise, it's crucial that we don't allow debt to spiral and burden future generations with further debt."" James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said: ""The chancellor will approach the UK's latest crisis - the tightest income squeeze in generations, exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine - with the public finances in better shape than expected."" In February, the UK government borrowed about Â£5bn more than expected, with those higher debt interest costs off-setting the boost in tax income. Nevertheless, Mr Smith called on the chancellor to increase tax revenues to provide emergency income support to families through the cost of living crisis. Charities such as Resolution Foundation and Save the Children UK have urged the chancellor to consider measures such as increasing benefit payments by at least 7% to try to match the rate at which prices are rising, as well as expanding eligibility for theWarm Home Discountfor energy bills. But Hoa Duong, an economist at consultancy firm PwC, suggested the growing pressures caused by the conflict in Ukraine and easing household living costs could exacerbate the deficit - the amount by which the government's income falls short of what it spends. ""In the Spring Statement we expect the chancellor to continue his cautious approach and prioritise balancing the books. Therefore any financial support, including reducing pressure on households' cost of living, is likely to be limited,"" she said.

Charred belongings found at China plane crash site,"Search and rescue workers trawling the slopes near the crash site are yet to find passengers Rescuers have found no survivors so far from a jet carrying 132 people which crashed in hills in southern China. Crash investigators also had no information on why China Eastern flight MU5735 plummeted out of the sky on Monday. Recovery work at the site of the Boeing 737-800 crash in Guangxi province is being hampered by difficult terrain. There has been an outpouring of grief in China, where families of passengers and crew are waiting for news. Hundreds of responders have been scouring the steeply forested slopes in Wuzhou where debris from the plane was strewn after it broke apart and set fire to the hillside. There had been no official word on casualties until China's Civil Aviation Administration held its news briefing, some 36 hours after the disaster. ""Up to now, search and rescue work has not found any survivors,"" Zhu Tao, aviation safety office director at the CAA, told reporters. ""Given the information currently available, we still do notÂ have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash."" Air controllers had repeatedly called theÂ aircraft during its descent but had received noÂ response, he added. Rescuers have so far found parts of the 737's burnt wreckage. State broadcasters showed images of the charred remains of letters, bags, wallets and identity cards belonging to those on board. Meanwhile, the families and friends of the 123 passengers and nine crew have gathered at each end of the flight - with relatives visiting China Eastern's offices in Yunnan province and waiting at Guangzhou International Airport. The China Eastern Airlines flight from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, had been due to land in Guangzhou on Monday afternoon. China Eastern has grounded all its Boeing 737-800s and set up a hotline for people seeking information on those on board. Authorities have yet to identify passengers and crew members, but some relatives have spoken to local media or shared their grief online. One woman reported the loss of her newly-wed husband on her WeChat account. Her earlier posts included videos of the couple's holiday trips. Other passengers included a group of six people, one of them a teenager, who were on their way to Guangzhou to attend a funeral, a local newspaper reported. Families waiting for news at Guangzhou International Airport on Monday night Another woman interviewed said her sister and close friends were part of that group, adding that she had also been booked on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very anguished,"" she told Jiemian News. Boeing jets under 'surveillance' after China crash How does a plane's black box work? Air disasters timeline Reuters quoted a man at the airport who said he was the colleague of a passenger named Mr Tan. After confirming that Mr Tan was on board, he had to break the news to Mr Tan's family. ""They were sobbing. His mother couldn't believe this had happened,"" he told the news agency. ""Her boy was only 29 years old."" He added that arrangements were being made by the airline to bring families to the crash site in Wuzhou. Pictures show distraught families waiting in a cordoned-off area at Guangzhou airport, being assisted by airline staff. One unverified clip circulating widely on Chinese social media shows a man slumped in his seat crying and lamenting the loss of his three children who were on the flight. This accident took place in China and involved a Chinese airline. As such, the investigation will be led by the country's civil aviation administration. But under international standards, the US will also be entitled to appoint an accredited representative because the Boeing 737 was designed and built in the US. The National Transportation Safety Board has already appointed a senior air safety investigator to fulfil this role. Representatives from Boeing itself, the engine maker CFM International and the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, will serve as technical advisers. The priority now will be to gather evidence from the crash site and search for the ""black boxes"", the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. If they can be found, and the data they contain is readable, then the immediate cause of the crash could become apparent quite quickly. But the investigation as a whole will take time. Flight MU5735 had been in the air for more than an hour and was nearing its destination when it suddenly plummeted from its cruising height. Chinese state TV outlets have broadcast footage which appears to show a jet in a near nosedive to the ground. The footage was captured by a car's dashcam. The BBC has not yet been able to verify the clip. Flight tracker data showed the Boeing 737-800 jet dropped thousands of metres in under three minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 model has a strong safety record, with thousands in service around the world. The aircraft that crashed was less than seven years old. Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes - including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision.

Putin redraws the world - but not the way he wanted,"""Russia does not start wars, it ends them"" reads a poster of Vladimir Putin in Simferopol, Crimea, 10 March Vladimir's Putin's invasion of Ukraine has changed the world. We are living in new and more dangerous times - the post-Cold War era that began with the fall of the Berlin Wall is over. It is a rare thing to live through a moment of huge historical consequence and understand in real time that is what it is. In November 1989, I stood on a snow-flecked Wenceslas Square in Prague, the capital of what was then Czechoslovakia, and watched a new world being born. The peoples of Communist Eastern Europe had risen in defiance of their dictatorships. The Berlin Wall had been torn down. A divided Europe was being made whole again. In Prague, the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel addressed a crowd of 400,000 from a second-floor balcony. It was an exhilarating moment, dizzying in its pace. That evening, the Communist regime collapsed and within weeks Havel was president of a new democratic state. I sensed, even at the time, that I had watched the world pivot - that it was one of those rare moments when you know the world is remaking itself before your eyes. Vaclav Havel in Wenceslas Square, Prague, 24 November 1989 How many such moments had there been in the history of Europe since the French Revolution? Probably, I thought then, about five. This, 1989, was the sixth. But that world - born in those dramatic popular revolutions - came to an end when Putin ordered Russian forces into Ukraine. The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called this moment a zeitenwende - a turning point - while UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""paradigm shift"". The age of complacency, she said, was over. Storming of the Bastille,14 July 1789 1789:French Revolution. Monarchy overthrown, republic founded 1815:Congress of Vienna redraws map of Europe, restores balance of power and ushers in decades of peace after the upheaval of the Napoleonic wars 1848:A wave of liberal and democratic revolutions across Europe 1919:Treaty of Versailles. New independent sovereign nation states replace old multi-national empires 1945:Yalta - great powers agree to partition Europe into Western and Soviet ""spheres of influence"". Iron Curtain falls across the continent 1989:Democratic revolutions in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe tear down the Iron Curtain. The Soviet Union collapses two years later. Vladimir Putin calls this the ""greatest catastrophe of the 20th Century"" Quentin Sommerville, one of the BBC's most experienced war reporters walked through the wreckage in Kharkiv recently and said of the Russian bombardment: ""If these tactics are unfamiliar to you, then you haven't been paying attention."" He should know, he spent enough time under Russian rockets in Syria to be paying very close attention. But the governments of the democratic world - how much attention have they been paying to the nature of the Putin regime? The evidence has been building for years. Two decades have passed since he sent troops into Georgia claiming he was supporting breakaway regions. Later, he sent spies into British cities armed with nerve agents to murder exiled Russians. In 2014, he invaded Eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Ukraine war: Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway 'If these tactics are unfamiliar to you, then you haven't been paying attention' 'Suburban gardens have become battlefields from Europe's past' Despite all this, Germany, and much of the EU, were locking themselves into an unhealthy dependence on Russian gas. A year after the annexation of Crimea, they approved the building of a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, to boost supplies. The ""complacency"" Liz Truss refers to also indicts her own country. London has been a safe haven for Russian money since John Major was prime minister. Russian oligarchs have parked billions here, laundered their money, bought up the most prestigious private homes in the capital, socialised with politicians and donated to their campaign funds. Few questions were asked about where their vast wealth, acquired so suddenly, had come from. So, no. The Western democracies have not been ""paying attention"" to the nature of the menace that has been incubating on their eastern frontier. But Putin, too, has seemed complacent. Receiving station for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, near Lubmin, Germany First, he believed the West was in chronic decline, weakened by internal division and ideological rancour. The election of Donald Trump and Brexit he saw as proof of this. The rise of right-wing authoritarian governments in Poland and Hungary was further evidence of the disintegration of liberal values and institutions. The US's humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan was proof of a waning power withdrawing from the world stage. Second, he misread what was happening on his borders. He refused to believe that a series of democratic uprisings in former Soviet Republics - Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004-5) and Kyrgyzstan (2005) - could possibly be authentic expressions of the popular will. Because each was aimed at removing corrupt and unpopular pro-Moscow governments, it seemed self-evident to the Kremlin that these were the work of foreign intelligence agencies, the Americans and the British in particular - Western imperialism's forward march into territory that was rightfully and historically Russia's. Third, he has failed to understand his own armed forces. It is clear now that he expected this ""special military operation"" to be over in a few days. Russia's military incompetence has astonished many Western security experts. It brings echoes for me of a smaller, more containable, but nonetheless devastating war, in former Yugoslavia. In 1992, Serb nationalists launched a war to strangle the newly independent state of Bosnia at birth. They argued that Bosnian identity was bogus, that Bosnian statehood had no historical legitimacy, that it was really part of Serbia. It is exactly Putin's view of Ukraine. A Bosnian special forces soldier and civilians come under fire from Serbian snipers, Sarajevo, 6 April 1992 Like Russia today, Serb forces enjoyed overwhelming firepower superiority. But they often stalled wherever local non-Serbs put up resistance. They seemed unable to seize towns or cities - unwilling to fight street-by-street on foot. The Bosnian defenders were initially very poorly equipped - I remember boys in tennis shoes in the trenches of Sarajevo with one AK-47 between three of them. But they defended their capital for nearly four years. There is a similar resolve in the young men volunteering to defend Kyiv. So instead of taking the cities and towns, the Serbs laid siege to them - surrounding them, bombarding them, cutting off water, gas and electricity. It is already happening in Mariupol. Besiege a city and cut off its water supply, and within 24 hours, every toilet is a public health hazard. Citizens have to go out into the streets to find water standpipes and fill up receptacles just to flush their loos. Cut off the electricity and you freeze in your own home. Soon the food runs out. Is that what the Russians intend for Mariupol, for Kharkiv, for Kyiv? To starve them into submission? But nearly four years of this cruelty gave Bosnian nationhood a founding narrative of resistance, suffering and heroic struggle. Ukraine's identity, too, will be strengthened further by the way Ukrainians have fought. Ukraine's Russian speakers have not felt ""liberated"" by the invasion. The evidence is that they, too, believe in Ukraine as a sovereign state. Putin's war, aimed at reunifying what he sees as two parts of the Russian nation, is already having the opposite effect - strengthening the will of most Ukrainians to seek a destiny free from Russian domination. Scrambling for rationed food during the siege of Sarajevo, 1992 In 1994, while the war in the Balkans was still raging, the rest of Eastern Europe was looking to the future - each nation eager to take what it saw as its natural place in a Europe of independent sovereign states at peace with each other. But it was still far from certain that any of them would be allowed to join Nato. There was a debate, back then, about whether a third security block should be formed by the newly-liberated East European nations, to act as a buffer between Nato and Russia. Russia was weak in the 1990s, and the nations that had endured Soviet occupation for 40 years did not trust it to stay weak for long. In the end, they wanted nothing short of Nato membership. Under President Bill Clinton, the US pressed ahead with Nato expansion. The Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who saw himself as a loyal ally of Clinton's, was said to be furious when he found out - at a press conference - that Nato was planning to admit new members without consulting Moscow. And the tearing down of the Iron Curtain had raised a new question in geopolitics - how far east does the Western world extend? I was commissioned by the BBC to take a road trip through Poland, Belarus and Ukraine to address the question, ""Where is the eastern edge of the Western world now?"" I went to the hunting lodge in Belarus where, in late 1991, the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, had met his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus. Here, they agreed to recognise each other's Soviet Republics as independent nation-states. They then rang the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and informed him that the country of which he was head of state - the Soviet Union - no longer existed. It was a moment fraught with both danger and opportunity. For Belarus and Ukraine, it was the chance to liberate themselves from Moscow rule - domination by Russian imperialism in both its Tsarist and Soviet forms. For Yeltsin, it represented the chance to liberate Russia too - from its historic role as an imperial power. The UK and France had both ceased to be imperial powers after World War Two - as Austria had done after WW1. In Turkey, Kemal Ataturk had built a modern European secular republic - a Turkish nation-state - after the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire had been defeated and dismembered in 1918. US President George HW Bush with Boris Yeltsin in Maryland, 1992 Could Boris Yeltsin do the same thing - build a modern Russian nation-state, at peace with its sovereign neighbours, on the ruins of the Soviet Empire? In the early 1990s, he began his Westernising experiment, to try to turn an imperial power into a democratic state. But the rush - encouraged by the Western democracies eager for investment opportunities - to turn a sclerotic, state-owned command economy into a free-market system was disastrous. It created gangster capitalism. A tiny elite became fabulously rich by plundering the assets of the major industries - especially oil and gas. The wheels finally came off the experiment in 1998. The economy collapsed, the rouble lost two-thirds of its value in a month and inflation hit 80%. I stood with a middle-aged couple in a queue at a Moscow bank. They wanted to take their money out in dollars or pounds - anything other than roubles. The queue was long and slow-moving and, every few minutes, a bank employee changed the displayed exchange rate, as the rouble plunged further. People could see their life savings dropping in value by the minute. The couple got close to the head of the queue when suddenly the shutters came down - there was no cash left. Queue at a Russian bank, Moscow, September 1998 I went to a former coal-mining region near the Ukraine border, where the mines were barely functioning. I met a graduate mining engineer who had lost his job - a man in his 30s with a young family. He took me to his dacha outside the city, which had about an acre of land. ""About 80% of what my family eat in the year,"" he said. ""I grow on this patch of land. The rest, like coffee and sugar, I barter for. I haven't used or even seen cash in about 18 months."" Nothing spoke more powerfully about Yeltsin's failure to transform Russia than the sight of this highly educated man digging for his own dinner. ""Stalin turned a nation of peasants into an industrial superpower in a generation. Yeltsin is doing the same thing in reverse,"" he told me. Ordinary Russians felt robbed. The great westernising experiment had been a con trick that had enriched a criminalised elite and impoverished everyone else. Many of the reports we filed from Russia at that time boiled down to a single question: ""What are the political consequences of the profound disenchantment that Russians now feel?"" The answer was that Russia, eventually, would revert to type - a retreat from democracy and a return to authoritarian rule. A retreat from nation-statehood and return to a more assertive imperial attitude to its ""near abroad"" - the countries that had previously been part of the Soviet Union. The former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski famously said that Russia could be a democracy or an empire, but it could not be both. The Russian emblem, the double-headed eagle, looks both east and west. History has pulled Russia in opposing directions - democratic nation statehood in one direction, domineering imperial power in the other. Go to St Petersburg and you will see another aspect of this dual character. It is the country's beautiful bay window on the Gulf of Finland. It is an 18th Century city, facing west. It is the European Enlightenment in architectural form. Under the Tsars it was the imperial capital. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks moved the capital back to Moscow and power retreated behind the high, crenellated walls of the Kremlin. It is the architecture of defensiveness, of suspicion, even fear. When Russian leaders look west from here, they see flat open countryside rolling away to the south and west for hundreds of miles. There are no natural frontiers. Palace Square at dusk, St Petersburg, Russia The crenellated red walls of the Kremlin in Moscow When I was the BBC's Moscow correspondent in the late 1990s, there was a driver who could remember, as a boy, seeing German troops on the outskirts of Moscow in the 1940s. Every time he took us to Sheremetyevo Airport, we would pass a monument designed to look like metal anti-tank defences - so-called Czech hedgehogs - and he would say: ""This is how close they came, the Germans."" Napoleon's army had gone further the previous century. That experience - that chronic sense of an insecure western frontier - informs the way Russian leaders have thought about their ""near abroad"". In another conversation about the ""near abroad"", a friend recited a rhyming couplet to me. In Russian it rhymes nicely, but in English it goes: ""A chicken's not really a bird; and Poland's not really abroad."" Russia's sense of what it is entitled to in the lands to its west penetrates popular consciousness, too. I will borrow an anecdote from another friend in Moscow at the time. The same driver picked her up from the airport and asked her where she had been. ""I've been for a weekend in Prague,"" she said. ""Oh Prague,"" came the reply. ""That's good. That's ours."" But it wasn't. The Berlin Wall had come down nine years earlier and the nations of Eastern Europe had ceased being ""ours"". Except Ukraine. Putin regards it not as a neighbouring country, but as the frontier land of Russia itself - and he wants it brought back into the Russian fold. What would it take to do that? How can a nation that has put up so unified a resistance be subdued? Almost certainly he has overreached himself. Several factors must now be alarming him. The first is the state of his own armed forces. Smoke rises from a destroyed Russian tank in Ukraine, 26 February The second is the resilience of the Ukrainian defence. Did Putin really expect the Russian-speaking people of Ukraine to welcome his troops as liberators? Did he really believe that the uprising of 2014 - which replaced the pro-Moscow government with one oriented to the West - was all a Western plot? If he did, then it reveals how little the Kremlin understands about its ""near abroad"". But his biggest miscalculation has been to underestimate the resolve of the West. And this is what makes 2022 one of those pivotal years - the zeitenwende, in the words of Chancellor Scholz. Almost overnight, Germany has transformed its attitude to its role in the world. Traditionally reluctant - for sound historical reasons - to throw its weight around, it had preferred the exercise of soft power to hard. Not now. It has announced a doubling of defence spending, and is sending lethal weapons to Ukraine. Gone, too, is the ostpolitik - the decades-old German policy of seeking peace through engagement, especially trade. Germany, along with the rest of the democratic world, will now move to end its dependence on Russian gas. The Nord Stream 2 project is suspended - though not yet scrapped. We are seeing a root-and-branch redrawing of the map of global energy distribution, aimed at cutting Russia out of it. Russia is highly integrated into the global economy. But now it has been expelled from the system the world uses to exchange payment for goods and services. Its industries, including oil and gas, depend on imported goods and components. Soon production will grind to a halt. Employers will have to lay off their workers. Unemployment will rise. No-one expected the West to sanction the Russian Central Bank. Already, the rouble has collapsed and interest rates have doubled. No other major economy has ever been subjected to a package of sanctions this punitive. It amounts to the expulsion of Russia from the global economy. More workers will be laid off. Major industries will find it hard to carry on. Unemployment will rise further. Soaring inflation will erode life savings. We will all be affected. Potentially, this is the rolling back of the globalised economy that emerged after the end of the Cold War. The US and the EU have, in effect, divided the world up. Those states and companies that continue to trade with Russia will find themselves punished - also frozen out of trade with the rich world. It amounts to a new economic iron curtain separating Russia from the West. Much will depend on how China negotiates this new landscape. China and Russia are bonded by their shared antipathy to American power, and their conviction that the greatest threat is from a resurgent, more unified democratic world. China does not want Putin weakened, or the West strengthened. Yet that is exactly what the effect the war in Ukraine has had. Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping meet in Beijing, February 2022 Some China watchers believe Beijing will try to challenge the dominance of the dollar as a reserve currency by carving out a distinct yuan zone as an alternative space in the global economy that can be protected from any future attempt by the US to sanction China. Putin's war, therefore, could redraw the international financial map. But above all, this is a war that pits the world's democracies against the world's authoritarian regimes. It is also a war between two conflicting conceptions of the rules by which international relations should function. The Oxford scholar Timothy Garton Ash says these two world views can be expressed in short form by two words - Helsinki versus Yalta. At Yalta in 1945, Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill carved post-war Europe into ""spheres of influence"" - most of Eastern Europe to Russia, the West to the trans-Atlantic alliance that would set about rebuilding Europe's democracies. ""Helsinki"", by contrast, describes a Europe of independent sovereign states, each of which is free to choose its own alliances. This grew out of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 and gradually evolved into the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Ukraine's defenders are fighting for Helsinki. Putin has sent his troops in to impose a modern version of Yalta - which would kill off Ukraine's independence and leave it under Russian domination. Garton Ash argues that the West has been too half-hearted in defending the values of Helsinki - that it has formally acknowledged Ukraine's right to join Nato at some unspecified date in the future without ever intending to make it happen. But Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has signalled a readiness to compromise on Helsinki principles, by agreeing to abandon Ukraine's ambition to become a Nato member. With all the risks that entails, it may yet be the price Ukraine pays for the survival of its statehood. My generation grew up with the existential terror of the threat of nuclear annihilation. The conflict has brought that fear back to public consciousness. Putin has threatened to use Russia's nuclear arsenal. That makes this the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Then, the Soviet Union shipped nuclear missiles to its ally Cuba. The US assembled a fleet to blockade (or ""quarantine"") Cuba and was considering an attack on the island by air and/or sea. What the Americans did not know is that the Soviets didn't only have long-range strategic missiles. They also had smaller, tactical nuclear missiles - so-called battlefield nuclear weapons. And that Soviet military doctrine delegated first-use decision making to commanders on the ground. Had the threatened invasion gone ahead, it would have triggered a nuclear exchange. The then American Defence Secretary Robert McNamara only found out about this when the Soviet archives opened in 1991. Only then, did he understand how close the world had come to catastrophe. In a remarkable film called Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert McNamara, he explained how the world had avoided destroying itself. Was it skilled diplomacy? Wise leadership? No. ""Luck,"" he said. ""We lucked out."" That experience, now fading from memory, should focus minds.

What's driving Putin?,"Russia's leader Vladimir Putin is trapped in a closed world of his own making, Western spies believe. And that worries them. For years they have sought to get inside Mr Putin's mind, to better understand his intentions. With Russian troops seemingly bogged down in Ukraine, the need to do so has become all the more necessary as they try to work out how he will react under pressure. Understanding his state of mind will be vital to avoid escalating the crisis into even more dangerous territory. There has been speculation that Russia's leader was ill, but many analysts believe he has actually become isolated and closed off to any alternative views. His isolation has been evident in pictures of his meetings, such as when he met President Emmanuel Macron, the pair at far ends of a long table. It was also evident in Mr Putin's meeting with his own national security team on the eve of war. Mr Putin's initial military plan looked like something devised by a KGB officer, one Western intelligence official explains. It had been created, they say, by a tight ""conspiratorial cabal"" with an emphasis on secrecy. But the result was chaos. Russian military commanders were not ready and some soldiers went over the border without knowing what they were doing. Western spies, through sources they will not discuss, knew more about those plans than many inside Russia's leadership. But now they face a new challenge - understanding what Russia's leader will do next. And that is not easy. ""The challenge of understanding the Kremlin's moves is that Putin is the single decision-maker in Moscow,"" explains John Sipher, who formerly ran the CIA's Russia operations. And even though his views are often made clear through public statements, knowing how he will act on them is difficult intelligence challenge. ""It is extremely hard in a system as well protected as Russia to have good intelligence on what's happening inside the head of the leader especially when so many of his own people do not know what is going on,"" Sir John Sawers, a former head of Britain's MI6, told the BBC. Isolated - President Putin chairs a meeting in February 2022 Mr Putin, intelligence officials say, is isolated in a bubble of his own making, which very little outside information penetrates, particularly any which might challenge what he thinks. ""He is a victim of his own propaganda in the sense that he only listens to a certain number of people and blocks out everything else. This gives him a strange view of the world,"" says Adrian Furnham, a professor of psychology and co-author of a forthcoming book The Psychology of Spies and Spying. The risk is what is called ""group think"" in which everyone reinforces his view. ""If he's a victim of group think we need to know who the group is,"" says Prof Furnham. The circle of those Mr Putin talks to has never been large but when it came to the decision to invade Ukraine, it had narrowed to just a handful of people, Western intelligence officials believe, all of those ""true believers"" who share Mr Putin's mindset and obsessions. Who are the advisors in Vladimir Putin's tight inner circle? The sense of how small his inner circle has become was emphasised when hepublicly dressed down the head of his own Foreign Intelligence Serviceat the national security meeting just before the invasion - a move which seemed to humiliate the official. His speech hours later alsorevealed a man angry and obsessed with Ukraineand the West. Those who have observed him say the Russian leader is driven by a desire toovercome the perceived humiliation of Russia in the 1990salong with a conviction that the West is determined to keep Russia down and drive him from power. One person who met Mr Putin remembers his obsession with watching videos of Libya's Col Gaddafi being killed after he was driven from power in 2011. When the director of the CIA, William Burns, was asked to assess Mr Putin's mental state, he said he had ""been stewing in a combustible combination of grievance and ambition for many years"" and described his views as having ""hardened"" and that he was ""far more insulated"" from other points of view. Is the Russian president crazy? That is a question many in the West have asked. But few experts consider it helpful. One psychologist with expertise in the area said a mistake was to assume because we cannot understand a decision like invading Ukraine we frame the person who made it as ""mad"". The CIA has a team which carries out ""leadership analysis"" on foreign decision makers, drawing on a tradition dating back to attempts to understand Hitler. They study background, relationships and health, drawing on secret intelligence. Another source are read-outs from the those who have had direct contact, such as other leaders. In 2014, Angela Merkel reportedly told President Obama that Mr Putin was living ""in another world"". President Macron meanwhile when he sat down with Mr Putin recently, was reported to have found the Russian leader ""more rigid, more isolated"" compared with previous encounters. Presidents Putin and Macron in Moscow recently Did something change? Some speculate, without much evidence, about possible ill-health or the impact of medication. Others point to psychological factors such as a sense of his own time running out for him to fulfil what he sees as his destiny in protecting Russia or restoring its greatness. The Russian leader has visibly isolated himself from others during the Covid pandemic and this also may have had a psychological impact. ""Putin is likely not mentally ill, nor he has changed, although he is in more of a hurry, and likely more isolated in recent years,"" says Ken Dekleva, a former US government physician and diplomat, and currently a senior fellow at the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China Relations. But a concern now is that reliable information is still not finding its way into Mr Putin's closed loop. His intelligence services may have been reluctant before the invasion to tell him anything he did not want to hear, offering rosy estimates of how an invasion would go and how Russian troops would be received before the war. And this week one Western official said Mr Putin may still not have the insight into how badly things are going for his own troops that Western intelligence has. That leads to concern about how he might react when confronted with a worsening situation for Russia. Mr Putin himself tells the story of chasing a rat when he was a boy. When he had driven it into a corner, the rat reacted by attacking him, forcing a young Vladimir to become the one who fled. The question Western policymakers are asking is what if Mr Putin feels cornered now? ""The question really is whether or not he doubles down with greater brutality and escalates in terms of the weapon systems that he's prepared to use,"" said one western official. There have been concerns he could use chemical weapons or even a tactical nuclear weapon. ""The worry is that he does something unbelievably rash in a vicious press-the button way,"" says Adrian Furnham. Mr Putin himself may play up the sense that he is dangerous or even irrational - this is a well-known tactic (often called the ""madman"" theory) in which someone with access to nuclear weapons tries to get his adversary to back down by convincing them that he may well be crazy enough to use them despite the potential for everyone to perish. For Western spies and policymakers understanding Mr Putin's intentions and mindset today could not be more important. Predicting his response is pivotal in working out how far they can push him without triggering a dangerous reaction. ""Putin's self concept does not allow for failure or weakness. He despises such things"" says Ken Dekleva. ""A cornered, weakened Putin is a more dangerous Putin. It's sometimes better to let the bear run out of the cage and back to the forest.""

UK to compensate postmasters who exposed scandal,"Subpostmasters who helped uncover the Post Office IT scandal but missed out on full compensation are to get payouts under a new government scheme. The 555 workers won a landmark civil case against the Post Office in 2019, but saw most of their settlements swallowed up by legal fees. They will now get the same level of compensation as other subpostmasters who were wrongly convicted. The announcement comes as a public inquiry into the scandal continues. Between 2000 and 2014, hundreds of subpostmasters and mistresses were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to faults in the Horizon computer software being used at branches across the UK. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Post Office scandal: I considered ending my life In 2019, a group of 555 subpostmasters and mistresses successfully challenged the Post Office over the accusations in the High Court. That case set a legal precedent and paved the way for a series of cases in which 72 people had criminal convictions overturned. The Post Office opened a historic shortfall scheme to compensate more than 700 wrongfully convicted former branch managers who had personally covered shortfalls in branch accounts caused by the Horizon software. But the 555 people who won the High Court case could not participate in the scheme, and despite winning nearly Â£43m in compensation in 2019, the group's funds were swallowed up due to a ""no win, no fee"" agreement with Therium, the company which funded the litigation. The group only got a ""small fraction"" of the settlement equating to around Â£20,000 each, the Treasury said. Therium has agreed to waive its rights to any claim on the new pot of compensation. Business minister Paul Scully told the BBC's Today programme that the compensation paid to the 555 people would be ""absolutely parallel"" to the other Post Office workers who had been compensated through the historic shortfall scheme. He said the group were ""pioneers"" and had ""broken open"" the scandal. ""I want to make sure they get that full compensation,"" he said. ""It is a massive scandal and it's something I am absolutely determined to put right."" Asked if the families of 32 out of the 555 people who have since died would be able to receive the compensation, Mr Scully said he would look into it. This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Mr Scully said he envisaged the compensation scheme as running alongside the historic shortfall scheme ""on the basis of losses, and looking at ongoing losses as well"". ""I'd love to say I've got a blank cheque from the Treasury, but that's clearly not going to happen from this place - but the Treasury know that we need to sort it out. ""I want to make sure that the scheme has the confidence of [subpostmasters],"" he added. Following the government's announcement, the Post Office said it welcomed the move. ""Since it came to light through media reports that around Â£46m of the compensation provided to group litigation claimants was directed to the funders of their case, we have continually urged the government to address this unfairness,"" a statement said. It's hard to overstate the importance of the legal precedent set by the victory of 555 subpostmasters two and a half years ago. That was the moment that evidence came into the public domain about the flaws with the Post Office's Horizon system, and back-end access to the software. The judge did not hold back in his opinion of the Post Office, saying the system was not remotely robust, but that getting that information out of the Post Office had taken subpostmasters years, and many tens of millions of pounds in costs. It was the moment where the tables turned against a crown institution which had been wrongly convicting, bankrupting, and sacking its own employees for decades. Their David v. Goliath legal battle has proved the ammunition needed for 706 branch managers who were convicted or sent to prison have been able to get those convictions quashed. It also forced the Post Office to agree to refund 2,500 others for huge financial losses they suffered as result, although most still haven't received a penny of that money. The 555 original legal trailblazers stood and cheered as their legal victory snowballed, but were left with very little in compensation themselves. This new scheme is promising to set that right. Full details of how to claim have not yet been published, and there's still a lot of nervousness from those who had to fight the Post Office and the government at every turn, but this is the clearest statement yet that a fairer payment is on the way. The new compensation scheme comes as High Court judge Sir Wyn Williams leads a public inquiry into the Post Office scandal, which has heard testimonies from Post Office staff, some of which were wrongly accused or convicted of crimes they didn't commit. A total of 72 have had their names cleared so far. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - is examining whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system, Horizon, which was developed by Japanese company Fujitsu. It will also ask how and why they were left to shoulder the blame. The Post Office has previously said it is ""sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families and we are in no doubt about the human cost"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. The Department for Business has previously said it is ""eager to see all Horizon-related issues resolved fairly and quickly, including for the 555, who played a crucial role in bringing this scandal to light"".

The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians,"This video can not be played WATCH: Protesters block superyacht linked to Abramovich at Bodrum A superyacht linked to Roman Abramovich has had to leave a port in Turkey, as Western powers ramp up pressure on Russian oligarchs. The MY Solaris sailed to Bodrum last month after the billionaire was included in both UK and EU sanctions. It was greeted by protests from a boatload of young Ukrainians, who tried to stop the yacht docking there. But after two weeks in Bodrum, Global Port Holdings, which operates the cruise terminal,said it had decided not to accept payment for berthing the ship.,external The company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it ""has always strictly adhered to and will continue to adhere to... international sanctions rules and the requirements of the applicable laws, as well as to the legal conditions of its concession agreement in Bodrum."" In its statement, it said that it was not involved in deciding which ships could dock in the port, which is the responsibility of the Turkish authorities. MY Solaris has since moved off from Bodrum to anchor in nearby YalÄ±kavak, while a second yacht linked to Mr Abramovich, the Eclipse, remains in Marmaris, a popular tourist destination along the Turkish Riviera. Both vessels cost more than $500m and are among a number tracked by Lloyd's List Intelligence. The shipping data experts have been monitoring on-board tracking devices and have shared this information exclusively with the BBC, enabling the journeys of these and other vessels linked to sanctioned Russians to be plotted. The UK, US and EU have said they will target superyachts, andsome havealreadybeen seizedin European ports. More remain at large - some are on the move, others are moored in places that are currently safe from sanctions, including the Maldives. Many superyachts are linked to Russian billionaires but ownership is shrouded in secrecy - they are often registered through a series of offshore companies. The team at Lloyd's List sifted through registration papers, credit reports and other records to determine who they believe is linked to each superyacht. MY Solaris, which is estimated to have cost $600m, boasts a pool and a helipad. It has a crew of up to 60 and can accommodate more than 30 guests. It left Barcelona on 8 March where it was undergoing repairs, and docked off Tivat in Montenegro days after Mr Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK. Tivat is a hub for superyachts and boasts a large marina. MY Solaris left Tivat and was sailing off the Greek west coast when the EU sanctioned Mr Abramovich on 15 March. After this date, the yacht's tracking data shows it was steering clear of Greek territorial waters (Greece is in the EU) and sailing in international waters, where it cannot be seized. On 21 March, it arrived in the Turkish resort of Bodrum, which has a modern marina and can accommodate superyachts up to 140m in length. But its path was blocked by a small dinghy carrying eight children from a Ukrainian junior sailing team and their coach, waving Ukrainian flags. Coach Paulo Donstov told the BBC they were there to compete in a sailing championship and were tipped off about the arrival of MY Solaris. Protesters from a junior sailing team try to prevent MY Solaris docking ""We want the world to know that Ukraine wants freedom and peace,"" said Mr Donstov, whose family are still in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. Turkey has said it has ""no intention"" of joining EU sanctions on Russians and, unlike most European countries, it is still allowing direct flights from Russia. The captain of one vessel linked to a wealthy Russian, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC that Turkish officials had made it clear that Russian ships are ""very welcome and will be treated as any other vessel"". TheEclipseis one of the world's largest superyachts. It has nine decks, three helipads and a three-person submarine. It is also rumoured to have a missile-defence system and a laser-directed light system to deter photographers from taking pictures of the vessel. It was docked off the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten - a Dutch overseas territory linked to the EU - but left at the beginning of March. It then sailed east through the Mediterranean, north of Algeria. On 22 March, the data showed it arriving at Marmaris in Turkey. The resort, a former fishing village, is another popular destination for superyachts. There is a marina, an Ottoman castle and more than 50 diving sites nearby. Sea Rhapsodyhas also been on the move. It has been linked to Andrei Kostin, president of the Russian state-owned VTB bank, who has been sanctioned by the US, EU and UK authorities. The vessel, which boasts a cinema and a gym, left Fethiye in Turkey on 18 February, heading for Oman before arriving in the Seychelles on 3 March, where it has remained since. The superyachtCliois linked to Oleg Deripaska, an industrialist with close ties to President Putin, who has been sanctioned by the UK and the US. It has its own support vessel called Sputnik - complete with its own helipad. Clio's on-board tracker located it near the Maldives in mid-March. It left these waters on 19 March, headed towards Oman and then the north-west coast of India, before turning back towards the Maldives.It has since headed north again, this time through the Gulf of Aden. Several other vessels linked to sanctioned Russians were in or near the Maldives, including theOcean Victorylinked to Viktor Rashnikov andNordlinked to Alexei Mordashov. TheMadame Gu- linked to Andrey Skoch who has been sanctioned by the EU, UK and US - is in Dubai. AndLe Grand Bleu,a yacht linked to Eugene Shvidler, who is under UK sanctions, was sailing in the Caribbean and is now in Puerto Rico (a US territory). The Maldives, the Seychelles and Dubai don't have an agreement with the US, UK or EU that would allow the authorities to seize property, protecting yachts there from any sanctions. But they may not be able to stay in safe waters indefinitely. ""These things are living, guzzling animals on the water that need maintenanceâ¦ so you need ports that can cater to that,"" says Capucine de VallÃ©e, CEO of Boatbookings. ""All the leading shipyards are in northern Europe."" She believes manufacturers may stop offering parts and maintenance due to sanctions. A superyacht linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past sailed back to Russian waters before the invasion of Ukraine began. Gracefulmoved from Germany to the coast of Kaliningrad, Russia, in mid-February. But Lloyd's List says the movement data is limited as the vessel turned off its tracking device for several weeks. Under the UN Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, ships must have their onboard-trackers switched on at all times unless there is a danger to the safety of the crew and vessel. Several other yachts linked to Russians have also occasionally turned off their tracking data in the last month. US officials are examining the ownership of a second yacht, theScheherazadewhich is currently docked off the Italian town of Marina di Carrara. Supporters of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny have linked the 140m vessel, estimated to be worth $700m, to President Putin. At this time of year, many superyachts would usually start heading toward popular European destinations, such as Port Hercule in Monaco or Marina Grande on the Italian island of Capri. But some countries in Europe have now seized yachts linked to sanctioned Russians. The US and Spanish authorities recently conducted a joint operation in Mallorca to seize the yacht Tango.  It's linked to Viktor Vekselberg,who was sanctioned by the US in 2018.,external Sailing Yacht A - linked to Andrei Melnichenko - was seized in Trieste, Italy There have been other vessels seized as well: Sailing Yacht Aseized in Trieste, Italy (linked to Andrei Melnichenko) Lenaseized in San Remo, Italy (linked to Gennadiy Timchenko) Lady Mseized in Imperia, Italy (linked to Alexei Mordashov) Amore Veroseized in La Ciotat, France (linked to Russian oligarch Igor Sechin) Valerieseized near Barcelona, Spain (linked to Sergei Chemenov) Crescentseized in Tarragona, Spain Lady Anastasiaseized in Port Adriano, Spain (linked to Alexander Mikheev) Axiomaseized in Gibraltar (linked to Dmitrievich Pumpyansky) There is still confusion about the status of one of the world's biggest superyachts, theDilbar- linked to sanctioned Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov. It was reported that it had been seized in Hamburg, but the local authorities told us that this was not the case and that it was docked for ongoing repairs. And a further two yachts are reported to have been seized in France, but the details have not yet been confirmed by the authorities. Italian officials on board the Lena yacht - linked to Gennadiy Timchenko Lloyds List looked at more than 40 superyachts that they linked to wealthy Russians. Many of them haven't been sanctioned and there are clusters of them (highlighted in blue) still in the Mediterranean. But they are already getting a frosty welcome in some ports. Crew members have been shunned in Monaco, according to Ms de Vallee, with some contractors refusing to carry out maintenance work because of fears they might have their payments confiscated by the EU. The captain of one superyacht told us: ""Our line of credit is completely cut, which makes operating very difficult.""

Oligarch says he ditched mansions before sanctionsAlisher Usmanov put luxury homes into trusts raising questions about whether sanctions will work.Business,"Alisher Usmanov shakes hands with Vladimir Putin in 2018 A Russian billionaire sanctioned by the UK says he no longer owns many former properties, potentially putting them beyond the reach of the law. Ex-Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov's Â£82m London home and Surrey mansion were put into trusts linked to the oligarch. This raises questions over the effectiveness of sanctions imposed since the invasion of Ukraine began. The UK government says Mr Usmanov ""cannot access his assets"". On 3 March, seven days after Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, Alisher Usmanov was added to the list of sanctioned Russian businessmen. His assets were frozen, he was banned from visiting the UK, and British citizens and businesses were banned from dealing with him. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: âWe will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.â The government said sanctions would cut him off from âsignificant UK interests including mansions worth tens of millionsâ. But this is now in doubt because Mr Usmanovâs spokesman says he is no longer the legal owner of many of those assets. Born in Uzbekistan in the Soviet Union, Alisher Usmanov, 68, owns USM Holdings, a huge conglomerate involved in mining and telecoms, including Russia's second biggest mobile network MegaFon. Beechwood House in Highgate, North London His wealth has been estimated at $18.4bn (Â£14bn), including ""Beechwood House in Highgateâ¦ and the 16th Century Sutton Place estate in Surreyâ,the UK government said,external. BBC research estimates that Beechwood House could now be worth about Â£82m. But a spokesman for Mr Usmanov said that most of the billionaireâs UK property, as well as his yacht, had already been âtransferred into irrevocable trustsâ. Those are trusts which cannot usually be amended, modified, or revoked after theyâre created. When the assets were transferred, Mr Usmanov no longer owned them, his spokesman said. âNor was he able to manage them or deal with their sale, but could only use them on a rental basis.â âMr Usmanov withdrew from the beneficiaries of the trusts, donating his beneficial rights to his family,"" he said. The spokesman was answering questions about Mr Usmanovâs wealth put to him as part of an investigation into the assets of 35 oligarchs close to Putin. TheRussian Asset Tracker,externalis a global partnership involving 27 media organisations includingthe Guardian,external, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BBC Panorama. The project identified $3.4bn (Â£2.6bn) worth of specific assets whichit says belong to Mr Usmanov,external. But if Mr Usmanov is not the beneficial owner of much of this property, it could be beyond the reach of UK sanctions. And the same could be true for other oligarchs. According to lawyer and sanctions expert Michael OâKane, âitâs very common for high net worth individualsâ¦ to structure both their commercial enterprises and their personal wealth in a way that gives them maximum tax efficiency. Quite often that results in structures whereby they release ownership and control in return for more tax efficiency.â âIn order for an entity to be designated under sanctions it needs to be owned or controlled by a sanctioned person. The more opaque and complex the structures of ownership the more difficult that is to establish.â Sutton Place in Surrey Tracing the ownership of the two houses targeted by the UK government is extremely difficult. They have been held through a complex web of trusts and companies registered in places like the British Virgin Islands, which have until recently not required the ultimate owner to be disclosed. This illustrates the difficulty investigators will have in working out which assets should be subject to sanctions. Despite offshore secrecy the BBC has been able to identify two trusts that have owned the properties, and the involvement of one of Mr Usmanovâs closest business associates. Farhad Moshiri watching Everton Football Club They involve a long-time associate of Mr Usmanov, Farhad Moshiri, the owner of Everton football club, who is not subject to sanctions. Heâs a shareholder in Mr Usmanovâs company USM, which sponsored Everton until the club terminated the relationship in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Leaked documents obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland other corporate records show Mr Moshiri was the shareholder of a company in the British Virgin Islands called Coney Holdings Limited. Until 2014 it owned the shares of the corporate trustees of the Sutton Place Property Unit Trust, which owns the Surrey Mansion, drawing a direct link between Mr Moshiri and the house. After Sutton Place Property Unit Trust was set up in 2005, Mr Usmanov was given a Â£6m loan facility secured against the trust. Mr Usmanov was also the beneficiary of the Pauillac Trust, the owner of Hanley Limited, the Isle of Man company that owns Beechwood, the other property targeted by the government. Once again, Mr Moshiri was involved, this time as a director of Pauillac Properties Limited, a company owned by the trust, that held shares in Hanley Limited. Mr Usmanov declined to respond to questions about his relationship with the two trusts, or whether he had ceased to have a beneficial interest in them. While the evidence confirms he was once involved, exactly who stands behind the two trusts now, and therefore owns the properties, is a mystery. A spokesman for Mr Moshiri told the BBC that he âceased to be a director of Pauillac in 2016â and that Mr Moshiri âhas never been nor is he now involved in the management and/or control of the Sutton Place Property Unit Trustâ. In relation to USM, Mr Moshiri's spokesman said he had sold 50% of his stake in the company but is prevented from selling the rest by the Russian government. He has resigned from the board. Alisher Usmanov watching an Arsenal game Mr Moshiri owns another property identified by our investigation. Mr Usmanov bought a luxury property in north London for Â£15.8m in 2011. In 2014 Russia invaded Crimea. In March that year Western sanctions targeting those closest to President Putin were imposed, and calls were made for Mr Usmanovâs UK assets to be frozen. A month later shares in the company that owned the property, Oakhill Avenue Limited, were transferred to a company owned by Mr Moshiri, for what his spokesman said was ""north of Â£18m."" He told the BBC Oakhill Avenue ""is 100% owned by Mr Moshiri and has been since 2014 when Mr Moshiri acquired the house."" He said âNeither Mr Usmanov, nor any entities related to him, have any current connection to the house or indeed the company that owns the house.â But thatâs not the only property Mr Moshiri obtained from Mr Usmanov. In 2004 Mr Usmanov had bought another property in north London for Â£2 million. Five years later the property, on Tercelet Terrace in Hampstead, was transferred to Mr Moshiri ânot for moneyâ. In June 2010, it was transferred, again ânot for moneyâ, this time to Mr Moshiriâs sister. Itâs not the first time Mr Moshiri has faced questions over his complex financial relationship with Mr Usmanov, such as hisinvestments in Arsenal and Everton FC. Farhad Moshiri at Everton Asked why Mr Usmanov had handed the property to Mr Moshiri ânot for moneyâ Mr Moshiriâs spokesman declined to comment. The use of offshore entities makes it hard for governments to build a clear picture of what someone they have sanctioned actually owns. âBritainâs offshore financial centres, such as the British Virgin Islands, have long been a destination of choice for Kremlin cronies and kleptocrats,â says Steve Goodrich, Head of Research and Investigations at Transparency International UK (TIUK). âComplex networks of secretive shell companies in these jurisdictions means the UK government is attempting to enforce these sanctions with one arm tied behind its back.â TIUK says the UK government should work with the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to increase the pace of their own transparency reforms. A spokesman for Mr Usmanov said that âto characterise the source of his money as ânon-transparentâ is inherently incorrect and damages Mr Usmanovâs reputation as an honest entrepreneur and philanthropist.â âThe entirety of Mr Usmanovâs capital was built through successful, sometimes risky investments, as well as through the effective management of his assets.â The government says its sanctions are having an impact with $250bn (Â£189bn) wiped off the Russian stock market. âThe sanctions against Alisher Usmanov were enacted with immediate effectâ said a spokesperson for the Foreign Office. âIt is now illegal for any person or company in the UK to do business with him.â Additional reporting: Ben King and Will Dahlgreen Everton-linked Usmanov has assets frozen What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

Hobbyist satellite watchers change our view of war,"Satellites can be used to pick out images of individual vehicles and even road markings Kyle Glen, a project manager in Wales in the UK, has an unusual hobby - tracking Russian troop movements. Mr Glen is co-founder of Conflict News, an account on social media platform, Twitter, with more than 400,000 followers. It collates and shares publicly-available photos and videos of conflict, gathered from a variety of online sources. Since early last year, he and others among what's known as the ""open source intelligence community"" have been closely watching Russian military activity in and around Ukraine. He bought and shared from the account satellite images from online service SkyWatch, which reportedly showed the massing of vehicles along the Russia-Ukraine border over many months - and then, the moment when the invasion began. ""We watched it go from nothing, to quite significant build-up and then it was empty again the day before the invasion,"" he recalls, referring to images from one apparent camp on the border. ""I don't get any money from this at all,"" says Mr Glen. ""It's completely a hobby, voluntary, whatever you want to call it."" Media coverage of the war in Ukraine, which started almost a month ago, has included, arguably to an unprecedented extent, content shared via social media. This has includedsatellite photos that documenttroop movements and shocking damage to cities. BBC News: Tips on how to spot Ukraine fakes In recent days, pictures snapped by satellites in orbit have captured images which appear to show destroyed Russian helicopters, extensive damage to a shopping centre and residential districts in Mariupol, and a civilian tanker vessel on fire in the Black Sea. Maxar satellite images appear to show a long Russian convoy of military vehicles approaching Kyiv, Ukraine's capital Privately-owned companies that launch and operate their own satellites - such as Planet and Maxar - have distributed many satellite images of the conflict zone. The proliferation of these images means members of the public and military analysts alike can try to gauge the situation on the ground in Ukraine and the progress of Russia's invading armed forces from thousands of miles away. Mr Glen says that while satellite imagery has been available online during previous conflicts,including the war in Syria, the volume of this material was ""a drop in the bucket"", compared to what has come out of Ukraine in little more than a fortnight. So, what's changed? While government and intelligence agency satellites gather classified, secret information, commercial firms have long been able to sell their own, unclassified, imagery. And now, this material is being made easily accessible online. A variety of businesses and other organisations rely on satellite images to track everything from wildfires to crops and the movement of ships. This means there has been a big rise in the number of commercial satellites in orbit which has significantly increased data sharing possibilities says Chris Quilty, partner at Quilty Analytics. ""There are more eyes in the sky,"" as he puts it. There has been a big rise in satellite launches over the last 20 years Members of the public can purchase high-quality pictures gathered by satellite for as little as $10 (Â£7.60) per sq km. The resolution of these images is sometimes very high, capturing tiny details measuring down to 30cm by 30cm at ground level. This granularity makes it possible to identify vehicles and road markings. Operators can also program satellites to monitor specific locations multiple times every 24 hours, picking up even small changes almost as soon as they happen. As the technology has advanced, the public's willingness to engage with satellite images has really taken off, Mr Quilty adds: ""The fundamental capability hasn't changed dramatically, it's the willingness and manner in which users are ingesting and using the data that has changed."" This even extends to sophisticated, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which is often more difficult to interpret than a picture taken with an optical lens. Satellites can even capture SAR images through cloud cover. The resulting black-and-white pictures might show vehicles, including tanks, for instance, as rows of bright dots. Mr Glen says these types of image have helped him, and people like him, to track the beginning of the Ukraine invasion. Rita Konaev says widespread access to satellite images has helped combat disinformation about the Ukraine conflict. Rita Konaev, associate director of analysis at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, says satellite imagery ""has been an aspect of modern conflict for 10 to 15 years now, but the scale [this time] is different and the accessibility is different,"" she adds, suggesting satellite imagery has helped to challenge disinformation about the invasion. ""The architecture of European cities like Kyiv is very familiar in the Western world,"" adds Dr Konaev. This familiarity, she suggests, may have influenced the response in the West to the invasion - in contrast with wars in the Middle East and further afield. Mr Glen says followers of Conflict News and similar social media accounts, can verify satellite imagery by checking online sources themselves. ""You can present the evidence to a wider audience in as unbiased a way as possible and let people to come to their own conclusions,"" he says.

How Covid exposed India's 'crumbling' health sector The shipping giant banking on a greener fuel However, he also acknowledges that he and others like him in the so-called ""open source intelligence community"" make judgements about what to share and when. For example, he identifies more closely with the Ukrainians than the Russians in this conflict, he says, and therefore would not intentionally publish any information about Ukrainian military movements, to avoid accidentally compromising their safety. Some private companies are also sharing sophisticated images captured from orbit - in near real-time - directly with the Ukrainian military. Canadian firmMDA is one such example,external. Dr Konaev argues that satellite images offer a unique overview - literally - of events unfolding thousands of miles away, unlike any other media, which may she says explain some of the heightened interest in these pictures. A tank driver flies the Ukraine flag ""In some ways, I think the imagery from a distance, gives even more of a perspective of the scale of the destruction and the devastation,"" she adds. ""It's more than just people's individual lives, it's [whole] communities."" But there could be some significant consequences of making such detailed imagery so widely available. Although militaries have vast intelligence resources that they rely on beyond social media, there is no knowing how satellite images of troop movements shared on Twitter, or Facebook, could influence operational decisions on the ground. ""There are real, potential life or death consequences,"" says Dr Konaev. Mr Glen has thought about this possibility but will likely never know whether an image he shares ultimately leads to a fatal attack or confrontation on a frontline. ""I wouldn't say it makes me hesitate, as such, but it's something I'm aware is a possibility,"" he says. ""And I've come to terms with it.""

Stena Line to help NI retail routes over P&O issues,"This video can not be played P&O Ferries 'ripped up employment rule book' Stena Line will put on two extra ferry services from Scotland to Northern Ireland from tomorrow, the UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. He told the Commons it would be of help to some retailers including Asda and Marks and Spencers. He said the company had already ""stepped up"" following the suspension of P&O routes last week. Up to 50 staff from Northern Ireland will be directly impacted by P&O's move to fire 800 workers last week. Mr Shapps said if it was confirmed that relative notice periods and consultations were not conducted before P&O staff were fired, then it would be a ""a matter for criminal prosecution and unlimited fines"". The Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has accused the firm of ""ripping up the employment rule book"". Mr Lyons said he did not believe P&O had acted within either the ""spirit or letter"" of employment law, a matter devolved to Northern Ireland. Officials are investigating potential remedies for breaches of the law. On Thursday, the companyfired about 800 of its workers, with about a quarter of the staff hearing the news via a pre-recorded video message. A private security firm was sent on board the vessel in Larne, County Antrim, which remains docked at the port, to remove staff. On Monday, P&O said its services, including the crossing from Larne to Cairnryan in Scotland, would be ""unable to run for the next few days"". ""For essential travel, customers are advised to seek alternatives themselves,"" the firm continued. It had been suggested at the time of the workforce announcement thatit could be a weekbefore the ferry service could resume. A protest was held against P&O's decision at the Port of Larne on Friday Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he raised the P&O situation during discussions with his counterparts in Scotland and Wales and the chief secretary to the treasury on Monday. He said there should be support for the workers who needed to be treated ""fairly"". ""We can't just be subject to the whim of company who decide to cut their costs and behave in an appalling manner to do that,"" Mr Murphy added. Allow Twitter content?

""P&O might want to hide behind the small print of maritime law... but the court of public opinion will not be so sympathetic,"" Mr Lyons told assembly members (MLAs) on Monday. ""We must send a strong message to all companies that might think of getting involved in a practice in this way."" On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said P&O's move had been ""awful"" and ""wrong"" and the governmentwould examine the legality of its actions. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Some of the dismissed workers and trade unionsheld a protestat Larne port on Friday. This video can not be played P&O workers 'have been treated appallingly' P&O has said its decision to fire workers was to secure the future viability of the business. It explained that required ""swift and significant changes now"". The company said it would update its Twitter account regularly to inform people of the operational situation. On Monday, Northern Ireland's Consumer Council said that following talks with P&O, travellers affected by the disruption could re-book their crossing with Stena Line andclaim expenses from P&O,external. The council's head of transport, Richard Williams, said people could also claim for additional expenditure, such as some hotel or mileage costs. ""Originally that wasn't going to be the case but they've accepted that because they can't provide the re-rerouting they normally would that people really have to book with Stena,"" he said. Mr Williams said it was common for mechanical issues to cause delays to ferry services but the P&O situation was one that was ""going on and on"". ""It is certainly an unusual situation which is causing real problems for passengers,"" he added. Mr Williams said the biggest issue was the employee situation but he warned the company faced ""financial repercussions"" to resolve customer issues also. Geraldine Sinclair, who was due to travel with P&O on Thursday to a family event in Scotland said she would never use the company again because of how they treated customers and staff, She told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster she needed to re-arrange transport and was told she would receive a refund. ""I don't think much of them but to be honest, it's the staff I feel sorry for. We've all been there with redundancies but certainly not like that,"" she said. Geraldine's husband Jim said he would avoid the company unless there was ""no viable alternative"". P&O has said its decision to fire workers was to secure the future viability of the business.

Union 'wouldn't exempt special schools' from strike,"Unite workers are on strike in a dispute over pay The Unite union refused requests to exempt special school services from strike action, the Education Authority has claimed. The authority said the union declined requests it made on Wednesday 16 March and Monday 21 March. The Unite union has been contacted by BBC News NI for a response. Members ofUnite are taking action over a local government pay offer of 1.75%, which the union has called a ""real terms pay cut"". Unite is one of the largest public sector unions. The union said its members in councils, the Education Authority and the Housing Executive expressed overwhelming support for the industrial action in ballots. Gareth Scott, from Unite, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster the offer was ""totally inadequate"". ""These local authority workers have seen their pay cut in real terms by 22% in last 12 years,"" he added. ""Over the last two years, during the pandemic, they have been essential workers and now we have the cost of living crisis - the response from employers was to offer a meagre 1.75% increase."" This video can not be played We're not being offered a living wage' When asked if the union had considered making an exception for special schools, he said the problem lay with the employers. ""This could have been avoided by the employers making a fair and reasonable pay offer - something that goes a lot closer to meeting the cost of living,"" he said. ""Our members do not want to be on strike. But they have got to the point where they feel they have no alternative."" Some school transport, meals, council bin collections, leisure services and Housing Executive maintenance will be disrupted by the week-long action by over 2,000 Unite members. Some special schools are expected to be particularly affected by the unavailability of Education Authority transport as they rely heavily on the so-called yellow buses. Some classroom assistants in special schools who are members of Unite may also be on strike. But only one of 39 special schools - Glenveagh in Belfast - has said it cannot offer pupils face-to-face teaching ""due to lack of staffing"". The Education Authority, though, said it had asked on Wednesday 16 March for classroom assistants at Glenveagh to be exempt from the strike. It had also asked for yellow bus drivers in greater Belfast who transport wheelchair-using pupils to be allowed to continue to work. The strikes may cause some disruption to school meals The authority said that on Monday it had gone further and asked Unite to exempt all special school staff and bus drivers from the strike action. The Education Authority's director of human resources Clare Duffield told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra that Unite had been asked to ""protect"" special schools. ""It is very disappointing that children with special educational needs are having their normal routine disrupted,"" she said. ""And it's really disappointing that those requests have been rejected at this stage."" ""We have made the requests on a number of occasions and will continue to escalate those requests so that we can attempt to minimise the disruption throughout the week."" ""We absolutely respect the right of a trade union and their members to take lawful industrial action but it's very disappointing when that impact son the most vulnerable children and young people."" Ms Duffield said that around 100 out of over 2,000 EA bus routes had been affected by strike action on Monday but that pupils from special schools has been most affected.

Shell reconsiders exit from oil field off Shetland,"Energy giant Shell is reconsidering its recent decision to pull investment from a large new UK oil field, the BBC understands. In December, Shell said the economic case - along with possible regulatory delays - meant it was withdrawing from the Cambo oil field, which is 75 miles off the west coast of Shetland. At the time the price of crude oil was under $70 a barrel. It has since touched double that price and has consistently been over $100. Oil prices are volatile because of fears that Russian oil will either be shunned, or cut off. The desire to reduce European dependence on Russian exports has also made the UK government willing to fast track investment in domestic fossil fuels. Shell has not yet sold its interests in the field. Sources close to the matter said that, while the company's official position had not changed, it did acknowledge that the economic, political and regulatory environment had changed enormously since the decision was announced just three months ago. Shell last week resubmitted an application to develop the Jackdaw North Sea gas field - off the east coast of Scotland - having had it turned down in October by environmental regulators. The company said it had modified the chemical processes involved in the gas extraction to meet regulatory requirements. The UK government said investment decisions are a commercial matter for the companies involved, but it remains committed to the domestic offshore oil and gas sector as the UK transitions to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. What does net zero mean? The UK's North Sea regulator plans later this year to hold the first oil and gas licensing round for new fields since 2020. Shell's decision last December to pull out of the project was taken two weeks after COP26 - a high profile global climate conference in Glasgow - and was roundly welcomed by environmental campaigners, who described Shell's decision as a hammer blow to the project. Tessa Khan, director of environmental group Uplift, said new oil and gas assets like Cambo would not help bring down prices or secure UK energy security of supply. ""Contrary to what [Business Secretary] Kwasi Kwarteng has said, this isn't 'our oil',"" she said. ""It belongs to Shell who will sell it abroad to the highest bidder. According to the government's own figures, 80% of North Sea oil is put in tankers and exported. ""What it will do is produce carbon emissions equivalent to 18 coal-fired power stations, when we are already experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis. Cambo makes as little sense today as it did last year."" The government is due to unveil its energy supply strategy early next week. What does net zero mean?

Rescuers scour China plane crash site for survivors,"Search and rescue workers trawling the slopes near the crash site are yet to find passengers Rescuers have found no survivors so far from a jet carrying 132 people which crashed in hills in southern China. Crash investigators also had no information on why China Eastern flight MU5735 plummeted out of the sky on Monday. Recovery work at the site of the Boeing 737-800 crash in Guangxi province is being hampered by difficult terrain. There has been an outpouring of grief in China, where families of passengers and crew are waiting for news. Hundreds of responders have been scouring the steeply forested slopes in Wuzhou where debris from the plane was strewn after it broke apart and set fire to the hillside. There had been no official word on casualties until China's Civil Aviation Administration held its news briefing, some 36 hours after the disaster. ""Up to now, search and rescue work has not found any survivors,"" Zhu Tao, aviation safety office director at the CAA, told reporters. ""Given the information currently available, we still do notÂ have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash."" Air controllers had repeatedly called theÂ aircraft during its descent but had received noÂ response, he added. Rescuers have so far found parts of the 737's burnt wreckage. State broadcasters showed images of the charred remains of letters, bags, wallets and identity cards belonging to those on board. Meanwhile, the families and friends of the 123 passengers and nine crew have gathered at each end of the flight - with relatives visiting China Eastern's offices in Yunnan province and waiting at Guangzhou International Airport. The China Eastern Airlines flight from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, had been due to land in Guangzhou on Monday afternoon. China Eastern has grounded all its Boeing 737-800s and set up a hotline for people seeking information on those on board. Authorities have yet to identify passengers and crew members, but some relatives have spoken to local media or shared their grief online. One woman reported the loss of her newly-wed husband on her WeChat account. Her earlier posts included videos of the couple's holiday trips. Other passengers included a group of six people, one of them a teenager, who were on their way to Guangzhou to attend a funeral, a local newspaper reported. Families waiting for news at Guangzhou International Airport on Monday night Another woman interviewed said her sister and close friends were part of that group, adding that she had also been booked on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very anguished,"" she told Jiemian News. Boeing jets under 'surveillance' after China crash How does a plane's black box work? Air disasters timeline Reuters quoted a man at the airport who said he was the colleague of a passenger named Mr Tan. After confirming that Mr Tan was on board, he had to break the news to Mr Tan's family. ""They were sobbing. His mother couldn't believe this had happened,"" he told the news agency. ""Her boy was only 29 years old."" He added that arrangements were being made by the airline to bring families to the crash site in Wuzhou. Pictures show distraught families waiting in a cordoned-off area at Guangzhou airport, being assisted by airline staff. One unverified clip circulating widely on Chinese social media shows a man slumped in his seat crying and lamenting the loss of his three children who were on the flight. This accident took place in China and involved a Chinese airline. As such, the investigation will be led by the country's civil aviation administration. But under international standards, the US will also be entitled to appoint an accredited representative because the Boeing 737 was designed and built in the US. The National Transportation Safety Board has already appointed a senior air safety investigator to fulfil this role. Representatives from Boeing itself, the engine maker CFM International and the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, will serve as technical advisers. The priority now will be to gather evidence from the crash site and search for the ""black boxes"", the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. If they can be found, and the data they contain is readable, then the immediate cause of the crash could become apparent quite quickly. But the investigation as a whole will take time. Flight MU5735 had been in the air for more than an hour and was nearing its destination when it suddenly plummeted from its cruising height. Chinese state TV outlets have broadcast footage which appears to show a jet in a near nosedive to the ground. The footage was captured by a car's dashcam. The BBC has not yet been able to verify the clip. Flight tracker data showed the Boeing 737-800 jet dropped thousands of metres in under three minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 model has a strong safety record, with thousands in service around the world. The aircraft that crashed was less than seven years old. Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes - including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision.

Stomach bug cases plummeted in UK's Covid lockdown,"The UK's Covid lockdown appears to have had a massive impact on stomach bugs, slashing outbreaks by more than half in England during the first six months of the pandemic. Far fewer people suffered vomiting and diarrhoea than usual, data show. People staying at home, mixing less and washing their hands will have had an impact, say public health experts in a new article published by BMJ Open. This perk may continue if we all carry on being more germ-aware, they say. Routine surveillance in England shows the number of outbreaks caused by the winter vomiting bug norovirus hasincreased in recent weeks,,externalalthough they are still below the five-year-average or usual level for this time of year. Norovirus is easily transmitted through contact with people who have it, or contaminated surfaces. Prof Saheer Gharbia, from the UK Health Security Agency and one of the authors of the BMJ study, said: ""Norovirus, commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, has been at lower levels than normal throughout the pandemic but, as people have begun to mix more, the numbers of outbreaks have started to increase again."" Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea. Although it can be very unpleasant, it usually goes away in a couple of days. The advice is to stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do not return to work or send children to school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. Prof Gharbia said: ""Please avoid visiting elderly relatives if you are unwell - particularly if they are in a care home or hospital. ""As with Covid and other infectious illnesses, handwashing is really important to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, unlike for Covid, alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus, so soap and water is best."" For their study, Prof Gharbia and colleagues looked at information on outbreaks, laboratory notifications, calls to the NHS 111 health advice service, GP appointments, and attendance at emergency care for gastrointestinal infections during the first half of 2020 in England. That included illness from bacteria like salmonella and listeria, as well as the winter vomiting virus. Just over 1,500 suspected and lab-confirmed gastrointestinal infection outbreaks were reported in England, representing a 52% fall on the five-year average for the period. Google Trends data showed internet searches for key phrases, such as ""food poisoning"", ""gastroenteritis"" and ""sickness bug"" plunged, while ones for ""handwashing"" and ""disinfection"" rose substantially during the UK's first Covid wave. Each year in England there are typically more than 17 million cases of gastrointestinal infections, resulting in more than one million calls or visits for medical advice or care. To help reduce the spread: Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water If you do become ill, stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated Wash any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash Do not share towels and flannels Ensure toilets and the surrounding areas are cleaned thoroughly Avoid eating raw, unwashed food produce Prof Martin Marshall, from the Royal College of GPs, said: ""This study makes clear that as we've seen with other contagious diseases, such as colds and flu, prevalence of gastro-intestinal infection was lower during the pandemic. This is likely to be in a large part due to restrictions that were implemented to stop the spread of Covid, and greater adherence to public health measures. ""As we move to the next stages of the pandemic, severe restrictions have been, and continue to be, lifted to allow a more normal way of life, but practising good hygiene measures is something that can and should continue, and really can help people keep well.""

Families wait for news of China plane crash rescue,"Search and rescue workers trawling the slopes near the crash site are yet to find passengers Rescuers have found no survivors so far from a jet carrying 132 people which crashed in hills in southern China. Crash investigators also had no information on why China Eastern flight MU5735 plummeted out of the sky on Monday. Recovery work at the site of the Boeing 737-800 crash in Guangxi province is being hampered by difficult terrain. There has been an outpouring of grief in China, where families of passengers and crew are waiting for news. Hundreds of responders have been scouring the steeply forested slopes in Wuzhou where debris from the plane was strewn after it broke apart and set fire to the hillside. There had been no official word on casualties until China's Civil Aviation Administration held its news briefing, some 36 hours after the disaster. ""Up to now, search and rescue work has not found any survivors,"" Zhu Tao, aviation safety office director at the CAA, told reporters. ""Given the information currently available, we still do notÂ have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash."" Air controllers had repeatedly called theÂ aircraft during its descent but had received noÂ response, he added. Rescuers have so far found parts of the 737's burnt wreckage. State broadcasters showed images of the charred remains of letters, bags, wallets and identity cards belonging to those on board. Meanwhile, the families and friends of the 123 passengers and nine crew have gathered at each end of the flight - with relatives visiting China Eastern's offices in Yunnan province and waiting at Guangzhou International Airport. The China Eastern Airlines flight from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, had been due to land in Guangzhou on Monday afternoon. China Eastern has grounded all its Boeing 737-800s and set up a hotline for people seeking information on those on board. Authorities have yet to identify passengers and crew members, but some relatives have spoken to local media or shared their grief online. One woman reported the loss of her newly-wed husband on her WeChat account. Her earlier posts included videos of the couple's holiday trips. Other passengers included a group of six people, one of them a teenager, who were on their way to Guangzhou to attend a funeral, a local newspaper reported. Families waiting for news at Guangzhou International Airport on Monday night Another woman interviewed said her sister and close friends were part of that group, adding that she had also been booked on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very anguished,"" she told Jiemian News. Boeing jets under 'surveillance' after China crash How does a plane's black box work? Air disasters timeline Reuters quoted a man at the airport who said he was the colleague of a passenger named Mr Tan. After confirming that Mr Tan was on board, he had to break the news to Mr Tan's family. ""They were sobbing. His mother couldn't believe this had happened,"" he told the news agency. ""Her boy was only 29 years old."" He added that arrangements were being made by the airline to bring families to the crash site in Wuzhou. Pictures show distraught families waiting in a cordoned-off area at Guangzhou airport, being assisted by airline staff. One unverified clip circulating widely on Chinese social media shows a man slumped in his seat crying and lamenting the loss of his three children who were on the flight. This accident took place in China and involved a Chinese airline. As such, the investigation will be led by the country's civil aviation administration. But under international standards, the US will also be entitled to appoint an accredited representative because the Boeing 737 was designed and built in the US. The National Transportation Safety Board has already appointed a senior air safety investigator to fulfil this role. Representatives from Boeing itself, the engine maker CFM International and the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, will serve as technical advisers. The priority now will be to gather evidence from the crash site and search for the ""black boxes"", the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. If they can be found, and the data they contain is readable, then the immediate cause of the crash could become apparent quite quickly. But the investigation as a whole will take time. Flight MU5735 had been in the air for more than an hour and was nearing its destination when it suddenly plummeted from its cruising height. Chinese state TV outlets have broadcast footage which appears to show a jet in a near nosedive to the ground. The footage was captured by a car's dashcam. The BBC has not yet been able to verify the clip. Flight tracker data showed the Boeing 737-800 jet dropped thousands of metres in under three minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 model has a strong safety record, with thousands in service around the world. The aircraft that crashed was less than seven years old. Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes - including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision.

Donât expect much from Sunakâs Spring Statement,"The chancellor is under pressure to address the rising cost of living There is a very big question hanging over tomorrow's Spring Statement: just how much do the public expect the government to give a helping hand at a time of international emergency? The instinct of the chancellor, is that he can only do so much. In my travels from Ayrshire to Derbyshire over the past week, trying to take the temperature of the economy at the time of a seismic price shock, it's clear that the public expects more than it used to. Whether it was Milligan's coach company, unable to work out if it can price its trips at a profit because of rising diesel costs; or the farm owner in Ashover, unprotected by energy caps, facing ""open-ended"" price increases from heating oil. Over the period of the pandemic, the chancellor repeatedly rolled out ever expanding multi-billion pound economic rescues, with mainly borrowed money. But Rishi Sunak does not want expanded government spending to define his tenure at Number 11. How much would cutting fuel duty on petrol save you? What's the pension triple lock and why's it being suspended? Spring Statement: What to expect on fuel, pensions and benefits The statement that is coming on Wednesday was originally intended to be no more than an economic update, alongside the new forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Plans have changed since then to reflect the acute challenges for household budgets, but it would be wrong to see this as a mini-Budget. Perhaps not even a micro-Budget. There is still not enough for the traditional ""red book"" of measures. The big takeaway from the chancellor's words over the weekend was not about a significant rescue package, but that he can not protect the country from all the pressures arising out of the global wave of surging prices. The most important text ahead of the chancellor's statement, is hisMais lecture,externalfrom last month. He used it to push back against the idea that the size of the British state would be left bigger forever. This is an area of political judgement as well as economic strategy. The main area of household economic stress - domestic gas and electricity bills - will be dealt with at a later date. The official cost of the government package designed to lessen the burden of next month's record rise, will be revealed. But whether the further rise will be another few hundred pounds a year or over a thousands pounds a year for an average household can not yet be known with certainty. The original Â£9bn package helped mitigate less than half of the Â£21bn rise in energy prices until January, and that was mostly through loans. But the total value of price rises is on course to more than double to over Â£43bn. There is scope to cut back fuel duty on petrol and diesel by a few pence - however, pump prices will still feel like they are at a record, with an average diesel tank costing close to Â£100. The really stark fact in here is that amid these global pressures arising from the pandemic bounce-back and the invasion, the government is further squeezing households with significant new tax rises. It is remarkable this is all hitting at the same time. It is difficult to think that the government would have devised policy in this way, had the price surge occurred earlier. The effect of some of the national insurance rise on low and middle earners could be unpicked by a rise in the threshold over which it is paid. But, to be clear, these are slightly smaller rises in taxes, not tax cuts. The problem for the exchequer is that acknowledging the reality of 8% inflation rates for national insurance thresholds, points to doing the same for universal credit and for public sector pay. Indeed the Bank of England are now projecting that inflation could be at double digit levels at the end of the year. While some increase in the generosity of universal credit could come, public sector pay is being left to the pay review bodies. In April at least there will be immediate real terms pay cuts, as wages fail to match inflation. Some of this might be undone by the summer, but the government's position so far is that public sector should pay more attention to the 2% inflation target for setting interest rates, than actual rates of inflation. And all the while, the Treasury would rather be talking about long term plans to raise investment, productivity, growth, living standards and tax revenues. The current cost of living crisis threatens to turn into an emergency. And although this could be a new normal lasting years, don't expect a pandemic-style rescue, this time.

High debt payments add to Spring Statement pressure,"The chancellor has ""wiggle room"" to help tackle the rising cost of living, an influential economist has said. Sir Charlie Bean told the BBC that Rishi Sunak may have as much as Â£50bn ""to play with"", ahead of the Spring Statement on Wednesday. New official data also show that the government is borrowing less than expected so far this year. It comes as pressure mounts on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to take action to tackle soaring costs. Calls from charities and politicians have been growing for the chancellor to address the increasing pressure on household budgets at the Spring Statement on Wednesday, where he will deliver an update on how the economy is faring as well as some policy updates. But Mr Sunak has said the priority has to be shrinking the amount that the government has to borrow to make up the shortfall between what it borrows and what it earns in receipts. Where does the government borrow billions from? Donât expect much from Sunakâs Spring Statement How could Rishi Sunak's plans affect you? TheOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthat government borrowing in the financial year to February was Â£138.4bn. It marks the third-highest since records began in 1993, although it is still Â£21.2bn less than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Sir Charlie Bean, who was responsible for economic forecasts at the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility until December, told the BBC's Today programme that rising inflation and improved tax receipts would mean that the chancellor might have more ""wiggle room"" at Wednesday's spring statement. According to the new figures, the government collected Â£53.7bn in taxes this February, up by more than Â£4bn in comparison with last year. He suggested that could mean that Mr Sunak could even have between Â£25 and Â£50bn ""to play with"", depending on how the independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks the cost of living will change over the next few years. The amount the government borrows to make up the difference between what it spends and what it collects is known as ""public sector net borrowing"". It will borrow because it spends more than it gets in income, which mainly comes in from taxes like VAT or income tax. It does this by selling bonds - a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates - essentially an interest-paying ""IOU"". Find out more about government borrowing and how it works here. Surging food prices, energy bills and fuel prices have pushed costs up for households, but rising inflation also means the government is paying more in interest payments on its debt. Rising inflation led to government interest payments hitting a fresh record in February, the ONS figures also show. Interest payments reached Â£8.2bn last month, the highest amount for a February since records for them began in April 1997 and up Â£1bn on last year. The payments are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - which reached 7.8% in January. The government has borrowed billions of pounds to spend on measures designed to limit the impact of the Covid pandemic, such as the furlough scheme, over the last couple of years. New data showed that public sector debt, excluding public sector banks, remains at a level not seen since the early 1960s. In response to the figures, Mr Sunak said: ""The ongoing uncertainty caused by global shocks means it's more important than ever to take a responsible approach to the public finances. ""With inflation and interest rates still on the rise, it's crucial that we don't allow debt to spiral and burden future generations with further debt."" James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said: ""The chancellor will approach the UK's latest crisis - the tightest income squeeze in generations, exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine - with the public finances in better shape than expected."" In February, the UK government borrowed about Â£5bn more than expected, with those higher debt interest costs off-setting the boost in tax income. Nevertheless, Mr Smith called on the chancellor to increase tax revenues to provide emergency income support to families through the cost of living crisis. Charities such as Resolution Foundation and Save the Children UK have urged the chancellor to consider measures such as increasing benefit payments by at least 7% to try to match the rate at which prices are rising, as well as expanding eligibility for theWarm Home Discountfor energy bills. But Hoa Duong, an economist at consultancy firm PwC, suggested the growing pressures caused by the conflict in Ukraine and easing household living costs could exacerbate the deficit - the amount by which the government's income falls short of what it spends. ""In the Spring Statement we expect the chancellor to continue his cautious approach and prioritise balancing the books. Therefore any financial support, including reducing pressure on households' cost of living, is likely to be limited,"" she said.

How satellite image access changes our view of war,"Satellites can be used to pick out images of individual vehicles and even road markings Kyle Glen, a project manager in Wales in the UK, has an unusual hobby - tracking Russian troop movements. Mr Glen is co-founder of Conflict News, an account on social media platform, Twitter, with more than 400,000 followers. It collates and shares publicly-available photos and videos of conflict, gathered from a variety of online sources. Since early last year, he and others among what's known as the ""open source intelligence community"" have been closely watching Russian military activity in and around Ukraine. He bought and shared from the account satellite images from online service SkyWatch, which reportedly showed the massing of vehicles along the Russia-Ukraine border over many months - and then, the moment when the invasion began. ""We watched it go from nothing, to quite significant build-up and then it was empty again the day before the invasion,"" he recalls, referring to images from one apparent camp on the border. ""I don't get any money from this at all,"" says Mr Glen. ""It's completely a hobby, voluntary, whatever you want to call it."" Media coverage of the war in Ukraine, which started almost a month ago, has included, arguably to an unprecedented extent, content shared via social media. This has includedsatellite photos that documenttroop movements and shocking damage to cities. BBC News: Tips on how to spot Ukraine fakes In recent days, pictures snapped by satellites in orbit have captured images which appear to show destroyed Russian helicopters, extensive damage to a shopping centre and residential districts in Mariupol, and a civilian tanker vessel on fire in the Black Sea. Maxar satellite images appear to show a long Russian convoy of military vehicles approaching Kyiv, Ukraine's capital Privately-owned companies that launch and operate their own satellites - such as Planet and Maxar - have distributed many satellite images of the conflict zone. The proliferation of these images means members of the public and military analysts alike can try to gauge the situation on the ground in Ukraine and the progress of Russia's invading armed forces from thousands of miles away. Mr Glen says that while satellite imagery has been available online during previous conflicts,including the war in Syria, the volume of this material was ""a drop in the bucket"", compared to what has come out of Ukraine in little more than a fortnight. So, what's changed? While government and intelligence agency satellites gather classified, secret information, commercial firms have long been able to sell their own, unclassified, imagery. And now, this material is being made easily accessible online. A variety of businesses and other organisations rely on satellite images to track everything from wildfires to crops and the movement of ships. This means there has been a big rise in the number of commercial satellites in orbit which has significantly increased data sharing possibilities says Chris Quilty, partner at Quilty Analytics. ""There are more eyes in the sky,"" as he puts it. There has been a big rise in satellite launches over the last 20 years Members of the public can purchase high-quality pictures gathered by satellite for as little as $10 (Â£7.60) per sq km. The resolution of these images is sometimes very high, capturing tiny details measuring down to 30cm by 30cm at ground level. This granularity makes it possible to identify vehicles and road markings. Operators can also program satellites to monitor specific locations multiple times every 24 hours, picking up even small changes almost as soon as they happen. As the technology has advanced, the public's willingness to engage with satellite images has really taken off, Mr Quilty adds: ""The fundamental capability hasn't changed dramatically, it's the willingness and manner in which users are ingesting and using the data that has changed."" This even extends to sophisticated, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which is often more difficult to interpret than a picture taken with an optical lens. Satellites can even capture SAR images through cloud cover. The resulting black-and-white pictures might show vehicles, including tanks, for instance, as rows of bright dots. Mr Glen says these types of image have helped him, and people like him, to track the beginning of the Ukraine invasion. Rita Konaev says widespread access to satellite images has helped combat disinformation about the Ukraine conflict. Rita Konaev, associate director of analysis at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, says satellite imagery ""has been an aspect of modern conflict for 10 to 15 years now, but the scale [this time] is different and the accessibility is different,"" she adds, suggesting satellite imagery has helped to challenge disinformation about the invasion. ""The architecture of European cities like Kyiv is very familiar in the Western world,"" adds Dr Konaev. This familiarity, she suggests, may have influenced the response in the West to the invasion - in contrast with wars in the Middle East and further afield. Mr Glen says followers of Conflict News and similar social media accounts, can verify satellite imagery by checking online sources themselves. ""You can present the evidence to a wider audience in as unbiased a way as possible and let people to come to their own conclusions,"" he says.

How Covid exposed India's 'crumbling' health sector The shipping giant banking on a greener fuel However, he also acknowledges that he and others like him in the so-called ""open source intelligence community"" make judgements about what to share and when. For example, he identifies more closely with the Ukrainians than the Russians in this conflict, he says, and therefore would not intentionally publish any information about Ukrainian military movements, to avoid accidentally compromising their safety. Some private companies are also sharing sophisticated images captured from orbit - in near real-time - directly with the Ukrainian military. Canadian firmMDA is one such example,external. Dr Konaev argues that satellite images offer a unique overview - literally - of events unfolding thousands of miles away, unlike any other media, which may she says explain some of the heightened interest in these pictures. A tank driver flies the Ukraine flag ""In some ways, I think the imagery from a distance, gives even more of a perspective of the scale of the destruction and the devastation,"" she adds. ""It's more than just people's individual lives, it's [whole] communities."" But there could be some significant consequences of making such detailed imagery so widely available. Although militaries have vast intelligence resources that they rely on beyond social media, there is no knowing how satellite images of troop movements shared on Twitter, or Facebook, could influence operational decisions on the ground. ""There are real, potential life or death consequences,"" says Dr Konaev. Mr Glen has thought about this possibility but will likely never know whether an image he shares ultimately leads to a fatal attack or confrontation on a frontline. ""I wouldn't say it makes me hesitate, as such, but it's something I'm aware is a possibility,"" he says. ""And I've come to terms with it.""

Pictures show distraught families waiting in a cordoned-off area at Guangzhou airport, being assisted by airline staff. One unverified clip circulating widely on Chinese social media shows a man slumped in his seat crying and lamenting the loss of his three children who were on the flight. This accident took place in China and involved a Chinese airline. As such, the investigation will be led by the country's civil aviation administration. But under international standards, the US will also be entitled to appoint an accredited representative because the Boeing 737 was designed and built in the US. The National Transportation Safety Board has already appointed a senior air safety investigator to fulfil this role. Representatives from Boeing itself, the engine maker CFM International and the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, will serve as technical advisers. The priority now will be to gather evidence from the crash site and search for the ""black boxes"", the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. If they can be found, and the data they contain is readable, then the immediate cause of the crash could become apparent quite quickly. But the investigation as a whole will take time. Flight MU5735 had been in the air for more than an hour and was nearing its destination when it suddenly plummeted from its cruising height. Chinese state TV outlets have broadcast footage which appears to show a jet in a near nosedive to the ground. The footage was captured by a car's dashcam. The BBC has not yet been able to verify the clip. Flight tracker data showed the Boeing 737-800 jet dropped thousands of metres in under three minutes. According to FlightRadar24, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft (about 9,000m), but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft. Aviation experts say the Boeing 737-800 model has a strong safety record, with thousands in service around the world. The aircraft that crashed was less than seven years old. Investigators are expected to look at several possible causes - including deliberate action, pilot error, or technical issues such as a structural failure or mid-air collision.

Fewer stomach bugs recorded in UK's Covid lockdown,"The UK's Covid lockdown appears to have had a massive impact on stomach bugs, slashing outbreaks by more than half in England during the first six months of the pandemic. Far fewer people suffered vomiting and diarrhoea than usual, data show. People staying at home, mixing less and washing their hands will have had an impact, say public health experts in a new article published by BMJ Open. This perk may continue if we all carry on being more germ-aware, they say. Routine surveillance in England shows the number of outbreaks caused by the winter vomiting bug norovirus hasincreased in recent weeks,,externalalthough they are still below the five-year-average or usual level for this time of year. Norovirus is easily transmitted through contact with people who have it, or contaminated surfaces. Prof Saheer Gharbia, from the UK Health Security Agency and one of the authors of the BMJ study, said: ""Norovirus, commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, has been at lower levels than normal throughout the pandemic but, as people have begun to mix more, the numbers of outbreaks have started to increase again."" Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea. Although it can be very unpleasant, it usually goes away in a couple of days. The advice is to stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do not return to work or send children to school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. Prof Gharbia said: ""Please avoid visiting elderly relatives if you are unwell - particularly if they are in a care home or hospital. ""As with Covid and other infectious illnesses, handwashing is really important to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, unlike for Covid, alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus, so soap and water is best."" For their study, Prof Gharbia and colleagues looked at information on outbreaks, laboratory notifications, calls to the NHS 111 health advice service, GP appointments, and attendance at emergency care for gastrointestinal infections during the first half of 2020 in England. That included illness from bacteria like salmonella and listeria, as well as the winter vomiting virus. Just over 1,500 suspected and lab-confirmed gastrointestinal infection outbreaks were reported in England, representing a 52% fall on the five-year average for the period. Google Trends data showed internet searches for key phrases, such as ""food poisoning"", ""gastroenteritis"" and ""sickness bug"" plunged, while ones for ""handwashing"" and ""disinfection"" rose substantially during the UK's first Covid wave. Each year in England there are typically more than 17 million cases of gastrointestinal infections, resulting in more than one million calls or visits for medical advice or care. To help reduce the spread: Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water If you do become ill, stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated Wash any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash Do not share towels and flannels Ensure toilets and the surrounding areas are cleaned thoroughly Avoid eating raw, unwashed food produce Prof Martin Marshall, from the Royal College of GPs, said: ""This study makes clear that as we've seen with other contagious diseases, such as colds and flu, prevalence of gastro-intestinal infection was lower during the pandemic. This is likely to be in a large part due to restrictions that were implemented to stop the spread of Covid, and greater adherence to public health measures. ""As we move to the next stages of the pandemic, severe restrictions have been, and continue to be, lifted to allow a more normal way of life, but practising good hygiene measures is something that can and should continue, and really can help people keep well.""

Family 'relief' as Nazanin returns,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, husband Richard and daughter Gabriella shared a hug after she landed at RAF Brize Norton A relative of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says news of her return to the UK is ""absolutely mind-blowing"" after six years of being detained in Iran. The 43-year-old and another detainee, Anoosheh Ashoori, weremet at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours. Alex Loftus, cousin of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, said she did not think it had ""sunk in properly yet"". Mrs Loftus, from Warwickshire, added it had been ""so moving"" seeing the images of her being reunited with family. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori, 67, left Tehran on Wednesday after their release was secured following months of negotiations. Alex Loftus said she was ""absolutely over the moon"" after years of campaigning over Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release It marked the end of an ordeal that saw the British-Iranian national detained, after being accused in 2016 of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. She was sentenced to a further year in prison in April last year and a one-year travel ban on charges of propaganda against the government. Both Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori have consistently and vigorously denied allegations. Their release came after the UK settled a debt to Iran of almost Â£400m dating from the 1970s. Mrs Loftus, who lives near Southam, said a couple of years ago Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""made the very brave decision of sending"" her now seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella, back home. The girl rushed to hug her mother after she touched down at Brize Norton. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released after the UK settled a near Â£400m debt to Iran Mrs Loftus added: ""She could then start having a normal sort of, well the British life that she was meant to have in the first place and go to school, be with her dad. ""Thankfully we now have Skype... [but] things like... giving Gabriella a kiss goodnight, walking her to school, things like that... she just missed out on."" The cousin said 3.7 million people had signed a Change.org petition and that there had been regular family meetings. ""We've been there so many times, that there's been hope,"" she said. ""I don't think any us were ever going to believe it until actually Naz was on that plane out of Iranian airspace. ""We'll have our time to see them, but at the moment it just needs to be the three of them."" Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Ukraine: Hard choices for surrogate mothers and parents,"A nurse with a baby in Kyiv's underground nursery On the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Svetlana found it hard to believe that what she was watching on the news was really happening. Things were calm in her home town, Bila Tserkva, a historic city on a winding river 80km (50 miles) south of Kyiv. Then the explosions began. Svetlana and her husband dragged their mattresses into the corridor of their apartment building and huddled there with their three children. The noise of the sirens was constant and they didn't sleep for days. Thousands of miles away in Australia, Emma Micallif was frantically messaging. The two women are intimately connected because Svetlana is pregnant with Emma's second child. As rockets fell on Bila Tserkva Emma felt angry and helpless. For six months the two mums had chatted back and forth using a translation app. They shared pictures of their children, discussed the things they liked to bake with their kids or moaned about the stress of pandemic home-schooling. Now they were trying to co-ordinate an evacuation. ""I thought having cancer was stressful or having a baby while having treatment was stressful or having round after round of IVF and it not working was stressful,"" Emma says. ""But it just does not compare."" With the help of the surrogacy agency, Emma got in touch with two other parents who had surrogates in Ukraine. They found a bus that would take the three women and their 10 children on an 18-hour trip to the Moldovan border. When they finally got to the Moldovan capital they were crammed into a small apartment. Emma was horrified when she heard that there weren't enough beds. ""Our lovely, pregnant Svetlana was sleeping on the floor,"" she says. But Svetlana was too devastated to care. She had left her husband behind in Ukraine and her mother had fled to Germany. When her mother calls she just cries down the phone. ""It hurts so much that this war is tearing families apart,"" she told me. ""I feel safe in Moldova but my heart is in Ukraine."" More than 2,000 children are born through surrogacy every year in Ukraine, the majority to foreign couples. The country has around 50 reproductive clinics and many agencies and middle-men who match couples - known as ""intended parents"" - to surrogates. Ukraine is a popular choice because of the way its laws on surrogacy are written. In many European countries, including the UK, when a surrogate gives birth she is listed as the mother on the birth certificate. If she is married, her husband will be listed as the father. In Ukraine the intended parents are listed as mother and father. That means getting the baby a passport and bringing them home is much simpler. The agency that Emma and Svetlana are using is small - it is currently managing nine surrogacies - but Ukraine's biggest agency currently has 500 surrogates at different stages of pregnancy. This video can not be played Watch: Surrogate babies waiting for parents in a bomb shelter in Kyiv, Ukraine Forty-one babies in its care are stranded in Kyiv, because their intended parents, from all over the world, have been prevented from collecting them by the war. Many of these children are being cared for in a basement nursery in Kyiv as Russian forces sit outside the city and shell it. Every day more children are born, but since the invasion only nine sets of parents have risked the journey to Kyiv to pick up their babies. Another five have arranged remote pick-ups. ""If nothing changes in the near future, we may have 100 babies under our care,"" says Denys Herman, the agency's legal adviser. The company has been grappling with whether to move the babies out of Kyiv to a safer location in western Ukraine, but transporting them in a war zone also carries risks. It's not just Denys Herman who has a problem with stranded babies. Nastya was saving up to buy a house in Kharkiv, where she lives with her two young boys, and coming to the end of her second surrogate pregnancy. When the war broke out she was only weeks from her due date and went into labour to give birth to twins a few days later. A Ukrainian territorial defence soldier examines a burnt-out Russian military vehicle in Kharkiv ""We spent the entire time in the hospital in a bomb shelter,"" she says. Kharkiv was under heavy bombardment and the hospital's basement was packed from wall to wall with mattresses and baby cribs. She camped out in a storage room with her two children, sleeping on sofa cushions on the floor, underneath shelves piled high with files and paperwork. ""But the doctors were wonderful, I am very grateful to them,"" she says. She gave birth to two healthy boys. A week later she left the hospital. Kharkiv was still under attack and the foreign parents couldn't get there to collect the twins. So, together with some staff from her agency, Nastya, her two sons and the new-born twins travelled across Ukraine. She cared for the babies while delivering them to their parents at the border. That was more than a week ago, and she hasn't heard from them since. When Emma envisages the family she wants, she thinks of the drive from her home in Canberra to her parent's place in Sydney. She imagines looking into the back seat and seeing a gaggle of children. Instead, she has one. ""It just feels like a hole in my life,"" she says. Five years ago while she was pregnant with her son, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. The tumour was growing at an alarming rate, helped along by the hormones she produced in pregnancy. It was a rare medical event and when her son was born doctors crowded into the delivery room to observe. ""He came out perfect, he didn't have to go into the neonatal ICU, so I felt very lucky,"" she says. When her son was only five weeks old, she started intense radiation and chemotherapy which damaged her reproductive organs. ""I went into early menopause at 29. So that was delightful,"" she says wryly. In the five years since her cancer diagnosis, Emma's every waking moment has been consumed by thoughts of how to conceive her second child. She and her husband went through 13 cycles of IVF which were traumatic and expensive, but none of the embryos would ultimately take. ""Surrogacy is never anyone's first pick but it comes as a result of a deep loss beforehand,"" she says. Emma and her husband, Alex, struggled to find a surrogate in Australia where only altruistic surrogacy is allowed. When they first heard about the option of Ukraine they were hesitant but they were reassured by other Australians who'd had a good experience. With their first surrogate, two attempts at pregnancy didn't take, causing further heartbreak. When they were matched with Svetlana and she got pregnant right away it felt like the battle was finally over. ""It was such a relief that we could stop fighting. We'd been in a state of fight or flight, as husband and wife, for so long."" Emma Micallif, Alex and their son Before the war, the whole family had planned to travel to Ukraine. Emma had hoped to spend time with Svetlana so that she could tell her new child about her birth mother. With the baby due in a month that's unlikely to happen now. But for some intended parents the war is making the relationship with their surrogates even closer. Christine (not her real name) woke up on the day of the invasion and felt sick. Her surrogate was in Zaporizhzhia, in the south-east of Ukraine, which would make headlines a few days later when its nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, was attacked by Russian forces. Her surrogate, Tatiana (also not her real name) left for Poland that day with her six-year-old son. Christine marvels at her strength. When she asked Tatiana if she was interested in coming to England Christine wasn't sure how she would react. But she was delighted. ""We can come next week,"" she said. She is one of only four or five women applying for a bespoke visa created by the Home Office for surrogate mothers. ""The past few days have been unbearably traumatic in what's already been a traumatic year,"" Christine says. Last January she and her husband lost a child, a daughter who was born prematurely and died at five weeks old. At one point during the delivery her husband was told he might have to choose between Christine and the baby. She was advised not to try again but she did and miscarried again. ""Because I was impatient and grieving and wanting it now, we looked abroad."" They found out Tatiana was pregnant in January this year. ""It was kind of too good to be true,"" she says. On Sunday Christine flew to Poland to meet Tatiana for the first time. Both were nervous, but relaxed when a Polish doctor said the results of the first scan were good. Now they are working hard to get to know each other, using Google translate. ""Yesterday, we had a discussion about our spiritual beliefs, whether we believe in clairvoyance and all those things. It's not just all about pregnancy,"" she says. The visa will last three years and Christine and her husband have invited Tatiana to stay with them for as long as she wants to, beyond the birth of their child. In Mariupol, children bear the brunt of Putin's war Pregnant woman and baby die after hospital shelled 'We try to tell them the truth' - parenting in wartime Surrogacy is legal in the UK, but under English law the surrogate's name will be on the birth certificate, along with Christine's husband's. Legal parenthood will then have to be transferred from Tatiana to Christine. If the baby is born in a third country there are even more legal complications. And that's left Svetlana, Emma and Alex with a dilemma. Surrogacy is not permitted in Moldova. If the baby is born there, Svetlana will be its legal guardian. She could place it for adoption but then it could be years before Emma and Alex are allowed to take their child home. So together they have come up with a plan for Svetlana to deliver the baby in a city close to the border. Svetlana has mixed feelings about going back to Ukraine. ""There's shooting everywhere, homes are being reduced to rubble and the Russians are shelling maternity hospitals, kindergartens and schools,"" she says. On the other hand, she is desperate to see her husband, who can't leave the country under the terms of Ukraine's martial law. A mother waits to give birth in a hospital basement in Mykolaiv For Emma, the idea of Svetlana returning to a war zone is hard to take. ""If you'd asked me a year ago, I'd say 'No, I wouldn't do that.' Because it's just not what we should be doing. It's not what should be happening,"" she says. One possible snag is that it could take weeks for the baby's birth certificate to be issued. If that happens Emma and Alex are not sure what they will do. The war has left thousands of surrogates and intended parents in equally terrible positions. Cyrille, who is French, struggled to get in touch with his surrogate in Kharkiv for two weeks after the invasion. When eventually he did, he helped her to come to Paris where he hopes she will stay until she gives birth in August. But she has left her children in western Ukraine with their father, who didn't want them to leave. Natasha, a surrogate in Cherkasy is 10 weeks pregnant with the baby of a couple in the US. She is tormented by sirens, shelling and morning sickness. ""This is not life, it's a nightmare,"" she says. Just a few days before the war, I spoke to another surrogate who is pregnant with a baby girl for a couple in Spain. Maryna lived close to Svetlana in the town of Uzyn. When we spoke she was getting ready to move to Kyiv for the last two months of her pregnancy. ""Kyiv is always going to be a safe place because it's so far from the Donbas,"" she said. Even after Russia invaded she struggled to imagine how bad things could get. ""I really hope that a brain will appear in Putin's head and he will start to withdraw his troops. Because Ukrainian and Russian mothers didn't give birth to children so that they would fight."" Just after Svetlana arrived safely in Moldova, Emma felt a moment of bittersweet relief. ""She sent me a photo of her youngest daughter with a soft-serve ice cream from McDonalds and a balloon and the biggest smile on her face. And I just completely broke down,"" Emma says. It reminded her of what every child should be doing, enjoying her life safely, with her family.

UK government mulls move to take over Gazprom unitThe BBC understands the UK division of Russian gas giant Gazprom could be placed into administration.Business,"Many English councils have already said they intend to end their deals with the Russian energy giant The UK arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom could be placed into administration in the coming days, the BBC understands. Bloomberg,externalreported the government is preparing to step in and temporarily run Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail Ltd, which supplies thousands of organisations across the UK. Its clients include McDonald's, Siemens, hospitals and councils. It is understood the government is looking at all options and monitoring the situation closely. One possibility could be to put the company into special administration, where it is temporarily run on behalf of the government. Last November, the UK energy companyBulb was placed into special administration, with Â£1.7bn in government funds set aside to keep it trading. The company's UK retail operation does not sell gas from its parent company in Russia, but a number of companies and councils are thought to be trying to end their contracts with the company in protest at Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Gazprom itself has also been sanctioned by the UK government. English councils seek exit from Gazprom deals Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Shell to sell Russian investments due to Ukraine conflict Earlier this month, a number of councils in England told the BBC they were looking to end their Gazprom contracts as soon as possible. According to the public services data firm Tussell, UK public sector contracts amounted to Â£107m in total between 2016 and 2021. Health Secretary Sajid Javid also urged NHS trusts to stop using energy supplied by Gazprom. A government spokesperson would not be drawn on its plans for Gazprom's UK unit but said the UK ""was in no way"" dependent on Russian gas. ""Our highly diverse sources of gas supply and a diverse electricity mix ensures that households, businesses, and heavy industry get the energy they need,"" they said. ""We are aware that Gazprom Energy has a large presence in the non-domestic energy retail market. ""Gazprom's retail business continues to trade in the UK and customers should exercise their own commercial judgement with regards to energy supply contracts they have in place at the moment."" Gazprom has been approached for comment. A spokesperson for McDonald's said it was trying to exit its deal ""at the earliest opportunity"" while Siemens UK said it was looking at the terms of cancelling supply contracts with Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail. ""We support the severe and broad sanctions applied by western governments and are ensuring that we act in compliance with them,"" it said. How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

Russia's alleged use of its hypersonic missile is probably intended to ""detract from a lack of progress"" in its ground campaign, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in a tweet. Over the last several days, Russia has claimed to have fired hypersonic missiles - for the first time ever in combat - at targets in western Ukraine. Russian officials claim the missile - known as the Kinzhal - can hit targets up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away at speeds over 6,000 km/h. The UK's MoD, however, assesses the missiles are unlikely to ""materially affect the outcome"" of Russia's campaign in Ukraine. Read more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

cyber-attacks from Russia. In a statement, President Biden said his administration was reiterating
previous warnings ""based on evolving intelligence that the Russian
Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks"". The White House said it was a ""critical"" moment to boost defences. This is the latest in a series of warnings about possible fall-out in
cyberspace from the conflict. In particular, there have been concerns that Russia might retaliate for
sanctions by hitting back at the US and Western economies through cyber-attacks. So far these attacks have not materialised. But this latest warning does suggest US intelligence has seen some
indications of Russian activity on computer networks that could be the prelude
for some kind of attack â however, they acknowledge that this does not mean that
such an attack will definitely take place. The public warning may be designed to act as a deterrent. US and UK cyber officials have both been briefing executives of major
organisations over a period of months, especially those within critical
infrastructure, to warn them of the risks and encourage them to ensure they
have the best possible defences in place. The UK branch of Russian gas giant Gazprom could be placed under
administration soon, according to reports. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the UK's government is preparing to
step in and run Gazprom Marketing & Trading Retail Ltd. The firm's clients include McDonald's and Siemens, as well as councils
and hospitals around the country. It does not, however, sell gas from its
parent company in Russia. The BBC understands that the UK government is looking at a number of
options and monitoring the situation closely. The government, however, has not commented on the possible
administration procedure, with a spokesperson noting only that the UK us in
""no way"" dependent on Russian gas. Earlier in March, several councils in England told the BBC they were
seeking to end their contracts with Gazprom. Both McDonald's and Siemens have
also said they were looking at trying to exit deals or cancelling supply
contracts. Gazprom has yet to comment. Read more here Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The most bombarded city in Ukraineâs war with Russia is key to Moscowâs military campaign. But why? Securing a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas:Mariupol stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula. They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Strangling Ukraine's economy:In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond. Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Propaganda opportunity:Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, which contains far-right extremists including neo-Nazis. Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has given Moscow a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis. Major morale boost:A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow.

visited today in Dnipro will stay here in central Ukraine, perhaps hoping one
day to return to Mariupol. But with much of the city destroyed and as many as 40% of those damaged
structures said to be irreparable, returning any time soon will not be an
option for many. Among those is Olga, who we met while she was picking up food, some
clothes, and bedding. For the time being her immediate family is staying in a
small flat here in the city after a harrowing journey out of Mariupol. ""We were driving out under fire,"" Olga tells me. ""Shells
were exploding. They were bombing us and there were dead bodies everywhere, but
we managed to join the larger convoy and eventually get out."" Olga says sheâd like to return to the broken city she calls home,
especially as she has extended family members still trapped there, unable to
escape. But, Olga told me, she received an ominous warning from a Russian
soldier at one of the last checkpoints out of Mariupol. ""Donât bother
staying in Dnipro,"" the soldier said to her, ""because we'll soon be
attacking that city as well."" This video can not be played Footage has emerged of Russian forces using gunfire to disperse demonstrators in the occupied southern city of Kherson. The footage - which was shared on social media and verified by the BBC - also shows explosions, which were reported to be from stun grenades. Demonstrators were reportedly injured during the incident. Protests have taken place in the city of Kherson since the city fell to Russian forces on 3 March. Read more about the protestshere. We told you earlier about the bombastic warning Russia issued that its relations with the US were near breaking point. It comes days after President Joe Biden called his Russian counterpart ""a war criminal"". Since Biden made the statement on 16 March, the label has been heard more often in connection with Vladimir Putin. Former UK prime ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major have called for the creation of a new international tribunal to investigate Putin and those who helped plan his invasion of Ukraine. And the Pentagon has indicated the US is actively engaged in the investigation of the Russian leader. ""We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are
committing war crimes and we are helping with the collecting of
evidence of that,"" spokesman John Kirby told a news
briefing. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is spearheading the legal process - after 39 nations called for an inquiry to be opened. Read more about war crimes and whether Putin may be prosecuted Hundreds were sheltering at the Mariupol theatre when missiles destroyed it S-300 anti-aircraft weapons on parade in Kyiv last year Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby says the US is in ""ongoing discussions"" with other countries to provide long-range air defence systems to Ukraine. To date, the US has provided Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. These systems, however, are primarily effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, rather than higher altitude combat aircraft. It has been reported a number of countries - including Slovakia - have expressed a willingness to give Ukraine S-300 anti-aircraft systems, provided they receive something to replace them. Ukraine already uses the S-300 and has personnel trained in its use. While Kirby does not comment directly on Slovakia or the S-300, he says the US is in ""active consultations"" about âthe
kinds of defence capabilities to include long-range air defences, that we know
that theyâre [Ukraine] comfortable using."" Wyre DaviesBBC News, Dnipro Children playing at a makeshift refugee reception centre in Dnipro At what is usually a middle school in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, a makeshift reception centre for refuges of fighting from the east has been set up. Many of the people queueing patiently in the schoolyard are from the besieged city of Mariupol â others have come here from Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. They all have another thing in common â theyâre without possessions. Families crammed into cars, they fled through mined roads and numerous Russian checkpoints to safety and need all the basics to survive; food, clothes, and medicine. All of the things being collected here are donations from residents of Dnipro and local charities. So, while children get hand-me-down toys, their mothers line up for the basics. In the school canteen, volunteers package together food parcels that will feed a family for a couple of days. Among those working here is Vadym, normally a teacher at the school but
now doing his ""civic duty to help other Ukrainians"". The UN says there
are six and a half million displaced people inside Ukraine alone. This city and
this community are doing their part to make that transition less traumatic. Women putting together food parcels for refugees If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's a short summary of
what's been happening in the war in Ukraine: Russia's foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador John Sullivan in to protest about recent statements by President Biden, who labelled President Putin a ""war criminal"" over the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement, the ministry said the comments were unworthy of a statesman of such a high rank and pushed Russian-American relations to breaking point. Hostile actions taken against Russia would receive a ""decisive and firm response,"" it warned. The State Department confirmed that the meeting between Sullivan and Russian officials took place, adding that Sullivan demanded that US citizens in custody be given access to consular services. The department says that one US citizen, basketball player Brittany Griner, has still not been given access to consular services after being detained for possession of vape cartridges last month. Speaking to reporters on Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said it is ""awfully rich"" for Russia to ""speak about 'inappropriate comments' when that same country is engaged in mass slaughter"". Jessica ParkerBBC News, Brussels The EUâs foreign affairs chief has suggested there wonât be a further package of EU sanctions against Russia adopted this week. Josep Borrell was speaking at a press conference, following meetings of the blocâs foreign and defence ministers in Brussels. âFormal adoption of sanctions requires procedure and I donât think during this week it will be formal adoption of sanctions, according with our procedures.â But he said when EU leaders meet later this week, for a summit in Brussels, theyâll likely consider âwhat else can be done"". He said the issue of energy had been raised by some ministers - but today wasnât a day for such decisions, rather one for âanalysingâ possible future actions. Borrell said there needs to be an âeffective response which wonât lead to an unbearable cost for member states"". Five cases of Russian forces detaining local officials have been recorded in the northern city of Chernihiv, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency is reporting. Quoting the Ukrainian parliament website, it says Russian forces have detained the heads of two villages and a local councillor, while two local government officials have also been abducted. Meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine, Russians have abducted the head of a village in Kharkiv, according to UNIAN news agency. The Russian newspaper KP said the lines appeared as a result of a hack We reported earlier that our colleagues at BBC Russian had compiled a list of 557 confirmed Russian military deaths in the Ukraine invasion, mentioning that Russia's defence ministry has so far only once provided fatality figures - 498 deaths as of 2 March. All that suddenly changed in the last few hours, or so it seemed... The staunchly pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP) published an article quoting the ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen had died, a figure which exceeds even US intelligence estimates of Russian fatalities. It gave the number of wounded as 16,153. Minutes later, this part of the article disappeared from the page, but we were able to take screen grabs of the relevant paragraphs. KP editor Vladimir Sungorkin subsequently told the BBC the information had been the result of a hack, and said the paper will post an explanation later.  Joe Biden at the White House on Sunday US President Joe Biden has held a phone call with European leaders to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, the White House has announced. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on the call, as was Italian PM Mario Draghi, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron. In a statement, the White House said that the leaders ""discussed their serious concerns about Russiaâs
brutal tactics in Ukraine, including its attacks on civilians"". ""They underscored
their continued support for Ukraine, including by providing
security assistance to the brave Ukrainians who are defending their country
from Russian aggression, and humanitarian assistance to the millions of
Ukrainians who have fled the violence,"" the statement added. Biden is scheduled to travel to Europe later this week for meetings with Nato, EU, and G7 allies in Brussels, followed by a bilateral meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Friday. Pavel has been taking pictures in bomb shelters Pavel Gomzyakov usually photographs the happiest days of peopleâs lives. He is an award-winning wedding photographer from Mariupol, southern Ukraine. But, recently, he has been documenting life in the city as it has come under heavy Russian attack. âBefore the start of the war, Mariupol was a peaceful Ukrainian city, a city in which 95% of people were Russian speaking, like me. My daughter used to study at a Russian school,â he tells BBC Panorama. At the end of last week, he escaped, along with his wife and nine-year-old son. His elderly parents stayed behind and he hasnât been able to contact them for days, as electricity has been cut. He is now trying work out how he can unite with his eldest daughter, 17, who is alone in Germany. She was in the north-eastern Ukrainian city Kharkiv at ballet school when the war started. Pavel says it is if they have all woken up to a new, terrible reality. More on PanoramaUkraine's Resistance: Standing Up to Putinon BBC One at 20:00 GMT A satellite photo shows the disputed Kuril islands (Hokkaido is bottom left) Russia says it is abandoning talks with Japan aimed at signing a formal peace treaty, because Japan has joined in sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. They did not formally end World War Two hostilities because of a dispute over small islands known in Russia as the Southern Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories. They lie just off Japan's northern island of Hokkaido and were occupied by Soviet forces in 1945. Russia's foreign ministry says its move freezes discussions on joint economic projects for the islands and halts visa-free visits to them by Japanese citizens. ""All responsibility for the harm to bilateral co-operation and to the interests of Japan itself lies with official Tokyo, which deliberately chose to pursue an anti-Russian course,"" the ministry said. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak has told the BBC his country's resilience has made Russia ""more adequately assess the reality"" of how its invasion is progressing - leading, he says, to a change in the talks between the two countries. Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, several rounds of negotiations have taken place between delegates from Kyiv and Moscow but it's been hard to gauge the progress so far.

Please follow ushere for all the latest from the Ukraine war. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce on Thursday that the UK will provide Ukraine with about 6,000 extra missiles. At the Nato and G7 leaders' meetings in Brussels, Johnson will also unveil Â£25m ($33m) of funding to help pay Ukrainian soldiers and pilots. The UK government will also provide Â£4.1m for the BBC World Service to help support its Ukrainian and Russian language services in the region. ""The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight,"" Johnson said. ""One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world."" Britain said the new package will come on top of around 4,000 missiles already provided by the UK to Ukrainian forces. The latest funding is in addition to Â£400m already committed in humanitarian and economic aid, said UK officials.  Boris Johnson vowed ""to keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine"" Nada TawfikBBC News, New York Itâs getting harder and harder for Russia to deny its isolation on the international stage. Besides its ally, China, all 13 members abstained from voting on Moscowâs draft. The common message from most members was if Russia cared, and wanted to relieve the suffering of the Ukrainian people, it could end its war now. Instead, Russiaâs draft does not even recognise it is the sole cause of the humanitarian disaster or respond to the realities on the ground. Ukraine has its own humanitarian resolution set for a vote in the General Assembly, where Russia cannot wield its veto. Still, Moscow doesnât show any sign of changing course. It denounced the latest General Assembly vote as another anti-Russian show and blamed the humanitarian devastation on Ukrainian ""nationalists and radicals"". As British diplomat Barbara Woodward told me after the vote: ""I think Russia has consistently misplayed its hand here, and seriously underestimated the consequences of what it's done and the international perception of what it's done. ""They tabled this resolution over a week ago and they kept it on the table and rolled it forward. And, we saw the result today. Only one country supported Russia."" Ukraine's forces are ""increasing pressure"" on Russian troops occupying the region north-east of Kyiv, according to the latest intelligence assessment from the UK Ministry of Defence. Ukraine is continuing to carry out ""successful counter attacks"" on Russians outside the capital, the report says, and the Ukrainians have probably retaken the towns of Makariv and Moschun. ""There is a realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are now able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin,"" assesses the MoD. British military officials note that Russian troops along the axis north-east of Kyiv are facing ""considerable supply and morale issues"". ""It is likely that successful counter attacks by Ukraine will disrupt the ability of Russian forces to reorganise and resume their offensive towards Kyiv,"" says the report. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Russiaâs unprovoked invasion of its Slavic neighbour has triggered Europeâs worst security crisis since the Second World War. And yet, one month on, Russian forces have failed to exert full control over a single major city, their advance has stalled on several fronts and in some places they have even lost ground to Ukrainian counter-attacks. Bolstered by hi-tech weaponry from Britain and other Nato countries, Ukrainians have proven themselves both brave and resilient. But their defiance has come at a terrible cost. The southern port of Mariupol will go down in history as one of the most bombed and shattered cities of our time. Its destruction has been labelled a war crime. And Ukraine still faces major challenges. Its forces are running low on weapons and ammunition, armed Russian drones are now operating largely with impunity and Moscow is calling up reinforcements. President Putin appears set on subjugating Ukraine even if that means reducing it to a smouldering ruin. Zelensky spoke in English during his nightly address Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been delivering nightly video addresses since the start of the war, has called on people around the world to publicly protest on Thursday - the one month anniversary of Russia's invasion. ""The war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider,"" Zelensky says, for the first time delivering his address in English. ""Russia started the war against freedom,"" he continues, adding: ""This is only the beginning for Russia."" ""Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world."" ""It tried to show that only crude and cruel force matters,"" he continues. He adds: ""The world must stop Russia. The world must stop the war."" ""One month already. That long. It breaks my heart, the hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet."" He goes on to call for street demonstrations and for protesters to march while wearing Ukrainian symbols. ""Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourself visible and heard,"" he says. ""Say that people matter, freedom matters, people matter, peace matters. Ukraine matters."" A Russian-drafted resolution has failed to pass the UN Security Council. The resolution called for aid access in Ukraine, but made no mention of Moscow's role in the war. Russia and China were the only members to vote yes, while the remaining 13 members abstained. A rival humanitarian resolution drafted by Ukraine is due to be voted on in the General Assembly in the coming days. Biden was greeted at the Brussels airport by Belgium's prime minister If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of some of the latest developments on day 28 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: A Ukrainian soldier holds a US-based Javelin missile launcher outside Kharkiv The first shipments of weapons for Ukraine that were pledged by American lawmakers in a recently passed aid package will be sent to Ukraine in the next day or two, a senior US defence official told Reuters. The weapons will reach Ukraine quickly after departure, the unnamed official said, also refusing to specify which weapons would be delivered. The official added that weapons already in use by Ukrainian troops would be prioritised for delivery. ""We are already aggregating stocks in the United States and we're getting ready to ship them over there,"" the official said. Read more: What weapons is the US giving Ukraine - and how much will they help? Bethany BellBBC News, Vienna The head of the UNâs nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has again stressed what he called âthe urgent needâ to send experts and equipment to Ukraine to help ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and prevent the risk of a severe accident. Grossi said he remained gravely concerned about the situation in Ukraine. He said he hoped to work out an agreement to provide technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of Ukrainian nuclear sites, but that a positive solution had not yet been reached. ""We cannot afford to lose any more time,"" he said. ""We need to act now."" Ukraineâs atomic facilities include 15 reactors as well as Chernobyl, the site of the worldâs worst nuclear accident in 1986. Ukrainian officials have said that more than 4,500 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities via humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. Nearly 3,000 of them travelled from the besieged city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said,according to the Kyiv Independent newspaper,external. An evacuee from Berdyansk checks his phone Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov has denounced US claims that Russia is planning cyber attacks in retaliation for western businesses pulling out of Russia. ""These accusations against us are absurd,"" he said in a statement. On Monday, President Biden said that it was the patriotic duty of American companies to shore up their cyber defences against possible Russian attacks. Mr Syromolotov called the warning a ""new outburst of Russophobia against the backdrop of the situation in Ukraine"". Read more: Biden: Russia 'exploring' US cyber-attacks Russia has blocked access to Google News after accusing the news aggregation site of spreading false information about the war. The decision came at the request of Russia's Prosecutor-General's Office, Interfax news agency reported. The office determined that the website ""provided access to numerous publications and materials containing unreliable socially significant information about the course of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,"" according to the report. Numerous English language-websites - including Facebook and Instagram - have been blocked in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. A new law there makes it illegal to report on events that could discredit Russian forces. Alphabet - the parent company of Google - had said earlier that they would block advert payments to websites and YouTube videos that spread false and harmful information about the war. In an email to publishers seen by Reuters, Google said it would not run adverts alongside ""claims that imply victims are responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim blaming, such as claims that Ukraine is committing genocide or deliberately attacking its own citizens"". French car manufacturer Renault has announced that it is suspending work at its Moscow factory once more. Earlier today, Ukraine's president called on Renault and other French companies to quit Russia as he addressed the French parliament via videolink. ""They must stop financing the murders of women and children,"" he told French MPs. Renault had restarted operations in Moscow this week, after pausing work following the invasion of Ukraine. Ina statement released on Wednesday evening it,externalstressed that it was already complying with international sanctions on Russia. Chelsea football club will be allowed to sell tickets to away games, cup matches and games involving the women's team after the UK government made alterations to the club's special licence. The club have been unable to sell tickets since owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under the changed licence, the club will not receive any revenue from ticket sales. Proceeds will go directly to the Premier League and then be distributed to the relevant party. Chelsea fans can purchase tickets for future Premier League away games, with any revenue going to the host team. The move means Chelsea will be able to sell tickets for their home Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on 6 April and the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley Stadium on the weekend of 16 April.

A four-generation family of 10 have been reunited after fleeing Ukraine and moving to a home in the UK offered by a businessman. Mick Swinhoe, 52, said he bought the property in a village near Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, as a ""project"". He offered it to provide refuge to a Ukrainian family after a social media appeal, saying it was a ""better use"". Valeriia, whose family moved in, said it was ""such a relief"" to arrive in the UK after fleeing the war-torn north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. ""Maybe I can feel like I've got a home again,"" said the 37-year-old. ""I did so much, my family, for us to live there, to earn money, nice place to live, work for kids. We lost in one day everything."" Read more on this story here Joe Biden is taking his third trip to Europe as US president at a moment of international crisis. Speaking on board Air Force One as the president travels to Brussels, Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US would be announcing more sanctions on political figures and oligarchs on Thursday. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering its fourth week with no end in sight, and, sanctions aside, the path ahead for the US-Europe alliance is far from clear. Here's a look from our senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher at the most pressing concerns facing Mr Biden as he meets European leaders and allies in the days ahead: A cancer surgeon in Lviv has told the BBC that his hospital has seen a large influx of patients needing urgent treatment arriving from eastern Ukraine. Roman Shyyan says his hospital lacks enough chemotherapy drugs to treat all the patients - though more are being shipped now from Kyiv and other parts of the country. Help from Poland is proving hard to get because of logistical problems on the Poland/Ukraine border, he says. Some technicians working all hours to try and provide the radiotherapy that the extra patients need were unable to leave the hospital for days in a row - having worked late to offer treatments they were then trapped by the curfew rules, Shyyan said. The surgeon's team are limiting the number of post-operative patients they have in the hospital, he said, as they need to be able to move everyone safely into the basement when the air-raid sirens go off. Russian state media says the foreign ministry has given the US embassy a list of American diplomats it is expelling. The move comes after 12 Russian diplomats were expelled from its mission to the United Nations in New York earlier this month. The Russian foreign ministry said that the Americans were ""firmly told that any hostile actions of the United States against Russia will receive a decisive and adequate response"", Interfax reported.
