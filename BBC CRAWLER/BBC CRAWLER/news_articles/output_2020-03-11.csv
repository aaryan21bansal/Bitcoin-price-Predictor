Cladding firm suggested cheaper Grenfell panels,"A cladding company manager suggested using a cheaper material for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment, a 2013 email seen by the inquiry has shown. Mark Harris, of Harley Facades, told architects his firm's preference, ""from a selfish point of view"", was to use aluminium composite material (ACM). ACM was ""tried and tested"" and the firm had used it many times before, he said. It was eventually used on the tower, with the inquiry concluding it fuelled the 2017 fire that killed 72 people. Now in its second phase, the inquiry is looking into how the building came to be covered in such cladding. It is the first detailed evidence the inquiry has heard suggesting reasons why the material was changed during the refurbishment programme between 2012 and 2016, with catastrophic consequences. Grenfell architect did not check fire advice Protection for spoken Grenfell evidence guaranteed Grenfell: Seven key points from the first phase report The inquiry's witness on Wednesday, Tomas Rek, a former employee of architects Studio E, was questioned about a meeting he attended on 27 September 2013 at Hay's Galleria in London with representatives from Harley Facades, the cladding subcontractor. Mr Rek worked on the block's revamp between September and December 2013 and helped prepare drawings and the project's National Building Specification, a document used by designers to describe required materials, standards and workmanship. At the meeting, the two firms discussed the cladding options and Harley Facades showed him its portfolio, including a project at Ferrier Point in Canning Town, east London, which had used ACM panels. Mr Rek told the inquiry he thought the focus of the meeting was ""more to do with the appearance and price of the various materials and not their fire performance or fire rating"". Afterwards, lead Studio E architect Bruce Sounes sent an email to Mr Harris of Harley saying his ""back of a fag packet"" figure for the cladding had been deemed over-budget, according to emails. The next month, Mr Harris emailed Mr Rek regarding pricing, saying from a ""Harley selfish point of view our preference would be to use ACM"", adding the firm was ""confident of the cost base"". Separately, Mr Rek told the inquiry the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the client for the project, was putting his firm ""under some kind of pressure"" to use the cheaper materials. By July 2014,the BBC has previously revealed, council officials had decided to change the cladding to the more dangerous material, reducing the budget by less than Â£300,000. Mr Rek also said he was unaware of several fire safety requirements for buildings and considered it a ""subject outside of my competence"". He said he did not know at the time what would constitute a material of limited flammability and was unaware how individual parts of the cladding system should be considered for fire issues. The council has admitted a series of failings by its building control department which signed off the work despite the safety risk. Harley Facades will give evidence later in the process.

Coronavirus confirmed as pandemic,"This video can not be played Coronavirus outbreak has officially become pandemic says WHO The coronavirus outbreak has been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the number of cases outside China had increased 13-fold in two weeks. He said he was ""deeply concerned"" by ""alarming levels of inaction"". A pandemic is a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time. Hours later Italy said all shops except food shops and pharmacies would close. Announcing the toughest lockdown seen yet in Europe, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said bars, hairdressers, restaurants and cafes that could not guarantee a metre's distance between customers and non-essential company departments would also close. Read the latest on the coronavirus here What is a pandemic and why use the term now? Stock markets plunge as WHO confirms pandemic The impact of the tightened restrictions - in force from Thursday until 25 March - on the rate of new coronavirus cases would take a couple of weeks to be seen, Mr Conte said. Dr Tedros said that calling the outbreak a pandemic did not mean the WHO was changing its advice about what countries should do. He called on governments to change the course of the outbreak by taking ""urgent and aggressive action"". ""Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled,"" he said. ""The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same - it's whether they will."" This video can not be played A video circulating in Iran shows a morgue in the city of Qom, full of dead bodies Governments had to ""strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimising disruption and respecting human rights"". ""We're in this together to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It's doable,"" he said. His appeal was followed by the several other countries announcing ever more stringent restrictions to try to prevent the virus taking a hold. Denmark - which has 514 confirmed cases, up 10-fold since Monday, but no deaths so far - is to close all schools and universities from Friday and will send home all public sector employees who are not in critical roles in the coming days. The government also urged the cancellation of events with more than 100 people attending. Meanwhile India has suspended most visas for foreigners until 15 April and Guatemala is banning European citizens from entering from Thursday. The country has already closed schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the country. It has more than 12,000 confirmed cases and a death toll of 827. Nearly 900 people with the virus in Italy were in intensive care, the WHO's emergencies head Michael Ryan said. Dr Ryan said the situation in Iran - where the official figures are 354 deaths among 9,000 cases - was ""very serious"". The WHO had sent 40,000 testing kits to Iran but there was still a shortage of ventilators and oxygen. ""Iran and Italy are suffering now but I guarantee you other countries will be in that situation very soon,"" he said. This video can not be played What life looks like under Italy's coronavirus lockdown Earlier, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70% of the country's population - some 58 million people - could contract the coronavirus. She said since there was no known cure, the focus would fall on slowing the spread of the virus.""It's about winning time,"" she said. Some German virologists dispute the high figure. Former federal government adviser on disease control, Prof Alexander KekulÃ©, told German media he saw a worst case scenario of 40,000 cases. The number of confirmed cases in Germany has risen to 1,567 from 1,296, the Koch institute for infectious diseases said. By Philippa Roxby, BBC Health The use of the p-word by the WHO to describe the global spread of this new coronavirus is not a huge surprise. Up until now, it has talked merely of the ""threat"" or the ""potential"" for a pandemic. But with cases in more than 100 countries, and increasing numbers not linked to travel, the language has changed. The WHO no longer 'declares' a pandemic the way it used to, so this is as official as it gets. Yet this doesn't mean the pandemic cannot be controlled, it explains. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? It's a call to action and a plea for all countries not to give up, no matter how large the number of cases. Practically, countries are being told to continue to do what they have been advised to do. That means some may have to step up their response. But the WHO is not changing what it's doing or the threat level of the virus. What the use of the word ""pandemic"" highlights is the importance of countries around the world taking urgent action to respond to their own outbreaks - because now it's everyone's responsibility to turn the tide on the virus.

Sunak pumps billions into economy to combat coronavirus,"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Kuenssberg: The chancellor's very large cheque book Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Islam: The chancellor's two Budgets Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Budget gets mixed reaction on green issues Chancellor pledges big increase to research spend In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year. A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England. He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. What questions do you have about the budget?

Cabinet minister self-isolates after virus test,"Two more people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK deaths to 10. There are now 596 confirmed cases in the UK, up from 456 on Wednesday - with 491 in England, 60in Scotland,20in Northern Irelandand 25in Wales. It comes as the government is expected to announce within hours that it is stepping up its coronavirus response. It is anticipated the UK will switch to tactics aimed at delaying its spread, rather than containing it. The latest two deaths were an 89-year-old at Charing Cross Hospital in London and a woman in her 60s at Queen's Hospital in Romford, NHS England said. They both had underlying health conditions. As of 09:00 GMT, a total of 29,764 people had been tested for the virus in the UK. The rise in confirmed cases - of 140 -  is the first time the day-on-day increase has been more than 100.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization haslabelled the outbreakof the disease as a pandemic. Schools, colleges and other public facilities in the Republic of Irelandare to close until 29 March. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to sign off plans to move from the ""containment"" phase of the outbreak to ""delay"" at the Cobra meeting on Thursday. Speaking as the meeting continued, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the UK has moved into the delay phase. She added that the Scottish government has decided that from Monday gatherings of more than 500 people will be cancelled - to reduce pressure on frontline services. Overnight, US President Donald Trumpsuspended travel to the US from 26 European countries- but not the UK or Ireland.

The move could also result in people who show even minor signs of respiratory tract infections - such as a cough - or a fever soon being toldto self-isolate. Speaking to BBC News, deputy chief medical officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the introduction of social distancing measures should come at ""exactly the right time"". She also warned that members of the public wearing face masks could be putting themselves at more risk of contracting the virus - if they touch it with unwashed hands or put it on a surface they have not cleaned. ""You can actually trap the virus in the mask and start breathing it in,"" she said. The move to delay is an acknowledgement the virus cannot be contained. This is not unexpected given health officials have been clear in the past week or so that we should expect widespread community transmission. The key now is how quickly, and by how much, cases start to rise. A good scenario given the circumstances would be for infections to climb gradually over the coming months and for the peak weeks - where the risk is that half the overall cases could come quickly - to be kept under control. That will allow the health service to manage as best it can. The government has a range of powers at its disposal. But expect the most drastic to be reserved for just before the peak. The focus of today's advice is expected to be how the vulnerable can be protected - the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Breakfast any new measures would seek to protect people who are especially vulnerable and would be ""guided by the science"". ""We now believe the virus could spread significantly,"" he said. This video can not be played The University of Westminster's Dr Adele McCormick demonstrates how to wash your hands Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that blanket bans on foreign travel like that imposed by the US are unlikely to have a ""material effect"" on the spread of infection. He said the UK government was ""looking at interventions that provide very high clinical benefit and minimise the social impact"". The delay phase aims to lower the peak impact of the virus and push it away from the winter season - when pressures on the NHS are more acute because of issues including seasonal flu. Biggest daily rise as UK virus cases reach 460 What is a pandemic and why use the term now? Is the UK ready for a major outbreak? Delaying the outbreak's impact could also buy time for the testing of drugs and development of vaccines and/or improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease. The Cobra committee last met on Monday, when it was decidedthe UK should remain in the containment phase. On Wednesday, in his first Budget, Mr Sunakpledged billions of pounds of investment to get the country through the coronavirus outbreak,as well as saying the NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"". Meanwhile the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru have cancelled their respective spring conferences. In response to the World Health Organization labelling the outbreak of the disease a pandemic, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whittytweeted,externalthat the UK ""had been planning"" for this situation. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Newsnight that alternative areas like operating theatres and recovery rooms could be adapted to help cope with increased hospital admissions. He said: ""The idea that we've got a fixed number of beds and capacity is not right."" Alison Cameron, 53, is one of 15 people in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea to have been diagnosed with the disease. She contacted NHS 111 after she began finding it difficult to breathe. ""I feel really unwell. I am currently in isolation. It is not pleasant,"" she said, adding: ""At the heart of it I feel like death on legs."" She believes she contracted the virus after a chance meeting with someone who was subsequently diagnosed with it. ""It's a horrible feeling not being able to go out and it is quite frightening,"" she said. ""I am more worried about my neighbours because they are quite vulnerable too."" Read more here.

Biggest daily rise as UK virus cases reach 460,"The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day. It comes as two more people with the virus died in the UK, bringing the total to eight. One was in their 70s and had underlying health conditions in Dudley, while the other, in Nuneaton, was elderly and had a number of serious health conditions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the peak of the UK outbreak was expected ""in a matter of a couple of months"". He told MPs he was meeting the opposition ""first thing"" on Thursday to discuss emergency laws that will be set out next week, adding: ""The best way for us to beat it is for us to work together."" The legislation will include measures to keep public services running, help businesses, and ensure the adult social care sector is ready. He said Parliament would stay open, since ""the public will expect Parliament to sit and to get on with its job"", and the prime minister would chair a further meeting of the government's emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday. It comes as the World Health Organizationupgraded the statusof the outbreak to a pandemic. The two latest deaths were announced on Wednesday by George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust and Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old British woman has become the first person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to die in Indonesia, according to local media reports. It is not clear whether the woman - who was reportedly critically ill with multiple health conditions - died due to the virus. A flight carrying about 135 British passengers and crew members from the quarantined Grand Princess cruise ship in California has landed in Birmingham. Passengers were wearing face masks as they were led off the plane at Birmingham Airport and onto coaches by officials wearing hazmat suits. They are all being asked to self-isolate.

In all, 27,476 people have been tested so far. Later, Wales confirmed four new cases. There are now 387 confirmed cases in England, 36in Scotland,18in Northern Irelandand 19in Wales. Scotland and Wales have also seen their first cases of community transmission - meaning the virus was contracted in the UK and is unrelated to travel. Of the cases in England, London has the highest number, with 104. South-east England is the next highest infected area, with 60 cases, followed by south-west England with 44 cases. One case has been confirmed in a council-run care home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. The patient has been taken to hospital.

Delivering the Budget,Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged the NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis - whether it needed ""millions of pounds or billions"". He said workers who fell ill would be able to get a sick note by ringing 111 rather than visiting a GP, and people who were self-employed who were off work because of the virus would be eligible for benefits from day one. For businesses, Mr Sunak promised a temporary coronavirus loan scheme to help small and medium-sized companies and said the government would rebate firms with up to 250 people for the cost of statutory sick pay. At-a-glance: Budget key points Mr Hancock was asked by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt about comments previously made by England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, that the start of the UK peak of the epidemic could be within the next fortnight. Mr Hancock replied: ""I just want to slightly correct the point about the deputy chief medical officer who said that in the next couple of weeks, we may see the numbers starting to rise fast to their peak. ""We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we expect numbers to continue to rise after that and the peak would be in a matter of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. This is a marathon and not a sprint."" Mr Hancock added that 12 labs were now testing people for coronavirus, and the government was working with ""more than two dozen companies on further testing capability"". The Foreign Officehas issued a travel update,externalfor British nationals in Italy, urging all remaining tourists to contact their airline operators and return back to the UK. People were still able to leave Italy without restrictions and airports were still open, the Foreign Office added. Italy is the European country worst-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with the whole of the country currently in lockdown. Anyone who has returned from anywhere in Italy since Mondayis being asked to self-isolate,,externaleven if they do not have symptoms.

"Beer, wine and cider duties frozen","Rishi Sunak has offered a cocktail of measures to boost the spirits of pubs and drinkers affected by coronavirus and economic uncertainty. The chancellor scrapped a planned increase in duty on beer and spirits, while tax on all other kinds of alcoholic drinks will also be frozen. The small pub business rates discount will increase from Â£1,000 to Â£5,000. But the measures are a ""double penalty'"" for those worst-affected by alcohol harm, charities say. The 2020 Budget has offered an unexpected windfall for the alcohol industry, including tax breaks and cash giveaways. The business rate discount for small pubs - those with a rateable value of less than Â£100,000 - will be increased from Â£1,000 to Â£5,000, partly because of the ""possible impact of coronavirus"". Planned tax rises on beer and spirits were also scrapped, as part of a freezing on duty across all alcoholic drinks. This Budget marks only the second time that has happened in 20 years, the chancellor said. The British Beer and Pub Association described it as ""a great Budget for pubs, pub-goers and Britain's world-class brewing industry"". The association says the chancellor's measures will save pub-goers Â£80m and safeguard 2,000 jobs. It points out that other measures unveiled in the Budget will also provide a boost to many pubs, including the Â£3,000 small business relief grant and the temporary waiving of business rates for firms with a rateable value of Â£51,000 or less. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2020: What it means for you Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Business rates suspended for shops and cafes But an alcohol abuse charity said the government ""must stop placing industry profits ahead of health"". ""Cutting the price of alcohol while also cutting business rates, which help already-struggling local authorities to pay for alcohol treatment services, means a double penalty in today's Budget for those worst-affected by alcohol harm,"" said Lucy Holmes, director of Research and Policy at Alcohol Change UK. Mr Sunak offered Scotch whisky makers a Â£1m support fund while the government lobbies the US to remove ""harmful tariffs"" on the product. There will also be a Â£10m research and development fund to help distilleries ""go green"". The US - a market worth Â£1bn to Scotch whisky exporters - put a 25% tariff on single malt late last year. ""Although the chancellor's measures are welcome, there's no way they come anywhere close to mitigating the impact of US tariffs on the Scotch whisky industry,"" said Wendy Chamberlain, Liberal Democrat MP for North East Fife. The Scotch whisky trade body said the industry needed ""continued support"". ""We are pleased that the chancellor underlined the UK government's commitment to resolving these damaging tariffs quickly, while also announcing measures to support scotch whisky in a challenging period - including through a green energy fund to support our industry's leading work to decarbonise the energy we use and achieve net-zero,"" said Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Karen Betts.

Will Budget help self-employed?,"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ In his first Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a Â£12bn package to help the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He also outlined spending pledges that will add up to Â£18bn next year when combined with measures from last year's Spending Review. We answer some of your questions on the Budget. People who are not eligible for sick pay, particularly the self-employed,will be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA),externalfrom day one of ""illness"" rather than day eight. ESA is paid to those who are too sick to work, provided they meet certain conditions. It is worth Â£73.10 a week, or Â£57.90 for the under-25s. The complexity of this benefit may mean this change is unlikely to affect a lot of people. Councils will also have access to a hardship fund to help vulnerable people in their area. However, many self-employed people face a higher tax bill from April, when the so-called IR35 rule is extended to the private sector. That could mean thousands of contractors and freelancers will pay more tax. The government is also temporarily removing the minimum income floor from universal credit. The minimum income floor would have taken into account how much you would normally expect to earn in a month, when calculating your entitlement to universal credit. Not having the floor means they will be able to claim for time they spend off work due to sickness. Mr Sunak said they would not need to attend a job centre, and could apply on the phone or online instead. The government has also announced a new Â£500m fund to support economically vulnerable people - this will be allocated by local authorities. The burden of sick pay has fallen on employers, and it still will, except for those with fewer than 250 employees. The government would argue that other policies - such as loans and the Bank of England's rate cut - will help some of the bigger businesses. There is also an argument that the biggest companies have cash reserves to deal with unexpected financial shocks of this kind. Chancellor unveils Â£30bn coronavirus package At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Beer, wine and cider duties frozen UK growth 'to be slowest since 2009' The money being spent in the Budget mostly comes from borrowing, with some from a few small tax increases. The Office for Budget Responsibility said borrowing would climb to a six-year high by 2022, to fund what it called the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time there were any forecasts. That figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the country through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget, in the autumn. The full, new state pension will go up by 3.9% from Â£168.60 a week to about Â£175.20 in April. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is also going up - by 3.9%, from Â£129.20 to Â£134.25 per week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up. Is it safe to use swimming pools and other coronavirus questions Can I still live in the EU and other Brexit questions Climate change: What can I do about it and other questions Various measures were pledged in the budget to protect the environment. A plastic packaging tax will come into force from April 2022, while manufacturers and importers whose plastic products have less than 30% recyclable material will be charged Â£200 per tonne to recycle it. Subsidies for fuel used in off-road vehicles - known as red diesel - will be scrapped ""for most sectors"" in two years' time, but they will remain for farmers and rail operators. An emergency relief fund of Â£120m will be allocated for communities affected by this winter's flooding, along with another Â£200m for flood resilience. Total investment in flood defences will be doubled to Â£5.2bn over the next five years And a Â£640m ""nature for climate fund"" will be set up to protect natural habitats, while 30,000 hectares of new trees will be planted over five years.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? In addition to the measures to support economy during the coronavirus outbreak, the chancellor also outlined an Â£18bn programme of additional spending in 2020-21, much of which had already been announced in last year's Spending Review. Other giveaways include extra infrastructure spending, the national insurance tax cut and a further freeze on fuel duty. What questions do you have about the budget?

UK interest rates cut in emergency move,"This video can not be played Governor Mark Carney says the action will provide relief ""at a difficult time"" The Bank of England has announced an emergency cut in interest rates to shore up the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak. Policymakers reduced rates from 0.75% to 0.25%, taking borrowing costs back down to the lowest level in history. The Bank said it would also free up billions of pounds of extra lending power to help banks support firms. It comes as the chancellor is expected to announce further measures to support growth and jobs in the Budget later. Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, said policymakers had seen a ""sharp fall in trading conditions"", including spending on non-essential goods. ""The Bank of England's role is to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large and sharp, but should be temporary,"" he said. Live: Follow latest from the Budget He said the Bank's co-ordinated action on Budget day was designed to have ""maximum impact"". Mr Carney stressed that the economic damage caused by the coronavirus remained unclear. However, he suggested that the UK economy could shrink in the coming months. He said early evidence from China suggested that the world's second largest economy was on course to contract in the first quarter. Other nations were experiencing a ""similar shift"", he said. ""I would emphasise the direction is clear, though the orders of magnitude are still to be determined."" While the Bank's last emergency rate cut was in October 2008, Mr Carney said the virus was unlikely to inflict the damage seen during the financial crisis. ""There is no reason for it to be as bad as 2008 if we act as we have, and if there is that targeted support,"" he said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? The emergency rate cut comes as a sixth person died from the virus in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases. The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions. Meanwhile,Manchester City's Premier League match against Arsenalon Wednesday has been postponed as ""a precautionary measure"" because of the outbreak. A number of Arsenal players are in self-isolation after coming into contact with Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who tested positive for the virus.. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to help the UK battle the impact of the coronavirus, saying the NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis, while he is also expectedto unveil measures to boost the self-employed and small businesseswho are left out of pocket. Meanwhile, NHS England said it wasscaling up its capacity for testing peoplefor the infection, with the number of cases set to rise. The sudden cut in the Bank rate will immediately reduce the mortgage bill of a minority of homeowners. Others will have to wait to see how their home loan provider reacts at a time when mortgage rates are already at very low levels. Little will change for savers, who have had to endure years of low returns anyway. They may take heart from the fact this is a temporary measure from the Bank. Most people are, of course, savers and borrowers. As well as concern over their physical health from coronavirus, their financial health will primarily depend on their job. This emergency action is clearly designed to help protect businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, and in turn the employment of millions of people. What the rate cut means for you The interest rate cut was part of a package of measures introduced by the Bank to support the economy. It also announced a new Â£100bn scheme to help ensure households and businesses - particularly small and medium-sized firms - benefit from the reduction in interest rates. The Bank of England said other changes would free up an additional Â£190bn for banks to lend. It said the package of measures would ""help UK businesses and households bridge across the economic disruption that is likely to be associated with Covid-19"". The Bank said it expected UK economic activity to ""weaken materially"" over the coming months, but it was ready to take ""all further necessary steps to support the UK economy"". ""These measures will help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm."" Initially, the pound fell against both the euro and the dollar in reaction to the rate cut, but then rebounded. Share markets reacted positively, with the FTSE 100 rising more than 2% in early trading. Separatedata published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalshowed the UK economy stagnated in the three months to January. The dramatic emergency rate cut will dominate the headlines, but it is the overall package of measures which the departing Bank of England governor Mark Carney will stress as a support for the economy in this extraordinary coronavirus crisis. The key target of this move is the cashflow of small and medium-sized businesses, which could be hit by a combination of slumping demand, trade difficulties and staff absence. The Bank and Treasury agree that this will be a temporary shock. The aim, therefore, is to prevent unnecessary permanent economic scars. Alongside Budget measures, it is designed as a bridge beyond the virus. So the Bank's base rate is slashed to its record low, first reached in the aftermath of the EU referendum. But as important is the new TFSME - the ""Term Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". This proved rather successful after the EU referendum, and the aim is to get the banks to pass on the rate cut in full to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized firms, which face the greatest pressure to cut staff or hours in a crisis. Cutting the amount of money that banks are required to squirrel away when the sun is shining so they can spend the cash during this sort of rainy day should provide the firepower for banks to boost lending well above current lending levels. To be clear, coronavirus is unique and highly unpredictable. There is a fundamental problem of people and businesses not being able to function because of the measures to contain the virus. The message from the Bank is that the banking system is fully padded up to help businesses get through this. What are your experiences relating to the coronavirus outbreak?

Budget 2020: What it means for youVideoVideoGovernment lays out economic plan to combat Covid-19,"Key taxes are changing as a result of Budget announcements Chancellor Rishi Sunak's first Budget came as attention is focused on coronavirus, but what does it mean for your financial health? There weresignificant announcements,externalon benefits, tax, and the wider economy. A tax break from the government regarding national insurance was promised in the Conservative manifesto. The current threshold sees employees and the self-employed paying contributions once they earn Â£166 a week, equivalent to an annual salary of Â£8,632 a year. From April, you start paying when earning Â£9,500. That will mean 500,000 people will no longer have to pay this tax, according to independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Those still paying will save up to Â£85 a year on average. The chancellor said it would be just over Â£100 a year, but that calculation may not include the self-employed. The IFS says 8% of the gains go to the poorest 20% of working households, so it is those on a decent income who may benefit the most. However, those working in a number of low-paying part-time jobs could see their take-home pay increase significantly. Another tax to be cut is VAT on digital books, newspapers and magazines. Many of the measures aimed to tackle the impact of coronavirus benefit small businesses and so protect some jobs. This has been coordinated with the interest rate cut announced by the Bank of England. UK interest rates cut in emergency move Specific personal finance changes include the chancellor saying all of those advised to self-isolate, even if they do not show symptoms, are to receive statutory sick pay if eligible. UK employees have already started toget statutory sick pay from the first dayoff work, to help contain coronavirus. This is paid by the employer, but smaller businesses with fewer than 250 employees can reclaim the cost of paying sick pay for the 14 days of isolation. Those who are not eligible for sick pay, particularly the self-employed, will be able to claimEmployment and Support Allowance,external(ESA) from day one of ""illness"" rather than day eight. ESA is paid to those who are too sick to work, provided they meet certain conditions. It is worth Â£73.10 a week, or Â£57.90 for the under-25s. The complexity of this benefit may mean this change is unlikely to affect a lot of people. Councils will also have access to a hardship fund to help vulnerable people in their area, with money distributed through council tax discounts. Sunak pumps billions into economy to combat virus At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Beer, wine and cider duties frozen as pubs get help Business rates suspended for shops and cafes The highly complicated way in which high earners are taxed is set to change. Basically, tax relief on pensions becomes less generous if annual income exceeds Â£150,000 a year. This has become a problem as the income cap includes the value of pensions earned, not just salary. Some doctors have been refusing to work extra hours (and earning more) because they were being landed with much bigger tax bills. They, and other high earners, are currently affected by this restriction once income goes over Â£110,000. The government has promised this may only kick in once annual income exceeds Â£200,000. The duties on alcoholic drinks - beer, wine and cider - are all being frozen. So that means no extra tax on a pint or glass. There has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade, and this will continue for at least another year. About 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT. Duty on cigarettes and cigars will go up by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation plus 2% until the end of this Parliament (usually five years). That is a 27p rise on a pack of 20 cigarettes. Hand-rolling tobacco duty will rise by RPI plus 6% in April. Leaseholders will be able to access grants to safely remove unsafe cladding from flats. Some havetold the BBC about how they could not sellowing to the issue. The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the ""tampon tax"" - will beabolished from January. This was trailed by the Treasury at the weekend. People can put a lot more into tax-free savings for children. The allowance for Junior Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) and Child Trust Funds will be increased from Â£4,368 to Â£9,000 in April. However, the typical amount saved is only about Â£1,000. Owners of new motorhomes, who were facing a massive rise in vehicle excise duty, will now only face a much lower charge, following a campaign by the industry. Those working from home, who can claim Â£4 a week off their income tax bill, will be able to claim Â£6 from April. This April, the amount earned before paying 20% income tax will be frozen at Â£12,500. Also frozen is the Â£50,000 threshold at which people start to pay the higher 40% rate of income tax. Practically, that means anyone who gets a pay rise in the coming year may be at risk of paying more than they expected in tax, as the extra wages mean they cross these thresholds. If you are living in Scotland, you have different income tax rates from the rest of the UK. Changes were announced inthe recent Scottish budget. Other big changes to your finances in April had already been set, including: Many working-age benefits which had been frozen for four years. including Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit.will rise in line with the rising cost of living,external, going up by 1.7%. So, for example, child benefit for the eldest child will go up from Â£20.70 to Â£21.05 per week Those aged 25 and over will get theNational Living Wageof Â£8.72 an hour, a rise of 6.2%, with younger workers also getting more. This is paid by employers The full, new state pension will go up by 3.9% from Â£168.60 a week to about Â£175.20 in April. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is also going up by 3.9%, from Â£129.20 to Â£134.25 per week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Many self-employed people face a higher tax bill from April, when the so-called IR35 rule is extended to the private sector. That could mean thousands of contractors and freelancers will pay more tax The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendantsfree from some inheritance taxwill enter its final stage of introduction.

Stock markets plunge,"Share markets in the US plummeted on Wednesday, with losses acceleratingafter the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,500 points or more than 5.8%, while the S&P 500 fell 4.9% and Nasdaq fell 4.7%. The declines pushed the Dow more than 20% below its recent high, a threshold that often accompanies a recession. The falls come as the virus's spread has the global economy reeling. Concerns about the disease have disrupted manufacturing, prompted widespread closings and cancellations, and kept people at home. On Wednesday,UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a Â£30bn package, whilethe Bank of England delivered an emergency cutin interest rates. However, the White House and Congress have yet to reach a deal for economic relief after President Donald Trump's proposal of a tax cut for workers failed to garner widespread support. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday said that the administration hoped to extend deadlines for tax payments, cover the cost of sick leave for staff forced to stay home and provide loan guarantees for affected industries, such as airlines. ""We are not only focused on the health issues, but the economic issues,"" he said. The New York branch of the US central bank also said it would inject money into the financial system by making more overnight loans available to banks, its second such move this week. The Fed last week made its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis in an effort to keep money flowing. The moves come as the spread of the virus, despite hopes of containment, has rapidly reset expectations for global growth this year. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy The other reason behind Wall Street's jitters Global growth 'could halve' if outbreak intensifies On Wednesday, economists at IHS Markit said global growth was likely to slow to 1.7% this year, down from the 2.5% it forecast last month. The firm warned that the outbreak was likely to push Europe, which was already experiencing low growth, into recession and reduce US growth to 1.8%. ""The global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is the single biggest risk facing the world economy in early 2020,"" the firm said. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4%, while European indexes saw more modest declines. Those falls follow several weeks of market turmoil. The 20% decline of the Dow has pushed it into bear market territory, ending a streak of gains that started in 2009. ""It is not the virus itself, but rather the fear and panic related to the virus and the associated altered economic behaviour that could be a damaging tipping point, forcing the global economy onto a darker path,"" said Katrina Ell, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics. Markets have also been slammed this week by a plunge in oil prices, after oil exporters said they would increase output rather than make coordinated cuts. On Wednesday, oil prices were down more than 3%. On the Dow, the biggest drag was US planemaker Boeing, which fell more than 18%. The firm has been in crisis since the crashes of two of its 737 Max planes, which have since been grounded globally for about a year. On Wednesday, it reported 46 cancellations, which were not made up by new orders. It is also reportedly freezing hiring and being forced to draw on a $13.8bn (Â£10.7bn) loan, in part because of the coronavirus.

"Woman claims Salmond gave her 'very sloppy' kissesThe senior Scottish government official also alleges that Mr Salmond ""deliberately"" touched her bottom.Scotland","Mr Salmond has pled not guilty to all 14 of the charges against him A senior Scottish government official has told the Alex Salmond trial that he had given her ""very sloppy"" kisses on the mouth and touched her bottom. The woman, known as Woman A, said she had been employed by the SNP at the time, and had regularly worked with Mr Salmond. She said Mr Salmond would ""often"" greet her by kissing her on the lips, which she said made her feel ""disgusted"". Mr Salmond denies a total of 14 sexual assault charges against 10 women. He says he is innocent of all the allegations against him, which are said to have happened while he was serving as Scotland's first minister and the SNP leader. Woman A is the second of the 10 complainers to give evidence during the trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. She told the court that she had worked alongside Mr Salmond ""almost every day"" while they were campaigning in 2008. What to expect during the Alex Salmond trial Listen to the Alex Salmond trial podcast Follow @bbcphilipsim for live updates from the trial,external The witness said Mr Salmond would ""often come to greet me in a very familiar way - giving the impression he was going to give me a kiss on the cheek and normally end up kissing me on the lips"". She said she did not encourage this and did not want it to happen, and had felt ""quite disgusted and embarrassed and kind of quite humiliated by it"". The woman also said the ""very sloppy and kind of unpleasant"" kisses did not happen if other people were there, so she sometimes tried to take people with her to meet Mr Salmond. She also claimed that, on three or four occasions, Mr Salmond would put his hand on her back and move it so it was ""on the side of my chest or on my bum"". The woman added: ""I took the view it was deliberately. I had been around politicians in public places and nobody else did it. There was no need for it."" She said she began to carry a bag so it was between her and Mr Salmond when they were in the street, making it harder for him to reach her. When asked by prosecuting lawyer Alex Prentice QC why she had not asked Mr Salmond to stop, she replied: ""I liked my job, I didn't know him very well and he was the most powerful man in the country. ""I didn't know what would happen if I said 'no' or 'get off'. I had experienced volatile mood swings and behaviour from him and it was always easier to move away than risk infuriating or antagonising him."" Alex Prentice QC (left) is leading the prosecution, with Gordon Jackson QC (right) heading Mr Salmond's defence team Woman A went on to describe an alleged incident that she claimed happened at a nightclub in Edinburgh in December 2010. She claimed that Mr Salmond ""ran his hands down the curve of my body, over my hips, commenting: 'You look good, you've lost weight'."" Gordon Jackson QC, who is leading Mr Salmond's defence team, put it to Woman A that Mr Salmond also kissed members of the public on the lips, because ""that's the sort of man he was"". Mr Jackson also said that the alleged incidents were ""absolutely nothing, they were not distressing in any way, shape or form"". Woman A responded by saying that Mr Jackson's interpretation was ""categorically wrong"". And she denied suggestions from Mr Jackson that she had encouraged other people to make complaints against Mr Salmond in an attempt to ""turn things that were trivial, nothing, into criminal charges"". The witness said: ""I was not encouraging people to make a complaint. Some people asked me for advice, but in every case I said it was their decision to make."" Another of the complainers, an SNP politician known as Woman C, later told the court that Mr Salmond had once given her and her husband a lift in his ministerial car. Woman C said her husband was in the front seat next to Mr Salmond's driver while she sat next to Mr Salmond in the back. She said Mr Salmond put his hand on her leg, above her knee. She said she had been ""embarrassed"" by it and hoped he would move his hand - but claimed he had instead left it on her leg until they arrived at their destination. Woman C refuted suggestions from Mr Salmond's lawyer that she had not told anyone about the incident at the time because it had not actually happened. She said: ""I suppose when you look back at things you realise how much you excuse a person because of who they are. It is so hard to explain how much he meant to our party, and you just put things to one side. ""I didn't think it was nothing, it was because of who he is and what he was. Who on earth was I going to tell and what on earth were they going to do about it?"" The trial is being held before senior judge Lady Dorrian and a jury of 15 members of the public Earlier on Wednesday, a third complainer denied ever having had a consensual sexual encounter with Alex Salmond. Mr Salmond denies sexually assaulting the former Scottish government official, known as Woman H, in May 2014 and attempting to rape her a month later. Giving evidence for a third day, Women H said she had ""never been a willing participant of Alex Salmond's advances towards me"". Woman H had previously told the court that Mr Salmond""pounced on her""after a dinner at the first minister's official Bute House residence in June 2014. She alleged that he pulled her clothes off, pushed her on to a bed and then lay naked on top of her despite her protests. Mr Salmond is alleged to have attempted to rape Woman H in the first minister's Bute House residence in Edinburgh Woman H has previouslydenied suggestionsby defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC that she was not at the dinner in June 2014, and that there was no incident. On Wednesday morning, Ms McCall put it to the witness that the dinner in question had actually been at Bute House in August 2013, and had led to a consensual sexual encounter with Mr Salmond. Woman H replied: ""That's not true. I have never been a willing participant in Alex Salmond's advances towards me, and never will be."" Woman H denied suggestions by Ms McCall that she had started to unbutton Mr Salmond's shirt as they were saying goodnight, kissed him and helped to pull his trousers down to his knees. The witness insisted: ""I spent a large part of that evening trying to dodge his advances."" Ms McCall said the truth of the matter was that Mr Salmond's underpants were not down, just his trousers, during the encounter. But Woman H said: ""Absolutely not, as I have got this horrific image of him being fully aroused and lying over me."" Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC claimed that Woman H had a consensual sexual encounter with Mr Salmond in 2013 Woman H also said that the evening had ended with Mr Salmond ""passing out drunk, snoring, exhausted by his attempts to get me to sleep with him, which I kept saying no to"". She denied that there had been a discussion with Mr Salmond about how she had got ""carried away"", and that he had told her not to worry about it. The court was later shown a video of a police interview with a celebrity who said he had been at a dinner in Bute House with Mr Salmond. He said he believed Woman H and a businesswoman were also there. When he was asked whether the dinner had been on the same date in June 2014 that Mr Salmond is alleged to have attempted to rape Woman H, the celebrity replied that it ""sounds about right"". The celebrity said that the four people had shared a bottle of wine between them at the ""jovial"" dinner, but they were ""not really"" under the influence of alcohol. He said he left Bute House at about 23:00. He said the businesswoman had already left by then, and that he remembered Mr Salmond and Woman H still being in the building. He also said he had not seen anything that caused him any concern. Also on Wednesday, the trial heard evidence from a businessman who said he had been at various Bute House dinners and remembered Woman H being ""friendly and comfortable"" with Mr Salmond. And a former member of Yes Scotland staff told the court that Woman H had never mentioned to him that she had been at a dinner with the celebrity. Mr Salmond has pled not guilty to one charge of attempted rape, one assault with intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults. The offences are alleged to have happened at various locations in Scotland between June 2008 and November 2014.

It is so hard to explain how much he meant to our party, and you just put things to one side. ""I didn't think it was nothing, it was because of who he is and what he was. Who on earth was I going to tell and what on earth were they going to do about it?"" The trial is being held before senior judge Lady Dorrian and a jury of 15 members of the public Earlier on Wednesday, a third complainer denied ever having had a consensual sexual encounter with Alex Salmond. Mr Salmond denies sexually assaulting the former Scottish government official, known as Woman H, in May 2014 and attempting to rape her a month later. Giving evidence for a third day, Women H said she had ""never been a willing participant of Alex Salmond's advances towards me"". Woman H had previously told the court that Mr Salmond""pounced on her""after a dinner at the first minister's official Bute House residence in June 2014. She alleged that he pulled her clothes off, pushed her on to a bed and then lay naked on top of her despite her protests. Mr Salmond is alleged to have attempted to rape Woman H in the first minister's Bute House residence in Edinburgh Woman H has previouslydenied suggestionsby defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC that she was not at the dinner in June 2014, and that there was no incident. On Wednesday morning, Ms McCall put it to the witness that the dinner in question had actually been at Bute House in August 2013, and had led to a consensual sexual encounter with Mr Salmond. Woman H replied: ""That's not true. I have never been a willing participant in Alex Salmond's advances towards me, and never will be."" Woman H denied suggestions by Ms McCall that she had started to unbutton Mr Salmond's shirt as they were saying goodnight, kissed him and helped to pull his trousers down to his knees. The witness insisted: ""I spent a large part of that evening trying to dodge his advances."" Ms McCall said the truth of the matter was that Mr Salmond's underpants were not down, just his trousers, during the encounter. But Woman H said: ""Absolutely not, as I have got this horrific image of him being fully aroused and lying over me."" Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC claimed that Woman H had a consensual sexual encounter with Mr Salmond in 2013 Woman H also said that the evening had ended with Mr Salmond ""passing out drunk, snoring, exhausted by his attempts to get me to sleep with him, which I kept saying no to"". She denied that there had been a discussion with Mr Salmond about how she had got ""carried away"", and that he had told her not to worry about it. The court was later shown a video of a police interview with a celebrity who said he had been at a dinner in Bute House with Mr Salmond. He said he believed Woman H and a businesswoman were also there. When he was asked whether the dinner had been on the same date in June 2014 that Mr Salmond is alleged to have attempted to rape Woman H, the celebrity replied that it ""sounds about right"". The celebrity said that the four people had shared a bottle of wine between them at the ""jovial"" dinner, but they were ""not really"" under the influence of alcohol. He said he left Bute House at about 23:00. He said the businesswoman had already left by then, and that he remembered Mr Salmond and Woman H still being in the building. He also said he had not seen anything that caused him any concern. Also on Wednesday, the trial heard evidence from a businessman who said he had been at various Bute House dinners and remembered Woman H being ""friendly and comfortable"" with Mr Salmond. And a former member of Yes Scotland staff told the court that Woman H had never mentioned to him that she had been at a dinner with the celebrity. Mr Salmond has pled not guilty to one charge of attempted rape, one assault with intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults. The offences are alleged to have happened at various locations in Scotland between June 2008 and November 2014.

He says it is ""good news that it is highly likely that once people have
got it and recovered then they are going to be OK"". On calls for testing for all, the UK's health secretary says the test is ""not reliable for people who are not symptomatic"". He says that is why testing at the airport, for example, is not effective and some of the countries that started doing that have stopped. There are ""loads of false positives"" with temperature testing as the person ""might be ill with something else"", he says. Or there are ""loads of false negatives... because they donât have enough virus in their system yet to be symptomatic"". ""Testing of someone who does not have symptoms is not
reliable and is counter-productive so we wonât be doing it."" The number of confirmed cases in Costa Rica has risen to 22, up from 13 that had previously been reported. Of the 22, three are foreign nationals. Health authorities have closed several schools linked with a man who has been hospitalised. Despite the rising infected count, many fervent Trump supporters in Florida say they aren't worried. Robert O'Brien, National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump, has suggested China ""covered up"" its initial outbreak, causing a two-month delay to the world's response. Speaking at an event in Washington,external, Mr O'Brien pointed to reports by Chinese nationals ""that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out"". He also praised President Trump's ""bold"" and ""courageous"" action, and said new travel restrictions on people entering the US from China had bought America six to eight weeks to prepare. The coronavirus outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The city's residents have now been on lockdown for more than 50 days. Despite the isolation, people are still trying to keep busy. The Europa League has been ""devalued"" by playing matches behind closed doors, says Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz before his side take on Rangers. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The use of the p-word by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
describe the global spread of this new coronavirus is not a huge surprise. Up until now, it has talked merely of the ""threat"" or the ""potential"" for a pandemic. But with cases in more than 100 countries, and increasing
numbers not linked to travel, the language has changed. The WHO no longer ""declares"" a pandemic the way it used to,
so this is as official as it gets. Yet this doesnât mean the pandemic cannot be controlled, it
explains. Itâs a call to action and a plea for all countries not to
give up, no matter how large the number of cases. Practically, countries are being told to continue to do what
they have been advised to do. That means some may have to step up their
response. But the WHO is not changing what itâs doing or the threat
level of the virus. What the use of the word ""pandemic"" highlights is the
importance of countries around the world taking urgent action to respond to
their own outbreaks â because now itâs everyoneâs responsibility to turn the
tide on the virus. House of CommonsParliament In the UK's House of Commons, Mr Hancock continues: ""We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we
expect numbers to continue to rise after that. ""And the peak would be in a matter
of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. ""This is a
marathon and not a sprint."" He says that the fact the World Health Organization is now calling the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic ""does indicate that they think that this virus will spread right across the world"". His statement comes after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 - the biggest rise in a single day. Read more in our story here The Italian governmentâs decision
to put the whole country in lockdown has prompted 200 student volunteers in the
northern region of Veneto to âadoptâ residents who need help going to the
supermarket or pharmacy. Our reporter Sira Thierij spoke with some of the volunteers. âWhen our cities were shut down
by the government, we were really concerned about people who cannot take care
of themselves, elderly people, but also immuno-suppressed ones and others who
could be more vulnerable to infection,â says Tommaso Biancuzzi, who came up
with the idea. The lockdown means movement in
and out of cities is severely restricted. Shops and cafes may be open but there
is no nightlife and Italians have been told they need a valid work or family
reason to travel. âThis is an emergency with no
precedent in the history of our country,â he told the BBC. âOf course itâs
important to follow the rules and directions given by the health institutions,
but we think it's also crucial to preserve solidarity and compassion.â The volunteers know the risks
involved and visit the elderly and the sick wearing face masks and latex
gloves. âSometimes young people are
considered lazy, but we really care,â says Mr Biancuzzi. House of CommonsParliament The UK's Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs that Parliament will remain openafter an MP tested positive for coronavirus. ""Of course in some ways this House may have to function differently, but the ability to hold government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times,"" he said. Mr Hancock said the public ""will expect Parliament to sit"" and that their approach ""will be guided by the best scientific evidence and medical advice"". A cross-party parliamentary group was meeting daily to
assess the situation, he added. He said he would meet the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, on Thursday morning to discuss an emergency bill that would include measures to keep ""vital public services running"". ""I know how worrying this is, I know people have deep concerns, I know everyone will play their partâ¦ the best way to beat it if for us to work
together,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We will do whatever it takes. We will give the NHS everything it needs.""   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day. It came as two more people with the virus died in the UK, bringing the total number of deaths to eight. One was described as being in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, while the other was elderly and had a number of serious health conditions. Two other Britons have died abroad after contracting the virus. The latest, on Wednesday, was a 53-year-old woman in Bali. Another man also died in Japan last month after contracting the disease aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Share markets in the US have moved sharply lower on Wednesday in another day of jittery trade, driven by fears about the economic impact of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones was down nearly 5% at midday trade in New York, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 4%. London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4%, while other European markets saw more modest falls. The falls come as countries rush to approve spending to shield economies from reduced activity resulting from measures to halt the progress of the virus. Read more here. Health authorities in Croatia have confirmed a further three people in the country have tested positive for coronavirus. All three had recently traveled from Austria and Germany. This brings the total number of cases in Croatia to 19. The government has announced a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people, but ruled out economic intervention for now. From the Olympic women's football qualifiers getting moved from Wuhan on 22 January to Arsenal and Manchester City's Premier League tie getting postponed today, the coronavirus has affected huge swathes of the sporting world. Here's a timelinedetailing all the events hit by the outbreak. Iran's Fars news agency reports that First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri has contracted the virus. In his role, Mr Jahangiri leads Cabinet meetings in the absence of the president, and is the most senior government figure to catch the virus. He has recently been absent from several top-level meetings, and there has been speculation about the state of his health. Two other cabinet members have also tested positive for the disease, according to Fars: Cultural Minister Ali Asghar Mounesan and Reza Rahmani, minister of industry, mines and business. They are among the many Iranian officials and politicians who have been infected in recent weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

From the Olympic women's football qualifiers getting moved from Wuhan on 22 January to Arsenal and Manchester City's Premier League tie getting postponed today, the coronavirus has affected huge swathes of the sporting world. Here's a timelinedetailing all the events hit by the outbreak. Iran's Fars news agency reports that First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri has contracted the virus. In his role, Mr Jahangiri leads Cabinet meetings in the absence of the president, and is the most senior government figure to catch the virus. He has recently been absent from several top-level meetings, and there has been speculation about the state of his health. Two other cabinet members have also tested positive for the disease, according to Fars: Cultural Minister Ali Asghar Mounesan and Reza Rahmani, minister of industry, mines and business. They are among the many Iranian officials and politicians who have been infected in recent weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

Pupil sent home for selling hand sanitiser,"Jenny Tompkins posted a picture of her son arriving home earlier after he was caught selling squirts of hand sanitiser A teenager was sent home from school after being caught selling shots of hand sanitiser to his fellow pupils at 50p a go, his family claimed. His mother, Jenny Tompkins, from Leeds, posted a picture of him arriving home earlier after his entrepreneurial exploits at Dixons Unity Academy. In a post on Facebook, she said it was hard to discipline her son when his ""dad called to say he was a legend"". The school denied it had excluded any pupils for selling hand sanitiser. Some respondents to the post, which was shared nearly 130,000 times, praised his efforts. One said ""can't fault his logic"". Others reminisced about selling cigarettes for Â£1 a go. Someone else said: ""Bet he gets an A in economics.""

She said this was made more difficult after she called his father at work, who responded by calling him ""a [expletive] legend"". Her son plans to use the Â£9 he made to buy a kebab and a multipack of Doritos, she added. In a statement, the school said: ""No pupil has ever been excluded for selling hand sanitiser"".

Your essential guide to the Budget,"This Budget is the first of two during 2020 Our finances, as a nation and individually, are affected significantly by what is said during an hour in Parliament and what is published immediately afterwards. The Budget updates us on the financial state of the nation and outlines the government's plans for tax and spending for the financial year, which starts in April. Is it gripping? Perhaps not. Is it important? Yes. So here is your essential guide. The Budget will be delivered on Wednesday 11 March, at or around 12:30 GMT, so straight after Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. This is actually a Budget that was scheduled for November last year, but was postponed because the general election was called. Usually, we have a Spring Statement at this time of year - basically an update on the numbers - so this has been replaced by the delayed Budget. What we already know about our changing finances Chancellor Rishi Sunak can learn from late replacements The speech usually lasts about an hour, although the longest continuous Budget speech was by William Gladstone in 1853, lasting four hours and 45 minutes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn then gets the first response before MPs debate the Budget. This is Chancellor Rishi Sunak's first Budget. He has had just four weeks in the job to prepare for arguably the most important day in his calendar, owing tothe surprise resignation of his predecessor Sajid Javid. Before his appointment as Chancellor, Mr Sunak was chief secretary to the Treasury, so he knew his way around the department. Rishi Sunak has held jobs in the finance industry He has been the Conservative MP for Richmond in Yorkshire since 2015. The father-of-two lives in Kirby Sigston, just outside the town of Northallerton. Before entering politics, he worked for investment bank Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund, then co-founded an investment firm. The last Budget was delivered in October 2018 by then chancellor Philip Hammond, who is no longer an MP. Policies and plans announced in the Budget will affect all, or parts, of the UK. Particular attention is expected to be paid this time to policies that are designed to tackle regional inequalities, although the detail is yet to be revealed. The devolved nations all deliver Budgets too, to allocate spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish Budgetwas announced in February. Wales now has control over some income tax too, but ministers have said they will not diverge from the main UK levels before next year's Welsh Assembly elections. In Northern Ireland, the Assembly has lesser tax control and is in discussion over how this will be organised. The coronavirus outbreak will be impossible to ignore, so the chancellor will undoubtedly say more about the cost to the government of dealing with the consequences of the disease. Chancellor must raise taxes in first Budget, says IFS Minimum wage levelshave already been set, with those aged 25 and over getting Â£8.72 an hour from April. Inheritance tax changeshave been happening for some timeand are in the pipeline again for 2020-21. Pretty much everything else is speculation. The Conservative manifesto published during the general election campaign just a few months ago pledged that there will be no increases in income tax, national insurance or VAT. They could fall, however, and the government has already pledged that in its first Budget (this one), it will say people will be allowed toearn more before they have to pay national insurance. Given the length of time Mr Sunak has been given to prepare, there are suggestions that any really big policy changes might not happen until the next Budget. The chancellor sets the so-called ""sin taxes"" on cigarettes and booze. The cost of a pint of beer often changes after a Budget So, at the end of Budget day, any change in these duties will come into effect and is likely to have an immediate impact on prices. The chancellor has special permission to drink alcohol during the speech, although the last one to do so was Kenneth Clarke, who had a whisky. About 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT. Fuel duty has been frozen for a decade and a group of Conservative MPs have warned the chancellor against raising it this time. Hold on to your hats, as this is the first of two Budgets this year. The March Budget is the one delayed from last year, and then there will be one in the autumn as normal. Last year was the first since at least 1900 that there was no Budget. This year also sees the announcement of a full, multi-year Spending Review. This considers the budgets of all the government departments and sets out how taxpayers' money will be spent, by fixing the maximum amount that they can spend.

Will Budget help self-employed and other questions,"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ In his first Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a Â£12bn package to help the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He also outlined spending pledges that will add up to Â£18bn next year when combined with measures from last year's Spending Review. We answer some of your questions on the Budget. People who are not eligible for sick pay, particularly the self-employed,will be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA),externalfrom day one of ""illness"" rather than day eight. ESA is paid to those who are too sick to work, provided they meet certain conditions. It is worth Â£73.10 a week, or Â£57.90 for the under-25s. The complexity of this benefit may mean this change is unlikely to affect a lot of people. Councils will also have access to a hardship fund to help vulnerable people in their area. However, many self-employed people face a higher tax bill from April, when the so-called IR35 rule is extended to the private sector. That could mean thousands of contractors and freelancers will pay more tax. The government is also temporarily removing the minimum income floor from universal credit. The minimum income floor would have taken into account how much you would normally expect to earn in a month, when calculating your entitlement to universal credit. Not having the floor means they will be able to claim for time they spend off work due to sickness. Mr Sunak said they would not need to attend a job centre, and could apply on the phone or online instead. The government has also announced a new Â£500m fund to support economically vulnerable people - this will be allocated by local authorities. The burden of sick pay has fallen on employers, and it still will, except for those with fewer than 250 employees. The government would argue that other policies - such as loans and the Bank of England's rate cut - will help some of the bigger businesses. There is also an argument that the biggest companies have cash reserves to deal with unexpected financial shocks of this kind. Chancellor unveils Â£30bn coronavirus package At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Beer, wine and cider duties frozen UK growth 'to be slowest since 2009' The money being spent in the Budget mostly comes from borrowing, with some from a few small tax increases. The Office for Budget Responsibility said borrowing would climb to a six-year high by 2022, to fund what it called the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time there were any forecasts. That figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the country through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget, in the autumn. The full, new state pension will go up by 3.9% from Â£168.60 a week to about Â£175.20 in April. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is also going up - by 3.9%, from Â£129.20 to Â£134.25 per week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up. Is it safe to use swimming pools and other coronavirus questions Can I still live in the EU and other Brexit questions Climate change: What can I do about it and other questions Various measures were pledged in the budget to protect the environment. A plastic packaging tax will come into force from April 2022, while manufacturers and importers whose plastic products have less than 30% recyclable material will be charged Â£200 per tonne to recycle it. Subsidies for fuel used in off-road vehicles - known as red diesel - will be scrapped ""for most sectors"" in two years' time, but they will remain for farmers and rail operators. An emergency relief fund of Â£120m will be allocated for communities affected by this winter's flooding, along with another Â£200m for flood resilience. Total investment in flood defences will be doubled to Â£5.2bn over the next five years And a Â£640m ""nature for climate fund"" will be set up to protect natural habitats, while 30,000 hectares of new trees will be planted over five years.

In addition to the measures to support economy during the coronavirus outbreak, the chancellor also outlined an Â£18bn programme of additional spending in 2020-21, much of which had already been announced in last year's Spending Review.

The chancellor's two Budgets,"This video can not be played Budget 2020: 'This is two Budgets in one' There were two Budgets here. And both were huge. The first, the priority, was the immediate coronavirus challenge and the threat of a recession, identified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The numbers were substantial. A multi-billion pound stimulus plan that for the first time would see the state fund statutory sick pay for small and medium-sized enterprises, grant some cash handouts and suspend some business rates for one year. On top of this, there's at least Â£5bn to boost health spending. The measures complemented the emergency rate cut from the Bank of England and provide a powerful bridge built on the assumption that the outbreak will be temporary. Both engines - monetary and fiscal - are on full power. But the government also enacted its central manifesto offer - rather spectacularly - to borrow a huge amount of money to fund public services. The numbers were eye-watering. They were historic. Rishi Sunak was not even 10 when we last had a Budget that pumped so much money into the economy: Â£175bn extra in spending, not just on infrastructure, as expected, but also on current spending. In fact, most of the extra spending is on day-to-day departmental expenditure - including on tens of thousands of nurses, policemen, etc. On infrastructure, the 3% of national income ""limit"" on spending, as the previous chancellor put it, appears to now be a target, basically hit in four years of the five-year Parliament. That is massive sums to spend on the future ahead of the delayed Infrastructure Review. They take spending on capital to the highest sustained levels since the 1970s. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2020: What it means for you Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Business rates suspended for shops and cafes Drinks tax frozen as distilleries get boost But much of the fine detail of where this money will actually go - in terms of department, region and type of public service - is not settled. Even the Treasury ""Green Book"" equation, that diverts spending towards places such as London, is being reviewed. This is the start of a big spending process that will last the rest of the year, taking in a delayed National Infrastructure Review, a Comprehensive Spending Review and a further Budget. ""How is all this paid for?"" is the question posed - and the answer, basically, is about Â£130bn of extra borrowing over the Parliament rather than tax rises, though revenue is raised from Corporation Tax and Entrepreneurs' Relief. Whereas deficits were being phased out under existing Conservative plans, under this one, they become permanent. A structural change on economic policy that seeks to take advantage of historic lows in the interest rates that governments pay to borrow. But this is a government with a lot on its plate. Driving all this through - with the coronavirus emergency, post-Brexit negotiations, preparations for a possible World Trade Organization-terms trading relationship with European Union, and running a significant deficit of near 3% - is not without its risks. But this is one of the most consequential Budgets in a generation.

That's the question thousands of Midlanders are entitled to ask of today's Budget, especially those Labour voters who broke the habits of several lifetimes by switching to the Conservatives in areas of the Black Country and North Staffordshire where, until recently, any such thing would have seemed unthinkable. Remember this Budget is not only the first to be presented on behalf of a new government by a very new chancellor. It's also the first after Brexit and the first after our own flooding emergency along the Rivers Severn and Wye which has left local communities facing long and relentless battles to rebuild their their lives and their livelihoods.

Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The owner of British Airways has reacted angrily to the fact that Air Passenger Duty will rise in line with inflation next year. International Airlines Group, which also owns Aer Lingus and Iberia, said âgiven the acute pressure on business, the hike in APD will make it even harder for UK firms to trade overseas. This costs UK jobs and growth.â Airlines have long campaigned for APD to be scrapped.
However the aviation industry is being hit hard by the drop in passenger demand because of the coronavirus outbreak. The budget says APD will increase in line with the Retail Price Index measure of inflation for 2021-22, meaning rates on short-haul flights will remain frozen at Â£13. Long-haul economy will increase by Â£3 per passenger.
The government will carry out a consultation on reforming APD in the spring. Use our Budget calculator to find out how your pocket may be affected by the latest tax measures. Share markets in the US were sharply lower on Wednesday on another day of jittery trade, driven by fears about the economic impact of coronavirus. The Dow Jones was down nearly 5% at midday trade in New York, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 4%. The falls come as countries rush to approve spending to shield economies from reduced activity due to the virus. In the last hour, the World Health Organization has formally declared the outbreak a pandemic. It's been a turbulent day on the FTSE 100, which closed 1.6% lower after the Bank of England unexpectedly announced an emergency stimulus package and Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a Budget that has been described as the ""biggest sustained giveaway"" in almost three decades. The index edged into the red as Mr Sunak took to his feet in the Commons and largely continued on a downward trend to close the day 95 points lower at 5,865. The FTSE 250 finished the day 1.2% lower at 17,339. Mark BroadBBC Business digital and deployments editor Number 10 has confirmed that executives from the major tech
firms have been called to a meeting this evening with Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook will also be having a meeting with the Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty, Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS,
and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Downing Street said the talks were due to focus on how to ""inform the public"" about
coronavirus and also look at ""modelling the spread of the disease"". Reality Check The government is going to raise infrastructure spending (which is money for things like building roads and hospitals) to unusually high levels, even after taking into account rising prices. There have been various numbers used, but this chart of public sector net investment, adjusted for inflation, shows the planned increase. The only time we have got close to these levels was in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when the government brought forward spending to help boost the economy during the financial crisis. But governments have found it very difficult over the years to spend as much as they've planned to on infrastructure,as Reality Check explained in this piece. Humanitarian organisation the British Red Cross, which among things campaigns on loneliness, has said the government should commit to a funding plan to tackle isolation. ""Better
connected communities are more resilient communities,"" says ZoÃ« Abrams, executive director of the British Red Cross. ""Whether floods or an
epidemic, in a crisis people who are lonely or socially isolated are hit the
hardest. ""Whilst loneliness wasnât
mentioned
in the Budget, we urge the government to commit to a meaningful funding plan to
tackle loneliness in the forthcoming spending review,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There were two Budgets here. And both were huge. The first, the priority, was the immediate coronavirus
challenge and the threat of a recession, identified by the Office for Budget
Responsibility. The numbers were substantial. A Â£30bn plan
that would, for the first time, see the state fund statutory sick pay for small
and medium sized enterprises, some cash handouts, and a one-year suspension of
business rates. And boost health spending. The measures complemented the
emergency rate cut from the Bank of England, and provide a powerful bridge
built on the assumption that the outbreak will be temporary. But the government also enacted its central manifesto

on day-to-day departmental spending â including on tens of thousands of nurses and police officers etc. Much of the fine detail of where this money will
actually go, in terms of department, region,

answer, basically, is around Â£130bn of extra borrowing over this Parliament, and not
really tax rises. Whereas deficits were being phased out under existing
Conservative plans, under this one, they become permanent. A structural change
on economic policy that seeks to take advantage of historic lows in the
interest rates that governments pay to borrow. But this is a government with a lot on its plate: coronavirus, post-Brexit negotiations and running a significant deficit of almost 3%. But this is one of the most consequential Budgets in a
generation. For those coming fresh to the BBC's live coverage of Rishi Sunak's first Budget, here are some of the key points you may have missed. The chancellor promised: The cost of a packet of hand-rolling tobacco is due to rise by 67p, considerably more than the 27p additional tax that will be added to a pack of 20 cigarettes. That's because, under a higher ""tobacco
escalator"" policy, the tax on rolling tobacco increases at 6% ahead of the
retail price index. Simon JackBBC Business Editor This was two Budgets in one: a core Budget with big
borrowing and spending plans for the years ahead and an emergency coronavirus
budget. Although itâs primarily a health emergency, the next few
weeks and months could be a life or death moment for many small businesses which are dealing with the virus and, more importantly, the response to it. Business rates relief for small firms, an offer to give
companies more time to pay tax and the promise of a cash grant of Â£3,000 to virus-affected small
firms will be welcomed. But many will feel the criteria is too prescriptive and
a more general hardship fund would have been more appropriate for a situation
whose impacts are hard to predict. But perhaps more important was the messaging that the
government wants to unlock the potential of business. That is a warmer tone to the private sector than the one
business has been used to. The government has acknowledged that business faces
financial distress on top of the Brexit preparation that could substantially
add to the cost and administrative burden that business will face at the end of this
year. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live has been speaking to business owners to get their reaction to the Budget... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Budget 2020: What it means for you,"Key taxes are changing as a result of Budget announcements Chancellor Rishi Sunak's first Budget came as attention is focused on coronavirus, but what does it mean for your financial health? There weresignificant announcements,externalon benefits, tax, and the wider economy. A tax break from the government regarding national insurance was promised in the Conservative manifesto. The current threshold sees employees and the self-employed paying contributions once they earn Â£166 a week, equivalent to an annual salary of Â£8,632 a year. From April, you start paying when earning Â£9,500. That will mean 500,000 people will no longer have to pay this tax, according to independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Those still paying will save up to Â£85 a year on average. The chancellor said it would be just over Â£100 a year, but that calculation may not include the self-employed. The IFS says 8% of the gains go to the poorest 20% of working households, so it is those on a decent income who may benefit the most. However, those working in a number of low-paying part-time jobs could see their take-home pay increase significantly. Another tax to be cut is VAT on digital books, newspapers and magazines. Many of the measures aimed to tackle the impact of coronavirus benefit small businesses and so protect some jobs. This has been coordinated with the interest rate cut announced by the Bank of England. UK interest rates cut in emergency move Specific personal finance changes include the chancellor saying all of those advised to self-isolate, even if they do not show symptoms, are to receive statutory sick pay if eligible. UK employees have already started toget statutory sick pay from the first dayoff work, to help contain coronavirus. This is paid by the employer, but smaller businesses with fewer than 250 employees can reclaim the cost of paying sick pay for the 14 days of isolation. Those who are not eligible for sick pay, particularly the self-employed, will be able to claimEmployment and Support Allowance,external(ESA) from day one of ""illness"" rather than day eight. ESA is paid to those who are too sick to work, provided they meet certain conditions. It is worth Â£73.10 a week, or Â£57.90 for the under-25s. The complexity of this benefit may mean this change is unlikely to affect a lot of people. Councils will also have access to a hardship fund to help vulnerable people in their area, with money distributed through council tax discounts. Sunak pumps billions into economy to combat virus At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Beer, wine and cider duties frozen as pubs get help Business rates suspended for shops and cafes The highly complicated way in which high earners are taxed is set to change. Basically, tax relief on pensions becomes less generous if annual income exceeds Â£150,000 a year. This has become a problem as the income cap includes the value of pensions earned, not just salary. Some doctors have been refusing to work extra hours (and earning more) because they were being landed with much bigger tax bills. They, and other high earners, are currently affected by this restriction once income goes over Â£110,000. The government has promised this may only kick in once annual income exceeds Â£200,000. The duties on alcoholic drinks - beer, wine and cider - are all being frozen. So that means no extra tax on a pint or glass. There has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade, and this will continue for at least another year. About 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT. Duty on cigarettes and cigars will go up by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation plus 2% until the end of this Parliament (usually five years). That is a 27p rise on a pack of 20 cigarettes. Hand-rolling tobacco duty will rise by RPI plus 6% in April. Leaseholders will be able to access grants to safely remove unsafe cladding from flats. Some havetold the BBC about how they could not sellowing to the issue. The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the ""tampon tax"" - will beabolished from January. This was trailed by the Treasury at the weekend. People can put a lot more into tax-free savings for children. The allowance for Junior Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) and Child Trust Funds will be increased from Â£4,368 to Â£9,000 in April. However, the typical amount saved is only about Â£1,000. Owners of new motorhomes, who were facing a massive rise in vehicle excise duty, will now only face a much lower charge, following a campaign by the industry. Those working from home, who can claim Â£4 a week off their income tax bill, will be able to claim Â£6 from April. This April, the amount earned before paying 20% income tax will be frozen at Â£12,500. Also frozen is the Â£50,000 threshold at which people start to pay the higher 40% rate of income tax. Practically, that means anyone who gets a pay rise in the coming year may be at risk of paying more than they expected in tax, as the extra wages mean they cross these thresholds. If you are living in Scotland, you have different income tax rates from the rest of the UK. Changes were announced inthe recent Scottish budget. Other big changes to your finances in April had already been set, including: Many working-age benefits which had been frozen for four years. including Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit.will rise in line with the rising cost of living,external, going up by 1.7%. So, for example, child benefit for the eldest child will go up from Â£20.70 to Â£21.05 per week Those aged 25 and over will get theNational Living Wageof Â£8.72 an hour, a rise of 6.2%, with younger workers also getting more. This is paid by employers The full, new state pension will go up by 3.9% from Â£168.60 a week to about Â£175.20 in April. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is also going up by 3.9%, from Â£129.20 to Â£134.25 per week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Many self-employed people face a higher tax bill from April, when the so-called IR35 rule is extended to the private sector. That could mean thousands of contractors and freelancers will pay more tax The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendantsfree from some inheritance taxwill enter its final stage of introduction.

Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans,"The OBR says the UK economy is on course to grow at the slowest pace since the financial crisis this year A surge in public spending risks exposing the UK economy to a shock rise in borrowing costs, according to the government's spending watchdog. Abandoning long-term goals to balance the books could have consequences, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. Higher annual borrowing and overall debt would leave Britain ""vulnerable"" to changing investor sentiment. The warning came as the chancellor unveiled the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. Rishi Sunak's first budget included an extra Â£7bn to support workers and businesses affected by the coronavirus and at least Â£5bn to help the NHS cope with the outbreak. In total he outlined Â£30bn of extra spending this year. But higher spending over the long-term would be likely to lead to higher borrowing, which could prompt a rise in the cost of that borrowing. A year ago, the OBR predicted the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year. Now it says it expects it to grow at just 1.1% this year, the slowest pace since the financial crisis. That does not take into account any hit from the virus, which will slow growth further and could add an additional Â£6bn to the deficit over the next two years, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura estimates. The extra Â£12bn to battle the coronavirus was not costed in this year's Budget, he points out. Public borrowing is already forecast to climb to a six-year high by 2022 without taking into account these additional spending measures. There has been no immediate impact on the cost of government borrowing. Yields on ten year government bonds rose only marginally after the Budget as investors took the near-term planned rise in borrowing in their stride Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said: ""Markets are not only willing to accept [higher] fiscal spending but are now actively cheering it."" However, the OBR said the government's decision to move away from trying to reduce Britain's debt in relation to the size of the economy, could store up problems for the future. The last government said it aimed to bring down public sector net debt, but it now is projected to remain steady at around 75% of GDP over the next five years. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said that while he did not see the government spending splurge as a ""gamble"", a sudden increase in inflation and interest rates would make ""the arithmetic a lot more uncomfortable."" Sir Charlie Bean, a member of the OBR's budget responsibility committee, added: ""Clearly the more debt you build up, the more exposed you are if things go wrong. ""And there's a good general principle that you want to have the debt-to-GDP ratio declining in good times, to build up the space for responding precisely to the events like the coronavirus. ""If you only have the ambition to keep debt constant as a proportion of GDP, every time you get a bad shock, you just ratchet that up again."" Boris Johnson's government has moved away from an previous Tory ambition to eliminate borrowing this decade. In the Budget the chancellor launched a review of the government's current self-imposed spending rule, which requires it to balance the books, excluding investment spending, within three years. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2020: What it means for you Business rates suspended for shops and cafes Drinks tax frozen as distilleries get boost Public borrowing is forecast to be lower this financial year at Â£47.4bn than predicted last March, but after that the deficit is projected to rise sharply. The government is now set to borrow Â£54.8bn in the coming financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is much higher than the Â£40.2bn that was forecast. This will rise to Â£66.7bn in 2021-22. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Mr Sunak said a weaker global backdrop would drag down UK growth. But the OBR said it expected the economy to rebound in 2021 with the help of the big spending boost. It said growth is forecast to rise to 1.8%, before moderating to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.3% the following year. Higher growth would make it easier to reduce debt as a proportion of the overall size of the economy and make the UK less vulnerable to a shock rise in borrowing costs. However, the growth forecasts were made before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK became clear. So they do not take into account the impact of the virus, the emergency government stimulus measures, orthe cut in UK interest ratesannounced earlier on Wednesday. Mr Sunak said the coronavirus outbreak would have a ""significant impact"" on the economy, warning that a fifth of Britain's workforce could be off work at the same time during the peak of the outbreak. But he said the extra spending and investment would provide ""security today"" and ""prosperity tomorrow"". Mr Sunak unveiled a three-point plan to tackle the coronavirus, including: Providing the NHS with unlimited financial resources to fight the virus Extending sick pay benefits to healthy people forced to self-isolate as well as the UK's five million self-employed Pledging to foot the sick pay bill for any business employing less than 250 people for up to 14 days, and scrapping business rates for small firms. Mr Sunak said the government would do ""everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure"".

Business rates suspended for shops and cafes,"Tens of thousands of England's retail, leisure and hospitality firms will not pay any business rates in the coming year, the chancellor has announced. Companies with a rateable value of less than Â£51,000 will be eligible for the tax holiday, Rishi Sunak said. The measure applies to firms including shops, cinemas, restaurants and hotels. It is part of a package of ""extraordinary"" measures to support the UK economy in the face of disruption from the coronavirus outbreak. ""That is a tax cut worth over Â£1bn, saving each business up to Â£25,000,"" Mr Sunak said. Business rates are a tax on properties that are used for commercial purposes, and are charged based on an estimate of what it would cost to rent the property on the open market: the ""rateable value"". Mr Sunak described the business rates holiday as an ""exceptional step"" that would benefit museums, art galleries, theatres, caravan parks, gyms, small hotels, sports clubs and night clubs, all of whom will be hard hit if customers stay away to slow the spread of coronavirus. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak said the policy would help businesses deal with impact of coronavirus The chancellor said the business rates system as a whole would be reviewed, with the conclusions published in the autumn. Firms in England have campaigned for several years for the system to be reformed, arguing it makes it hard for bricks and mortar retailers to compete with online rivals. Business rates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set by the devolved administrations. Chancellor unveils Â£30bn coronavirus package At-a-glance summary: Budget key points UK growth 'to be slowest since 2009' The head of retail and consumer at Pinsent Masons, Tom Leman, said the announcement would be ""extremely welcome news"" for small businesses. ""On the basis the coronavirus is not a long-term issue for these businesses, it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst. ""This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend."" However, some small businesses said the move would not help them. Biju Bubble Tea, based in Soho in London, tweeted that it was suffering the impact of fears around the virus, but would not qualify for relief. Allow Twitter content?

Larger retail and leisure chains are unlikely to benefit from the rates holiday. State aid rules include a cap on the amount of tax relief a business can claim over three years. Most large firms will have already reached the limit as a result of rates relief provided in previous years. Other Budget measures to support small businesses included: Cash grants of Â£3,000 to very small businesses with rateable values below Â£15,000 Government backing for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to small and medium-sized businesses Businesses with fewer than 250 employees can reclaim the cost of providing Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) to employees off work due to the coronavirus Scaling up of HMRC's ""Time to Pay"" service, including a new helpline so businesses and the self-employed can arrange to defer tax payments. As expected, Mr Sunak scrapped a planned cut to corporation tax. The rate of the tax will remain at 19% rather than falling to 17%. Another change that was widely anticipated was a cut to Entrepreneurs' Tax Relief. Business owners who sell their firms on were entitled to tax relief on profits of up to Â£10m over their lifetime. The tax relief has been scaled back rather than abolished, with the lifetime limit reduced to Â£1m. This was two Budgets in one: a core Budget with big borrowing and spending plans for the years ahead and an emergency coronavirus Budget. Although it's primarily a health emergency, the next few weeks and months could be a life-or-death moment for many small businesses who are dealing with the virus - and more importantly, the response to it. Business rates relief for small firms, an offer to give firms more time to pay tax, and cash grants of Â£3,000 to virus-affected small firms will be welcomed. But many will feel the criteria are too prescriptive and a more general hardship fund would have been more appropriate for a situation where the impacts are hard to predict. Yet perhaps more important was the messaging that the government wants to unlock the potential of business. That is a warmer tone to the private sector than the one business has been used to. The government has acknowledged that business faces financial distress on top of the Brexit preparation that could substantially add to the cost and administrative burden that firms will face at the end of this year. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said the chancellor's measures would help reinject optimism into business. ""We're already seeing supply chains disrupted and footfall hurt due to the spread of coronavirus. Against this backdrop, the chancellor's commitments to making more small business finance available, deferring tax bills, reducing business rates and setting up a hardship fund for the vulnerable - including the self-employed who cannot claim SSP - are all absolutely critical,"" he said. ""The priority at this point needs to be ensuring that these support mechanisms reach the small firms that need them as swiftly as possible."" However, larger businesses would feel left out in the cold, analysts said. ""There is nothing in the Budget that tackles the issues of the larger businesses - and these are the ones shedding the jobs,"" said John Webber of property firm Colliers. ""We are now destined to see more shop closures and job losses in the High Street in the months ahead."" Jerry Schurder, at real estate advisors Gerald Eve, said larger retailers and small firms outside the retail and leisure sectors would still face ""huge challenges"" from the coronavirus outbreak but were ""being left to rot by the Treasury"".

NHS to ramp up testing capacity,"With the number of UK coronavirus cases set to rise, NHS England says it is scaling up its capacity for testing people for the infection. It means 10,000 tests a day can be done - 8,000 more than the 1,500 being carried out currently. Confirmation of any positive test results will be accelerated, helping people take the right action to recover or quickly get treatment. Most of the people tested should get a result back within 24 hours. How a 'drive-through' testing facility in London works Coronavirus symptoms take five days to show Coronavirus: GPs prepare to drop routine work Public Health England has already carried out more than 25,000 tests across the UK. According to the latest figures, those tests have revealed 373 confirmed UK cases as of 09:00 GMT on Tuesday. Six people who tested positive for the Covid-19 disease have died in British hospitals. These have been older people with underlying health conditions. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be expected to roll out their own testing services, but there will be some shared capacity between nations, depending on need. NHS chief scientific officer Prof Dame Sue Hill said the health service was preparing to cope with more coronavirus cases. ""Every hospital across the country, and the healthcare professionals who run them, are now actively planning to respond flexibly to manage new demand. ""The public can help us to help the country to stay safe by practising good hygiene and washing their hands more often, for at least 20 seconds.""

England's deputy chief medical officer has defended the decision to delay closing schools and introducing other stringent measures to help stop the spread of the virus. Dr Jenny Harries said experts were assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a ""balanced response"", supported by science.

"Cladding firm suggested cheaper Grenfell panelsHarley Facades suggested the use of aluminium panels that fuelled the 2017 fire, the inquiry hears.UK","A cladding company manager suggested using a cheaper material for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment, a 2013 email seen by the inquiry has shown. Mark Harris, of Harley Facades, told architects his firm's preference, ""from a selfish point of view"", was to use aluminium composite material (ACM). ACM was ""tried and tested"" and the firm had used it many times before, he said. It was eventually used on the tower, with the inquiry concluding it fuelled the 2017 fire that killed 72 people. Now in its second phase, the inquiry is looking into how the building came to be covered in such cladding. It is the first detailed evidence the inquiry has heard suggesting reasons why the material was changed during the refurbishment programme between 2012 and 2016, with catastrophic consequences. Grenfell architect did not check fire advice Protection for spoken Grenfell evidence guaranteed Grenfell: Seven key points from the first phase report The inquiry's witness on Wednesday, Tomas Rek, a former employee of architects Studio E, was questioned about a meeting he attended on 27 September 2013 at Hay's Galleria in London with representatives from Harley Facades, the cladding subcontractor. Mr Rek worked on the block's revamp between September and December 2013 and helped prepare drawings and the project's National Building Specification, a document used by designers to describe required materials, standards and workmanship. At the meeting, the two firms discussed the cladding options and Harley Facades showed him its portfolio, including a project at Ferrier Point in Canning Town, east London, which had used ACM panels. Mr Rek told the inquiry he thought the focus of the meeting was ""more to do with the appearance and price of the various materials and not their fire performance or fire rating"". Afterwards, lead Studio E architect Bruce Sounes sent an email to Mr Harris of Harley saying his ""back of a fag packet"" figure for the cladding had been deemed over-budget, according to emails. The next month, Mr Harris emailed Mr Rek regarding pricing, saying from a ""Harley selfish point of view our preference would be to use ACM"", adding the firm was ""confident of the cost base"". Separately, Mr Rek told the inquiry the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the client for the project, was putting his firm ""under some kind of pressure"" to use the cheaper materials. By July 2014,the BBC has previously revealed, council officials had decided to change the cladding to the more dangerous material, reducing the budget by less than Â£300,000. Mr Rek also said he was unaware of several fire safety requirements for buildings and considered it a ""subject outside of my competence"". He said he did not know at the time what would constitute a material of limited flammability and was unaware how individual parts of the cladding system should be considered for fire issues. The council has admitted a series of failings by its building control department which signed off the work despite the safety risk. Harley Facades will give evidence later in the process.

"Sunak unveils package to combat coronavirusCoronavirus is likely to bring a ""temporary disruption"" to the UK economy but ""we will get through this together"", says the chancellor as he delivers his Budget.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Kuenssberg: The chancellor's very large cheque book Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Islam: The chancellor's two Budgets Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Budget gets mixed reaction on green issues Chancellor pledges big increase to research spend In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year. A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England. He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. What questions do you have about the budget?

"Beer, wine and cider duties frozen as pubs get help","Rishi Sunak has offered a cocktail of measures to boost the spirits of pubs and drinkers affected by coronavirus and economic uncertainty. The chancellor scrapped a planned increase in duty on beer and spirits, while tax on all other kinds of alcoholic drinks will also be frozen. The small pub business rates discount will increase from Â£1,000 to Â£5,000. But the measures are a ""double penalty'"" for those worst-affected by alcohol harm, charities say. The 2020 Budget has offered an unexpected windfall for the alcohol industry, including tax breaks and cash giveaways. The business rate discount for small pubs - those with a rateable value of less than Â£100,000 - will be increased from Â£1,000 to Â£5,000, partly because of the ""possible impact of coronavirus"". Planned tax rises on beer and spirits were also scrapped, as part of a freezing on duty across all alcoholic drinks. This Budget marks only the second time that has happened in 20 years, the chancellor said. The British Beer and Pub Association described it as ""a great Budget for pubs, pub-goers and Britain's world-class brewing industry"". The association says the chancellor's measures will save pub-goers Â£80m and safeguard 2,000 jobs. It points out that other measures unveiled in the Budget will also provide a boost to many pubs, including the Â£3,000 small business relief grant and the temporary waiving of business rates for firms with a rateable value of Â£51,000 or less. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2020: What it means for you Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Business rates suspended for shops and cafes But an alcohol abuse charity said the government ""must stop placing industry profits ahead of health"". ""Cutting the price of alcohol while also cutting business rates, which help already-struggling local authorities to pay for alcohol treatment services, means a double penalty in today's Budget for those worst-affected by alcohol harm,"" said Lucy Holmes, director of Research and Policy at Alcohol Change UK. Mr Sunak offered Scotch whisky makers a Â£1m support fund while the government lobbies the US to remove ""harmful tariffs"" on the product. There will also be a Â£10m research and development fund to help distilleries ""go green"". The US - a market worth Â£1bn to Scotch whisky exporters - put a 25% tariff on single malt late last year. ""Although the chancellor's measures are welcome, there's no way they come anywhere close to mitigating the impact of US tariffs on the Scotch whisky industry,"" said Wendy Chamberlain, Liberal Democrat MP for North East Fife. The Scotch whisky trade body said the industry needed ""continued support"". ""We are pleased that the chancellor underlined the UK government's commitment to resolving these damaging tariffs quickly, while also announcing measures to support scotch whisky in a challenging period - including through a green energy fund to support our industry's leading work to decarbonise the energy we use and achieve net-zero,"" said Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Karen Betts.

Harvey Weinstein arrives for sex trial sentencing,"Weinstein faces between five and 29 years after being found guilty Harvey Weinstein has arrived in court in New York for sentencing, weeks after being found guilty of sexual assault and rape in a landmark trial. Once one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, Weinstein could face up to 29 years in prison. His lawyers have appealed for a much shorter term. Weinstein appeared in court in a wheelchair. The 67-year-old has recently been moved to Rikers Island jailafter being hospitalised when his trial ended. He had stent implant surgery to remove a blockage after complaining of chest pains, according to a spokesman. Weinstein's lawyers have asked Judge James Burke to consider his poor health, age and young children while sentencing him. They asked for the shortest possible punishment of five years for their client, citing his ""accomplishments"" and ""charitable endeavours"" over the years. How a Hollywood giant faced his reckoning How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Weinstein accuser: 'No' was a trigger for him Prosecutors have asked for a prison sentence which reflects his ""lifetime of abuse towards others"" and ""lack of remorse"" for his actions. Dozens of women have come forward allegations of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Weinstein since October 2017. Weinstein consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers have said they will appeal against his convictions. Both he and the two women he was found guilty of assaulting could have the chance to speak at Wednesday's hearing, AP reports. Weinstein was convicted for two offences last month after a weeks-long trial in Manhattan. He was found guilty of a first-degree criminal sexual act charge for forcing oral sex on former production assistant Miriam Haley, also known as Mimi Haleyi, in 2006. This video can not be played Miriam Haley comments on Weinstein's guilty verdict He was also convicted of the third-degree rape of Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. The jury acquitted him of a more serious first-degree rape charge relating to Ms Mann. Jurors also cleared him of the two other counts he faced, for predatory sexual assault, which would have factored in the testimony of a third woman: actress Annabella Sciorra. Her allegation of rape, which dated back to the 1990s, was too old to be charged independently under New York law.  If Weinstein had been found guilty of the more serious predatory assault charges, he could have faced a life sentence. Wednesday's sentencing comes just days after a mound of court evidence was unsealed. US media has carried reports of the documents, which are said to include tense exchanges with his now-estranged brother and former business partner. Weinstein was remanded in custody following the guilty verdict Details also emerged of the ""red-flag list"" of people he had sent to private investigators and his apparent attempts to get help from influential figures, like Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg, as allegations against him mounted. Three additional women, outside of the New York charges, testified at Weinstein's trial to help prosecutors establish an alleged pattern of behaviour. The former movie executive still faces further criminal charges in Los Angelesover the alleged assault of two women in 2013. Investigators there also have other cases under review. Dozens have women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. The allegations helped the #MeToo movement go global, where women shared their own experiences of abuse and misconduct. The movie executive was once a titan of Hollywood, enjoying phenomenal success with Oscar winners such Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting and The King's Speech.

Business rates scrapped for shops and cafes,"Tens of thousands of England's retail, leisure and hospitality firms will not pay any business rates in the coming year, the chancellor has announced. Companies with a rateable value of less than Â£51,000 will be eligible for the tax holiday, Rishi Sunak said. The measure applies to firms including shops, cinemas, restaurants and hotels. It is part of a package of ""extraordinary"" measures to support the UK economy in the face of disruption from the coronavirus outbreak. ""That is a tax cut worth over Â£1bn, saving each business up to Â£25,000,"" Mr Sunak said. Business rates are a tax on properties that are used for commercial purposes, and are charged based on an estimate of what it would cost to rent the property on the open market: the ""rateable value"". Mr Sunak described the business rates holiday as an ""exceptional step"" that would benefit museums, art galleries, theatres, caravan parks, gyms, small hotels, sports clubs and night clubs, all of whom will be hard hit if customers stay away to slow the spread of coronavirus. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak said the policy would help businesses deal with impact of coronavirus The chancellor said the business rates system as a whole would be reviewed, with the conclusions published in the autumn. Firms in England have campaigned for several years for the system to be reformed, arguing it makes it hard for bricks and mortar retailers to compete with online rivals. Business rates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set by the devolved administrations. Chancellor unveils Â£30bn coronavirus package At-a-glance summary: Budget key points UK growth 'to be slowest since 2009' The head of retail and consumer at Pinsent Masons, Tom Leman, said the announcement would be ""extremely welcome news"" for small businesses. ""On the basis the coronavirus is not a long-term issue for these businesses, it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst. ""This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend."" However, some small businesses said the move would not help them. Biju Bubble Tea, based in Soho in London, tweeted that it was suffering the impact of fears around the virus, but would not qualify for relief. Allow Twitter content?

Larger retail and leisure chains are unlikely to benefit from the rates holiday. State aid rules include a cap on the amount of tax relief a business can claim over three years. Most large firms will have already reached the limit as a result of rates relief provided in previous years. Other Budget measures to support small businesses included: Cash grants of Â£3,000 to very small businesses with rateable values below Â£15,000 Government backing for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to small and medium-sized businesses Businesses with fewer than 250 employees can reclaim the cost of providing Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) to employees off work due to the coronavirus Scaling up of HMRC's ""Time to Pay"" service, including a new helpline so businesses and the self-employed can arrange to defer tax payments. As expected, Mr Sunak scrapped a planned cut to corporation tax. The rate of the tax will remain at 19% rather than falling to 17%. Another change that was widely anticipated was a cut to Entrepreneurs' Tax Relief. Business owners who sell their firms on were entitled to tax relief on profits of up to Â£10m over their lifetime. The tax relief has been scaled back rather than abolished, with the lifetime limit reduced to Â£1m. This was two Budgets in one: a core Budget with big borrowing and spending plans for the years ahead and an emergency coronavirus Budget. Although it's primarily a health emergency, the next few weeks and months could be a life-or-death moment for many small businesses who are dealing with the virus - and more importantly, the response to it. Business rates relief for small firms, an offer to give firms more time to pay tax, and cash grants of Â£3,000 to virus-affected small firms will be welcomed. But many will feel the criteria are too prescriptive and a more general hardship fund would have been more appropriate for a situation where the impacts are hard to predict. Yet perhaps more important was the messaging that the government wants to unlock the potential of business. That is a warmer tone to the private sector than the one business has been used to. The government has acknowledged that business faces financial distress on top of the Brexit preparation that could substantially add to the cost and administrative burden that firms will face at the end of this year. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said the chancellor's measures would help reinject optimism into business. ""We're already seeing supply chains disrupted and footfall hurt due to the spread of coronavirus. Against this backdrop, the chancellor's commitments to making more small business finance available, deferring tax bills, reducing business rates and setting up a hardship fund for the vulnerable - including the self-employed who cannot claim SSP - are all absolutely critical,"" he said. ""The priority at this point needs to be ensuring that these support mechanisms reach the small firms that need them as swiftly as possible."" However, larger businesses would feel left out in the cold, analysts said. ""There is nothing in the Budget that tackles the issues of the larger businesses - and these are the ones shedding the jobs,"" said John Webber of property firm Colliers. ""We are now destined to see more shop closures and job losses in the High Street in the months ahead."" Jerry Schurder, at real estate advisors Gerald Eve, said larger retailers and small firms outside the retail and leisure sectors would still face ""huge challenges"" from the coronavirus outbreak but were ""being left to rot by the Treasury"".

Cocktail of measures for drinkers unveiled,"Rishi Sunak has offered a cocktail of measures to boost the spirits of pubs and drinkers affected by coronavirus and economic uncertainty. The chancellor scrapped a planned increase in duty on beer and spirits, while tax on all other kinds of alcoholic drinks will also be frozen. The small pub business rates discount will increase from Â£1,000 to Â£5,000. But the measures are a ""double penalty'"" for those worst-affected by alcohol harm, charities say. The 2020 Budget has offered an unexpected windfall for the alcohol industry, including tax breaks and cash giveaways. The business rate discount for small pubs - those with a rateable value of less than Â£100,000 - will be increased from Â£1,000 to Â£5,000, partly because of the ""possible impact of coronavirus"". Planned tax rises on beer and spirits were also scrapped, as part of a freezing on duty across all alcoholic drinks. This Budget marks only the second time that has happened in 20 years, the chancellor said. The British Beer and Pub Association described it as ""a great Budget for pubs, pub-goers and Britain's world-class brewing industry"". The association says the chancellor's measures will save pub-goers Â£80m and safeguard 2,000 jobs. It points out that other measures unveiled in the Budget will also provide a boost to many pubs, including the Â£3,000 small business relief grant and the temporary waiving of business rates for firms with a rateable value of Â£51,000 or less. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2020: What it means for you Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Business rates suspended for shops and cafes But an alcohol abuse charity said the government ""must stop placing industry profits ahead of health"". ""Cutting the price of alcohol while also cutting business rates, which help already-struggling local authorities to pay for alcohol treatment services, means a double penalty in today's Budget for those worst-affected by alcohol harm,"" said Lucy Holmes, director of Research and Policy at Alcohol Change UK. Mr Sunak offered Scotch whisky makers a Â£1m support fund while the government lobbies the US to remove ""harmful tariffs"" on the product. There will also be a Â£10m research and development fund to help distilleries ""go green"". The US - a market worth Â£1bn to Scotch whisky exporters - put a 25% tariff on single malt late last year. ""Although the chancellor's measures are welcome, there's no way they come anywhere close to mitigating the impact of US tariffs on the Scotch whisky industry,"" said Wendy Chamberlain, Liberal Democrat MP for North East Fife. The Scotch whisky trade body said the industry needed ""continued support"". ""We are pleased that the chancellor underlined the UK government's commitment to resolving these damaging tariffs quickly, while also announcing measures to support scotch whisky in a challenging period - including through a green energy fund to support our industry's leading work to decarbonise the energy we use and achieve net-zero,"" said Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Karen Betts.

UK growth 'to be slowest since 2009',"The OBR says the UK economy is on course to grow at the slowest pace since the financial crisis this year A surge in public spending risks exposing the UK economy to a shock rise in borrowing costs, according to the government's spending watchdog. Abandoning long-term goals to balance the books could have consequences, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. Higher annual borrowing and overall debt would leave Britain ""vulnerable"" to changing investor sentiment. The warning came as the chancellor unveiled the biggest Budget giveaway since 1992. Rishi Sunak's first budget included an extra Â£7bn to support workers and businesses affected by the coronavirus and at least Â£5bn to help the NHS cope with the outbreak. In total he outlined Â£30bn of extra spending this year. But higher spending over the long-term would be likely to lead to higher borrowing, which could prompt a rise in the cost of that borrowing. A year ago, the OBR predicted the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year. Now it says it expects it to grow at just 1.1% this year, the slowest pace since the financial crisis. That does not take into account any hit from the virus, which will slow growth further and could add an additional Â£6bn to the deficit over the next two years, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura estimates. The extra Â£12bn to battle the coronavirus was not costed in this year's Budget, he points out. Public borrowing is already forecast to climb to a six-year high by 2022 without taking into account these additional spending measures. There has been no immediate impact on the cost of government borrowing. Yields on ten year government bonds rose only marginally after the Budget as investors took the near-term planned rise in borrowing in their stride Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said: ""Markets are not only willing to accept [higher] fiscal spending but are now actively cheering it."" However, the OBR said the government's decision to move away from trying to reduce Britain's debt in relation to the size of the economy, could store up problems for the future. The last government said it aimed to bring down public sector net debt, but it now is projected to remain steady at around 75% of GDP over the next five years. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said that while he did not see the government spending splurge as a ""gamble"", a sudden increase in inflation and interest rates would make ""the arithmetic a lot more uncomfortable."" Sir Charlie Bean, a member of the OBR's budget responsibility committee, added: ""Clearly the more debt you build up, the more exposed you are if things go wrong. ""And there's a good general principle that you want to have the debt-to-GDP ratio declining in good times, to build up the space for responding precisely to the events like the coronavirus. ""If you only have the ambition to keep debt constant as a proportion of GDP, every time you get a bad shock, you just ratchet that up again."" Boris Johnson's government has moved away from an previous Tory ambition to eliminate borrowing this decade. In the Budget the chancellor launched a review of the government's current self-imposed spending rule, which requires it to balance the books, excluding investment spending, within three years. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2020: What it means for you Business rates suspended for shops and cafes Drinks tax frozen as distilleries get boost Public borrowing is forecast to be lower this financial year at Â£47.4bn than predicted last March, but after that the deficit is projected to rise sharply. The government is now set to borrow Â£54.8bn in the coming financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is much higher than the Â£40.2bn that was forecast. This will rise to Â£66.7bn in 2021-22. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Mr Sunak said a weaker global backdrop would drag down UK growth. But the OBR said it expected the economy to rebound in 2021 with the help of the big spending boost. It said growth is forecast to rise to 1.8%, before moderating to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.3% the following year. Higher growth would make it easier to reduce debt as a proportion of the overall size of the economy and make the UK less vulnerable to a shock rise in borrowing costs. However, the growth forecasts were made before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK became clear. So they do not take into account the impact of the virus, the emergency government stimulus measures, orthe cut in UK interest ratesannounced earlier on Wednesday. Mr Sunak said the coronavirus outbreak would have a ""significant impact"" on the economy, warning that a fifth of Britain's workforce could be off work at the same time during the peak of the outbreak. But he said the extra spending and investment would provide ""security today"" and ""prosperity tomorrow"". Mr Sunak unveiled a three-point plan to tackle the coronavirus, including: Providing the NHS with unlimited financial resources to fight the virus Extending sick pay benefits to healthy people forced to self-isolate as well as the UK's five million self-employed Pledging to foot the sick pay bill for any business employing less than 250 people for up to 14 days, and scrapping business rates for small firms. Mr Sunak said the government would do ""everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure"".

Sunak unveils Â£30bn package to combat coronavirus,"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024.

Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts.

A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England. He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. What questions do you have about the budget?

Biggest daily rise as UK virus cases reach 456Latest government figures show a rise of 83 cases in a day across the UK.UK,"The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day. It comes as two more people with the virus died in the UK, bringing the total to eight. One was in their 70s and had underlying health conditions in Dudley, while the other, in Nuneaton, was elderly and had a number of serious health conditions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the peak of the UK outbreak was expected ""in a matter of a couple of months"". He told MPs he was meeting the opposition ""first thing"" on Thursday to discuss emergency laws that will be set out next week, adding: ""The best way for us to beat it is for us to work together."" The legislation will include measures to keep public services running, help businesses, and ensure the adult social care sector is ready. He said Parliament would stay open, since ""the public will expect Parliament to sit and to get on with its job"", and the prime minister would chair a further meeting of the government's emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday. It comes as the World Health Organizationupgraded the statusof the outbreak to a pandemic. The two latest deaths were announced on Wednesday by George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust and Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old British woman has become the first person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to die in Indonesia, according to local media reports. It is not clear whether the woman - who was reportedly critically ill with multiple health conditions - died due to the virus. A flight carrying about 135 British passengers and crew members from the quarantined Grand Princess cruise ship in California has landed in Birmingham. Passengers were wearing face masks as they were led off the plane at Birmingham Airport and onto coaches by officials wearing hazmat suits. They are all being asked to self-isolate.

Scotland and Wales have also seen their first cases of community transmission - meaning the virus was contracted in the UK and is unrelated to travel. Of the cases in England, London has the highest number, with 104. South-east England is the next highest infected area, with 60 cases, followed by south-west England with 44 cases. One case has been confirmed in a council-run care home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. The patient has been taken to hospital.

Delivering the Budget,Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged the NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis - whether it needed ""millions of pounds or billions"". He said workers who fell ill would be able to get a sick note by ringing 111 rather than visiting a GP, and people who were self-employed who were off work because of the virus would be eligible for benefits from day one. For businesses, Mr Sunak promised a temporary coronavirus loan scheme to help small and medium-sized companies and said the government would rebate firms with up to 250 people for the cost of statutory sick pay. At-a-glance: Budget key points Mr Hancock was asked by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt about comments previously made by England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, that the start of the UK peak of the epidemic could be within the next fortnight. Mr Hancock replied: ""I just want to slightly correct the point about the deputy chief medical officer who said that in the next couple of weeks, we may see the numbers starting to rise fast to their peak. ""We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we expect numbers to continue to rise after that and the peak would be in a matter of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. This is a marathon and not a sprint."" Mr Hancock added that 12 labs were now testing people for coronavirus, and the government was working with ""more than two dozen companies on further testing capability"".

He said Parliament would stay open, since ""the public will expect Parliament to sit and to get on with its job"", and the prime minister would chair a further meeting of the government's emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday. It comes as the World Health Organizationupgraded the statusof the outbreak to a pandemic. The two latest deaths were announced on Wednesday by George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust and Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old British woman has become the first person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to die in Indonesia, according to local media reports. It is not clear whether the woman - who was reportedly critically ill with multiple health conditions - died due to the virus.

Delivering the Budget,Chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged the NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis - whether it needed ""millions of pounds or billions"". He said workers who fell ill would be able to get a sick note by ringing 111 rather than visiting a GP, and people who were self-employed who were off work because of the virus would be eligible for benefits from day one. For businesses, Mr Sunak promised a temporary coronavirus loan scheme to help small and medium-sized companies and said the government would rebate firms with up to 250 people for the cost of statutory sick pay. At-a-glance: Budget key points Mr Hancock was asked by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt about comments previously made by England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, that the start of the UK peak of the epidemic could be within the next fortnight. Mr Hancock replied: ""I just want to slightly correct the point about the deputy chief medical officer who said that in the next couple of weeks, we may see the numbers starting to rise fast to their peak. ""We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we expect numbers to continue to rise after that and the peak would be in a matter of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. This is a marathon and not a sprint."" Mr Hancock added that 12 labs were now testing people for coronavirus, and the government was working with ""more than two dozen companies on further testing capability"". The Foreign Officehas issued a travel update,externalfor British nationals in Italy, urging all remaining tourists to contact their airline operators and return back to the UK.

""It's the weirdest holiday I think I've ever been on,"" said Hannah Butcher, from Newbury, Berkshire, who is in Rome with her husband for their first holiday alone since having a child. ""We arrived on Sunday. The advice then was as long as you're not going into Italy's red zone, you're OK. ""We're currently sitting in a restaurant and everyone here is in staggered rows because they have to sit one metre apart. It's quite weird seeing families spread across multiple tables."" She added that people are ""only allowed to enter shops one at a time"". ""All the attractions are closed; there are queues out the door of supermarkets and the butchers.

What the UK interest rate cut means for you,"Two emergency cuts in interest rates have been announced by the Bank of England within days of each other in response to the financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee first cut the so-called base rate from 0.75% to 0.25% on 11 March, only then to reduce it again to 0.1% on 19 March,pushing it to its lowest level in history. The Bank has also pumped more money into the economy. This benchmark Bank rate is used by banks and other financial institutions as a guide to what they pay savers or charge some borrowers. The sudden cut in the Bank rate will immediately reduce the mortgage bill of a minority of homeowners. Little will change for savers, who have had endure years of low returns anyway. As well as concern over your physical health from coronavirus, your financial health will primarily depend on your job. This emergency action by the Bank - alongside government action such as the guarantee for billions of pounds in loans - is clearly designed to help protect businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones. In turn, this will be key to the employment of millions of people. Some homeowners' mortgage repayments are directly affected by any move in the Bank of England's base rate. These are people on so-called tracker rates, which follow - or track - changes to the Bank rate. They represent about 11% of the outstanding mortgages in the UK. The rate cut immediately means their mortgage will become cheaper. For someone who has a Â£100,000 mortgage balance to pay over 25 years, both cuts should mean their mortgage gets about Â£30 cheaper each month, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. Other borrowers are on variable rate mortgages and, often, the amount they pay every month can be changed by their provider in response to the Bank's decision on the base rate. They must wait to see how their home loan provider reacts at a time when mortgage rates are already at very low levels. Relatively little of these rate changes are feeding through. About 16% of UK mortgages fall into this bracket, according to UK Finance, which represents mortgage providers. This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The majority of homeowners are on a fixed-rate mortgage, so they will see no change, but potentially they may find interest rates look a bit more attractive when it comes to remortgaging. That said, a lot may happen in the meantime that could affect the rates on offer in two to five years' time. The Bank's rate cuts are only designed to be temporary, to tackle the coronavirus impact, so rates could easily rise again by then. There is also a possibility that personal loans, often taken out for a new car or home improvements, may get a little cheaper. Banks and credit card companies are also able to defer repayments given the current crisis, although you must contact them to get this agreement in place. Ever since the financial crisis a decade ago, savers have seen relatively small returns for putting cash aside. Some people who have lived off the income from life savings have been particularly affected. They may take heart from the fact that this latest cut is a temporary measure from the Bank. Banks told to stop short-changing loyal savers Why a timely nudge might help us save money Three months after an interest rate cut of 0.25 percentage points in 2016, the typical interest on an easy access savings account fell by 0.14 of a percentage point, according to Moneyfacts. So, not all of the rate cut may be seen in savers' rates. A total of 40 million people in the UK have easy access savings accounts, but only 10% of them - primarily pensioners with large life savings pots - move them around to different accounts to make the most of the best interest rates on the market. With the Bank pumping more money into the economy, there is also less incentive for banks to offer decent rates to savers to win deposits that they can then lend out to others. UK interest rates cut in emergency move Banks told to stop short-changing loyal savers Can't save money? Is this the answer?

Salmond accuser denies encounter was consensual,"Mr Salmond has pled not guilty to all 14 of the charges against him A senior Scottish government official has told the Alex Salmond trial that he had given her ""very sloppy"" kisses on the mouth and touched her bottom. The woman, known as Woman A, said she had been employed by the SNP at the time, and had regularly worked with Mr Salmond. She said Mr Salmond would ""often"" greet her by kissing her on the lips, which she said made her feel ""disgusted"". Mr Salmond denies a total of 14 sexual assault charges against 10 women. He says he is innocent of all the allegations against him, which are said to have happened while he was serving as Scotland's first minister and the SNP leader. Woman A is the second of the 10 complainers to give evidence during the trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. She told the court that she had worked alongside Mr Salmond ""almost every day"" while they were campaigning in 2008. What to expect during the Alex Salmond trial Listen to the Alex Salmond trial podcast Follow @bbcphilipsim for live updates from the trial,external The witness said Mr Salmond would ""often come to greet me in a very familiar way - giving the impression he was going to give me a kiss on the cheek and normally end up kissing me on the lips"". She said she did not encourage this and did not want it to happen, and had felt ""quite disgusted and embarrassed and kind of quite humiliated by it"". The woman also said the ""very sloppy and kind of unpleasant"" kisses did not happen if other people were there, so she sometimes tried to take people with her to meet Mr Salmond. She also claimed that, on three or four occasions, Mr Salmond would put his hand on her back and move it so it was ""on the side of my chest or on my bum"". The woman added: ""I took the view it was deliberately. I had been around politicians in public places and nobody else did it. There was no need for it."" She said she began to carry a bag so it was between her and Mr Salmond when they were in the street, making it harder for him to reach her. When asked by prosecuting lawyer Alex Prentice QC why she had not asked Mr Salmond to stop, she replied: ""I liked my job, I didn't know him very well and he was the most powerful man in the country. ""I didn't know what would happen if I said 'no' or 'get off'. I had experienced volatile mood swings and behaviour from him and it was always easier to move away than risk infuriating or antagonising him."" Alex Prentice QC (left) is leading the prosecution, with Gordon Jackson QC (right) heading Mr Salmond's defence team Woman A went on to describe an alleged incident that she claimed happened at a nightclub in Edinburgh in December 2010. She claimed that Mr Salmond ""ran his hands down the curve of my body, over my hips, commenting: 'You look good, you've lost weight'."" Gordon Jackson QC, who is leading Mr Salmond's defence team, put it to Woman A that Mr Salmond also kissed members of the public on the lips, because ""that's the sort of man he was"". Mr Jackson also said that the alleged incidents were ""absolutely nothing, they were not distressing in any way, shape or form"". Woman A responded by saying that Mr Jackson's interpretation was ""categorically wrong"". And she denied suggestions from Mr Jackson that she had encouraged other people to make complaints against Mr Salmond in an attempt to ""turn things that were trivial, nothing, into criminal charges"". The witness said: ""I was not encouraging people to make a complaint. Some people asked me for advice, but in every case I said it was their decision to make."" Another of the complainers, an SNP politician known as Woman C, later told the court that Mr Salmond had once given her and her husband a lift in his ministerial car. Woman C said her husband was in the front seat next to Mr Salmond's driver while she sat next to Mr Salmond in the back. She said Mr Salmond put his hand on her leg, above her knee. She said she had been ""embarrassed"" by it and hoped he would move his hand - but claimed he had instead left it on her leg until they arrived at their destination. Woman C refuted suggestions from Mr Salmond's lawyer that she had not told anyone about the incident at the time because it had not actually happened. She said: ""I suppose when you look back at things you realise how much you excuse a person because of who they are. It is so hard to explain how much he meant to our party, and you just put things to one side. ""I didn't think it was nothing, it was because of who he is and what he was. Who on earth was I going to tell and what on earth were they going to do about it?"" The trial is being held before senior judge Lady Dorrian and a jury of 15 members of the public Earlier on Wednesday, a third complainer denied ever having had a consensual sexual encounter with Alex Salmond. Mr Salmond denies sexually assaulting the former Scottish government official, known as Woman H, in May 2014 and attempting to rape her a month later. Giving evidence for a third day, Women H said she had ""never been a willing participant of Alex Salmond's advances towards me"". Woman H had previously told the court that Mr Salmond""pounced on her""after a dinner at the first minister's official Bute House residence in June 2014. She alleged that he pulled her clothes off, pushed her on to a bed and then lay naked on top of her despite her protests. Mr Salmond is alleged to have attempted to rape Woman H in the first minister's Bute House residence in Edinburgh Woman H has previouslydenied suggestionsby defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC that she was not at the dinner in June 2014, and that there was no incident. On Wednesday morning, Ms McCall put it to the witness that the dinner in question had actually been at Bute House in August 2013, and had led to a consensual sexual encounter with Mr Salmond. Woman H replied: ""That's not true. I have never been a willing participant in Alex Salmond's advances towards me, and never will be."" Woman H denied suggestions by Ms McCall that she had started to unbutton Mr Salmond's shirt as they were saying goodnight, kissed him and helped to pull his trousers down to his knees. The witness insisted: ""I spent a large part of that evening trying to dodge his advances."" Ms McCall said the truth of the matter was that Mr Salmond's underpants were not down, just his trousers, during the encounter. But Woman H said: ""Absolutely not, as I have got this horrific image of him being fully aroused and lying over me."" Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC claimed that Woman H had a consensual sexual encounter with Mr Salmond in 2013 Woman H also said that the evening had ended with Mr Salmond ""passing out drunk, snoring, exhausted by his attempts to get me to sleep with him, which I kept saying no to"". She denied that there had been a discussion with Mr Salmond about how she had got ""carried away"", and that he had told her not to worry about it. The court was later shown a video of a police interview with a celebrity who said he had been at a dinner in Bute House with Mr Salmond. He said he believed Woman H and a businesswoman were also there. When he was asked whether the dinner had been on the same date in June 2014 that Mr Salmond is alleged to have attempted to rape Woman H, the celebrity replied that it ""sounds about right"". The celebrity said that the four people had shared a bottle of wine between them at the ""jovial"" dinner, but they were ""not really"" under the influence of alcohol. He said he left Bute House at about 23:00. He said the businesswoman had already left by then, and that he remembered Mr Salmond and Woman H still being in the building. He also said he had not seen anything that caused him any concern. Also on Wednesday, the trial heard evidence from a businessman who said he had been at various Bute House dinners and remembered Woman H being ""friendly and comfortable"" with Mr Salmond. And a former member of Yes Scotland staff told the court that Woman H had never mentioned to him that she had been at a dinner with the celebrity. Mr Salmond has pled not guilty to one charge of attempted rape, one assault with intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults. The offences are alleged to have happened at various locations in Scotland between June 2008 and November 2014.

Harvey Weinstein awaits sentencing in New York,"Weinstein faces between five and 29 years after being found guilty Harvey Weinstein has arrived in court in New York for sentencing, weeks after being found guilty of sexual assault and rape in a landmark trial. Once one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, Weinstein could face up to 29 years in prison. His lawyers have appealed for a much shorter term. Weinstein appeared in court in a wheelchair. The 67-year-old has recently been moved to Rikers Island jailafter being hospitalised when his trial ended. He had stent implant surgery to remove a blockage after complaining of chest pains, according to a spokesman. Weinstein's lawyers have asked Judge James Burke to consider his poor health, age and young children while sentencing him. They asked for the shortest possible punishment of five years for their client, citing his ""accomplishments"" and ""charitable endeavours"" over the years. How a Hollywood giant faced his reckoning How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Weinstein accuser: 'No' was a trigger for him Prosecutors have asked for a prison sentence which reflects his ""lifetime of abuse towards others"" and ""lack of remorse"" for his actions. Dozens of women have come forward allegations of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Weinstein since October 2017. Weinstein consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers have said they will appeal against his convictions. Both he and the two women he was found guilty of assaulting could have the chance to speak at Wednesday's hearing, AP reports. Weinstein was convicted for two offences last month after a weeks-long trial in Manhattan. He was found guilty of a first-degree criminal sexual act charge for forcing oral sex on former production assistant Miriam Haley, also known as Mimi Haleyi, in 2006. This video can not be played Miriam Haley comments on Weinstein's guilty verdict He was also convicted of the third-degree rape of Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. The jury acquitted him of a more serious first-degree rape charge relating to Ms Mann. Jurors also cleared him of the two other counts he faced, for predatory sexual assault, which would have factored in the testimony of a third woman: actress Annabella Sciorra. Her allegation of rape, which dated back to the 1990s, was too old to be charged independently under New York law.  If Weinstein had been found guilty of the more serious predatory assault charges, he could have faced a life sentence. Wednesday's sentencing comes just days after a mound of court evidence was unsealed. US media has carried reports of the documents, which are said to include tense exchanges with his now-estranged brother and former business partner. Weinstein was remanded in custody following the guilty verdict Details also emerged of the ""red-flag list"" of people he had sent to private investigators and his apparent attempts to get help from influential figures, like Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg, as allegations against him mounted. Three additional women, outside of the New York charges, testified at Weinstein's trial to help prosecutors establish an alleged pattern of behaviour. The former movie executive still faces further criminal charges in Los Angelesover the alleged assault of two women in 2013. Investigators there also have other cases under review. Dozens have women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. The allegations helped the #MeToo movement go global, where women shared their own experiences of abuse and misconduct. The movie executive was once a titan of Hollywood, enjoying phenomenal success with Oscar winners such Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting and The King's Speech.

"Health minister tests positive for coronavirusNadine Dorries is self-isolating at home, while another MP says she has been advised to do the same.UK","Health minister and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Ms Dorries said she has been self-isolating at home. Labour MP Rachael Maskell said she has since been told to do the same as she had met Ms Dorries. The Department of Health said Ms Dorries first showed symptoms on Thursday - the same day she attended an event hosted by the prime minister. Six people with the virus have died in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases. The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old British woman has become the first person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to die in Indonesia, according to local media reports. It is not clear whether the woman - who was reportedly critically ill with multiple health conditions - died due to the virus. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it is ""supporting the family of a British woman who has died in Indonesia and are in contact with local authorities"". Thegovernment is unveiling its first Budget,amid growing fears about the impact the outbreak will have on the UK economy. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged the NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis as well as a ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" to support small and medium-sized businesses. He also said the government will meet the cost of statutory sick pay for firms with up to 250 people, and people who are self-employed and fall sick will be eligible for benefits from day one.

She also held a surgery in her constituency on Friday morning which was attended by up to 12 people, according to Steven Dixon, chair of the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association. Mr Dixon said the details of all those who attended the surgery have been passed to the NHS. The Flitwick Club, where the surgery took place, is undergoing a deep clean as a precaution. The Department of Health said ministers - including the prime minister - would not need to undergo testing as Public Health England (PHE) has assessed the risk of Ms Dorries' close contacts and only those with symptoms needed to self-isolate.

Budget 2020: What we already know,"Two Budgets this year will have a big impact on the money in our pocket - but in fact, we already know our finances are changing. Some policies have already been announced, some calculations completed, and some promises made that tell us how we will be affected. These are some of the ways in which your wages, taxes, pensions and benefits will shift in April. One of the big factors of this and upcoming Budgets is something that actually is not going to happen. The Conservative manifesto promised that during the course of this five-year parliament, there will be no rise in the rates of income tax, VAT or national insurance. So that means no increase in the proportion of our pay packet that goes to such taxes, or the tax when we buy goods and services. Clearly, if we earn more, we will pay more. There are other ways in which the chancellor can raise money from us, so some people could still end up worse off. In recent Budgets, chancellors have increased the amount we can earn before we pay tax, known as the personal allowance. This April, it will be frozen at Â£12,500 before we start paying 20% income tax. Also frozen is the Â£50,000 threshold at which people start to pay the higher 40% rate of income tax. Chancellor must raise taxes in first Budget, says IFS Your essential guide to Rishi Sunak's debut Chancellor Rishi Sunak can learn from late replacements Practically, that means anyone who gets a pay rise in the coming year may be at risk of paying more in tax, as the extra wages mean they cross these thresholds. This is known among economists as fiscal drag. If you are living in Scotland, you have different income tax rates from the rest of the UK. Changes were announced inthe recent Scottish budget. One nailed-on promise from the government was a tax breakregarding national insurance. The current threshold sees employees and the self-employed paying contributions once they earn Â£166 a week, equivalent to an annual salary of Â£8,632 a year. From April, we will start paying when we earn Â£9,500. That will mean 500,000 people will no longer have to pay this tax, according to independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Those still paying will save up to Â£85 a year. The IFS says 8% of the gains go to the poorest 20% of working households, so it is those on a decent income who may benefit the most. Over the last four years, many working-age benefits have been frozen. including Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. This policy has been one of the biggest factors squeezing the finances of millions of people during the years of austerity. The IFS says it has cut an average of Â£560 per year from the income of the country's poorest seven million families since 2016. From April, these benefitswill rise in line with the rising cost of living,external, going up by 1.7%. So, for example, child benefit for the eldest child will go up from Â£20.70 to Â£21.05 per week. There are still some cuts being introduced gradually - for example, the two-child limit on means-tested benefits and the abolition of the family premium, which sees extra financial support for the first child. There has been another delay in the full introduction of Universal Credit, the benefit that merges a number of others into one. Those on the lowest wages will be getting a pay rise in April. This has already been agreed. Many young workers will get a pay rise Those aged 25 and over will get the National Living Wage of Â£8.72 an hour, with younger workers also getting more. From April, the new rates are: The National Living Wage for ages 25 and above - up 6.2% to Â£8.72 The National Minimum Wage for 21 to 24-year-olds - up 6.5% to Â£8.20 For 18 to 20-year-olds - up 4.9% to Â£6.45 For under-18s - up 4.6% to Â£4.55 For apprentices - up 6.4% to Â£4.15 Clearly the burden of paying these higher wages is carried by employers, not the government, which should actually receive more in tax as a result. Those at the other end of the age spectrum will also get a 3.9% state pension rise. The full, new state pension will go up from Â£168.60 a week to about Â£175.20 in April. However, most pensioners get the older basic state pension, which is likely to go up from Â£129.20 to Â£134.25 per week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up. The rise is the result of the triple-lock system, which means that the state pension rises in line with inflation, earnings or 2.5% - whichever is the highest. The Conservatives have pledged to keep this in place for this term of parliament. The highly complicated way in which high earners are taxed is set to change. Basically, tax relief on pensions becomes less generous if annual income exceeds Â£150,000 a year. Some doctors have been refusing to work extra hours (and earning more) because they were being landed with bigger tax bills. They, and other high earners, are being assessed to see if they were liable once their annual salary goes over Â£110,000. The government has promised to look at the situation and there is an expectation that changes in the Budget will mean this assessment will only kick in once a standard salary exceeds Â£150,000. Many self-employed people face a higher tax bill from April, when the so-called IR35 rule is extended to the private sector. Larger private-sector employers will need to assess whether their contractors are, in fact, employees. That could mean thousands of contractors and freelancers will pay income tax, as well as national insurance at a higher rate than they do now. The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendantsfree from some inheritance taxwill enter its final stage of introduction. It will reach its target by 2021.

Five ways the Budget could help tackle coronavirus,"Small businesses can be particularly vulnerable to economic disruption A little over three weeks after becoming chancellor, Rishi Sunak is about to deliver what's become known as the ""coronavirus Budget,"" as fears grow over the impact the outbreak will have on the UK economy. He is expected to unveil a package of measures to boost everything from the NHS to struggling small businesses and the self-employed. But how much can the chancellor actually do, and will it go far enough? The NHS will get ""whatever it needs"", the chancellor said Mr Sunak has pledged that the NHS will get""whatever resources it needs""to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting he may be writing the health service a blank cheque. NHS costs are likely to soar with the extra pressure on its services. It has already had torecruit extra stafffor its 111 phone service. ""Clearly a large pool of money will be required for the NHS, bigger than the Â£400m for the winter flu crisis, so it will be a scaling up,"" says Luke Bartholomew, economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""I imagine [the money] would be allocated specifically for issues related to coronavirus, such as public health campaigns, just as much as it would be for hospital beds."" The chancellor could cut VAT rates in a bid to get us all to start spending more at the tills. VAT is a tax added to some goods and services, and currently stands at 20% for most items it applies to. But a cut in the tax ""would have limited effect"" if shoppers are determined to avoid the High Street, says Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. It would also be expensive: reducing it to 17.5%, for example, would cost HM Treasury about Â£17bn this financial year, she estimates. Luke Bartholomew agrees: ""I suspect once the worst of the crisis is over, a cut would help the economy bounce back, but it doesn't matter how much cheaper you make things if people can't leave the house."" The hospitality sector has been particularly affected by the outbreak Another option for the chancellor is to either delay or temporarily scrap business rates, a tax on firms linked to the value of their premises. ""Cashflow issues are important and business rate suspensions mean businesses could focus on paying employees,"" said Melissa Geiger of KPMG. ""It's easier for governments to help businesses by offering tax relief, rather than paying out lump sums,"" she says. Trade body UK Hospitality has written to the government asking for a three-month business rate suspension for the industry, which has been particularly badly hit by the outbreak. Hotel occupancy is down 15%, while eating and drinking out has fallen by 7% it says. Advance bookings have slumped by up to 50%. Using an existing mechanism - like business rates - to support business would be quick and effective, argues Ms Geiger. In an ""emergency Budget"" like this, ""you have to focus on the short-term"" she says. ""It's about paying more through a system you already have, rather than implementing new tax law quickly, which is very difficult."" Some workers in the gig economy are worried about missing out on payments UK employees have already started toget statutory sick pay from the first dayoff work, to help contain coronavirus. But that money is not available to the self-employed, a group of about five million people. This has led to fears that these workers may struggle to make ends meet, and that those on zero-hours contractsmay risk going into workwhen they shouldn't, helping the virus to spread. The chancellor has suggested he may announce temporary measures to support people in this position. This could include making sure benefits like universal credit and Employment and Support Allowance are available ""quickly and effectively"". It may also mean waiving requirements for sick notes or in-person benefits interviews. It's Chancellor Rishi Sunak's first Budget Cashflow is likely to be an issue for small businesses during this outbreak, as they are particularly vulnerable to sudden loss of trade, supply chain problems and a reduction in their workforce. Supporting small businesses during this time means ""introducing new, targeted measures and delivering on existing promises,"" according to the Federation of Small Businesses. It's calling for Mr Sunak to relax the requirements to apply for a ""Time to Pay"" arrangement, which allows small businesses to spread out tax payments to HMRC. The body wants the UK to follow Japan's lead by making interest-free loans available to small firms. It's also calling for smaller employers to immediately receive a rebate for any statutory sick pay they give out.

Chancellor unveils coronavirus measures,"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Kuenssberg: The chancellor's very large cheque book Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Islam: The chancellor's two Budgets Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Budget gets mixed reaction on green issues Chancellor pledges big increase to research spend In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year. A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England. He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. What questions do you have about the budget?

Health minister tests positive,"Health minister and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Ms Dorries said she has been self-isolating at home. Labour MP Rachael Maskell said she has since been told to do the same as she had met Ms Dorries. The Department of Health said Ms Dorries first showed symptoms on Thursday - the same day she attended an event hosted by the prime minister. Six people with the virus have died in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases. The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old British woman has become the first person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to die in Indonesia, according to local media reports. It is not clear whether the woman - who was reportedly critically ill with multiple health conditions - died due to the virus. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it is ""supporting the family of a British woman who has died in Indonesia and are in contact with local authorities"". Thegovernment is unveiling its first Budget,amid growing fears about the impact the outbreak will have on the UK economy. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged the NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis as well as a ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" to support small and medium-sized businesses. He also said the government will meet the cost of statutory sick pay for firms with up to 250 people, and people who are self-employed and fall sick will be eligible for benefits from day one. The Bank of England earlierannounced an emergency cut in interest ratesfrom 0.75% to 0.25% in response to the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? It is not known how many meetings Ms Dorries had attended at Westminster or in her constituency in recent days, but she was at an event at Downing Street last Thursday to mark International Women's Day. She also held a surgery in her constituency on Friday morning which was attended by up to 12 people, according to Steven Dixon, chair of the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association. Mr Dixon said the details of all those who attended the surgery have been passed to the NHS. The Flitwick Club, where the surgery took place, is undergoing a deep clean as a precaution. The Department of Health said ministers - including the prime minister - would not need to undergo testing as Public Health England (PHE) has assessed the risk of Ms Dorries' close contacts and only those with symptoms needed to self-isolate. But Labour MP Rachael Maskelltweeted she has been told by NHS 111 to self-isolate,external""as a result of a meeting"" she had with Ms Dorries last Thursday. UK virus cases rise again as sixth person dies Coronavirus in the UK: How are people responding? What's the risk on public transport? Ms Dorries, who began her career as a nurse, later tweeted it had been ""pretty rubbish but I hope I'm over the worst of it now,external"". But the 62-year-old added she was worried about her 84-year-old mother who was staying with her and began to cough on Tuesday. In other developments: The chief executive of NHS England Sir Simon Stevens announced plans to invite ""up to 18,000 third year undergraduate nurses to help out on the frontline"" NHS England isscaling up its capacity for testing peoplefor the infection. Public Health England, which has already carried out more than 25,000 coronavirus tests across the UK, is set to expand the number of people it can test a day to 10,000 - currently 1,500 are being carried out Confirmation of any positive test results will also be accelerated with most people getting a result back within 24 hours Health Secretary Matt Hancock is to give a statement to MPs at 19:00 GMT on Wednesday.

""Every hospital across the country, and the healthcare professionals who run them, are now actively planning to respond flexibly to manage new demand."" Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be expected to roll out their own testing services, but there will be some shared capacity between nations, depending on need. The number of total cases for the UK include 324 cases in England,27 in Scotland,,external16 inNorthern Ireland,externaland15 in Wales. There are 91 in London, with the next highest infected area being the south-east, with 51 cases.

The Foreign Office has warned Britons against all but essential travel to Italy, which is experiencing the worst outbreak outside China. Italy has introduced strict travel restrictions, with people being told to stay home, seek permission for essential travel, and give justification if they want to leave the country. The Foreign Office is advising anyone arriving in the UK from Italy since Monday evening to self-isolate for 14 days.

British Airways has cancelled all of its flights to and from Italy until 4 April, and has asked staff to take voluntary unpaid leave. Easyjet, Ryanair and Jet2 are also cancelling their flightson Italian routes, though EasyJet will operate ""rescue flights"" to bring British travellers home in the coming days. ""We know we'll have to go into quarantine when we get home."" ""It's the weirdest holiday I think I've ever been on,"" said Hannah Butcher, from Newbury, Berkshire, who is in Rome with her husband for their first holiday alone since having a child. ""We arrived on Sunday. The advice then was as long as you're not going into Italy's red zone, you're OK. ""We're currently sitting in a restaurant and everyone here is in staggered rows because they have to sit one metre apart. It's quite weird seeing families spread across multiple tables."" She added that people are ""only allowed to enter shops one at a time"". ""All the attractions are closed; there are queues out the door of supermarkets and the butchers. There are police driving round making sure the rules are enforced and a noticeable armed police presence, presumably to keep order."" She said they were due to fly home with Ryanair on Wednesday morning and had not been informed of any flight updates.

A family describes being tested at home and a student says she moved into a caravan on her parents' drive. We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can still follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak and other stories on the BBC News website. Here are a few key developments from today: Sometimes it takes longer to clean the room than take the test House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock says he has been advised that the degree of resistance against coronavirus for those who have recovered from it ""is deemed to be very high, especially in the first year or more afterwards"". He says it is ""good news that it is highly likely that once people have
got it and recovered then they are going to be OK"". On calls for testing for all, the UK's health secretary says the test is ""not reliable for people who are not symptomatic"". He says that is why testing at the airport, for example, is not effective and some of the countries that started doing that have stopped. There are ""loads of false positives"" with temperature testing as the person ""might be ill with something else"", he says. Or there are ""loads of false negatives... because they donât have enough virus in their system yet to be symptomatic"". ""Testing of someone who does not have symptoms is not
reliable and is counter-productive so we wonât be doing it."" The number of confirmed cases in Costa Rica has risen to 22, up from 13 that had previously been reported. Of the 22, three are foreign nationals. Health authorities have closed several schools linked with a man who has been hospitalised. Despite the rising infected count, many fervent Trump supporters in Florida say they aren't worried. Robert O'Brien, National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump, has suggested China ""covered up"" its initial outbreak, causing a two-month delay to the world's response. Speaking at an event in Washington,external, Mr O'Brien pointed to reports by Chinese nationals ""that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out"". He also praised President Trump's ""bold"" and ""courageous"" action, and said new travel restrictions on people entering the US from China had bought America six to eight weeks to prepare. The coronavirus outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The city's residents have now been on lockdown for more than 50 days. Despite the isolation, people are still trying to keep busy. The Europa League has been ""devalued"" by playing matches behind closed doors, says Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz before his side take on Rangers. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The use of the p-word by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
describe the global spread of this new coronavirus is not a huge surprise. Up until now, it has talked merely of the ""threat"" or the ""potential"" for a pandemic. But with cases in more than 100 countries, and increasing
numbers not linked to travel, the language has changed. The WHO no longer ""declares"" a pandemic the way it used to,
so this is as official as it gets. Yet this doesnât mean the pandemic cannot be controlled, it
explains. Itâs a call to action and a plea for all countries not to
give up, no matter how large the number of cases. Practically, countries are being told to continue to do what
they have been advised to do. That means some may have to step up their
response. But the WHO is not changing what itâs doing or the threat
level of the virus. What the use of the word ""pandemic"" highlights is the
importance of countries around the world taking urgent action to respond to
their own outbreaks â because now itâs everyoneâs responsibility to turn the
tide on the virus. House of CommonsParliament In the UK's House of Commons, Mr Hancock continues: ""We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we
expect numbers to continue to rise after that. ""And the peak would be in a matter
of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. ""This is a
marathon and not a sprint."" He says that the fact the World Health Organization is now calling the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic ""does indicate that they think that this virus will spread right across the world"". His statement comes after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 - the biggest rise in a single day. Read more in our story here The Italian governmentâs decision
to put the whole country in lockdown has prompted 200 student volunteers in the
northern region of Veneto to âadoptâ residents who need help going to the
supermarket or pharmacy. Our reporter Sira Thierij spoke with some of the volunteers. âWhen our cities were shut down
by the government, we were really concerned about people who cannot take care
of themselves, elderly people, but also immuno-suppressed ones and others who
could be more vulnerable to infection,â says Tommaso Biancuzzi, who came up
with the idea. The lockdown means movement in
and out of cities is severely restricted. Shops and cafes may be open but there
is no nightlife and Italians have been told they need a valid work or family
reason to travel. âThis is an emergency with no
precedent in the history of our country,â he told the BBC. âOf course itâs
important to follow the rules and directions given by the health institutions,
but we think it's also crucial to preserve solidarity and compassion.â The volunteers know the risks
involved and visit the elderly and the sick wearing face masks and latex
gloves. âSometimes young people are
considered lazy, but we really care,â says Mr Biancuzzi. House of CommonsParliament The UK's Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs that Parliament will remain openafter an MP tested positive for coronavirus. ""Of course in some ways this House may have to function differently, but the ability to hold government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times,"" he said. Mr Hancock said the public ""will expect Parliament to sit"" and that their approach ""will be guided by the best scientific evidence and medical advice"". A cross-party parliamentary group was meeting daily to
assess the situation, he added. He said he would meet the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, on Thursday morning to discuss an emergency bill that would include measures to keep ""vital public services running"". ""I know how worrying this is, I know people have deep concerns, I know everyone will play their partâ¦ the best way to beat it if for us to work
together,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We will do whatever it takes. We will give the NHS everything it needs.""   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day. It came as two more people with the virus died in the UK, bringing the total number of deaths to eight. One was described as being in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, while the other was elderly and had a number of serious health conditions. Two other Britons have died abroad after contracting the virus. The latest, on Wednesday, was a 53-year-old woman in Bali. Another man also died in Japan last month after contracting the disease aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Share markets in the US have moved sharply lower on Wednesday in another day of jittery trade, driven by fears about the economic impact of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones was down nearly 5% at midday trade in New York, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 4%. London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4%, while other European markets saw more modest falls. The falls come as countries rush to approve spending to shield economies from reduced activity resulting from measures to halt the progress of the virus. Read more here. Health authorities in Croatia have confirmed a further three people in the country have tested positive for coronavirus. All three had recently traveled from Austria and Germany. This brings the total number of cases in Croatia to 19. The government has announced a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people, but ruled out economic intervention for now. From the Olympic women's football qualifiers getting moved from Wuhan on 22 January to Arsenal and Manchester City's Premier League tie getting postponed today, the coronavirus has affected huge swathes of the sporting world. Here's a timelinedetailing all the events hit by the outbreak. Iran's Fars news agency reports that First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri has contracted the virus. In his role, Mr Jahangiri leads Cabinet meetings in the absence of the president, and is the most senior government figure to catch the virus. He has recently been absent from several top-level meetings, and there has been speculation about the state of his health. Two other cabinet members have also tested positive for the disease, according to Fars: Cultural Minister Ali Asghar Mounesan and Reza Rahmani, minister of industry, mines and business. They are among the many Iranian officials and politicians who have been infected in recent weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Chancellor unveils coronavirus measuresCoronavirus is likely to bring a ""temporary disruption"" to the UK economy but ""we will get through this together"", says the chancellor as he delivers his Budget.UK Politics","This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024.

Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus.

The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn.

A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024.

He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU.

Budget 2020: The economy must be vaccinated,"Whether it's ""catching a cold"" or ""contagion"", chancellors have long used virology as an analogy to describe the impact of external events on our economy. This time, at this moment, the virus and its impact is very real. In his first Budget, Rishi Sunak must swap his famous red Budget box for a medical kit of parts to vaccinate the economy from coronavirus. There was no Budget in 2019 and it is difficult to convey just how extraordinary this first Budget of 2020 will be. Even a fortnight ago, the plan was a Budget to launch a parliament of post-Brexit renewal. A significant shift in economic policy and primarily in tax-and-spend - fiscal policy - in order to provide a detailed long-term plan for infrastructure investment across the nation. Now the focus is firmly on the short-term economic and health challenge of coronavirus. Firstly, the numbers in the Office for Budget Responsibility's fiscal report are already out-of-date before the document is even published. This is no fault of the authorities. Rarely can growth, borrowing, oil price, stock market and government borrowing cost forecasts have changed so rapidly and so close to a Budget event. Coronavirus economics will be dealt with in a separate box, but the substance of the forecast is the world as it was a fortnight ago, rather than the one the chancellor faces on Wednesday. The numbers in the OBR book will represent a measure of normality, an aim, perhaps even a best-case scenario. Should we expect a coronavirus Budget? Your essential guide to the Budget There will be an assessment of the potential impact on the economy. The OECD says there will be a 0.2% hit just from the global growth slowdown. As that gets higher, so will the justification for considerable firepower to keep the economy turning through a virus containment pause. The response will need to be calibrated to the degree of disruption, but I expect the chancellor to outline the thinking behind the economic support: that however bad the virus gets here, and however much the economic cost of dealing with it, it will be temporary, and viable businesses should be given a bridge to the other side that helps them keep their employees, helps their cash flow, and enables them to thrive when things return to normal. The plan needs to be comprehensive: hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. So expect significant funding for the health system, help for companies dealing with prolonged sickness absence, and joint guarantees with the Bank of England for banks to keep lending and extend overdrafts to people and to business. The Treasury always ponders some forms of cut to VAT at times like this, because it's ""timely, temporary and targeted"" - the quickest way to inject cash into people's wallets. But the answer may equally come in the way in which retailers pay their VAT. Either way, public spending will be higher and tax receipts lower. The Treasury does not want to lose sight of the medium and long term, however. It had already been decided that this Budget should be seen as part of a trilogy of ""fiscal events"" to deliver the government's ""levelling up"" agenda: this Budget, the Autumn Budget and a Comprehensive Spending Review of departmental spending. Coronavirus has put paid to austerity in the short term In fact, make that a four-parter.As I reported last week, the detailed plan on capital spending, the National Infrastructure Review, will be delayed for a month or two, to provide the chancellor a chance to review it, particularly as regards net zero commitments. That is a difference that has emerged because of the change of chancellor. Sajid Javid was ready to publish this week. What we will get instead is the start of a process on infrastructure. There will be some early allocations of capital investment. There will be the start of a review of the investment appraisal methodology, the Green Book, which many feel overly favours investment in London. But we will also get an overall envelope on capital investment, showing the highest sustained capital investment since the 1970s, and above the long-run post-war investment average of 2.7% of GDP. It will also be above not just the average, but peak net investment under New Labour. This is a huge amount of money. The signal from government borrowing markets is that they want governments with space to spend, to do so. But it was clear that under Sajid Javid's fiscal rules, the 3% number was seen as a limit on investment, a maximum, rather than a target. If confirmed, that does appear to be more spending than planned by his predecessor. It will be couched in terms of short-term stimulus and medium and long-term ""levelling up"". On the latter, however, it is the start of a process that will last a few months more yet and might also be complicated by the coronavirus. The main political point here will be to deliver, line by line, on the winning Conservative manifesto, especially for the ""borrowed votes"" in the Red Wall. Indeed, I'm told that immediately after being appointed to Number 11, the new chancellor was advised to delay the Budget, but spent the weekend looking at what was required and decided to push ahead. It will be a personal challenge. Any inhabitant of Number 11 needs to assert control of the public finances, to convince markets of their credibility. The coronavirus means that departing from fiscal rules outlined by his predecessor just four months ago is less controversial than it was. The election ended the need for austerity long-term. Coronavirus means the opposite of austerity short-term too. Should we expect a coronavirus Budget?

House of CommonsParliament Labour's Rachel Hopkins tells MPs that Luton food banks gave away 359 food parcels in December last year. She says that while employment has gone down ""more people are in low-paid insecure jobs"". ""Would the PM agree with me that it is wholly unacceptable that families are in work but children are growing up in poverty,"" she asks. Boris Johnson replies that his government is ""lifting up the national minimum wage by the biggest ever increase"". ""That will benefit people across this country to the tune of Â£4,000 a year,"" he adds. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Naz Shah picks up on therenewed callfrom the Muslim Council of Britain for the UK's equalities watchdog to launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. She asks for an assurance about ""what he is doing to assure Britain's Muslims that their prime minister is not an Islamophobe and takes their concerns seriously"". Boris Johnson replies that there is ""absolutely no room"" for racism in his party. ""I wish I could say the same of her own party,"" he adds. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Julian Lewis says there are an ""estimated 265 war widows - whose pensions were cancelled when they remarried and can only be restored by going through a divorce and remarriage to their second husbands.""

House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford also asks about sick pay for people who are told to stay away from work due to the coronavirus. He asks what the statutory sick rate pay is in Ireland, compared to the UK. Boris Johnson says it is not his ""duty"" to compare rates but says those on universal credit will ""get they help they need from day one"". In a follow-up, Mr Blackford says the Irish government has raised sick pay to Â£266 per week, and notes that it covers those who are self-employed, but is Â£94.25 a week in the UK. He asks for a commitment that it will go up to the average EU level. Mr Johnson says the UK has an ""extensive"" benefits system and the NHS is ""very well managed"". House of CommonsParliament Mr Corbyn uses his last question to accuse the prime minister of making ""offensive"" comments about single mothers, Muslim women and working women. ""His words are backed up by offensive and discriminatory polices,"" says the Labour leader. He asks the PM to apologise and ""ensure these policies are reversed by the government"". The PM hits back: ""I am proud about what this government has done to promote the rights of women."" He adds that the Conservatives are ""the only party that has produced not one but two women prime ministers"". ""Wouldn't it be amazing if that party [Labour] would produce a female leader of its own - don't hold your breath."" House of CommonsParliament Jeremy Corbyn says the gender pay gap is ""too wide"" and says the government should do more about it. He asks the PM to give councils an extra Â£173m a year to provide support to the victims of domestic violence, which he says could go up if people are self-isolating with the coronavirus. The prime minister says the government has an ""outstanding"" record in taking action against women and girls. House of CommonsParliament Jeremy Corbyn now asks about the gender pay gap. He says women are still paid 17% less than men and asks why the government has not committed to closing the gender pay gap by 2030.

""What we want to see is a uniting and levelling up across the country,"" he adds. House of CommonsParliament Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pays tribute to the six people who have
so far died from the coronavirus, and gives his best wishes to Health Minister Nadine Dorries, who has been diagnosed
with the virus. For his opening question, Mr Corbyn asks the PM to guarantee ""emergency legislation"" to guarantee sick pay for those on zero-hours contracts who stay at home because of the virus. In reply, the prime minister says the government has already taken action to bring sick pay forward. He pledges that people on ""all types of contracts"" will get the ""protection they need,"" and people should not be penalised for staying at home.

We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can still follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak and other stories on the BBC News website. Here are a few key developments from today: Sometimes it takes longer to clean the room than take the test House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock says he has been advised that the degree of resistance against coronavirus for those who have recovered from it ""is deemed to be very high, especially in the first year or more afterwards"". He says it is ""good news that it is highly likely that once people have
got it and recovered then they are going to be OK"". On calls for testing for all, the UK's health secretary says the test is ""not reliable for people who are not symptomatic"". He says that is why testing at the airport, for example, is not effective and some of the countries that started doing that have stopped. There are ""loads of false positives"" with temperature testing as the person ""might be ill with something else"", he says. Or there are ""loads of false negatives... because they donât have enough virus in their system yet to be symptomatic"". ""Testing of someone who does not have symptoms is not
reliable and is counter-productive so we wonât be doing it."" The number of confirmed cases in Costa Rica has risen to 22, up from 13 that had previously been reported. Of the 22, three are foreign nationals. Health authorities have closed several schools linked with a man who has been hospitalised. Despite the rising infected count, many fervent Trump supporters in Florida say they aren't worried. Robert O'Brien, National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump, has suggested China ""covered up"" its initial outbreak, causing a two-month delay to the world's response. Speaking at an event in Washington,external, Mr O'Brien pointed to reports by Chinese nationals ""that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out"". He also praised President Trump's ""bold"" and ""courageous"" action, and said new travel restrictions on people entering the US from China had bought America six to eight weeks to prepare. The coronavirus outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The city's residents have now been on lockdown for more than 50 days. Despite the isolation, people are still trying to keep busy. The Europa League has been ""devalued"" by playing matches behind closed doors, says Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz before his side take on Rangers. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The use of the p-word by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
describe the global spread of this new coronavirus is not a huge surprise. Up until now, it has talked merely of the ""threat"" or the ""potential"" for a pandemic. But with cases in more than 100 countries, and increasing
numbers not linked to travel, the language has changed. The WHO no longer ""declares"" a pandemic the way it used to,
so this is as official as it gets. Yet this doesnât mean the pandemic cannot be controlled, it
explains. Itâs a call to action and a plea for all countries not to
give up, no matter how large the number of cases. Practically, countries are being told to continue to do what
they have been advised to do. That means some may have to step up their
response. But the WHO is not changing what itâs doing or the threat
level of the virus. What the use of the word ""pandemic"" highlights is the
importance of countries around the world taking urgent action to respond to
their own outbreaks â because now itâs everyoneâs responsibility to turn the
tide on the virus. House of CommonsParliament In the UK's House of Commons, Mr Hancock continues: ""We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we
expect numbers to continue to rise after that. ""And the peak would be in a matter
of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. ""This is a
marathon and not a sprint."" He says that the fact the World Health Organization is now calling the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic ""does indicate that they think that this virus will spread right across the world"". His statement comes after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 - the biggest rise in a single day. Read more in our story here The Italian governmentâs decision
to put the whole country in lockdown has prompted 200 student volunteers in the
northern region of Veneto to âadoptâ residents who need help going to the
supermarket or pharmacy. Our reporter Sira Thierij spoke with some of the volunteers. âWhen our cities were shut down
by the government, we were really concerned about people who cannot take care
of themselves, elderly people, but also immuno-suppressed ones and others who
could be more vulnerable to infection,â says Tommaso Biancuzzi, who came up
with the idea. The lockdown means movement in
and out of cities is severely restricted. Shops and cafes may be open but there
is no nightlife and Italians have been told they need a valid work or family
reason to travel. âThis is an emergency with no
precedent in the history of our country,â he told the BBC. âOf course itâs
important to follow the rules and directions given by the health institutions,
but we think it's also crucial to preserve solidarity and compassion.â The volunteers know the risks
involved and visit the elderly and the sick wearing face masks and latex
gloves. âSometimes young people are
considered lazy, but we really care,â says Mr Biancuzzi. House of CommonsParliament The UK's Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs that Parliament will remain openafter an MP tested positive for coronavirus. ""Of course in some ways this House may have to function differently, but the ability to hold government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times,"" he said. Mr Hancock said the public ""will expect Parliament to sit"" and that their approach ""will be guided by the best scientific evidence and medical advice"". A cross-party parliamentary group was meeting daily to
assess the situation, he added. He said he would meet the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, on Thursday morning to discuss an emergency bill that would include measures to keep ""vital public services running"". ""I know how worrying this is, I know people have deep concerns, I know everyone will play their partâ¦ the best way to beat it if for us to work
together,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We will do whatever it takes. We will give the NHS everything it needs.""   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day. It came as two more people with the virus died in the UK, bringing the total number of deaths to eight. One was described as being in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, while the other was elderly and had a number of serious health conditions. Two other Britons have died abroad after contracting the virus. The latest, on Wednesday, was a 53-year-old woman in Bali. Another man also died in Japan last month after contracting the disease aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Share markets in the US have moved sharply lower on Wednesday in another day of jittery trade, driven by fears about the economic impact of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones was down nearly 5% at midday trade in New York, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 4%. London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4%, while other European markets saw more modest falls. The falls come as countries rush to approve spending to shield economies from reduced activity resulting from measures to halt the progress of the virus. Read more here. Health authorities in Croatia have confirmed a further three people in the country have tested positive for coronavirus. All three had recently traveled from Austria and Germany. This brings the total number of cases in Croatia to 19. The government has announced a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people, but ruled out economic intervention for now. From the Olympic women's football qualifiers getting moved from Wuhan on 22 January to Arsenal and Manchester City's Premier League tie getting postponed today, the coronavirus has affected huge swathes of the sporting world. Here's a timelinedetailing all the events hit by the outbreak. Iran's Fars news agency reports that First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri has contracted the virus. In his role, Mr Jahangiri leads Cabinet meetings in the absence of the president, and is the most senior government figure to catch the virus. He has recently been absent from several top-level meetings, and there has been speculation about the state of his health. Two other cabinet members have also tested positive for the disease, according to Fars: Cultural Minister Ali Asghar Mounesan and Reza Rahmani, minister of industry, mines and business. They are among the many Iranian officials and politicians who have been infected in recent weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sunak: We will get through coronavirus togetherCoronavirus is likely to bring a ""temporary disruption"" to the UK economy but ""we will get through this together"", says the chancellor as he delivers his Budget.","This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Kuenssberg: The chancellor's very large cheque book Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Islam: The chancellor's two Budgets Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Budget gets mixed reaction on green issues Chancellor pledges big increase to research spend In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year. A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England. He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU.

Budget to be unveiled amid coronavirus pressures,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is preparing to unveil his first Budget amid continued pressure from the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Sunak will present his economic plans to MPs in the Commons at 12:30 GMT, less than a month after taking over at the Treasury. Some elements have already been revealed, includingmore than Â£600bn for infrastructure projects over five yearsandextra money for potholes. But the economic challenge posed by the virusis still expected to dominate. The Bank of England has announced an emergency cutin interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25% in a bid to support the economy during the virus outbreak. Speaking at the cabinet meeting ahead of the Budget, Mr Sunak said his plan would make the UK ""one of the best placed economies in the world to manage the potential impact of the virus"". Live Budget day updates from the Commons Budget 2020: The economy must be vaccinated What should we make of Conservative spending promises? Your essential guide to the Budget The number of coronavirus cases in the UK reached 382 on Tuesday, a rise of 63 since the previous day, with a sixth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. Mr Sunak has previously saidthe NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisisand that he is looking at extra financial help for individuals and businesses who are left out of pocket. The Budget also comes in a week in which shares around the world - already hit by fears about coronavirus - suffered some of their biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis. Dubbed ""Black Monday"", indexes tumbled as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge, with declines in London wiping some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. This video can not be played Budget 2020: What is Johnson-omics? On the eve of the Budget announcements, the Treasury pledged to triple the average net investment made over the last 40 years into rail and road, affordable housing, broadband and research. It said this would lead to the ""highest levels [of investment] in real terms since 1955"" - more than Â£600bn over the five-year Parliament - and be targeted ""in every region and nation of the UK"". Mr Sunak said: ""We have listened and will now deliver on our promise to level up the UK, ensuring everyone has the same chances and opportunities in life, wherever they live. ""By investing historic amounts in British innovation and world-class infrastructure, we will rebalance opportunities and lay the foundations for a decade of growth for everybody."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell called the figures ""exaggerated claims"", adding: ""Boris Johnson has a track record of boastful claims followed by non delivery and it looks like he is running true to form."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the decision marked a significant increase in the amount of spending on capital projects compared with the period since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. However, she said it wasnot yet clear whether the government would stick to its own fiscal rulesset out in its manifesto. And she said the spread of the virus means that the Treasury's spreadsheets and sums that had been prepared for the Budget are now completely out of date. The government is also set to pledgeÂ£2.5bn to fixing potholes in Englandas part of the Budget. The Treasury said the money would also be available to local authorities to start resurfacing works, preventing potholes from appearing in the first place. But Mr McDonnell said the policy was part of a ""gimmicky grab-bag of projects"". Wednesday's Budget will also be the first time a woman has chaired the proceedings in the Commons' history. Dame Eleanor Laing will make history as the first woman to chair the Commons during the Budget Dame Eleanor Laing was elected as the House's first woman chairman of ways and means in January - the most senior deputy speaker - who traditionally oversees the Budget. She said she ""probably will be a bit nervous"" on the day, but said, with a new chancellor in post as well, ""we will all be newbies"".

Chancellor unveiling coronavirus Budget,"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Kuenssberg: The chancellor's very large cheque book Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn.

A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England. He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. What questions do you have about the budget?

What the rate cut means for you,"Two emergency cuts in interest rates have been announced by the Bank of England within days of each other in response to the financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee first cut the so-called base rate from 0.75% to 0.25% on 11 March, only then to reduce it again to 0.1% on 19 March,pushing it to its lowest level in history. The Bank has also pumped more money into the economy. This benchmark Bank rate is used by banks and other financial institutions as a guide to what they pay savers or charge some borrowers. The sudden cut in the Bank rate will immediately reduce the mortgage bill of a minority of homeowners. Little will change for savers, who have had endure years of low returns anyway. As well as concern over your physical health from coronavirus, your financial health will primarily depend on your job. This emergency action by the Bank - alongside government action such as the guarantee for billions of pounds in loans - is clearly designed to help protect businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones. In turn, this will be key to the employment of millions of people. Some homeowners' mortgage repayments are directly affected by any move in the Bank of England's base rate. These are people on so-called tracker rates, which follow - or track - changes to the Bank rate. They represent about 11% of the outstanding mortgages in the UK. The rate cut immediately means their mortgage will become cheaper. For someone who has a Â£100,000 mortgage balance to pay over 25 years, both cuts should mean their mortgage gets about Â£30 cheaper each month, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. Other borrowers are on variable rate mortgages and, often, the amount they pay every month can be changed by their provider in response to the Bank's decision on the base rate. They must wait to see how their home loan provider reacts at a time when mortgage rates are already at very low levels. Relatively little of these rate changes are feeding through. About 16% of UK mortgages fall into this bracket, according to UK Finance, which represents mortgage providers. This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The majority of homeowners are on a fixed-rate mortgage, so they will see no change, but potentially they may find interest rates look a bit more attractive when it comes to remortgaging. That said, a lot may happen in the meantime that could affect the rates on offer in two to five years' time. The Bank's rate cuts are only designed to be temporary, to tackle the coronavirus impact, so rates could easily rise again by then. There is also a possibility that personal loans, often taken out for a new car or home improvements, may get a little cheaper. Banks and credit card companies are also able to defer repayments given the current crisis, although you must contact them to get this agreement in place. Ever since the financial crisis a decade ago, savers have seen relatively small returns for putting cash aside. Some people who have lived off the income from life savings have been particularly affected. They may take heart from the fact that this latest cut is a temporary measure from the Bank. Banks told to stop short-changing loyal savers Why a timely nudge might help us save money Three months after an interest rate cut of 0.25 percentage points in 2016, the typical interest on an easy access savings account fell by 0.14 of a percentage point, according to Moneyfacts. So, not all of the rate cut may be seen in savers' rates. A total of 40 million people in the UK have easy access savings accounts, but only 10% of them - primarily pensioners with large life savings pots - move them around to different accounts to make the most of the best interest rates on the market. With the Bank pumping more money into the economy, there is also less incentive for banks to offer decent rates to savers to win deposits that they can then lend out to others.

UK interest rates cut in emergency moveThe Bank of England cuts rates to the lowest level in history amid the coronavirus outbreak.,"This video can not be played Governor Mark Carney says the action will provide relief ""at a difficult time"" The Bank of England has announced an emergency cut in interest rates to shore up the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak. Policymakers reduced rates from 0.75% to 0.25%, taking borrowing costs back down to the lowest level in history. The Bank said it would also free up billions of pounds of extra lending power to help banks support firms. It comes as the chancellor is expected to announce further measures to support growth and jobs in the Budget later. Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, said policymakers had seen a ""sharp fall in trading conditions"", including spending on non-essential goods. ""The Bank of England's role is to help UK businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large and sharp, but should be temporary,"" he said. Live: Follow latest from the Budget He said the Bank's co-ordinated action on Budget day was designed to have ""maximum impact"". Mr Carney stressed that the economic damage caused by the coronavirus remained unclear. However, he suggested that the UK economy could shrink in the coming months. He said early evidence from China suggested that the world's second largest economy was on course to contract in the first quarter. Other nations were experiencing a ""similar shift"", he said. ""I would emphasise the direction is clear, though the orders of magnitude are still to be determined."" While the Bank's last emergency rate cut was in October 2008, Mr Carney said the virus was unlikely to inflict the damage seen during the financial crisis. ""There is no reason for it to be as bad as 2008 if we act as we have, and if there is that targeted support,"" he said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? The emergency rate cut comes as a sixth person died from the virus in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases. The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions. Meanwhile,Manchester City's Premier League match against Arsenalon Wednesday has been postponed as ""a precautionary measure"" because of the outbreak. A number of Arsenal players are in self-isolation after coming into contact with Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who tested positive for the virus.. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to help the UK battle the impact of the coronavirus, saying the NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis, while he is also expectedto unveil measures to boost the self-employed and small businesseswho are left out of pocket. Meanwhile, NHS England said it wasscaling up its capacity for testing peoplefor the infection, with the number of cases set to rise. The sudden cut in the Bank rate will immediately reduce the mortgage bill of a minority of homeowners. Others will have to wait to see how their home loan provider reacts at a time when mortgage rates are already at very low levels. Little will change for savers, who have had to endure years of low returns anyway. They may take heart from the fact this is a temporary measure from the Bank. Most people are, of course, savers and borrowers. As well as concern over their physical health from coronavirus, their financial health will primarily depend on their job. This emergency action is clearly designed to help protect businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, and in turn the employment of millions of people. What the rate cut means for you The interest rate cut was part of a package of measures introduced by the Bank to support the economy. It also announced a new Â£100bn scheme to help ensure households and businesses - particularly small and medium-sized firms - benefit from the reduction in interest rates. The Bank of England said other changes would free up an additional Â£190bn for banks to lend. It said the package of measures would ""help UK businesses and households bridge across the economic disruption that is likely to be associated with Covid-19"". The Bank said it expected UK economic activity to ""weaken materially"" over the coming months, but it was ready to take ""all further necessary steps to support the UK economy"". ""These measures will help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm."" Initially, the pound fell against both the euro and the dollar in reaction to the rate cut, but then rebounded. Share markets reacted positively, with the FTSE 100 rising more than 2% in early trading. Separatedata published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalshowed the UK economy stagnated in the three months to January. The dramatic emergency rate cut will dominate the headlines, but it is the overall package of measures which the departing Bank of England governor Mark Carney will stress as a support for the economy in this extraordinary coronavirus crisis. The key target of this move is the cashflow of small and medium-sized businesses, which could be hit by a combination of slumping demand, trade difficulties and staff absence. The Bank and Treasury agree that this will be a temporary shock. The aim, therefore, is to prevent unnecessary permanent economic scars. Alongside Budget measures, it is designed as a bridge beyond the virus. So the Bank's base rate is slashed to its record low, first reached in the aftermath of the EU referendum. But as important is the new TFSME - the ""Term Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". This proved rather successful after the EU referendum, and the aim is to get the banks to pass on the rate cut in full to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized firms, which face the greatest pressure to cut staff or hours in a crisis. Cutting the amount of money that banks are required to squirrel away when the sun is shining so they can spend the cash during this sort of rainy day should provide the firepower for banks to boost lending well above current lending levels. To be clear, coronavirus is unique and highly unpredictable. There is a fundamental problem of people and businesses not being able to function because of the measures to contain the virus. The message from the Bank is that the banking system is fully padded up to help businesses get through this. What are your experiences relating to the coronavirus outbreak?

Budget: 'First-time buyers need more help',"Whether renting or paying a mortgage, under-35s are more concerned about housing than just about any other financial issue. Members of the BBC's Affordable Living group on Facebook were asked what they wanted to see for young people in Wednesday's Budget - and the answer came back loud and clear. ""Rent controls and more tax on buy-to-let properties,"" said James. ""Then put that toward helping people buy their own house."" Sarah echoed the call for controls on rents, saying: ""Really annoys me that hard-up young people are paying for their landlords' lifestyles."" Trushar called for the abolition of leasehold properties, which have recently been the focus ofan investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. He said that ""would literally be the best thing Boris can do for young people"", adding: ""I can't consider buying a house whose value drops the moment I purchase and is full of unfair covenants."" One would-be first-time buyer who would like to get a helping hand from Wednesday's Budget is 29-year-old Andre Armenian, who wants to buy a property with his fiancÃ©e SiÃ¢n Webb. The couple have been saving money by living about 35 miles apart in their parents' houses - him in St Albans, Hertfordshire, her in Romford, Essex. Andre told the BBC: ""I appreciate that there is only so much in the way of measures that can be applied to the housing market so as to maintain a healthy balance of demand and supply. However, something needs to be done to address the growing challenge facing first-time buyers. ""A revised version of the Help to Buy Isa would be a good start, one with more realistic house value caps. Under the previous scheme, I believe properties outside of London could only be worth up to Â£250,000 in order to be eligible for Help to Buy, which, if you're only just outside the M25, isn't very much money. ""Young people are having to buy properties further and further out from the towns and cities they work in, as these tend to be a little cheaper. ""Introducing some travel discounts or rail cards for first-time home owners, who have already laboured to get onto the first rung of the housing ladder, would help ease their financial burden."" However, it appears unlikely that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil a major package of housing-related measures in the Budget. Whitehall sources have made clear that the government's financial priorities are based on delivering on the Conservatives' election manifesto promises. And the main plank of its housing strategy in that document was to continue progress towards its target of 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s. Iona Bain is founder of the Young Money Blog As forrent controls, they featured in the Labour party's manifesto, but have never been embraced by the Conservatives. Financial commentator Iona Bain, founder ofthe Young Money Blog,external, said the Budget should contain measures to shake up the housing market and help young people. However, she feared it would be ""business as usual"", with more ""vague promises to build more houses that are not going to cut the mustard"". She told the BBC: ""We've still not seen the kind of ambitious radical reform that will allow young people to get on the housing ladder."" Ms Bain said that unlike many other younger people, she had managed to buy her own property, but was now ""staying put"" with no chance of moving to a larger place: ""That's the way it is now for first-time buyers."" She called for measures to make the housing market ""more transparent and functional"", including laws to stop developers sitting on land that had been approved for housebuilding while its value rose. She also pointed out that new homes were often built in areas with no amenities and poor transport links, making them undesirable for young people. ""They've got to be the right homes in the right area at the right prices,"" she said. Sajid Javid, who resigned as chancellor last month after a row over merging his team with No 10's advisers, has said he would have reduced stamp duty, which is a tax paid on most properties purchased in England or Northern Ireland, if he had stayed on to deliver the Budget. But property consultancy BuyAssociation reckons Mr Sunak is unlikely to follow suit. ""Despite pressure on the government to use its powers to boost the housing market and encourage investment, a general stamp duty cut seems unlikely,"" it says.

Five ways the Budget could help tackle coronavirusVideoVideoBudget 2020: What is Johnson-omics?Budget: 'First-time buyers need more help',"Small businesses can be particularly vulnerable to economic disruption A little over three weeks after becoming chancellor, Rishi Sunak is about to deliver what's become known as the ""coronavirus Budget,"" as fears grow over the impact the outbreak will have on the UK economy. He is expected to unveil a package of measures to boost everything from the NHS to struggling small businesses and the self-employed. But how much can the chancellor actually do, and will it go far enough? The NHS will get ""whatever it needs"", the chancellor said Mr Sunak has pledged that the NHS will get""whatever resources it needs""to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting he may be writing the health service a blank cheque. NHS costs are likely to soar with the extra pressure on its services. It has already had torecruit extra stafffor its 111 phone service. ""Clearly a large pool of money will be required for the NHS, bigger than the Â£400m for the winter flu crisis, so it will be a scaling up,"" says Luke Bartholomew, economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""I imagine [the money] would be allocated specifically for issues related to coronavirus, such as public health campaigns, just as much as it would be for hospital beds."" The chancellor could cut VAT rates in a bid to get us all to start spending more at the tills. VAT is a tax added to some goods and services, and currently stands at 20% for most items it applies to. But a cut in the tax ""would have limited effect"" if shoppers are determined to avoid the High Street, says Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. It would also be expensive: reducing it to 17.5%, for example, would cost HM Treasury about Â£17bn this financial year, she estimates. Luke Bartholomew agrees: ""I suspect once the worst of the crisis is over, a cut would help the economy bounce back, but it doesn't matter how much cheaper you make things if people can't leave the house."" The hospitality sector has been particularly affected by the outbreak Another option for the chancellor is to either delay or temporarily scrap business rates, a tax on firms linked to the value of their premises. ""Cashflow issues are important and business rate suspensions mean businesses could focus on paying employees,"" said Melissa Geiger of KPMG. ""It's easier for governments to help businesses by offering tax relief, rather than paying out lump sums,"" she says. Trade body UK Hospitality has written to the government asking for a three-month business rate suspension for the industry, which has been particularly badly hit by the outbreak. Hotel occupancy is down 15%, while eating and drinking out has fallen by 7% it says. Advance bookings have slumped by up to 50%. Using an existing mechanism - like business rates - to support business would be quick and effective, argues Ms Geiger. In an ""emergency Budget"" like this, ""you have to focus on the short-term"" she says. ""It's about paying more through a system you already have, rather than implementing new tax law quickly, which is very difficult."" Some workers in the gig economy are worried about missing out on payments UK employees have already started toget statutory sick pay from the first dayoff work, to help contain coronavirus. But that money is not available to the self-employed, a group of about five million people. This has led to fears that these workers may struggle to make ends meet, and that those on zero-hours contractsmay risk going into workwhen they shouldn't, helping the virus to spread. The chancellor has suggested he may announce temporary measures to support people in this position. This could include making sure benefits like universal credit and Employment and Support Allowance are available ""quickly and effectively"". It may also mean waiving requirements for sick notes or in-person benefits interviews. It's Chancellor Rishi Sunak's first Budget Cashflow is likely to be an issue for small businesses during this outbreak, as they are particularly vulnerable to sudden loss of trade, supply chain problems and a reduction in their workforce. Supporting small businesses during this time means ""introducing new, targeted measures and delivering on existing promises,"" according to the Federation of Small Businesses. It's calling for Mr Sunak to relax the requirements to apply for a ""Time to Pay"" arrangement, which allows small businesses to spread out tax payments to HMRC. The body wants the UK to follow Japan's lead by making interest-free loans available to small firms. It's also calling for smaller employers to immediately receive a rebate for any statutory sick pay they give out.

What should we make of Conservative spending promises?,"If you wondered what the government's new buzz phrase of 'levelling up' was meant to mean, the Conservatives will try to provide the answer tomorrow. In his first budget, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will commit to the biggest increase on spending on capital - roads, rail, research - that there has been in generations. He's expected to promise to sign a hypothetical cheque of more than Â£600bn of gross public sector investment, to be cashed by the middle of 2025, we understand. And the Treasury tonight claims it will push public investment in real terms to levels not seen since 1955. It's wise to be careful with the historical claims. The economy is totally different to that era. Chancellor promises 'record' infrastructure Budget Budget 2020: The economy must be vaccinated Your essential guide to the Budget As with any Budget, the words in black and white in the Treasury documents tomorrow, the final numbers in the columns matter enormously, and more of course, than the preloaded political messaging. It's worth noting too, that public sector investment is normally counted in the 'net', not the 'gross' figure, which makes the numbers sound more impressive. And more than anything else, remember capital spending on shiny new projects is not the same as day-to-day spending on schools, prisons, hospitals and other vital public services. Promising big bucks for big projects won't make the very real strain on some public services go away. But tomorrow will represent a notable and significant gear-change in the kind of levels of investment spending we have seen in recent decades, certainly since the period when Margaret Thatcher was in charge - if, of course, the government manages to find enough projects that are ready and waiting to receive the cash and they can get it out of the door. Labour is already out tonight saying, 'we've heard it all before'. The new resident of No 11 will also confirm that the Treasury will change the way it calculates the benefit of public spending - to include how it spreads wealth around the country, not how much it contributes in total. That sounds academic, but it matters a lot. Government number crunchers will no longer just be looking at the national bottom line when considering whether projects are good value for the taxpayers' money, but how it affects the economy around the country. Conservative strategists hope tomorrow will mark a down payment to voters who turned to their party for the first time at the election in December. But some parts of the public sector will still feel the pinch.

That's the question thousands of Midlanders are entitled to ask of today's Budget, especially those Labour voters who broke the habits of several lifetimes by switching to the Conservatives in areas of the Black Country and North Staffordshire where, until recently, any such thing would have seemed unthinkable. Remember this Budget is not only the first to be presented on behalf of a new government by a very new chancellor. It's also the first after Brexit and the first after our own flooding emergency along the Rivers Severn and Wye which has left local communities facing long and relentless battles to rebuild their their lives and their livelihoods. What's in it for them, too? Read more here. In non-Budget news: insurer LV has stopped selling travel cover as a result of the spread of
coronavirus. LV said: âIn light of the impact
that Coronavirus (Covid-19) is having globally, weâve made the difficult
decision to pause the sale of travel insurance to new customers.â The company has seen a doubling

Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The owner of British Airways has reacted angrily to the fact that Air Passenger Duty will rise in line with inflation next year. International Airlines Group, which also owns Aer Lingus and Iberia, said âgiven the acute pressure on business, the hike in APD will make it even harder for UK firms to trade overseas. This costs UK jobs and growth.â Airlines have long campaigned for APD to be scrapped.
However the aviation industry is being hit hard by the drop in passenger demand because of the coronavirus outbreak. The budget says APD will increase in line with the Retail Price Index measure of inflation for 2021-22, meaning rates on short-haul flights will remain frozen at Â£13. Long-haul economy will increase by Â£3 per passenger.
The government will carry out a consultation on reforming APD in the spring. Use our Budget calculator to find out how your pocket may be affected by the latest tax measures. Share markets in the US were sharply lower on Wednesday on another day of jittery trade, driven by fears about the economic impact of coronavirus. The Dow Jones was down nearly 5% at midday trade in New York, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 4%. The falls come as countries rush to approve spending to shield economies from reduced activity due to the virus. In the last hour, the World Health Organization has formally declared the outbreak a pandemic. It's been a turbulent day on the FTSE 100, which closed 1.6% lower after the Bank of England unexpectedly announced an emergency stimulus package and Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a Budget that has been described as the ""biggest sustained giveaway"" in almost three decades. The index edged into the red as Mr Sunak took to his feet in the Commons and largely continued on a downward trend to close the day 95 points lower at 5,865. The FTSE 250 finished the day 1.2% lower at 17,339. Mark BroadBBC Business digital and deployments editor Number 10 has confirmed that executives from the major tech
firms have been called to a meeting this evening with Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook will also be having a meeting with the Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty, Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS,
and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Downing Street said the talks were due to focus on how to ""inform the public"" about
coronavirus and also look at ""modelling the spread of the disease"". Reality Check The government is going to raise infrastructure spending (which is money for things like building roads and hospitals) to unusually high levels, even after taking into account rising prices. There have been various numbers used, but this chart of public sector net investment, adjusted for inflation, shows the planned increase. The only time we have got close to these levels was in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when the government brought forward spending to help boost the economy during the financial crisis. But governments have found it very difficult over the years to spend as much as they've planned to on infrastructure,as Reality Check explained in this piece. Humanitarian organisation the British Red Cross, which among things campaigns on loneliness, has said the government should commit to a funding plan to tackle isolation. ""Better
connected communities are more resilient communities,"" says ZoÃ« Abrams, executive director of the British Red Cross. ""Whether floods or an
epidemic, in a crisis people who are lonely or socially isolated are hit the
hardest. ""Whilst loneliness wasnât
mentioned
in the Budget, we urge the government to commit to a meaningful funding plan to
tackle loneliness in the forthcoming spending review,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There were two Budgets here. And both were huge. The first, the priority, was the immediate coronavirus
challenge and the threat of a recession, identified by the Office for Budget
Responsibility. The numbers were substantial. A Â£30bn plan
that would, for the first time, see the state fund statutory sick pay for small
and medium sized enterprises, some cash handouts, and a one-year suspension of
business rates. And boost health spending. The measures complemented the
emergency rate cut from the Bank of England, and provide a powerful bridge
built on the assumption that the outbreak will be temporary. But the government also enacted its central manifesto
offer, rather spectacularly - borrow a huge amount of money to fund public
services. The numbers were eye-watering, historic. Rishi Sunak was
not even 10 years old when we last had a Budget that pumped so much money into the
economy. There is Â£175bn extra in spending, not just on infrastructure, as
expected, but also on current spending. In fact, most of the extra spending is
on day-to-day departmental spending â including on tens of thousands of nurses and police officers etc. Much of the fine detail of where this money will
actually go, in terms of department, region,
type of public service is not settled. Even the Treasury âGreen Bookâ equation
that diverts spending towards places like London, is being reviewed. How is all this paid for? The
answer, basically, is around Â£130bn of extra borrowing over this Parliament, and not
really tax rises. Whereas deficits were being phased out under existing
Conservative plans, under this one, they become permanent. A structural change
on economic policy that seeks to take advantage of historic lows in the
interest rates that governments pay to borrow. But this is a government with a lot on its plate: coronavirus, post-Brexit negotiations and running a significant deficit of almost 3%. But this is one of the most consequential Budgets in a
generation. For those coming fresh to the BBC's live coverage of Rishi Sunak's first Budget, here are some of the key points you may have missed. The chancellor promised: The cost of a packet of hand-rolling tobacco is due to rise by 67p, considerably more than the 27p additional tax that will be added to a pack of 20 cigarettes. That's because, under a higher ""tobacco
escalator"" policy, the tax on rolling tobacco increases at 6% ahead of the
retail price index. Simon JackBBC Business Editor This was two Budgets in one: a core Budget with big
borrowing and spending plans for the years ahead and an emergency coronavirus
budget. Although itâs primarily a health emergency, the next few
weeks and months could be a life or death moment for many small businesses which are dealing with the virus and, more importantly, the response to it. Business rates relief for small firms, an offer to give
companies more time to pay tax and the promise of a cash grant of Â£3,000 to virus-affected small
firms will be welcomed. But many will feel the criteria is too prescriptive and
a more general hardship fund would have been more appropriate for a situation
whose impacts are hard to predict. But perhaps more important was the messaging that the
government wants to unlock the potential of business. That is a warmer tone to the private sector than the one
business has been used to. The government has acknowledged that business faces
financial distress on top of the Brexit preparation that could substantially
add to the cost and administrative burden that business will face at the end of this
year. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live has been speaking to business owners to get their reaction to the Budget... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can still follow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak and other stories on the BBC News website. Here are a few key developments from today: Sometimes it takes longer to clean the room than take the test House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock says he has been advised that the degree of resistance against coronavirus for those who have recovered from it ""is deemed to be very high, especially in the first year or more afterwards"". He says it is ""good news that it is highly likely that once people have
got it and recovered then they are going to be OK"". On calls for testing for all, the UK's health secretary says the test is ""not reliable for people who are not symptomatic"". He says that is why testing at the airport, for example, is not effective and some of the countries that started doing that have stopped. There are ""loads of false positives"" with temperature testing as the person ""might be ill with something else"", he says. Or there are ""loads of false negatives... because they donât have enough virus in their system yet to be symptomatic"". ""Testing of someone who does not have symptoms is not
reliable and is counter-productive so we wonât be doing it."" The number of confirmed cases in Costa Rica has risen to 22, up from 13 that had previously been reported. Of the 22, three are foreign nationals. Health authorities have closed several schools linked with a man who has been hospitalised. Despite the rising infected count, many fervent Trump supporters in Florida say they aren't worried. Robert O'Brien, National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump, has suggested China ""covered up"" its initial outbreak, causing a two-month delay to the world's response. Speaking at an event in Washington,external, Mr O'Brien pointed to reports by Chinese nationals ""that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out"". He also praised President Trump's ""bold"" and ""courageous"" action, and said new travel restrictions on people entering the US from China had bought America six to eight weeks to prepare. The coronavirus outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The city's residents have now been on lockdown for more than 50 days. Despite the isolation, people are still trying to keep busy. The Europa League has been ""devalued"" by playing matches behind closed doors, says Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz before his side take on Rangers. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The use of the p-word by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
describe the global spread of this new coronavirus is not a huge surprise. Up until now, it has talked merely of the ""threat"" or the ""potential"" for a pandemic. But with cases in more than 100 countries, and increasing
numbers not linked to travel, the language has changed. The WHO no longer ""declares"" a pandemic the way it used to,
so this is as official as it gets. Yet this doesnât mean the pandemic cannot be controlled, it
explains. Itâs a call to action and a plea for all countries not to
give up, no matter how large the number of cases. Practically, countries are being told to continue to do what
they have been advised to do. That means some may have to step up their
response. But the WHO is not changing what itâs doing or the threat
level of the virus. What the use of the word ""pandemic"" highlights is the
importance of countries around the world taking urgent action to respond to
their own outbreaks â because now itâs everyoneâs responsibility to turn the
tide on the virus. House of CommonsParliament In the UK's House of Commons, Mr Hancock continues: ""We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we
expect numbers to continue to rise after that. ""And the peak would be in a matter
of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. ""This is a
marathon and not a sprint."" He says that the fact the World Health Organization is now calling the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic ""does indicate that they think that this virus will spread right across the world"". His statement comes after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 - the biggest rise in a single day. Read more in our story here The Italian governmentâs decision
to put the whole country in lockdown has prompted 200 student volunteers in the
northern region of Veneto to âadoptâ residents who need help going to the
supermarket or pharmacy. Our reporter Sira Thierij spoke with some of the volunteers. âWhen our cities were shut down
by the government, we were really concerned about people who cannot take care
of themselves, elderly people, but also immuno-suppressed ones and others who
could be more vulnerable to infection,â says Tommaso Biancuzzi, who came up
with the idea. The lockdown means movement in
and out of cities is severely restricted. Shops and cafes may be open but there
is no nightlife and Italians have been told they need a valid work or family
reason to travel. âThis is an emergency with no
precedent in the history of our country,â he told the BBC. âOf course itâs
important to follow the rules and directions given by the health institutions,
but we think it's also crucial to preserve solidarity and compassion.â The volunteers know the risks
involved and visit the elderly and the sick wearing face masks and latex
gloves. âSometimes young people are
considered lazy, but we really care,â says Mr Biancuzzi. House of CommonsParliament The UK's Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs that Parliament will remain openafter an MP tested positive for coronavirus. ""Of course in some ways this House may have to function differently, but the ability to hold government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times,"" he said. Mr Hancock said the public ""will expect Parliament to sit"" and that their approach ""will be guided by the best scientific evidence and medical advice"". A cross-party parliamentary group was meeting daily to
assess the situation, he added. He said he would meet the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, on Thursday morning to discuss an emergency bill that would include measures to keep ""vital public services running"". ""I know how worrying this is, I know people have deep concerns, I know everyone will play their partâ¦ the best way to beat it if for us to work
together,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We will do whatever it takes. We will give the NHS everything it needs.""   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain has now reached 460, after the biggest rise in a single day. It came as two more people with the virus died in the UK, bringing the total number of deaths to eight. One was described as being in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, while the other was elderly and had a number of serious health conditions. Two other Britons have died abroad after contracting the virus. The latest, on Wednesday, was a 53-year-old woman in Bali. Another man also died in Japan last month after contracting the disease aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Share markets in the US have moved sharply lower on Wednesday in another day of jittery trade, driven by fears about the economic impact of the coronavirus. The Dow Jones was down nearly 5% at midday trade in New York, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 4%. London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4%, while other European markets saw more modest falls. The falls come as countries rush to approve spending to shield economies from reduced activity resulting from measures to halt the progress of the virus. Read more here. Health authorities in Croatia have confirmed a further three people in the country have tested positive for coronavirus. All three had recently traveled from Austria and Germany. This brings the total number of cases in Croatia to 19. The government has announced a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people, but ruled out economic intervention for now. From the Olympic women's football qualifiers getting moved from Wuhan on 22 January to Arsenal and Manchester City's Premier League tie getting postponed today, the coronavirus has affected huge swathes of the sporting world. Here's a timelinedetailing all the events hit by the outbreak. Iran's Fars news agency reports that First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri has contracted the virus. In his role, Mr Jahangiri leads Cabinet meetings in the absence of the president, and is the most senior government figure to catch the virus. He has recently been absent from several top-level meetings, and there has been speculation about the state of his health. Two other cabinet members have also tested positive for the disease, according to Fars: Cultural Minister Ali Asghar Mounesan and Reza Rahmani, minister of industry, mines and business. They are among the many Iranian officials and politicians who have been infected in recent weeks. Â© 2025 BBC.

Harvey Weinstein awaits sentencing in New YorkThe former Hollywood producer faces up to 29 years in jail after being convicted of rape and assault.US & Canada,"Weinstein faces between five and 29 years after being found guilty Harvey Weinstein has arrived in court in New York for sentencing, weeks after being found guilty of sexual assault and rape in a landmark trial. Once one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, Weinstein could face up to 29 years in prison. His lawyers have appealed for a much shorter term. Weinstein appeared in court in a wheelchair. The 67-year-old has recently been moved to Rikers Island jailafter being hospitalised when his trial ended. He had stent implant surgery to remove a blockage after complaining of chest pains, according to a spokesman. Weinstein's lawyers have asked Judge James Burke to consider his poor health, age and young children while sentencing him. They asked for the shortest possible punishment of five years for their client, citing his ""accomplishments"" and ""charitable endeavours"" over the years. How a Hollywood giant faced his reckoning How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Weinstein accuser: 'No' was a trigger for him Prosecutors have asked for a prison sentence which reflects his ""lifetime of abuse towards others"" and ""lack of remorse"" for his actions. Dozens of women have come forward allegations of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Weinstein since October 2017. Weinstein consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers have said they will appeal against his convictions. Both he and the two women he was found guilty of assaulting could have the chance to speak at Wednesday's hearing, AP reports. Weinstein was convicted for two offences last month after a weeks-long trial in Manhattan. He was found guilty of a first-degree criminal sexual act charge for forcing oral sex on former production assistant Miriam Haley, also known as Mimi Haleyi, in 2006. This video can not be played Miriam Haley comments on Weinstein's guilty verdict He was also convicted of the third-degree rape of Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. The jury acquitted him of a more serious first-degree rape charge relating to Ms Mann. Jurors also cleared him of the two other counts he faced, for predatory sexual assault, which would have factored in the testimony of a third woman: actress Annabella Sciorra. Her allegation of rape, which dated back to the 1990s, was too old to be charged independently under New York law.  If Weinstein had been found guilty of the more serious predatory assault charges, he could have faced a life sentence. Wednesday's sentencing comes just days after a mound of court evidence was unsealed. US media has carried reports of the documents, which are said to include tense exchanges with his now-estranged brother and former business partner. Weinstein was remanded in custody following the guilty verdict Details also emerged of the ""red-flag list"" of people he had sent to private investigators and his apparent attempts to get help from influential figures, like Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg, as allegations against him mounted. Three additional women, outside of the New York charges, testified at Weinstein's trial to help prosecutors establish an alleged pattern of behaviour. The former movie executive still faces further criminal charges in Los Angelesover the alleged assault of two women in 2013. Investigators there also have other cases under review. Dozens have women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. The allegations helped the #MeToo movement go global, where women shared their own experiences of abuse and misconduct. The movie executive was once a titan of Hollywood, enjoying phenomenal success with Oscar winners such Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting and The King's Speech.

Six people with the virus have died in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases. The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old British woman has become the first person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to die in Indonesia, according to local media reports.

She also held a surgery in her constituency on Friday morning which was attended by up to 12 people, according to Steven Dixon, chair of the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association. Mr Dixon said the details of all those who attended the surgery have been passed to the NHS. The Flitwick Club, where the surgery took place, is undergoing a deep clean as a precaution. The Department of Health said ministers - including the prime minister - would not need to undergo testing as Public Health England (PHE) has assessed the risk of Ms Dorries' close contacts and only those with symptoms needed to self-isolate.

Harvey Weinstein awaits sentencing in New YorkThe former Hollywood producer faces up to 29 years in jail after being convicted of rape and assault.,"Weinstein faces between five and 29 years after being found guilty Harvey Weinstein has arrived in court in New York for sentencing, weeks after being found guilty of sexual assault and rape in a landmark trial. Once one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, Weinstein could face up to 29 years in prison. His lawyers have appealed for a much shorter term. Weinstein appeared in court in a wheelchair. The 67-year-old has recently been moved to Rikers Island jailafter being hospitalised when his trial ended. He had stent implant surgery to remove a blockage after complaining of chest pains, according to a spokesman. Weinstein's lawyers have asked Judge James Burke to consider his poor health, age and young children while sentencing him. They asked for the shortest possible punishment of five years for their client, citing his ""accomplishments"" and ""charitable endeavours"" over the years. How a Hollywood giant faced his reckoning How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Weinstein accuser: 'No' was a trigger for him Prosecutors have asked for a prison sentence which reflects his ""lifetime of abuse towards others"" and ""lack of remorse"" for his actions. Dozens of women have come forward allegations of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Weinstein since October 2017. Weinstein consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers have said they will appeal against his convictions. Both he and the two women he was found guilty of assaulting could have the chance to speak at Wednesday's hearing, AP reports. Weinstein was convicted for two offences last month after a weeks-long trial in Manhattan. He was found guilty of a first-degree criminal sexual act charge for forcing oral sex on former production assistant Miriam Haley, also known as Mimi Haleyi, in 2006. This video can not be played Miriam Haley comments on Weinstein's guilty verdict He was also convicted of the third-degree rape of Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. The jury acquitted him of a more serious first-degree rape charge relating to Ms Mann. Jurors also cleared him of the two other counts he faced, for predatory sexual assault, which would have factored in the testimony of a third woman: actress Annabella Sciorra. Her allegation of rape, which dated back to the 1990s, was too old to be charged independently under New York law.  If Weinstein had been found guilty of the more serious predatory assault charges, he could have faced a life sentence. Wednesday's sentencing comes just days after a mound of court evidence was unsealed. US media has carried reports of the documents, which are said to include tense exchanges with his now-estranged brother and former business partner. Weinstein was remanded in custody following the guilty verdict Details also emerged of the ""red-flag list"" of people he had sent to private investigators and his apparent attempts to get help from influential figures, like Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg, as allegations against him mounted. Three additional women, outside of the New York charges, testified at Weinstein's trial to help prosecutors establish an alleged pattern of behaviour. The former movie executive still faces further criminal charges in Los Angelesover the alleged assault of two women in 2013. Investigators there also have other cases under review. Dozens have women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. The allegations helped the #MeToo movement go global, where women shared their own experiences of abuse and misconduct. The movie executive was once a titan of Hollywood, enjoying phenomenal success with Oscar winners such Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting and The King's Speech.

Budget to be unveiled amid coronavirus pressuresChancellor Rishi Sunak will present the government's first fiscal plans since it won the election.UK PoliticsComments,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is preparing to unveil his first Budget amid continued pressure from the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Sunak will present his economic plans to MPs in the Commons at 12:30 GMT, less than a month after taking over at the Treasury. Some elements have already been revealed, includingmore than Â£600bn for infrastructure projects over five yearsandextra money for potholes. But the economic challenge posed by the virusis still expected to dominate. The Bank of England has announced an emergency cutin interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25% in a bid to support the economy during the virus outbreak. Speaking at the cabinet meeting ahead of the Budget, Mr Sunak said his plan would make the UK ""one of the best placed economies in the world to manage the potential impact of the virus"". Live Budget day updates from the Commons Budget 2020: The economy must be vaccinated What should we make of Conservative spending promises? Your essential guide to the Budget The number of coronavirus cases in the UK reached 382 on Tuesday, a rise of 63 since the previous day, with a sixth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. Mr Sunak has previously saidthe NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisisand that he is looking at extra financial help for individuals and businesses who are left out of pocket. The Budget also comes in a week in which shares around the world - already hit by fears about coronavirus - suffered some of their biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis. Dubbed ""Black Monday"", indexes tumbled as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge, with declines in London wiping some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. This video can not be played Budget 2020: What is Johnson-omics? On the eve of the Budget announcements, the Treasury pledged to triple the average net investment made over the last 40 years into rail and road, affordable housing, broadband and research. It said this would lead to the ""highest levels [of investment] in real terms since 1955"" - more than Â£600bn over the five-year Parliament - and be targeted ""in every region and nation of the UK"". Mr Sunak said: ""We have listened and will now deliver on our promise to level up the UK, ensuring everyone has the same chances and opportunities in life, wherever they live. ""By investing historic amounts in British innovation and world-class infrastructure, we will rebalance opportunities and lay the foundations for a decade of growth for everybody."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell called the figures ""exaggerated claims"", adding: ""Boris Johnson has a track record of boastful claims followed by non delivery and it looks like he is running true to form."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the decision marked a significant increase in the amount of spending on capital projects compared with the period since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. However, she said it wasnot yet clear whether the government would stick to its own fiscal rulesset out in its manifesto. And she said the spread of the virus means that the Treasury's spreadsheets and sums that had been prepared for the Budget are now completely out of date. The government is also set to pledgeÂ£2.5bn to fixing potholes in Englandas part of the Budget. The Treasury said the money would also be available to local authorities to start resurfacing works, preventing potholes from appearing in the first place. But Mr McDonnell said the policy was part of a ""gimmicky grab-bag of projects"". Wednesday's Budget will also be the first time a woman has chaired the proceedings in the Commons' history. Dame Eleanor Laing will make history as the first woman to chair the Commons during the Budget Dame Eleanor Laing was elected as the House's first woman chairman of ways and means in January - the most senior deputy speaker - who traditionally oversees the Budget. She said she ""probably will be a bit nervous"" on the day, but said, with a new chancellor in post as well, ""we will all be newbies"".

"Murder case 'could still be solved' 50 years onPolice say DNA evidence could identify the killer of Susan Long, who was found dead in March 1970.Norfolk","Susan Long was found dead in a country lane in March 1970 Police investigating the unsolved murder of a teenager 50 years ago have said her killer could still be identified even if he has died. Susan Long, 18, had been out dancing on 10 March 1970 and got on a bus home to Aylsham, Norfolk, but her body was found in a country lane the next day. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Andy Guy, cold case manager for Norfolk Police, said: ""We have DNA, so with a name - and DNA - it is solvable."" He added: ""Let's say the killer was 30 at the time, he would be 80 now - there's a chance he could still be alive. And even if he is not, there are tests we can do to establish that DNA link. ""We could even exhume a body if it came to that."" Miss Long worked as a clerk at Norwich Union and regularly went to the Gala in Norwich with her ""steady"" boyfriend, who lived in the city. She left at about 22:25 GMT and was seen getting on the Aylsham bus, which arrived at her usual bus stop - the Market Place - at 23:10. ""She had just got a car so she knew it would be one of her last bus journeys. Sadly, it turned out to be the case,"" said Mr Guy. ""It's always been assumed she got off the bus at the Market Place but it's really unclear. The bus driver was questioned at the time but did not remember."" From there, it was a seven-minute walk to her parents' home in Sir Williams Lane, via White Hart Street and Gashouse Hill. At 05:30, a milkman found her body, face-down in a puddle by the side of a country lane at Spratt's Green, just outside Aylsham. The lane near Aylsham where Susan Long's body was found Miss Long's killer - described as ""panicked"" by Mr Guy - made no attempt to conceal her body, which was on view near a farm entrance. She was fully clothed but a bracelet and shoe were missing and have never been recovered. There were no signs of a violent struggle and a pathologist believed she had died at about midnight. Forensic evidence revealed whoever had sexually assaulted her had a rare blood type. Officers took 835 blood samples, spoke to 3,700 people and completed 10,000 questionnaires while knocking on doors. ""It was a huge investigation for the time,"" said Mr Guy, as the force launched a 50th anniversary appeal. ""They were very thorough - fragments of bitumen were found on her and they contacted Shell, which established it was from the road surface where she was found. ""A paint fragment from a car was also found, which suggested she had been in contact with such a car."" Miss Long's mother Molly died in 2014 Her boyfriend was eliminated from the inquiry, as were fellow bus passengers, and no link was established with men of a similar blood type - although, as Mr Guy pointed out, an individual could simply refuse to provide a blood sample in the 1970s. The trail soon went cold. The biggest breakthrough came in 2004, when familial DNA was established from samples taken at the time. It ruled out everyone who had provided a sample of a rare blood type. Fifty years on, Mr Guy believes the killer was someone local, with knowledge of the area. ""There are rumours that have been around the town for years - we've had several names given to us and we've looked at them,"" he said. ""If there is someone people have always felt suspicious of, perhaps how they act around the anniversary, then we need to hear about it. ""We are on the last roll of the dice in terms of people's memories - unless we get that DNA match I don't see where else we could go."" Miss Long's mother Molly died in 2014 ""never having had closure as to who killed her daughter"", and ""it was ""impossible to understand the pain she endured for all those years"", he added.

That's the question thousands of Midlanders are entitled to ask of today's Budget, especially those Labour voters who broke the habits of several lifetimes by switching to the Conservatives in areas of the Black Country and North Staffordshire where, until recently, any such thing would have seemed unthinkable. Remember this Budget is not only the first to be presented on behalf of a new government by a very new chancellor. It's also the first after Brexit and the first after our own flooding emergency along the Rivers Severn and Wye which has left local communities facing long and relentless battles to rebuild their their lives and their livelihoods.

Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The owner of British Airways has reacted angrily to the fact that Air Passenger Duty will rise in line with inflation next year. International Airlines Group, which also owns Aer Lingus and Iberia, said âgiven the acute pressure on business, the hike in APD will make it even harder for UK firms to trade overseas. This costs UK jobs and growth.â Airlines have long campaigned for APD to be scrapped.
However the aviation industry is being hit hard by the drop in passenger demand because of the coronavirus outbreak. The budget says APD will increase in line with the Retail Price Index measure of inflation for 2021-22, meaning rates on short-haul flights will remain frozen at Â£13. Long-haul economy will increase by Â£3 per passenger.
The government will carry out a consultation on reforming APD in the spring. Use our Budget calculator to find out how your pocket may be affected by the latest tax measures. Share markets in the US were sharply lower on Wednesday on another day of jittery trade, driven by fears about the economic impact of coronavirus. The Dow Jones was down nearly 5% at midday trade in New York, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 4%. The falls come as countries rush to approve spending to shield economies from reduced activity due to the virus. In the last hour, the World Health Organization has formally declared the outbreak a pandemic. It's been a turbulent day on the FTSE 100, which closed 1.6% lower after the Bank of England unexpectedly announced an emergency stimulus package and Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a Budget that has been described as the ""biggest sustained giveaway"" in almost three decades. The index edged into the red as Mr Sunak took to his feet in the Commons and largely continued on a downward trend to close the day 95 points lower at 5,865. The FTSE 250 finished the day 1.2% lower at 17,339. Mark BroadBBC Business digital and deployments editor Number 10 has confirmed that executives from the major tech

and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Downing Street said the talks were due to focus on how to ""inform the public"" about
coronavirus and also look at ""modelling the spread of the disease"". Reality Check The government is going to raise infrastructure spending (which is money for things like building roads and hospitals) to unusually high levels, even after taking into account rising prices. There have been various numbers used, but this chart of public sector net investment, adjusted for inflation, shows the planned increase. The only time we have got close to these levels was in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when the government brought forward spending to help boost the economy during the financial crisis. But governments have found it very difficult over the years to spend as much as they've planned to on infrastructure,as Reality Check explained in this piece. Humanitarian organisation the British Red Cross, which among things campaigns on loneliness, has said the government should commit to a funding plan to tackle isolation. ""Better
connected communities are more resilient communities,"" says ZoÃ« Abrams, executive director of the British Red Cross. ""Whether floods or an

hardest. ""Whilst loneliness wasnât

Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor There were two Budgets here. And both were huge. The first, the priority, was the immediate coronavirus
challenge and the threat of a recession, identified by the Office for Budget
Responsibility. The numbers were substantial. A Â£30bn plan
that would, for the first time, see the state fund statutory sick pay for small
and medium sized enterprises, some cash handouts, and a one-year suspension of
business rates. And boost health spending. The measures complemented the
emergency rate cut from the Bank of England, and provide a powerful bridge
built on the assumption that the outbreak will be temporary. But the government also enacted its central manifesto
offer, rather spectacularly - borrow a huge amount of money to fund public
services. The numbers were eye-watering, historic. Rishi Sunak was
not even 10 years old when we last had a Budget that pumped so much money into the
economy. There is Â£175bn extra in spending, not just on infrastructure, as
expected, but also on current spending. In fact, most of the extra spending is
on day-to-day departmental spending â including on tens of thousands of nurses and police officers etc. Much of the fine detail of where this money will
actually go, in terms of department, region,
type of public service is not settled. Even the Treasury âGreen Bookâ equation
that diverts spending towards places like London, is being reviewed. How is all this paid for? The
answer, basically, is around Â£130bn of extra borrowing over this Parliament, and not
really tax rises. Whereas deficits were being phased out under existing
Conservative plans, under this one, they become permanent. A structural change
on economic policy that seeks to take advantage of historic lows in the
interest rates that governments pay to borrow. But this is a government with a lot on its plate: coronavirus, post-Brexit negotiations and running a significant deficit of almost 3%. But this is one of the most consequential Budgets in a
generation. For those coming fresh to the BBC's live coverage of Rishi Sunak's first Budget, here are some of the key points you may have missed. The chancellor promised: The cost of a packet of hand-rolling tobacco is due to rise by 67p, considerably more than the 27p additional tax that will be added to a pack of 20 cigarettes. That's because, under a higher ""tobacco
escalator"" policy, the tax on rolling tobacco increases at 6% ahead of the
retail price index. Simon JackBBC Business Editor This was two Budgets in one: a core Budget with big
borrowing and spending plans for the years ahead and an emergency coronavirus
budget. Although itâs primarily a health emergency, the next few
weeks and months could be a life or death moment for many small businesses which are dealing with the virus and, more importantly, the response to it. Business rates relief for small firms, an offer to give
companies more time to pay tax and the promise of a cash grant of Â£3,000 to virus-affected small
firms will be welcomed. But many will feel the criteria is too prescriptive and
a more general hardship fund would have been more appropriate for a situation
whose impacts are hard to predict. But perhaps more important was the messaging that the
government wants to unlock the potential of business. That is a warmer tone to the private sector than the one
business has been used to. The government has acknowledged that business faces
financial distress on top of the Brexit preparation that could substantially
add to the cost and administrative burden that business will face at the end of this
year. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live has been speaking to business owners to get their reaction to the Budget... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scary clown ad played in Spotify lullaby playlist,"Warner Bros has been rebuked after an advert for one of its horror movies was played during a Spotify playlist of children's lullabies. The advert for the film It: Chapter Two featured the voice of killer clown Pennywise talking and giggling over scary music. It ran in August although it had been tagged as unsuitable for ""kids' music"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said Warner must take further steps to prevent a similar incident. Spotify did not respond to the BBC's request to explain why it had not blocked the advert. But the UK's advertising watchdog said that the music streaming firm had told it ""they did not believe the playlist was designed primarily for children"". Even so, the regulator noted the technology company had now removed the list from its platform. ""As streaming services become ever more mainstream, I suspect they'll face a number of new challenges like this one,"" commented Chris Cooke, managing director of music business consultancy CMU Insights. ""While it's reasonable to say that Spotify's advertising technology should keep unsuitable ads away from playlists overtly aimed at children, are we saying it should also look for playlists that have the sort of music that might make them popular for children? ""That said, Spotify is already making moves in this space by launching a specific kids version of its app for premium users. Maybe it needs to apply some of that functionality to its [advert-supported] free service too."" The playlist in question was titled ""Classical Lullabies"", and had been curated by Spotify itself. It included songs whose titles included the phrases: Children's Music For Children English Nursery Tunes On this basis, the ASA said that it considered the list was indeed ""designed primarily"" to be listened to by young children, despite Spotify's denial. The 30-second advert featured the distorted voice of It's villain. The character, created by the writer Stephen King, had terrorised a group of children in the first movie, and describes his desire to return, while indistinct whispers play in the background. ""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you. Oh, I missed you,"" he says, before a siren, drums and other discordant sound effects are played. The regulator said that it believed this was likely to distress young audiences. While Spotify has removed the offending playlist, a version using the same name and many of the same songs has been posted to the platform by one of its users Warner said that it had directed the advert to be targeted at 18 to 44-year-olds and had also marked it as being unsuitable for children. In response, the advertising watchdog acknowledged that the film distributor had taken steps to behave responsibly. But since this had not prevented children from hearing the advert, the ASA still judged it to be ""inappropriately targeted"". ""We expect advertisers, and the platforms on which their ads are served, to ensure children aren't targeted by inappropriate or irresponsible content,"" it said. It added that its rules also applied to ads played within user-curated playlists. The body does not have the power to impose fines, but it can demand repeat offenders provide it with their marketing materials to check them before use, among other sanctions.

Ms Dorries said she has been self-isolating at home. Labour MP Rachael Maskell said she has since been told to do the same as she had met Ms Dorries. The Department of Health said Ms Dorries first showed symptoms on Thursday - the same day she attended an event hosted by the prime minister. Six people with the virus have died in the UK, which has a total of 382 cases. The latest person to die was a man in his early 80s who had underlying health conditions. Meanwhile, a 53-year-old British woman has become the first person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to die in Indonesia, according to local media reports. It is not clear whether the woman - who was reportedly critically ill with multiple health conditions - died due to the virus. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it is ""supporting the family of a British woman who has died in Indonesia and are in contact with local authorities"". Thegovernment is unveiling its first Budget,amid growing fears about the impact the outbreak will have on the UK economy. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged the NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis as well as a ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" to support small and medium-sized businesses. He also said the government will meet the cost of statutory sick pay for firms with up to 250 people, and people who are self-employed and fall sick will be eligible for benefits from day one.

Mr Dixon said the details of all those who attended the surgery have been passed to the NHS. The Flitwick Club, where the surgery took place, is undergoing a deep clean as a precaution. The Department of Health said ministers - including the prime minister - would not need to undergo testing as Public Health England (PHE) has assessed the risk of Ms Dorries' close contacts and only those with symptoms needed to self-isolate.

Budget to be unveiled amid coronavirus pressuresChancellor Rishi Sunak will present the government's first fiscal plans since it won the election.,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is preparing to unveil his first Budget amid continued pressure from the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Sunak will present his economic plans to MPs in the Commons at 12:30 GMT, less than a month after taking over at the Treasury. Some elements have already been revealed, includingmore than Â£600bn for infrastructure projects over five yearsandextra money for potholes. But the economic challenge posed by the virusis still expected to dominate. The Bank of England has announced an emergency cutin interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25% in a bid to support the economy during the virus outbreak. Speaking at the cabinet meeting ahead of the Budget, Mr Sunak said his plan would make the UK ""one of the best placed economies in the world to manage the potential impact of the virus"". Live Budget day updates from the Commons Budget 2020: The economy must be vaccinated What should we make of Conservative spending promises? Your essential guide to the Budget The number of coronavirus cases in the UK reached 382 on Tuesday, a rise of 63 since the previous day, with a sixth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. Mr Sunak has previously saidthe NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisisand that he is looking at extra financial help for individuals and businesses who are left out of pocket. The Budget also comes in a week in which shares around the world - already hit by fears about coronavirus - suffered some of their biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis. Dubbed ""Black Monday"", indexes tumbled as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge, with declines in London wiping some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. This video can not be played Budget 2020: What is Johnson-omics? On the eve of the Budget announcements, the Treasury pledged to triple the average net investment made over the last 40 years into rail and road, affordable housing, broadband and research. It said this would lead to the ""highest levels [of investment] in real terms since 1955"" - more than Â£600bn over the five-year Parliament - and be targeted ""in every region and nation of the UK"". Mr Sunak said: ""We have listened and will now deliver on our promise to level up the UK, ensuring everyone has the same chances and opportunities in life, wherever they live. ""By investing historic amounts in British innovation and world-class infrastructure, we will rebalance opportunities and lay the foundations for a decade of growth for everybody."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell called the figures ""exaggerated claims"", adding: ""Boris Johnson has a track record of boastful claims followed by non delivery and it looks like he is running true to form."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the decision marked a significant increase in the amount of spending on capital projects compared with the period since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. However, she said it wasnot yet clear whether the government would stick to its own fiscal rulesset out in its manifesto. And she said the spread of the virus means that the Treasury's spreadsheets and sums that had been prepared for the Budget are now completely out of date. The government is also set to pledgeÂ£2.5bn to fixing potholes in Englandas part of the Budget. The Treasury said the money would also be available to local authorities to start resurfacing works, preventing potholes from appearing in the first place. But Mr McDonnell said the policy was part of a ""gimmicky grab-bag of projects"". Wednesday's Budget will also be the first time a woman has chaired the proceedings in the Commons' history. Dame Eleanor Laing will make history as the first woman to chair the Commons during the Budget Dame Eleanor Laing was elected as the House's first woman chairman of ways and means in January - the most senior deputy speaker - who traditionally oversees the Budget. She said she ""probably will be a bit nervous"" on the day, but said, with a new chancellor in post as well, ""we will all be newbies"".
