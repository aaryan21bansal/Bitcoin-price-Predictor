Footage shared on social media last week appeared to show the tiger wandering around the streets of in the west of the Texan city, India's new home is an animal sanctuary. The animal was spotted out on the streets on 9 May. When officers arrived at the scene, a man put the tiger into an SUV and drove off, police said.

Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, Mr Borza said: ""In no way, shape or form should you have an animal like that in your household. That animal is only nine months old and already weighs 175 lbs (80kgs) - full grown, that animal can get to 600 lbs. It still had its claws and it could do a lot of damage if he decided to. ""Luckily for us, he's very tame and he will be going to a sanctuary tomorrow where, hopefully, he'll live the rest of his life in a very safe environment."" The tiger will have its own enclosure with a wooded area and pool at the Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch. Carole Baskin, star of Netflix documentary Tiger King, said on Facebook that she was ""grateful"" the animal will be going to the sanctuary and said it had ""excellent facilities"". Tigers are not allowed within Houston City limits although it is permitted in many parts of the state under certain conditions.

Thousands set for overseas holidays as rules ease,"This video can not be played Holidaying Brits touch down in Portugal: 'It feels unreal' Thousands of British holidaymakers have begun taking advantage of the easing of lockdown rules on overseas travel. Travellers from England, Scotland and Wales are jetting off to some countries in what the crisis-hit tourism industry hopes is the start of a recovery. Travellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return. The bosses of British Airways and Ryanair said confidence was returning. The vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back. Bookings also remain well down on pre-pandemic levels. However, BA chief executive Sean Doyle told the BBC that the airline's six flights due to depart from Heathrow on Monday to ""green"" destinations such as Lisbon, Faro and Madeira were ""very busy"". He said the latest relaxation of restrictions was ""a small step in the right direction"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said there weredefinite signs of an early reboundin travel to European destinations. Bookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. ""The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We are very optimistic for the next couple of months."" Nellie and Jill are off to Portugal on Monday - but it seemed touch and go right up to the moment they got to the airport. They are ""super excited and really happy to be able to travel again"". But the past few weeks have been stressful, especially as it was only confirmed on Friday that they could definitely travel. Nellie said it was then a real scramble to get PCR coronavirus tests over the weekend, which Jill added was quite complicated. ""Adding all the documentation wasn't easy but we persevered and we're glad we did,"" Jill said. Some holiday sun and a glass of wine on their balcony would make it all worth it, she added. Gatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said welcoming holidaymakers for the first time in months was a ""big relief"". He expected the number of travellers to increase significantly by the end of May - but this will still be less than 15% of the traffic seen in pre-pandemic times. ""It's an important day for us... we're looking forward to seeing more countries added to the green list in the weeks ahead,"" he added. But there is still caution. Online travel agent Thomas Cook said the number of people booking to travel abroad was ""still small"". It said 75% of its bookings were for Portugal, although Thomas Cook customers planning to jet off this week numbered only in their hundreds. Live: Indoor pints and trips abroad as lockdown eases What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? The rules for holidays in green list countries such as Portugal Public must play their part as lockdown eases - PM People in Wales asked not to travel abroad On Friday, Portugal announced that travellers from the UK would be allowed to enter its borders provided they could show a negative PCR test result from the previous 72 hours. That led to an increase in demand for flights to the country. Tui, which has 19 flights scheduled from the UK to Portugal next week, said eight of those would now be on a Boeing Dreamliner, which can carry up to 345 people - almost twice as many people as the Boeing 737s that it had planned to use. Passengers checking in at Gatwick Many of those who do intend to get away plan to do so in style. Thomas Cook reported that 85% of customers had booked four or five-star hotels. Before the crisis, only around half of people chose to splash out on that kind of luxury. Hays Travel has noticed a similar trend. At present around half of its customers are booking for next year but it highlighted a ""cautious optimism"" among travellers following an almost four-fold increase in bookings for Portugal this summer. Chief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the average spend on a two-week holiday for a family of four had increased by Â£370 to Â£4,000 as people look to ""fulfil their bucket list"". ""People are upgrading to better destinations and accommodation, spending more to treat themselves,"" he said. After months of keeping apart, travelling on a busy plane feels both familiar and strange. Face masks are mandatory except to allow for eating and drinking, but seats are not socially distanced. I was handed a complimentary antibacterial wipe on boarding. The paperwork is far more complicated than normal. Alongside my passport and ticket, I'm carrying proof of my negative PCR test, a passenger locator form for Portugal and proof of my booked tests for my journey home. I'll have to complete another locator form to come back to the U.K. Still at 35,000 feet, we don't know how long the queues will be at the Portuguese border when we land or on the return journey. Passengers on board have said they feel a little like guinea pigs. The travel industry knows it's important to make this process smooth and safe if it's to have a good summer. While travel from England, Scotland and Wales is permitted to the 12 countries on the green list, most of the destinations are either remote islands or do not currently allow UK tourists to enter. And the government is advising people not to make non-essential trips to locations on its amber list, which covers popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece. However, the guidance is expected to be ignored by some holidaymakers. EasyJet and Tui have both said that they will operate holidays to countries classified as amber, provided Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) does not advise against ""all but essential"" travel. The majority of countries around the world are in the amber category, meaning that arrivals from these places to the UK are required to quarantine at home for 10 days as well as taking a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. Travellers arriving back in England from an amber country have the option after five days of quarantine to pay for a private Covid test under theTest to Release scheme,external. If the result is negative, the quarantine can end. Masked sunbathers in Portugal BA boss Sean Doyle said ""cautious optimism"" should be exercised when decisions are made about whether to expand the green list when it is reviewed on 7 June. He said vaccination and infection rates in a number of the major aviation markets were ""trending positively"", noting that the US - an important market for both tourism and business ""now has 60% of its adult population vaccinated [and] infections are falling"". From Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people who have had both doses will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.

Campaign launched to mark Queen's Platinum Jubilee,"The Queen joined Prince Charles for the first Jubilee tree planting in the grounds of Windsor Castle in March People across the UK are being urged to plant trees in an initiative to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in 2022. The Queen joined the Prince of Wales as he planted the first Jubilee tree at Windsor Castle earlier this year to launch the scheme honouring the monarch's 70-year reign. TheQueen's Green Canopy (QGC),externalwill see new trees planted, as well as ancient woodlands and forests protected. Prince Charles encouraged people to ""plant a tree for the jubilee"". ""In other words, a 'tree-bilee'"", he said in a video message. Taking part in the scheme, hosted by climate charity Cool Earth, could range from individuals planting trees in their own gardens to the creation of platinum jubilee copses on council land or avenues in cities or housing developments.. Schools and community groups will be able to apply for a share of three million free saplings from the Woodland Trust as part of the project. Charles' tree was planted earlier this year during official planting season (October-March) The prince said: ""Whether you are an individual hoping to plant a single sapling in your garden, a school or community group planting a tree, a council, charity or business intending to plant a whole avenue of trees or a farmer looking to create new hedgerows, everyone across the country can get involved."" He said it is vital more of theright species of trees are planted, in the right placesand that more woodlands, avenues, hedgerows and urban planting schemes should be established, while protecting and sustaining what we already have. Describing it as a ""statement of hope and faith in the future"", the prince said planting trees and hedgerows and protecting existing woodlands and forests were simple, cost-effective ways to protect the planet. The initiative will also highlight 70 irreplaceable ancient woodlands across the UK and identify 70 ancient trees. A pilot training programme for unemployed young people aged between 16 and 24 to plant and manage trees will also be created and run through Capel Manor College, London's only specialist environmental college, of which the Queen Mother was patron. Donations to the scheme will go to deprived areas and urban schools via one of the partner organisations of the Queen's Green Canopy, Trees for Cities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thrown his support behind the initiative. He said: ""Our trees stand at the frontline of our fight against climate change and by sustaining our beautiful countryside for generations to come. ""The Queen's Green Canopy is a fitting tribute to her majesty's years of service to this country. I urge everyone to get involved."" The Queen has herself planted more than 1,500 trees around the world during her reign. Woodland Trust chief executive, Darren Moorcroft, said the last year had ""emphasised the central role that trees and woods play in the life of the nation"". He added: ""We need more projects like this, giving people access to our natural heritage, opportunities to do something positive for the environment, and helping to safeguard it for our children in the face of a combined climate and nature crisis.""

Firms ask for more help after 'haemorrhaging cash',"Television chef Nisha Katona says debt could push firms out of business Leisure firms say they need more support after a year of ""haemorrhaging cash"" and mounting debts due to the pandemic. Businesses from wine bars to bingo halls can reopen on Monday but at reduced capacity making it harder to cover their costs. Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC he did not want rent arrears to ""cripple"" firms. He said the government was looking at ways to help firms manage their debts. While leisure venues, including soft play centres, amusement arcades and concert halls, are welcoming Monday's reopening, they know some customers will take longer to return to indoor activities, especially with the spread of the new Indian variant of the virus. Even if customer demand is high, venues can accommodate fewer customers at a time, due to social distancing rules. And according to the trade body UKHospitality, that sector alone has Â£2.5bn in rent arrears ""hanging around its neck"" as a result of the pandemic. ""Opening... will give us a certain amount of revenue, but we will still have half the number of covers we need to survive,"" says Nisha Katona, television presenter and founder of Indian restaurant chain Mowgli Street Food. She says her business has been lucky to have had a bit of financial ""breathing room"" to help it cope with lockdown, but it has still suffered. ""Cash has been haemorrhaging out of our account all the while we have no revenue, and yet we continue to pay rents,"" says Ms Katona. ""There are lots of business costs that don't go away, so while there has been no cash, we really have become a business that is on its knees, waiting for the resurrection."" Tenth of British restaurants lost during pandemic How many people can I meet in the pub? Indian variant could disrupt 21 June easing - PM She says the UK's high streets are already ""littered with the gravestones"" of independent bars and restaurants that didn't have backers with deep pockets or hadn't been able to negotiate concessions from their landlords. UKHospitality has called for ""a fair amount"" of rent debt to be written off and for a ban on business evictions, currently due to expire at the end of June, to be extended. The business minister, Mr Kwarteng, said the government was aware that businesses were facing a build-up in rent arrears after many months of not being able to trade normally. ""The government is working very closely together - the Treasury and [the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy] - to see if we can come up with an arrangement whereby tenants and landlords can work together to make sure this rent issue doesn't cripple business,"" he told the BBC. This is a big moment for the national mood and the UK economy - particularly those sectors which have been hardest hit by the restrictions. Nearly one million hospitality and leisure workers will go back to work today according to industry estimates. Although many have been open for outside service, 60% of hospitality venues have no outside space and have been unable to open till now. However, this is not the champagne moment many had hoped for. The real prize for businesses in hospitality and beyond was the planned removal of all restrictions on 21 June.  The recent increasing concerns and government warnings about the threat posed by the Indian variant to the reopening roadmap are casting an unwelcome cloud of uncertainty. Even with the restrictions being eased today, with the reintroduction of seated indoor drinking and dining, many businesses will still be unable to operate anywhere near pre-pandemic capacity and will be facing the prospect of deferred rent bills, the repayment of Covid loans and an increasingly acute staff shortage as hospitality workers who left the industry don't yet feel confident enough to return. A separate report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said employers would have to improve pay and working conditions to get the staff they need. Stephen Burns, chief executive of the Hollywood Bowl Group, which runs bowling and mini-golf sites throughout the UK, said his venues had only been able to trade for seven or eight of the past 62 weeks, costing the business Â£100m in lost revenue, during which time bills had mounted. ""Whilst we are incredibly grateful for the support that we have seen from the government, there has still been the cost of keeping our team members on furlough, as well as paying our rent, service charges and utility bills, so it has had a significant impact on our cashflows."" He said maintaining the furlough scheme had cost the firm Â£100,000 a week. Hollywood Bowl had been able to engage with its landlords, something that wasn't happening across all areas of the leisure sector, he added. Hollywood Bowl is keen to get back to pre-Covid levels of business After reopening, the bowling alleys would only run at half capacity, said Mr Burns, until measures to curb the pandemic end altogether, currently scheduled for 21 June, according to the government's roadmap. However that date has now been thrown into doubt. The government has said it will make a decision on 14 June about whether the final easing of restrictions can go ahead. Ms Katona said many businesses would make little or no profit while capacity was still restricted. ""In order to survive, what needs to happen is that we need to trade at the levels that we were trading prior to Covid,"" she said. ""While social distancing is in place we cannot do that. Many places will not be able to make any kind of profit while restrictions are in place."" She fears many businesses will go bankrupt in the Autumn as landlords demand rent arrears and says the government should look at things like business rates and VAT rates as well as support with debts due to landlords. Mr Kwarteng said he hoped the final lifting of restrictions, including ending the need to distance indoors, would go ahead in June, but that he couldn't offer any ""cast iron guarantees"".

Joshua v Fury showdown set for 14 August - Fury,"This video can not be played BBC Sport looks back at the verbal barbs and insults traded by Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury Tyson Fury says his world heavyweight title showdown with Anthony Joshua will take place in Saudi Arabia on 14 August. The all-British bout has been billed as one of the biggest in heavyweight boxing for decades and the winner will become undisputed champion. Joshua, 31, holds the WBA, WBO and IBF belts, while Fury, 32, is WBC champion. The fight will see all four belts on the line in a heavyweight bout for the first time in history. The last undisputed heavyweight champion was Britain's Lennox Lewis from 1999 to 2000, in an era when fighters did not need to hold the WBO belt to be recognised as undisputed champion. In announcing the fight date in a video on Twitter, Fury said: ""All eyes of the world will be on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and I cannot wait to smash Anthony Joshua on the biggest stage of all times. ""This is going to be the biggest sporting event ever to grace the planet earth. Do not miss it."" Plans for a fight between the pair were set in motion when Fury defeated Deontay Wilder to capture the WBC title in February last year. That came two months after Joshua avenged his only career loss to Andy Ruiz Jr, a fight which was also staged in Saudi Arabia, at the Diriyah Arena. Although news of the fight is one of boxing's worst-kept secrets, neither Joshua, his promoter Eddie Hearn or Fury's co-promoters Bob Arum and Frank Warren have officially confirmed it will take place. Last week, Hearn said that the fightwould take place in Saudi Arabiabut Fury did not mention a venue. Saudi Arabia has faced criticism from campaigners who have accused the Middle East country of trying to 'sportswash' its human rights record. ""The real question is will Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and their teams just go along with it?"" said Amnesty International UK spokesman Felix Jakens. When Joshua fought Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia in 2019, his promoter HearninsistedSaudi involvement was ""here to stay in boxing"", calling critics ""hypocrites"" and repeatedly referencing the fact other sporting institutions had worked in the country.

Early data suggests jabs work against India variant,"Vaccination buses are being used in Bolton which is a hotspot for the Indian variant The UK has ""increasing confidence"" that Covid-19 vaccines work against the Indian variant of the virus, the health secretary has said. Scientists believe that the variant is more transmissible and cases of it nearly tripled to 1,313 in the past week in England. But Matt Hancock said early lab data showed vaccines remained effective. He said the majority of those in hospital in Bolton -a hotspot for the Indian variant- were unvaccinated. More than 20 million people in the UK have now had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according tothe latest government figures.,external Mr Hancock welcomed the new milestone as ""great news"" and said the UK was making ""extraordinary strides"" as millions now have the fullest possible protection against the virus. The figures also show a further four people have died within 28 days of a positive test, and another 1,926 new infections have been identified. What are the latest changes to lockdown? Why was India not on the red list sooner? Why is the India variant causing concern in the UK? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the health secretary said that the Indian variant, known as B.1.617.2, was ""relatively widespread in small numbers"" in most of the country. It comes as England is due to move to stage three of the government's roadmap for easing lockdown on Monday, with socialising in groups of six indoors as well as some international travel to be allowed. On Friday Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the variant could pose ""serious disruption"" to the final stage of lockdown easing in England on 21 June. Mr Hancock said that it was ""quite likely"" that the variant would become the dominant strain in the UK. He said: ""What that reinforces is the importance of people coming forward for testing and being careful because this isn't over yet. ""But the good news is because we have increasing confidence that the vaccine works against the variant, the strategy is on track - it's just the virus has gained a bit of pace and we've therefore all got to be that bit more careful and cautious."" Mr Hancock also defended the easing of lockdown rules in England from Monday, saying the government's strategy was to ""replace the restrictions with vaccination"" as the first line of defence against the virus. But Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told the BBC that even though rules were being eased in most parts of the UK on Monday people should be ""very cautious about mixing"". A decision on whether all legal restrictions could be ended next month would be made on 14 June, Mr Hancock said. He also confirmed over-35s in England would be able to book an appointment for their Covid-19 jabs in the coming week. Three things explain why the government and experts are sounding so cautious. Firstly, we've known for a while that the vast majority of Covid infections take place when people mix indoors, and that's exactly what will be allowed with the next phase of lockdown easing in England on Monday. Secondly, the vaccination programme, for all its success, is still a long way from reaching all adults with two doses. And, even when it does, it can't guarantee 100% protection for everyone. Thirdly, the more transmissible Indian variant is casting an unsettling shadow over the roadmap out of lockdown. The guidance is to be concerned rather than to panic. The variant may well be less hazardous than feared but key questions about it remain unanswered. In any event, the hope is to vaccinate many more people as quickly as possible and in the meantime to highlight the risks. The advice can be summed up like this: think twice about lingering for hours in a crowded room that has little fresh air. In Bolton there are 18 people in hospital with coronavirus, with the majority of those not having the jab despite being eligible, the health secretary said. He added that five people had ended up in hospital having had one jab, while there was one there who had received both doses but was ""frail"". This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells of Indian variant hospitalisations in Bolton despite jabs The Greater Manchester town, where the Indian variant is spreading,has seen a spike in infectionsand Mr Hancock said hecould not rule out imposing local restrictions. Surge testing is taking place in targeted areas across Englandwhere virus variants have been found,,externalincluding postcodes within several London boroughs, Sefton, Worcestershire, and Nottingham. The vaccine programme is being accelerated in areas where there are rising cases from the variant, with vaccination buses being used in Bolton. Blackburn with Darwen public health director Dominic Harrisontweeted,externalthat an additional supply of more than 1,000 Pfizer-BioNTech jabs per day would be available for all residents over 18 in high variant spread areas for the next two weeks. Prof John Edmunds, who sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told Andrew Marr people should be ""concerned but not panicking"" about the new variant. ""We are in a much, much better position than we were when the Kent variant started spreading,"" he said, pointing to hospitals having few Covid patients and the vaccine programme being in place. On Thursday the number of patients in hospital with Covid dropped below 1,000 for the first time in eight months, down from the peak of nearly 40,000 in January.

Despite concerns about the Indian variant, coronavirus restrictions across England, Scotland and Wales are due to be relaxed from Monday. Curbs lifting across the devolved nations vary, but there will be a greater degree of indoor mixing allowed and more hospitality venues will be able to reopen. Northern Ireland is due to review its restrictions later this month. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with pubs, restaurants and cafes allowed to serve customers inside. Up to 30 people can meet outdoors. Museums, cinemas, theatres and sports stadiums can reopen, and indoor exercises resume. People can travel abroad to green list countries without needing to quarantine when they return. Up to six people from a maximum of three households can socialise indoors inScotland, and entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bingo halls can reopen. Alcohol can be served indoors in hospitality venues until 22:30, and international travel will be allowed in line with England's rules. InWales, pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants reopen for indoor service, with groups of up to six from six households permitted to meet. All holiday accommodation can reopen fully, as can indoor visitor attractions, such as galleries and museums. International travel can resume in line with the traffic light system. Northern Irelandis reviewing its restrictions on 20 May, with the hope more restrictions will be lifted on 24 May. You can read more about the changes across the UK here. Labour's Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said she felt worried about Monday's easing but recognised that businesses had prepared to open and that the government said vaccines were effective against the variant. She said it was right to concentrate on increasing vaccinations, testing and help fill the financial ""gap"" so people can self-isolate. On Saturday, the British Medical Association (BMA) said it had serious concerns about the decision to continue with the easing of lockdown restrictions. Meanwhile, minutes from a meeting of government scientific advisers,held on Thursday, said that,external""an even faster increase can be expected if measures are relaxed"" in areas where the Indian variant is already spreading. And if the variant was 40-50% more transmissible than the current dominant type, they warned proceeding to step three of England's roadmap on Monday would likely ""lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations (similar to, or larger than, previous peaks)"".

Why was India not on the red list sooner?,"Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's Home Affairs Committee, has criticised the delay in putting India on the government's travel-ban ""red list"". ""They should have put India on the red list at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since then, we've had this three-week period in which thousands of people have returned from India and that probably includes hundreds of the new variant Covid cases,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. India was added to the red list on 23 April, but neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh had been on it since 9 April. One of the variants of coronavirus first identified in India has spread to the UK. Just under half of these cases involve international travel and the strain has now been designated a ""variant of concern"". What is the India Covid variant? The red list is the government'slist of 43 countries,externalfrom which there are strict restrictions on travel to England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have similar rules in place with the same list of countries. The restrictions are designed to protect the UK from new variants, against which vaccines may be less effective and which may spread more easily. Which countries are on the red list? What are the Indian, Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? India red list add 'may be too late', Prof Mark Walport says Travel to England is banned for anyone who has been in one of the countries in the past 10 days, except for UK citizens and residents, who have to isolate on arrival at government-approved hotels. Direct flights are banned from most red list countries, but not Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya and India. The government says this is to allow critical freight and make it easier for British nationals to return home. The decision is based on Joint Biosecurity Centre risk assessments, which include: how good a country's testing structures are, including checking for variants how many cases those systems have identified whether people in that country have been catching new variants at home or the cases have come from overseas evidence of whether that country has exported cases of new variants to other countries, including to the UK how good the country's travel links with the UK are The first point is important, because the genome sequencing needed to identify new variants is very sophisticated and relatively rare. But just because a country has found variants of concern, or has many cases of coronavirus, it will not necessarily be on the red list. On 18 May,external, the World Health Organization identified: 106 countries where the variant identified in South Africa had been found, of which 28 are on the red list 61 countries with the variant identified in Brazil, of which 19 are on the red list 48 countries with the variant identified in India, of which 6 are on the red list. Bangladesh had the South Africa but not the Brazil variant and Pakistan had neither when they were added to the red list on 9 April. India had both, as well as a new variant, but was not added for another two weeks. On 9 April: Pakistan had a seven-day average of 21 cases per million people Bangladesh had twice as many India had four times as many Health Secretary Matt Hancock said these figures depended on how much testing was being done and said ""far more"" was carried out in India. He said the decision to add Pakistan and Bangladesh earlier was based on a higher proportion of people arriving in the UK from these countries, testing positive for coronavirus. ""When we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India,"" Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May. Figures from NHS Test and Trace,externaldo not support that claim. For the period 25 March to 7 April, the positivity rate from Bangladesh was 3.7%, from India was 5.1% and from Pakistan was 6.2%. Mr Hancock was asked about this in Parliament on 19 May and said: ""The positivity rate in India, on which the decision to put Pakistan but not India on the red list was 1.6% in India and 4.6% in Pakistan, which is three times higher, as I said."" But those are not published figures. He didn't give the date for them and didn't mention Bangladesh this time. Checking Matt Hancock's claim about Covid cases from India ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said. Boris Johnson had planned a trade visit to India but cancelled iton 19 April- days before the country was added to the red list. One of the variants first identified in India was designated as a variant of concern on 7 May. By 17 May, 2,323 cases of this variant had been found in the UK, of which 483 had been in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. The WHO said,externalit appeared to have a higher rate of transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines may be less effective against it. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cited fears of the India variant on 14 May as one of the reasons why Glasgow and Moray willnot have restrictions eased as planned. In the four weeks before India was added to the red list, 6,560 people were tested on arrival in England from India. Of those, 425 tested positive for coronavirus, which is about 6%. The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according toa 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Almost 60% of positive Covid19 tests are now sent for genome sequencing to identify new variants, which means the government has a good idea of where the cases are. Asked about the delays in adding India to the red list, the UK's former chief scientific adviser Prof Mark Walport told the BBC: ""These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth.""

The new rules for foreign travel,"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. However people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. There are still some restrictions in place inNorthern Ireland: 10 people from three households can meet and stay indoors in private dwellings and holiday accommodation Unlimited households can meet outdoors Social distancing of 1m (3ft) remains for many indoors activities, including restaurants, retail and shopping centres No social distancing laws outdoors, or on public transport, but 1m (3ft) recommended The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September. What can you now do across the UK? How are social distancing rules changing now? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. Indoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue tocollect customer contact details,external. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. Nightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland. TheCommon Travel Area (CTA),externalis a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Travel within the CTA is not considered international travel. Fully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip.

US climate envoy criticised for clean tech optimism,"This video can not be played US climate envoy John Kerry: 50% of carbon emission cuts to come from technology ""we don't yet have"" Americaâs climate envoy John Kerry has been ridiculed for saying technologies that donât yet exist will play a huge role in stabilising the climate. Speaking on the BBCâs Andrew Marr show, he said the US was leading the world on climate change - and rapidly phasing out coal-fired power stations. But he rejected a suggestion that Americans need to change their consumption patterns by, say, eating less meat. He said: âYou don't have to give up quality of life to achieve some of the things we want to achieve. âIâm told by scientists that 50% of the reductions we have to make (to get to near zero emissions) by 2050 or 2045  are going to come from technologies we donât yet have.â Banish coal, urges UK head of UN climate summit COP26: What, where, when? A really simple guide to climate change But his faith in unknown technologies has left some leading engineers aghast. Julian Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at the University of Cambridge, told BBC News: ""It's virtually impossible for new energy infrastructure technologies to have a significant effect on global emissions in the time we have left to act."" He warned that with every new energy-infrastructure technology so far, it's taken 30-100 years from invention to 5% penetration of existing markets. Julian Allwood says the most important innovations will come in areas such as remote working ""Firstly,"" he said, ""the new idea is developed from laboratory through increasing pilot scales to initial introduction to national systems. âWe have to solve physical and operational issues, solve problems with integration, develop legal and environmental regulations, understand financing requirements and explore social consent as the first accidents occur. âGrowth then occurs at a linear rate, as government appetite for risk is constrained, and the incumbent technology fights to avoid closure."" He said no country has ever introduced a new electricity generating technology at an average rate faster than 2% of national demand per year. âDespite politicians' wishful thinking,"" he continued, ""the most important innovation opportunities will be not about new technologies, but new businesses in areas such as remote working."" Dr Jen Baxter, a spokeswoman for the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, agreed that John Kerryâs timescale âseems very optimisticâ. She said some vital existing technologies such as capturing carbon from power stations and sucking CO2 directly from the air are not yet ready for mass usage. So, rather than putting faith in start-up technologies, the world should focus on existing technologies. âWe need to make use of every technology,â she said. âItâs going to be a massive amount of work and these time frames are going to be long.â âThere needs to be lifestyle changes, too - such as getting people on to public transport.â The prominent British engineer, Baroness Brown, said the climate crisis couldnât be solved without eating less meat. Some scientists, though, applauded Mr Kerryâs techno-optimism. Craig Bennett said most benefits would come from existing industries such as solar The UKâs former chief scientist, Professor Dave King, is a leading voice in Mission Innovation - a global initiative working to accelerate clean energy innovation. Itâs spending $25bn of public money between the 25 nations in the coalition, rising to more than $40bn by 2025. He said: ""We need regulatory measures to bring the new technologies rapidly into the market place, and carbon  pricing on oil, gas and coal extraction to speed up the process."" But he, too, agreed we also need lifestyle changes - and new rules to force clean technologies on to the market. Craig Bennett from the UK Wildlife Trusts told BBC News Mr Kerryâs remarks were âfrankly ridiculousâ. He said: âOf course we will benefit from new technologies, but they are most likely to be in industries that already exist such as renewables and energy storage - rather than some widget that we canât imagine at the moment.â âWe also need some forms of behaviour change, like walking and cycling more and eating less meat. These policies deliver health benefits anyway.â In his interview, Mr Kerry defended the US record on combating climate change, saying President Biden was leading the charge to get to net zero. Mr Kerry says it is now impossible to finance coal-fired power plants in the US He said some 58 US coal-fired power stations were slated for closure, and said it was impossible to get finance to build new ones: ""The marketplace has made a decision about coal. You couldnât build a new coal fired power plant in the United States because you canât finance it, nor even in Europe and other places. âWeâve been pushing very hard for countries to begin to move away from fossil fuel and towards alternative, renewable, sustainable energy sources and I think, again, the marketplace is going to make that happen."" He said it was US policy to switch to renewable energy sources as quickly as possible: ""We are moving to alternative renewable energy. Our incentives are towards renewable alternative energy. Seventy-five percent of the electricity thatâs new, that came online in the last years, came online through renewables. âSo, weâre going to do what we need to do to do our fair share of this and to take a leadership role and weâre doing that now."" He rejected  pessimism on climate change and said: âWeâll not only get there (to Net Zero emissions), weâll get there sooner than people think.""

Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many,"Alys Patosit has three jobs, but says buying a home is out of her family's reach. For many working parents in Wales, buying their own home is an ""unachievable dream,"" according to three charities. Nearly half the homeowners helped by the Help to Buy scheme in 2020-21 earned at least Â£40,000. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said evidence suggested it was ""not helping people on lower incomes"". The Welsh government said a new phase of the scheme will help those ""who most need support"". Alys Patosit, 41, and her husband Pin, 48, live in Monmouthshire with their two children. Mrs Patosit works part-time as an administrative assistant and as a carer for the elderly, as well as running her own online business, but said her family might never be able to afford their own home, no matter how hard they work. ""Since returning to work after having my children, I have found myself working three jobs and still having to claim Universal Credit to make ends meet, leaving us with nothing to save for a deposit,"" she said. ""We dream of being able to afford a modest home in the area I grew up in, but we feel trapped in a cycle and having housing security feels impossible, sometimes it feels completely hopeless."" Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses House sales and prices see early spring surge 5% deposit mortgage 'will help daughter's future' Help to Buy is a scheme which allows those eligible to buy a new-build property up to the value of Â£250,000 with help from the Welsh government by way of a shared equity loan. Since January 2014, 11,959 properties have been purchased using a Help to Buy loan in Wales. A recent official report on the scheme found that, over the last three years, the proportion of completed purchases by those on higher incomes had increased. ""During 2020-21, 49% of all homes purchased under the scheme were by those with an average household income of Â£40,000 to Â£60,000,"" saidthe report,external. ""In contrast, homes purchased by those with a household income of less than Â£20,000 have been decreasing annually and in 2020-21 accounted for only 2% of all completed purchases using the scheme."" Carmen Jackson, co-ordinator of Home-Start's Helping Working Families project across Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly, said: ""Housing is an issue that comes up again and again with many of our families. ""Feelings are running high about the current housing situation. Many families feel that home ownership for their family is a completely unachievable dream. ""We have found in some regions, social housing stock is low, which creates demand for rentals, forcing up the prices of rentals which makes investors buying homes as buy-to-lets attractive and making home ownership unrealistic for all but the wealthiest."" She added that affordable housing seemed to be only affordable where both parents were working full-time on a good wage or have significant help from family. ""We are noticing the knock-on effects for families, with families either overstretching themselves to try to create better lives for their families or feeling hopeless because the dream is completely out of reach,"" she said. Eve (who did not want her surname published), her husband and three children bought a home through the Help to Buy scheme, but were disappointed. ""The government's idea of affordable and most working families' incomes don't match up,"" said Eve. ""We ended up buying a house that's really too small for our family and needs loads of work doing, that we can't afford to do, but we were desperate. ""Local rents are just too high, the stress was wearing us down."" Dr Steffan Evans, policy and research officer at the Bevan Foundation, said: ""There have long been questions about whether Help to Buy is a scheme that helps boost the availability of genuinely affordable housing. ""The latest evidence adds further weight to these concerns. Investing the funds in other programmes such as the Social Housing Grant, which funds the construction of new social housing, could prove to be far more effective use of Welsh government funds."" Rachel Casey of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says support is not being given to the people who need it most Rachel Casey, policy and partnerships officer at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ""Even before coronavirus, around 700,000 people in Wales were trapped in poverty. Together with low wages and inadequate benefit levels, high private rents lock people in Wales in poverty. ""So it's not right that the majority of support in the housing market is currently being directed towards people who are not in poverty and who may already own their own homes. ""This evidence suggests that the Help to Buy scheme in Wales is not helping people on lower incomes to access home ownership, but instead supporting people on higher incomes. ""Across the UK, the stamp duty holiday policy is benefiting existing homeowners but making it much harder for renters to get on the property ladder."" Movers 'more likely to buy than first-time buyers' What does the chancellor's Budget mean for me? A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We understand the difficulties first-time buyers face and the uncertainties in the jobs market as a result of the pandemic. ""Our Help to Buy Wales scheme plays an important role in helping people get onto the property ladder with three-quarters of the 12,000 homes already delivered through the programme going to first-time buyers. ""Phase 3 of Help to Buy Wales was launched last month and has been designed to ensure the scheme further benefits those who most need support in securing home ownership.""

Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday.

Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Poots to consult party over Foster FM departure,"Edwin Poots was elected as the DUP's fourth leader in its 50 year history on Friday The next Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Edwin Poots has indicated he will consult with the party about whether Arlene Foster should stand down as first minister earlier than her intended departure date. Mrs Fostersaid she would stay onas first minister until the end of June. Mr Poots said he was keen to ensure a smooth transition. In an interview with theSunday Life newspaper,external, he confirmed he would not take the first minister post himself. Mr Poots added that party members could also judge whether he is the ""right man to stay"" in his current role as agriculture minister, or whether he should take on a different brief or leave ministerial office. Edwin Poots: Who is the new leader of the DUP? Analysis: Poots facing big questions after landing dream job ""I want our party to be a party that is healing and fit for purpose going forward. Therefore, I will deal with things as gently as I possibly can but also practically going forward,"" he told the newspaper. ""I will ascertain those views over the next few days."" Among those tipped as possible successors as first minister are DUP MLAs Mervyn Storey, Paul Givan, Paul Frew and the party's new deputy leader Paula Bradley. On Friday,Mr Poots defeated his Lagan Valley constituency colleague Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MPin the DUP's first contested leadership election in its 50-year history. Paula Bradley was elected to the role of DUP deputy leader on Friday Mr Poots said advice from colleagues will be ""critical"" to determining any changes to the DUP's ministerial team. He explained that by rejecting the role of first minister, which has been held by previous DUP leaders, whoever occupies it instead can focus on ""leading the country and dealing with the machinations of government"". PM leads reaction to election of Edwin Poots From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? ""The leader of unionism can focus on reinvigorating unionism,"" he continued. ""This is absolutely critical now"". With an assembly election a year away in 2022, Mr Poots said he planned to speak with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) about ways to maximise the unionist vote. He described the possibility of Sinn FÃ©in becoming Stormont's largest party and nominating a first minister as ""destabilising"" and ""something a lot of people would find hard to swallow"". The potential for a Sinn FÃ©in justice minister ""would create problems"", he added, ""given the history of Sinn FÃ©in and where they have come from and the attitude they had during the Troubles towards IRA violence"". Mr Poots said he wants unionist parties to cooperate to find a ""solution"" to the issues arising from the Northern Ireland Protocol, an element of the UK-EU Brexit deal which has led to disruption and additional checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? The DUP leader designate said he has requested to meet the prime minister and NI Secretary Brandon Lewis to discuss the issues and will ""certainly be ramping things"" in expressing his opposition to the protocol. ""I have been working with a senior UK lawyer who is advising us on what steps we can take in terms of judicial remedies,"" he said. ""If there isn't real significant political progress made in the coming weeks, I would imagine we would be launching judicial proceedings in the not too distant future."" UUP leadership candidate Doug Beattie has accused the DUP of not being honest on the Northern Ireland Protocol Mr Poots re-stated that he wouldnot be attending North-South Ministerial Council meetingsuntil there was a resolution. He accused the Irish government of having ""hugely damaged north-south relations in their conduct over the protocol, the demands they have made and the aggressive nature"". DUP MLA Christopher Stalford, who supported Mr Poots' leadership campaign, told Sunday Politics that all unionist parties agree ""the protocol has to go"". ""The provision in the law says if 45 members of the assembly vote to remove the protocol then it will go and that is where I think that we do need to see, I don't want to talk about pacts, or stuff like that, but we do need to see a degree of cooperation across the broad unionist family in order to ensure that 45 unionists are elected to Stormont in the next assembly election."" However, Doug Beattie, currently the only candidate for the UUP leadership, accused the DUP of ""not being honest with the electorate"" on efforts to scrap the protocol. Mr Beattie told Sunday Politics the assembly cannot vote to end the protocol if unionists return with 45 MLAs, rather, only articles five to ten can be replaced. ""We have to start this off by being as honest as we possibly can,"" he said. ""We want rid of the protocol, but we have worked really hard to try and put in alternatives and mitigations to get rid of that protocol, but what we will not be doing is telling people an untruth to garner support.""

Deaths mount in Gaza as UN meeting begins,"This video can not be played Homes and buildings destroyed in Israel and Gaza Israel's military operation against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza will continue ""with full force"", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. ""We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore calm... It will take time,"" Mr Netanyahu warned. Gaza officials said 42 people, including 16 women and 10 children, died in the latest Israeli air strikes. Ten people, including two children, have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel since Monday, Israel said. The overall death toll in Gaza now stands at 197 people, including 58 children and 34 women, with 1,235 injured, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Meanwhile, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting, with international mediators hoping to broker a ceasefire. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres opened the meeting by describing the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Rockets launched by Hamas have hit Ashkelon, southern Israel Sunday was thedeadliest day so far The Israeli air strikes hit a busy street in Gaza just after midnight on Sunday, causing at least three buildings to collapse and dozens of deaths. Hamas launched barrage of rockets towards southern Israel overnight and during the afternoon. Millions of Israelis scrambled to safe rooms or shelters as sirens went off. Palestinians also tried to take precautions, but in the densely packed and poorly resourced Gaza Strip, many had nowhere to go. Riyad Eshkuntana told Reuters news agency he put his daughters to sleep in a room of his house that he thought was the furthest from the explosions. Only one of his daughters, Suzy, six, survived the night. His wife and three other children died. ""I ran to check upon the girls,"" said Mr Eshkuntana. ""My wife jumped she hugged the girls to take them out from the room, then a second airstrike hit the room... The ceilings were destroyed and I was under the rubble."" The Israeli military later said it had been conducted a strikes on a militant tunnel system in the area. The tunnels' collapsed caused the houses above to collapse as well, leading to unintended civilian casualties, it said. Suzy, six, was rescued from rubble in Gaza City on Sunday, but five members of her family died Israel's military says it has been targeting leaders and infrastructure linked to Hamas. It said it had also struck the homes of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad Sinwar, whom it described as head of logistics and manpower for the movement. It was unlikely they were at home at the time of the strikes, according to the Associated Press news agency. Gazan rescue workers spent the day trying to rescue people from under the debris from the strikes. The Palestinian health ministry said a doctor was among the dead: Dr Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, head of internal medicine at Shifa hospital and part of the coronavirus team. What is Hamas? How Israel's Iron Dome missile shield works Boris Johnson condemns 'shameful' anti-Semitism in video In Israel, Hamas rockets hit Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and other parts of central and southern Israel. There were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it had seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the past week. The country's Iron Dome defence systemhas intercepted many of them. But some caused damage to cars and buildings, including the Yad Michael synagogue in Ashkelon, where a hole was blasted through the wall just before an evening service for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. No-one was reported hurt and locals moved quickly to clear up the damage so the service could go ahead, according to the Times of Israel. Israelis clean up a rocket-damaged synagogue in Ashkelon A car-ramming incident also took place in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem on Sunday evening. An Israeli police spokesman said the driver had been shot dead and four Israeli officers injured. The threat to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah to make way for Israeli settlers sparked the current round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. Those tensions culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews, and, on Monday, Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. By Paul Adams, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent Is Israel's military operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Guardian of the Walls"", nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks are continuing with ""full force"" and will ""take time"". In a news conference on Sunday, he admitted there were ""pressures"" but thanked US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, such as Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israel's estimation, we have not reached that point yet. What happenedduringthe UN meeting? The 15-member UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a public statement in recent days and none was forthcoming after the meeting. The United States - a strong ally of Israel - is said to be the hold-out, believing it would be unhelpful in the diplomatic process. In Sunday's meeting, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the US was ready to offer support ""should the parties seek a ceasefire"" and had been working tirelessly to try to bring an end to the conflict. Palestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, spoke of Saturday's attack on a refugee camp, which killed 10 members of the same family, leaving a five-month-old survivor to be pulled from the rubble. ""Israel often asks us to put ourselves in their shoes,"" he said, ""but they are not wearing shoes. They're wearing military boots."" In response, Israel's Permanent Representative, Gilad Erdan, cited the death of a 10-year-old Arab-Israeli girl, killed by a Hamas rocket. He insisted Israel was mounting what he called ""a heroic effort"" to ""dismantle terrorist infrastructure and avoid civilian casualties"". Mr Erdan ended by urging the Security Council to unequivocally condemn Hamas but warned that Israel would take all steps necessary to protect itself. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for manyNearly half the homeowners helped by the Help to Buy scheme earn at least Â£40,000, a report says.Wales","Alys Patosit has three jobs, but says buying a home is out of her family's reach. For many working parents in Wales, buying their own home is an ""unachievable dream,"" according to three charities. Nearly half the homeowners helped by the Help to Buy scheme in 2020-21 earned at least Â£40,000. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said evidence suggested it was ""not helping people on lower incomes"". The Welsh government said a new phase of the scheme will help those ""who most need support"". Alys Patosit, 41, and her husband Pin, 48, live in Monmouthshire with their two children. Mrs Patosit works part-time as an administrative assistant and as a carer for the elderly, as well as running her own online business, but said her family might never be able to afford their own home, no matter how hard they work. ""Since returning to work after having my children, I have found myself working three jobs and still having to claim Universal Credit to make ends meet, leaving us with nothing to save for a deposit,"" she said. ""We dream of being able to afford a modest home in the area I grew up in, but we feel trapped in a cycle and having housing security feels impossible, sometimes it feels completely hopeless."" Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses House sales and prices see early spring surge 5% deposit mortgage 'will help daughter's future' Help to Buy is a scheme which allows those eligible to buy a new-build property up to the value of Â£250,000 with help from the Welsh government by way of a shared equity loan. Since January 2014, 11,959 properties have been purchased using a Help to Buy loan in Wales. A recent official report on the scheme found that, over the last three years, the proportion of completed purchases by those on higher incomes had increased. ""During 2020-21, 49% of all homes purchased under the scheme were by those with an average household income of Â£40,000 to Â£60,000,"" saidthe report,external. ""In contrast, homes purchased by those with a household income of less than Â£20,000 have been decreasing annually and in 2020-21 accounted for only 2% of all completed purchases using the scheme."" Carmen Jackson, co-ordinator of Home-Start's Helping Working Families project across Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly, said: ""Housing is an issue that comes up again and again with many of our families. ""Feelings are running high about the current housing situation. Many families feel that home ownership for their family is a completely unachievable dream. ""We have found in some regions, social housing stock is low, which creates demand for rentals, forcing up the prices of rentals which makes investors buying homes as buy-to-lets attractive and making home ownership unrealistic for all but the wealthiest."" She added that affordable housing seemed to be only affordable where both parents were working full-time on a good wage or have significant help from family. ""We are noticing the knock-on effects for families, with families either overstretching themselves to try to create better lives for their families or feeling hopeless because the dream is completely out of reach,"" she said. Eve (who did not want her surname published), her husband and three children bought a home through the Help to Buy scheme, but were disappointed. ""The government's idea of affordable and most working families' incomes don't match up,"" said Eve. ""We ended up buying a house that's really too small for our family and needs loads of work doing, that we can't afford to do, but we were desperate. ""Local rents are just too high, the stress was wearing us down."" Dr Steffan Evans, policy and research officer at the Bevan Foundation, said: ""There have long been questions about whether Help to Buy is a scheme that helps boost the availability of genuinely affordable housing. ""The latest evidence adds further weight to these concerns. Investing the funds in other programmes such as the Social Housing Grant, which funds the construction of new social housing, could prove to be far more effective use of Welsh government funds."" Rachel Casey of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says support is not being given to the people who need it most Rachel Casey, policy and partnerships officer at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ""Even before coronavirus, around 700,000 people in Wales were trapped in poverty. Together with low wages and inadequate benefit levels, high private rents lock people in Wales in poverty. ""So it's not right that the majority of support in the housing market is currently being directed towards people who are not in poverty and who may already own their own homes. ""This evidence suggests that the Help to Buy scheme in Wales is not helping people on lower incomes to access home ownership, but instead supporting people on higher incomes. ""Across the UK, the stamp duty holiday policy is benefiting existing homeowners but making it much harder for renters to get on the property ladder."" Movers 'more likely to buy than first-time buyers' What does the chancellor's Budget mean for me? A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We understand the difficulties first-time buyers face and the uncertainties in the jobs market as a result of the pandemic. ""Our Help to Buy Wales scheme plays an important role in helping people get onto the property ladder with three-quarters of the 12,000 homes already delivered through the programme going to first-time buyers. ""Phase 3 of Help to Buy Wales was launched last month and has been designed to ensure the scheme further benefits those who most need support in securing home ownership.""

Deaths mount in Gaza as UN meeting beginsThe UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting as mediators try to broker a ceasefire.Middle East,"This video can not be played Homes and buildings destroyed in Israel and Gaza Israel's military operation against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza will continue ""with full force"", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said.

""Since returning to work after having my children, I have found myself working three jobs and still having to claim Universal Credit to make ends meet, leaving us with nothing to save for a deposit,"" she said. ""We dream of being able to afford a modest home in the area I grew up in, but we feel trapped in a cycle and having housing security feels impossible, sometimes it feels completely hopeless."" Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses House sales and prices see early spring surge 5% deposit mortgage 'will help daughter's future' Help to Buy is a scheme which allows those eligible to buy a new-build property up to the value of Â£250,000 with help from the Welsh government by way of a shared equity loan. Since January 2014, 11,959 properties have been purchased using a Help to Buy loan in Wales. A recent official report on the scheme found that, over the last three years, the proportion of completed purchases by those on higher incomes had increased. ""During 2020-21, 49% of all homes purchased under the scheme were by those with an average household income of Â£40,000 to Â£60,000,"" saidthe report,external. ""In contrast, homes purchased by those with a household income of less than Â£20,000 have been decreasing annually and in 2020-21 accounted for only 2% of all completed purchases using the scheme."" Carmen Jackson, co-ordinator of Home-Start's Helping Working Families project across Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly, said: ""Housing is an issue that comes up again and again with many of our families. ""Feelings are running high about the current housing situation. Many families feel that home ownership for their family is a completely unachievable dream. ""We have found in some regions, social housing stock is low, which creates demand for rentals, forcing up the prices of rentals which makes investors buying homes as buy-to-lets attractive and making home ownership unrealistic for all but the wealthiest."" She added that affordable housing seemed to be only affordable where both parents were working full-time on a good wage or have significant help from family. ""We are noticing the knock-on effects for families, with families either overstretching themselves to try to create better lives for their families or feeling hopeless because the dream is completely out of reach,"" she said. Eve (who did not want her surname published), her husband and three children bought a home through the Help to Buy scheme, but were disappointed. ""The government's idea of affordable and most working families' incomes don't match up,"" said Eve. ""We ended up buying a house that's really too small for our family and needs loads of work doing, that we can't afford to do, but we were desperate. ""Local rents are just too high, the stress was wearing us down."" Dr Steffan Evans, policy and research officer at the Bevan Foundation, said: ""There have long been questions about whether Help to Buy is a scheme that helps boost the availability of genuinely affordable housing. ""The latest evidence adds further weight to these concerns. Investing the funds in other programmes such as the Social Housing Grant, which funds the construction of new social housing, could prove to be far more effective use of Welsh government funds."" Rachel Casey of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says support is not being given to the people who need it most Rachel Casey, policy and partnerships officer at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ""Even before coronavirus, around 700,000 people in Wales were trapped in poverty. Together with low wages and inadequate benefit levels, high private rents lock people in Wales in poverty. ""So it's not right that the majority of support in the housing market is currently being directed towards people who are not in poverty and who may already own their own homes. ""This evidence suggests that the Help to Buy scheme in Wales is not helping people on lower incomes to access home ownership, but instead supporting people on higher incomes. ""Across the UK, the stamp duty holiday policy is benefiting existing homeowners but making it much harder for renters to get on the property ladder."" Movers 'more likely to buy than first-time buyers' What does the chancellor's Budget mean for me? A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We understand the difficulties first-time buyers face and the uncertainties in the jobs market as a result of the pandemic. ""Our Help to Buy Wales scheme plays an important role in helping people get onto the property ladder with three-quarters of the 12,000 homes already delivered through the programme going to first-time buyers. ""Phase 3 of Help to Buy Wales was launched last month and has been designed to ensure the scheme further benefits those who most need support in securing home ownership.""

LiveLiveStrikes on Gaza claim more lives ahead of UN meeting16 minutes ago,"Israelâs prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says its military operation against Hamas will continue ""with full force"" despite international calls for a ceasefire The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says 188 Palestinians have died since Monday, and Israel has reported 10 dead Sunday marks the seventh day of elevated Israeli-Palestinian violence, the worst since 2014 More rockets have been fired from Gaza towards southern Israel. Israel says the concentration of rocket fire in the past week has been the highest ever The UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting to discuss the hostilities UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged all parties to end the ""utterly appalling"" violence Israel says air strikes targeted the home of Hamas's leader in Gaza overnight Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours:  You can still get all the latest updates on this fast-moving storyon the BBC News website. Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Opposition Labour leaderKeir Starmer said the incident was ""utterly disgusting"",external, tweeting that there had to be consequences: ""Antisemitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society."" The Jewish community's Community Security Trust said it was fully aware of ""appalling anti-Semitic intimidation and incitement from [a] âpro-Palestinianâ car convoy from Bradford"". The Mayor of LondonSadiq Khan has said he is deeply concerned,externalby reports of ""hateful, intimidating and racist language used on marches and social media"". ""Behaviour that incites anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred has no place in our city,"" he said. We have more details on this story here. Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday. Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties. This video can not be played The fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza is taking a brutal toll on people's everyday lives. Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

How does surge testing for the Indian variant work?,"Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found. This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants. Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? Surge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid.

Poots wants smooth DUP leadership transition,"Edwin Poots was elected as the DUP's fourth leader in its 50 year history on Friday The next Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Edwin Poots has indicated he will consult with the party about whether Arlene Foster should stand down as first minister earlier than her intended departure date. Mrs Fostersaid she would stay onas first minister until the end of June. Mr Poots said he was keen to ensure a smooth transition. In an interview with theSunday Life newspaper,external, he confirmed he would not take the first minister post himself. Mr Poots added that party members could also judge whether he is the ""right man to stay"" in his current role as agriculture minister, or whether he should take on a different brief or leave ministerial office. Edwin Poots: Who is the new leader of the DUP? Analysis: Poots facing big questions after landing dream job ""I want our party to be a party that is healing and fit for purpose going forward. Therefore, I will deal with things as gently as I possibly can but also practically going forward,"" he told the newspaper. ""I will ascertain those views over the next few days."" Among those tipped as possible successors as first minister are DUP MLAs Mervyn Storey, Paul Givan, Paul Frew and the party's new deputy leader Paula Bradley. On Friday,Mr Poots defeated his Lagan Valley constituency colleague Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MPin the DUP's first contested leadership election in its 50-year history. Paula Bradley was elected to the role of DUP deputy leader on Friday Mr Poots said advice from colleagues will be ""critical"" to determining any changes to the DUP's ministerial team. He explained that by rejecting the role of first minister, which has been held by previous DUP leaders, whoever occupies it instead can focus on ""leading the country and dealing with the machinations of government"". PM leads reaction to election of Edwin Poots From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? ""The leader of unionism can focus on reinvigorating unionism,"" he continued. ""This is absolutely critical now"". With an assembly election a year away in 2022, Mr Poots said he planned to speak with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) about ways to maximise the unionist vote. He described the possibility of Sinn FÃ©in becoming Stormont's largest party and nominating a first minister as ""destabilising"" and ""something a lot of people would find hard to swallow"". The potential for a Sinn FÃ©in justice minister ""would create problems"", he added, ""given the history of Sinn FÃ©in and where they have come from and the attitude they had during the Troubles towards IRA violence"". Mr Poots said he wants unionist parties to cooperate to find a ""solution"" to the issues arising from the Northern Ireland Protocol, an element of the UK-EU Brexit deal which has led to disruption and additional checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? The DUP leader designate said he has requested to meet the prime minister and NI Secretary Brandon Lewis to discuss the issues and will ""certainly be ramping things"" in expressing his opposition to the protocol. ""I have been working with a senior UK lawyer who is advising us on what steps we can take in terms of judicial remedies,"" he said. ""If there isn't real significant political progress made in the coming weeks, I would imagine we would be launching judicial proceedings in the not too distant future."" UUP leadership candidate Doug Beattie has accused the DUP of not being honest on the Northern Ireland Protocol Mr Poots re-stated that he wouldnot be attending North-South Ministerial Council meetingsuntil there was a resolution. He accused the Irish government of having ""hugely damaged north-south relations in their conduct over the protocol, the demands they have made and the aggressive nature"". DUP MLA Christopher Stalford, who supported Mr Poots' leadership campaign, told Sunday Politics that all unionist parties agree ""the protocol has to go"". ""The provision in the law says if 45 members of the assembly vote to remove the protocol then it will go and that is where I think that we do need to see, I don't want to talk about pacts, or stuff like that, but we do need to see a degree of cooperation across the broad unionist family in order to ensure that 45 unionists are elected to Stormont in the next assembly election."" However, Doug Beattie, currently the only candidate for the UUP leadership, accused the DUP of ""not being honest with the electorate"" on efforts to scrap the protocol. Mr Beattie told Sunday Politics the assembly cannot vote to end the protocol if unionists return with 45 MLAs, rather, only articles five to ten can be replaced. ""We have to start this off by being as honest as we possibly can,"" he said. ""We want rid of the protocol, but we have worked really hard to try and put in alternatives and mitigations to get rid of that protocol, but what we will not be doing is telling people an untruth to garner support.""

Police recruitment 'a challenge' in working class areas,"Recruitment from some communities remains a challenge for policing in Northern Ireland Isaac Andrews is rarely off his phone. As a community worker in the unionist and loyalist Shankill area of Belfast, he responds to calls from local residents who are often in need of help or advice. His role also involves liaising with the police on a range of community policing matters. Yet, he doesn't know anyone who has joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Isaac Andrews said most officers he works with are not from a working class background ""I'm sadly not aware of one person that I could tell you that I know from a working class background recently has joined the PSNI,"" he said. ""Most of the PSNI officers who I work with are from the suburbs, somewhere else in Belfast, but they're not working class."" Police reform via the Patten Commission Report was a key part of the peace process. However, two decades after the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was superseded by the PSNI, recruitment from some communities remains a challenge for policing in Northern Ireland. Peter Sheridan said ""deep-rooted divisions"" make policing some communities difficult ""A lot of change happened in policing, like badges, uniforms, symbols, human-rights training,"" said Peter Sheridan, a former PSNI assistant chief constable. ""Unfortunately I think what happened is that all of those, if you like, shiny new police officers and new ideas and the new recruits went out into a society that largely hadn't changed, those deep-rooted divisions were there so that makes policing that environment still very difficult - and I think then that started to impact again more so in recent times around the politicisation of policing."" Police transformation was intended to build support for policing from all communities but attracting Catholics remains an issue for the PSNI. The ongoing dissident republican threat to police officers, as witnessed in recent weeks, is seen as a major factor in Catholic under-representation. Emmet Doyle said he is unaware of anyone from his community who has joined the PSNI Emmet Doyle is the AontÃº councillor for Ballyarnett on Derry City and Strabane District Council. ""I'm 34 and I don't know anyone, certainly from the area where I am, who has joined the PSNI,"" he said. ""There is a trade-off I suppose that many people from a nationalist/republican community would see when you join the police. ""It's almost accepted that you won't be part of the community anymore and that's not necessarily something I agree with but that's the reality of it."" There has been a drop-off in applications from the Catholic community in recent years - the 2018 recruitment campaign had around 500 fewer applicants than the year before. Add to that, the problem in trying to attract working-class Protestants, women, ethnic minorities and members of the LGBT community. Chief Constable Simon Byrne said there is ""more to do"" in order to reach out to working class communities ""The police service should reflect the society it comes from,"" said Peter Sheridan. ""We wanted young people from the Shankill Road, from Creggan, from the Bogside - that's what moderates policing when you have people from those communities - and if that disconnect is happening then it's not just a matter for the police and the police recruitment, it's a matter for all of society."" Chief Constable Simon Byrne said that in terms of recruitment, there is ""more to do"". ""I think we have tried certainly in my time, in the last recruitment round which has been the first under my tenure, we did reach out into working class loyalist and Catholic communities to try and attract people from there,"" he said. ""I think there's a recognition that there's more space to actually recruit people from all sorts of different backgrounds and it's a key commitment that I want to see fulfilled.""

Israeli PM vows to continue Gaza strikes,"This video can not be played Homes and buildings destroyed in Israel and Gaza Israel's military operation against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza will continue ""with full force"", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. ""We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore calm... It will take time,"" Mr Netanyahu warned. Gaza officials said 42 people, including 16 women and 10 children, died in the latest Israeli air strikes. Ten people, including two children, have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel since Monday, Israel said. The overall death toll in Gaza now stands at 197 people, including 58 children and 34 women, with 1,235 injured, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Meanwhile, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting, with international mediators hoping to broker a ceasefire. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres opened the meeting by describing the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Rockets launched by Hamas have hit Ashkelon, southern Israel Sunday was thedeadliest day so far The Israeli air strikes hit a busy street in Gaza just after midnight on Sunday, causing at least three buildings to collapse and dozens of deaths. Hamas launched barrage of rockets towards southern Israel overnight and during the afternoon. Millions of Israelis scrambled to safe rooms or shelters as sirens went off. Palestinians also tried to take precautions, but in the densely packed and poorly resourced Gaza Strip, many had nowhere to go. Riyad Eshkuntana told Reuters news agency he put his daughters to sleep in a room of his house that he thought was the furthest from the explosions. Only one of his daughters, Suzy, six, survived the night. His wife and three other children died. ""I ran to check upon the girls,"" said Mr Eshkuntana. ""My wife jumped she hugged the girls to take them out from the room, then a second airstrike hit the room... The ceilings were destroyed and I was under the rubble."" The Israeli military later said it had been conducted a strikes on a militant tunnel system in the area. The tunnels' collapsed caused the houses above to collapse as well, leading to unintended civilian casualties, it said. Suzy, six, was rescued from rubble in Gaza City on Sunday, but five members of her family died Israel's military says it has been targeting leaders and infrastructure linked to Hamas. It said it had also struck the homes of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad Sinwar, whom it described as head of logistics and manpower for the movement. It was unlikely they were at home at the time of the strikes, according to the Associated Press news agency. Gazan rescue workers spent the day trying to rescue people from under the debris from the strikes. The Palestinian health ministry said a doctor was among the dead: Dr Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, head of internal medicine at Shifa hospital and part of the coronavirus team. What is Hamas? How Israel's Iron Dome missile shield works Boris Johnson condemns 'shameful' anti-Semitism in video In Israel, Hamas rockets hit Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and other parts of central and southern Israel. There were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it had seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the past week. The country's Iron Dome defence systemhas intercepted many of them. But some caused damage to cars and buildings, including the Yad Michael synagogue in Ashkelon, where a hole was blasted through the wall just before an evening service for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. No-one was reported hurt and locals moved quickly to clear up the damage so the service could go ahead, according to the Times of Israel. Israelis clean up a rocket-damaged synagogue in Ashkelon A car-ramming incident also took place in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem on Sunday evening. An Israeli police spokesman said the driver had been shot dead and four Israeli officers injured. The threat to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah to make way for Israeli settlers sparked the current round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. Those tensions culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews, and, on Monday, Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. By Paul Adams, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent Is Israel's military operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Guardian of the Walls"", nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks are continuing with ""full force"" and will ""take time"". In a news conference on Sunday, he admitted there were ""pressures"" but thanked US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, such as Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israel's estimation, we have not reached that point yet. What happenedduringthe UN meeting? The 15-member UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a public statement in recent days and none was forthcoming after the meeting. The United States - a strong ally of Israel - is said to be the hold-out, believing it would be unhelpful in the diplomatic process. In Sunday's meeting, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the US was ready to offer support ""should the parties seek a ceasefire"" and had been working tirelessly to try to bring an end to the conflict. Palestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, spoke of Saturday's attack on a refugee camp, which killed 10 members of the same family, leaving a five-month-old survivor to be pulled from the rubble. ""Israel often asks us to put ourselves in their shoes,"" he said, ""but they are not wearing shoes. They're wearing military boots."" In response, Israel's Permanent Representative, Gilad Erdan, cited the death of a 10-year-old Arab-Israeli girl, killed by a Hamas rocket. He insisted Israel was mounting what he called ""a heroic effort"" to ""dismantle terrorist infrastructure and avoid civilian casualties"". Mr Erdan ended by urging the Security Council to unequivocally condemn Hamas but warned that Israel would take all steps necessary to protect itself. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"Tenth of British restaurants lost during pandemicAs bars, pubs and restaurants prepare to welcome customers back indoors, some will not reopen at all.Business","Monday sees another milestone in the reopening of the economy: people in most of the UK will be able to go to a bar or restaurant and eat indoors. But some favourite haunts will no longer be there: over the last year, thousands of establishments have closed, latest surveys indicate. Across Britain, there are 9.7% fewer restaurants to choose from, compared with before the pandemic. And mid-market ""casual dining"" venues have fallen by 19.4%. The data in the latest Market Recovery Monitor from CGA and AlixPartners suggests that while many pubs and bars have also struggled to survive the pandemic, it is restaurants that have fared worst. What are the rules for pubs and restaurants across the UK? That includes places such as Oskar Ali's in Newport in Wales. Oskar and his wife opened Falafilo Island, serving grilled meats and vegetables and falafel, in August 2018. They invested thousands of pounds to set up the business, transforming the dark interior with a cheerful yellow ceiling and tree-patterned walls. ""We had so many lovely customers, but corona just hit us so hard, we had to close,"" Oskar told BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme. They hoped a busy Christmas might save them, but Oskar's wife caught Covid and they had to isolate for two weeks. ""Then it was January and we thought: we should just close,"" he says. ""We couldn't survive, even with the grants they gave."" Oskar, a computer science graduate, now has thousands of pounds of debt and is looking for other work. Oskar and his wife invested thousands of pounds to set up the restaurant CGA and AlixPartners measured the impact of the last 13 months on pubs and restaurants that hold a licence to serve alcohol. Looking at the net number of venues, once all closures and new openings were taken into account, they found pubs across Britain fared slightly better than the restaurant sector. The number of pubs serving food has fallen by 4.2%. Bars and pubs that only serve drinks fell by 5.2%. But on top of the near-20% fall in casual dining outlets, bar-restaurants, which make up a smaller part of the overall dining market, fell by 9.6%. General restaurants, which are the largest dining out category, are down 10.2%. ""The main challenge for restaurants, in comparison to pubs, is that the restaurants all tend to be leased premises - they all have landlords and rent to pay,"" says Graeme Smith, managing director of AlixPartners. ""When their revenues stopped, their rental bills continued to build up, unless they managed to reach an agreement with their landlord. ""Unfortunately, with the burn of costs of rent and other costs of business, for a number of restaurants, that was simply too much to keep going through the period of closure."" And while restaurants that belong to larger chains were sometimes able to fall back on the group financially, or negotiate agreements with landlords across the business, independent operators have found it harder to survive. The restaurant sector was already shrinking before the pandemic, but the net losses between 2017 and 2019 were between 0.9% and 2.2% a year, according to CGA AlixPartners data. Many of those earlier losses were in crowded sectors such as burger bars. But losses over the past year have included businesses with otherwise promising futures. Hendersons, an Edinburgh institution, was an early casualty of the pandemic Hendersons in Edinburgh was founded in the 1960s, and as vegetarian and vegan food became more fashionable, it had expanded to two new sites in the city. Before the pandemic hit, it was trading strongly thanks to loyal customers and Edinburgh's throngs of summer visitors. But it relied completely on in-person footfall, says Janet Home, the third generation of the family to be involved in managing the business. When Covid hit, they tried to adapt, offering veg boxes and dry goods deliveries. ""We didn't have anything set up, the website wasn't set up for online delivery, there were so many processes we needed to go through,"" says Janet. ""With all the competition out there, there was no way we could cover all the running costs of the business."" In July, faced with redundancy payments for 35 staff, they reached breaking point. ""It was a soul-destroying decision the family had to come to, says Janet. ""We knew it was game over."" Janet Home's family faced a ""heart-breaking decision"" last summer Looking back she has no doubt it was the right decision. They would need to run at 60-75% capacity to cover their costs, which is difficult with social distancing rules still in place. ""Even if we were in a position to reopen now, the tourists are going to take time to come back, the offices are not at capacity, [some] students are working from home."" The Local Data Company, which monitors changes to property use across England, Scotland and Wales, says the biggest net losses were in American and Italian restaurants. But some categories saw a net gain in the number of outlets, according to their data, including vegan and Japanese restaurants. Graeme Smith from AlixPartners says he expects the churn to continue in the next few months. There's a ""cliff edge"" at the end of June for many restaurants, he points out, because after that point landlords can demand unpaid rents again, as the rules to support the sector are lifted. That could prompt a new wave of closures as big as the number we've seen already he warns. But pent-up demand could encourage new openings too. ""Landlords will be keen to get new tenants into their sites,"" points out Mr Smith. ""And restaurateurs are naturally optimistic people. When you see a restaurant closed, it doesn't stay closed for long."" Tim Hall is one of the founders of a small sourdough pizza chain, Three Joes - one of the businesses poised to capitalise on a bounce-back in demand. Last year, they bought another small chain, The Stable, taking them from three to 12 sites, mostly in south-western England. ""We're quite nervous about what's going to happen,"" he says. ""We've taken a big risk."" Restaurateurs hope customers will return after a year of restrictions The new restaurants are all either waterside or market-square sites, most with outdoor spaces, that he thinks will appeal to customers post-Covid. Crucially, none rely on ""office block"" trade. ""I don't think overall the trend for people to eat out more is going to be damaged in the medium term,"" he says. ""And in the short term, it will accelerate hugely. ""We're anticipating a summer like no other. Apart from anything else, people are trapped in England, they want to spend their savings and enjoy themselves.""

"Priti Patel accused of lobbying for face mask firmLabour calls for an investigation into a letter from Priti Patel, saying she did ""a favour to her friend"".UK PoliticsBuying a home an 'unachievable dream' for manyNearly half the homeowners helped by the Help to Buy scheme earn at least Â£40,000, a report says.Wales","Priti Patel - pictured here receiving her vaccine on Saturday - is facing questions over a letter she sent Home Secretary Priti Patel has been accused of lobbying a fellow minister on behalf of a healthcare firm trying to get a government contract. In May last year, Ms Patel wrote to Michael Gove expressing disappointment the government had not bought face masks from a company that had links to someone she knew. Labour has called for an investigation, saying she breached ministerial rules. But Ms Patel's spokesman said she acted as she should have. ""The home secretary rightly followed up representations made to her about the vital supply of PPE,"" the spokesman said. ""During a time of national crisis, failure to do so would have been a dereliction of duty."" In recent weeks there have been a series of revelations about PPE deals awarded to those with government connections. What is lobbying? A brief guide What is going on with government Covid contracts? In May 2020, Ms Patel wrote a letter to Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, about a company called Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd that was in talks with the government about an order for face masks. She said the government's ""late stage"" decision not to use the company had caused problems for the firm. ""I would be most grateful if you could review this matter urgently,"" she wrote in the letter to Mr Gove. The contact at Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd was a man called Samir Jassal, a Conservative activist who Ms Patel knew. According to his LinkedIn, he worked as an adviser to Ms Patel between 2014 and 2015 and on social media describes her as a ""good friend"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote back to Ms Patel to say the masks being offered by the firm were ""not suitable for use in the NHS"". But the company was later awarded a contract in July 2020, worth just under Â£103m, to supply a different type of mask. The letters -which were first reported in the Daily Mail,externaland now seen by the BBC - have come to light as part of a legal challenge by the Good Law Project. PPE fixer who was Tory donor named in admin error Labour called for an investigation, saying there was ""no evidence that the Home Secretary had any interest"" in the PPE deal until contacted by Mr Jassal, suggesting she did it ""as a favour to her friend"". ""This would represent a glaring and flagrant breach of the ministerial code,"" the party said, referring to the set of rules for ministers' conduct. Labour pointed tothis principle in the code:,external""Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". Samir Jassal (right), pictured with Boris Johnson in 2019, has campaigned alongside the prime minister The Good Law Project, a campaign group which took the government to court over not publishing PPE contracts, is taking legal action over the Â£103m contract for masks. The government has previously said ministers have no part in deciding who gets contracts. After coronavirus hit the UK, the government struck thousands of deals with private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process. Because it was an emergency, the government was allowed to go directly to preferred suppliers without any competition. But it has led to questions about the way the contracts were chosen. Mr Jassal previously said the company has 20 years' experience in the healthcare sector and it asked to supply PPE via an online government portal. The company, he said, had supplied PPE to various outlets for many years. Pharmaceuticals Direct Limited said: ""The business is proud of its successful track record of procurement and supply to various medical organisations, including supplying NHS bodies. ""As a business that has specialised in the procurement and delivery of healthcare supplies for more than 20 years, PDL was (and is) both equipped and well suited to find solutions to the urgent demands of the pandemic."" The company also said Mr Jassal was not employed by PDL. This article was updated on 18 May after Pharmaceuticals Direct Limited responded with a comment.

"Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for manyNearly half the homeowners helped by the Help to Buy scheme earn at least Â£40,000, a report says.","Alys Patosit has three jobs, but says buying a home is out of her family's reach. For many working parents in Wales, buying their own home is an ""unachievable dream,"" according to three charities. Nearly half the homeowners helped by the Help to Buy scheme in 2020-21 earned at least Â£40,000. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said evidence suggested it was ""not helping people on lower incomes"". The Welsh government said a new phase of the scheme will help those ""who most need support"". Alys Patosit, 41, and her husband Pin, 48, live in Monmouthshire with their two children. Mrs Patosit works part-time as an administrative assistant and as a carer for the elderly, as well as running her own online business, but said her family might never be able to afford their own home, no matter how hard they work. ""Since returning to work after having my children, I have found myself working three jobs and still having to claim Universal Credit to make ends meet, leaving us with nothing to save for a deposit,"" she said. ""We dream of being able to afford a modest home in the area I grew up in, but we feel trapped in a cycle and having housing security feels impossible, sometimes it feels completely hopeless."" Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses House sales and prices see early spring surge 5% deposit mortgage 'will help daughter's future' Help to Buy is a scheme which allows those eligible to buy a new-build property up to the value of Â£250,000 with help from the Welsh government by way of a shared equity loan. Since January 2014, 11,959 properties have been purchased using a Help to Buy loan in Wales. A recent official report on the scheme found that, over the last three years, the proportion of completed purchases by those on higher incomes had increased. ""During 2020-21, 49% of all homes purchased under the scheme were by those with an average household income of Â£40,000 to Â£60,000,"" saidthe report,external. ""In contrast, homes purchased by those with a household income of less than Â£20,000 have been decreasing annually and in 2020-21 accounted for only 2% of all completed purchases using the scheme."" Carmen Jackson, co-ordinator of Home-Start's Helping Working Families project across Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly, said: ""Housing is an issue that comes up again and again with many of our families. ""Feelings are running high about the current housing situation. Many families feel that home ownership for their family is a completely unachievable dream. ""We have found in some regions, social housing stock is low, which creates demand for rentals, forcing up the prices of rentals which makes investors buying homes as buy-to-lets attractive and making home ownership unrealistic for all but the wealthiest."" She added that affordable housing seemed to be only affordable where both parents were working full-time on a good wage or have significant help from family. ""We are noticing the knock-on effects for families, with families either overstretching themselves to try to create better lives for their families or feeling hopeless because the dream is completely out of reach,"" she said. Eve (who did not want her surname published), her husband and three children bought a home through the Help to Buy scheme, but were disappointed. ""The government's idea of affordable and most working families' incomes don't match up,"" said Eve. ""We ended up buying a house that's really too small for our family and needs loads of work doing, that we can't afford to do, but we were desperate. ""Local rents are just too high, the stress was wearing us down."" Dr Steffan Evans, policy and research officer at the Bevan Foundation, said: ""There have long been questions about whether Help to Buy is a scheme that helps boost the availability of genuinely affordable housing. ""The latest evidence adds further weight to these concerns. Investing the funds in other programmes such as the Social Housing Grant, which funds the construction of new social housing, could prove to be far more effective use of Welsh government funds."" Rachel Casey of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says support is not being given to the people who need it most Rachel Casey, policy and partnerships officer at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ""Even before coronavirus, around 700,000 people in Wales were trapped in poverty. Together with low wages and inadequate benefit levels, high private rents lock people in Wales in poverty. ""So it's not right that the majority of support in the housing market is currently being directed towards people who are not in poverty and who may already own their own homes. ""This evidence suggests that the Help to Buy scheme in Wales is not helping people on lower incomes to access home ownership, but instead supporting people on higher incomes. ""Across the UK, the stamp duty holiday policy is benefiting existing homeowners but making it much harder for renters to get on the property ladder."" Movers 'more likely to buy than first-time buyers' What does the chancellor's Budget mean for me? A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We understand the difficulties first-time buyers face and the uncertainties in the jobs market as a result of the pandemic. ""Our Help to Buy Wales scheme plays an important role in helping people get onto the property ladder with three-quarters of the 12,000 homes already delivered through the programme going to first-time buyers. ""Phase 3 of Help to Buy Wales was launched last month and has been designed to ensure the scheme further benefits those who most need support in securing home ownership.""

Israel PM vows to continue Gaza strikes,"This video can not be played Homes and buildings destroyed in Israel and Gaza Israel's military operation against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza will continue ""with full force"", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. ""We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore calm... It will take time,"" Mr Netanyahu warned. Gaza officials said 42 people, including 16 women and 10 children, died in the latest Israeli air strikes. Ten people, including two children, have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel since Monday, Israel said. The overall death toll in Gaza now stands at 197 people, including 58 children and 34 women, with 1,235 injured, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Meanwhile, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting, with international mediators hoping to broker a ceasefire. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres opened the meeting by describing the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Rockets launched by Hamas have hit Ashkelon, southern Israel Sunday was thedeadliest day so far The Israeli air strikes hit a busy street in Gaza just after midnight on Sunday, causing at least three buildings to collapse and dozens of deaths. Hamas launched barrage of rockets towards southern Israel overnight and during the afternoon. Millions of Israelis scrambled to safe rooms or shelters as sirens went off. Palestinians also tried to take precautions, but in the densely packed and poorly resourced Gaza Strip, many had nowhere to go. Riyad Eshkuntana told Reuters news agency he put his daughters to sleep in a room of his house that he thought was the furthest from the explosions. Only one of his daughters, Suzy, six, survived the night. His wife and three other children died. ""I ran to check upon the girls,"" said Mr Eshkuntana. ""My wife jumped she hugged the girls to take them out from the room, then a second airstrike hit the room... The ceilings were destroyed and I was under the rubble."" The Israeli military later said it had been conducted a strikes on a militant tunnel system in the area. The tunnels' collapsed caused the houses above to collapse as well, leading to unintended civilian casualties, it said. Suzy, six, was rescued from rubble in Gaza City on Sunday, but five members of her family died Israel's military says it has been targeting leaders and infrastructure linked to Hamas. It said it had also struck the homes of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad Sinwar, whom it described as head of logistics and manpower for the movement. It was unlikely they were at home at the time of the strikes, according to the Associated Press news agency. Gazan rescue workers spent the day trying to rescue people from under the debris from the strikes. The Palestinian health ministry said a doctor was among the dead: Dr Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, head of internal medicine at Shifa hospital and part of the coronavirus team. What is Hamas? How Israel's Iron Dome missile shield works Boris Johnson condemns 'shameful' anti-Semitism in video In Israel, Hamas rockets hit Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and other parts of central and southern Israel. There were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it had seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the past week. The country's Iron Dome defence systemhas intercepted many of them. But some caused damage to cars and buildings, including the Yad Michael synagogue in Ashkelon, where a hole was blasted through the wall just before an evening service for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. No-one was reported hurt and locals moved quickly to clear up the damage so the service could go ahead, according to the Times of Israel. Israelis clean up a rocket-damaged synagogue in Ashkelon A car-ramming incident also took place in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem on Sunday evening. An Israeli police spokesman said the driver had been shot dead and four Israeli officers injured. The threat to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah to make way for Israeli settlers sparked the current round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. Those tensions culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews, and, on Monday, Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. By Paul Adams, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent Is Israel's military operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Guardian of the Walls"", nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks are continuing with ""full force"" and will ""take time"". In a news conference on Sunday, he admitted there were ""pressures"" but thanked US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, such as Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israel's estimation, we have not reached that point yet. What happenedduringthe UN meeting? The 15-member UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a public statement in recent days and none was forthcoming after the meeting. The United States - a strong ally of Israel - is said to be the hold-out, believing it would be unhelpful in the diplomatic process. In Sunday's meeting, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the US was ready to offer support ""should the parties seek a ceasefire"" and had been working tirelessly to try to bring an end to the conflict. Palestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, spoke of Saturday's attack on a refugee camp, which killed 10 members of the same family, leaving a five-month-old survivor to be pulled from the rubble. ""Israel often asks us to put ourselves in their shoes,"" he said, ""but they are not wearing shoes. They're wearing military boots."" In response, Israel's Permanent Representative, Gilad Erdan, cited the death of a 10-year-old Arab-Israeli girl, killed by a Hamas rocket. He insisted Israel was mounting what he called ""a heroic effort"" to ""dismantle terrorist infrastructure and avoid civilian casualties"". Mr Erdan ended by urging the Security Council to unequivocally condemn Hamas but warned that Israel would take all steps necessary to protect itself. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.
