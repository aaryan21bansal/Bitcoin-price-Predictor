The FA Cup third round is put to bed, for 10 days at least, until the replays. We shall see you on Tuesday night though for some League Cup action! Oh yes. See you there.Â Cambridge 1-2 Leeds Leeds boss Garry Monk:""Cambridge were excellent in that first half, they put pressure on us and were a handful. ""We were playing too much football in the first half though, not on this pitch. We are a young group and there's not much experience between them but they have improved so much. ""We had a setback but we reset and more often than not they are able to do that. ""I love the FA Cup, I've grown up with it and it means a lot to me. All I know is that we use our squad, we respected it tonight, you could see that from how committed we were tonight."" Cambridge 1-2 Leeds Leeds manager Garry Monk:""Credit to Cambridge they made it very tough for us as we knew they would. ""We were able to move the game up the pitch in the second half and got the goals at good times. I trust all my players, there's no point in having a squad if you are not going to use them and it will stand them in good stead. ""Liam Cooper has an impact injury but he should be OK."" Cambridge 1-2 Leeds Cambridge manager Shaun Derry:""We want more of this. We want to be on a different stage. ""We are in League Two and it's a tough, tough level and we can make a real claim for the top seven now.""

They went down with 33 points in May 2004 and have not been back since. Cambridge 1-2 Leeds Steve ClaridgeEx-Cambirdge striker, BBC Radio 5 live Leeds have the capabilities of being a top six or seven team in the country. They will get 35,000 every home game if they win promotion to the Premier League. They have the ammunition and quality to give it a real go. Cambridge 1-2 Leeds Steve ClaridgeEx-Cambridge striker, BBC Radio 5 live Lots of things that have gone on at Leeds have left a slightly bitter taste. But what they done is given the manager a chance and backed him financially. You get the feeling Garry Monk, with what he has had to put up with, just lets it wash over him. He comes across as a focused person. Cambridge 1-2 Leeds Leeds winger Stuart Dallas: ""The first half was unacceptable from us and we needed a reaction which luckily we were able to do. We needed to keep the ball, cut out the mistakes and we knew chances would come. We have won the game, that's what it's about."" Leeds goalscorer Alex Mowatt:""I don't know what I was doing in there for the goal, it just hit my head and I'll take the goal. We have been playing well and we just needed to get a win tonight. The gaffer needed to rest some players and we've done well in the end."" Cambridge 1-2 Leeds  Cambridge 1-2 Leeds  Cambridge 1-2 Leeds  Cambridge 1-2 Leeds Steve ClaridgeEx-Cambridge striker, BBC Radio 5 live Excellent cup tie. Very, very different halves.

Dating and dwarfism,"Athlete and law student Pani Mamuneas has never had a girlfriend and says he suspects the only women who approach him want to tick ""dwarf"" off their bucket list. The 19-year-old decided to do something about it and applied for a TV dating show. You always hear girls say 'ooh what's your type? Oh tall, you know tall and handsome' and I'm the total opposite of that. At 4ft 7in people have always asked me 'would you have wanted to be born taller?' But now, I can't imagine life any other way. When I was younger I never saw myself as having a disability. I wasn't even aware of it until my teenage years when growth spurts happened to others and I started to see that I was different and school became very difficult. My fellow students at school in Leicester would ask 'Pani why are you so small? Were you born the size of a pea?' Thinking back, all those things that hurt me could have easily been avoided by realising people were just curious - they were kids asking silly questions. I have what's known as Achondroplasia - a form of dwarfism. Apparently I'm taller than average for my condition but still quite tiny and it definitely affected potential relationships and how I have viewed myself over the years. My male friends and I would always talk about girls and celebrities, the ones we would dream of marrying and how we would ask them out. But this is when things went very wrong for me. At the age of 12 I asked a girl out. We went to the cinema and seemed to have a good time, but the next day the gossip began. I secretly told a friend in the school library that I liked her but he wrote it in big letters on the whiteboard for everyone to see - when I saw it I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. Myself and the girl both ended up in tears and she felt too embarrassed to talk to me again. That was when I lost all of my confidence and thought I was not good enough because of my height. I stopped talking to girls and I certainly wouldn't reveal if I fancied someone. I was afraid of what girls would think of me, always worrying they might ignore or tease me, or treat me like a nobody, because I was different. It was a very difficult time of my life. When I reached college, however, things started to look up. Everyone seemed to have matured and the general bullying stopped. It became a time for me to discover who I was, and what I wanted to do with my future. Sadly, this new way of thinking didn't mean my love life improved and I had other challenges to overcome including going to nightclubs with friends. I wouldn't have the confidence to go up to girls, chat to them or ask them to dance. I always felt that because I was different if a woman approached me it was so she could tick it off her bucket list. It was at this point, having never had a girlfriend, I decided to contact Channel 4's The Undateables - a reality show which tries to match disabled people with a partner - and so face my fear of dating with the hope of potentially finding somebody. It was a drastic thing to do but I thought if I could successfully go on a date on a television show I wouldn't have any confidence problems in the future. Facing my fears worked and I now feel able to approach a woman and have a conversation with her because I have learned there isn't anything to be afraid of. If the girl doesn't like me fair enough, but some open-minded people will like me. I had been competing internationally in shot put and javelin and hoped to compete in the Paralympic Games in Rio last year but injury forced me to take time out. Participating in The Undateables helped me to focus on a different aspect of life and took my mind off the injury although I've now returned to training with my sights set on the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo as well as taking a degree in law. This process has further boosted my confidence and I've realised that being short isn't a barrier it's a feature. All this time I shouldn't have thought of myself as less of a person. Being me is the best thing I can do better than anyone else. The Undateables,externaltransmits on Monday nights at 21:00 GMT on Channel 4 and is also available on All 4.

'Words and action needed',"Theresa May has unveiled plans to do more to help those, particularly young people, with mental health conditions. In her speech at the Charity Commission, the prime minister announced a number of pledges including training at every secondary school, training for employers and organisations, and the appointment of a mental health campaigner. Here, people have been sharing their experiences of mental health services. For the last three years, I have been saying exactly what the prime minister has announced today. I lost my daughter Chloe Rose to suicide two and a half years ago - she was 19. She was under the care of Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) but discharged at 16. There is a gap in care from the age of 16 to 18. After 16, you're put into the adult mental health category. But a young person in a dark place may miss an important appointment - who follows them up to see if they're OK? I've carried out talks to police recruits and college students, and have done many charity events. I ran a 100km [62-mile] ultramarathon in memory of my daughter - it was for the charitySurvivors of Bereavement by Suicide,external, which is a great charity I use who support people going through suicide grief. I'm currently serving in the Army as a sergeant, and I'm going through a transfer to become an Army welfare worker. Also, I will soon be getting qualified as a adult and young persons' mental-health first-aid instructor and also a trainer in applied suicide-intervention skills training. Being in the military, I'm well aware of the stigma and lack of resources that are not available to us and the community. I run a social media page,Miles for Mental Health,external, to raise awareness of organisations as well as funds to help pay for people to do mental health first-aid courses. I'm pushing for the courses to be brought into the curriculum in both primary and secondary schools, as well as in companies, communities, and the military. I'm a firm believer that experience, education, research, intervention and preparation can potentially save a life. The new measures have received praise from some, but others think the government has not gone far enough Mental health services have been in crisis for the last five years. [In my job as a community psychiatric nurse,] we have no beds or resources. My team has over 90 people on its caseload. We struggle to cope with 45. The system is broken. We take people on to avoid admission, but we have no beds to admit to. This year, [after 40 years,] I have had enough, it's time for me to go, I cannot cope with the strain and pressure anymore. The government do nothing, they lie and manipulate all the time. Trust managers know what is happening but are unable to act. I've had experience of both NHS and private mental health facilities recently, and the NHS is far worse at dealing with mental health issues. I had quite a bad experience with a GP who was very dismissive of these issues, so I opted to go through aLive Well,externalfacility in my local area. This was better for me, but still has a very light touch and [is] generic, without any effort or in my view ability to deal with mental health issues. I'm in a position where I can afford private healthcare, however many are not, so I can only imagine how widespread this issue is. I'm glad that there will, hopefully, now be a far greater focus on mental health, but there needs to be both words and action to tackle the problem. My daughter had anorexia last year. She suffers from self-esteem issues and the feeling of needing to be perfect. She was diagnosed [at] the beginning of April, but the nearest appointment to see a Camhs worker was the middle of June, which I feared would have been too late for my daughter. I took her to the GP again due to her deteriorating health, but he told me that I had to wait for the Camhs appointment. At this point her weight was in the danger zone, down to five stone. In the meantime, I tried manage it all myself, using all kinds of approaches to help my daughter. When she was eventually seen by Camhs, she was so ill she was admitted to hospital. She had to stay in a general hospital for two weeks before there was a bed available in a specialist hospital. But the nearest bed was over 120 miles from home in Middlesbrough, as there is no provision in the whole of Cumbria. She stayed in Middlesbrough for seven weeks - it affected her mental health further by being so far away from home, but in the end it was the best place for her. When she was discharged, she needed to see a dietician, but the only one in Cumbria was off sick. My daughter didn't see a dietician for six weeks. My main issue is that GPs didn't understand the seriousness of this mental health disorder - the system is woefully inadequate.

Drawing together,"Applicants for the Women Who Draw website were asked to submit an illustrated portrait of a woman A website designed to showcase the work of female illustrators and promote diversity has got off to a flying start, after receiving submissions from around the world. TheWomen Who Draw,externalwebsite, which had its ""soft launch"" in December, crashed under the weight of more than six million page views in its first three days, according to its US founders, Wendy MacNaughton and Julia Rothman. ""We had to close submissions because we were overwhelmed. We received 1,200 submissions in 24 hours,"" said Ms Rothman, citing contributions from Iran, Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, among others. The site's mission statement is to ""increase the visibility of female illustrators, female illustrators of colour, LBTQ+, and other minority groups"". On Monday, it is relaunching, backed by a new server and showcasing 700 new members, whose work organisers have collated within three weeks. They also have more than 300 artists on the waiting list. Ms MacNaughton and Ms Rothman, who are both successful illustrators, said they were motivated to create the project after noticing certain publications were dominated by male artists. ""We counted a certain magazine that often has illustrated covers, and noticed that in the past 55 covers, only four were by women,"" said Ms Rothman. Something seemed to be amiss, considering that the arts field within education is often dominated by women. In the UK,data from higher-education admissions service Ucas,externalshows that in 2016 the number of women enrolled in design studies courses (including illustration) was more than double the number of men. So, do the women behind Women Who Draw think sexism in the industry is an enduring problem? ""When I see who wins the awards, who are on the juries and who speaks at conferences, it is clear that there is a bias. Although no-one has specifically said to me that you are a woman so I am not going to hire you,"" said Ms Rothman. Sabrina Scott, an artist, illustration lecturer, and PhD student at Toronto's York University, has conducted a study of seven years of images within the American Illustration (AI) annual, a collection of award-winning images, chosen by a jury. She looked at how people - male and female - were represented in nearly 3,000 images. Ms Scott said: ""Over seven years from 2008 to 2015, white men appear in 55% of AI award-winning illustrations, on average. The representation of white women has remained fairly steady at an average of 32%, as has the representation of men and women of colour, whose seven-year averages are 8% and 4%, respectively."" She also found that while men were drawn as nude or nearly nude 3% of the time, that figure rose to 30% for female figures. ""The only dead bodies depicted during the timeframe of my analysis are those that belong to men of colour,"" she added. The site allows artists to highlight different aspects of their identity. Artists can be tagged according to their sexuality, religion, and location. Trans women are also encouraged to join, and are not differentiated from other women. Artist Kaylani Juanita lists herself on the site under the categories African American/black, LBTQ+, west coast (US), multiracial, and native Hawaiian/Pacific islander. Did she worry that she might get pigeonholed? ""I'm far more worried about invisibility or erasure of identity rather than being pigeonholed for making my identity visible,"" she said. ""I joined because it's an inclusive list that's well needed within publishing and illustration,"" she added. ""For women artists, it provides solidarity, visibility, and community. I would have loved a list like this when I was in college and high school."" Bryan Gee, an art director at Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail, says he has already commissioned three artists he found on the site. One was themed on female sexuality. He also finds the categorisation of artists based on location useful, as part of his job involves showcasing Canadian talent. ""The biggest challenge to Women Who Draw as they to continue to add to their roster will be how to balance inclusivity with the quality of the work that I currently find there,"" he said. However, some of the features he is less convinced about. ""It seems a bit odd, for example, to see 'atheist' pop up so frequently as a primary defining quality of some of the illustrators."" ""I don't think it is about tokenism,"" adds Lizzy Stewart, an artist from London, who has joined the site. ""I think work will still be commissioned based on talent, after all no-one wants to pay for bad work. It'd just be great if that work could come from a wider range of sources."" Women Who Draw has decided not to include tags to denote writers who are white or straight. ""That was a big decision that we debated a lot,"" said Ms MacNaughton. ""We decided we didn't want to support art directors in search of more white women."" But Ms MacNaughton adds that it is an evolving project and they are open to feedback. ""Ultimately it is the work that matters,"" she said. ""The site creates a signpost. It is up to the art director to choose the work and the people.""

Fix rooms,"Angelea Let works as a prostitute to fund her drug addiction Britain could soon see its first ""fix room"" for drug users - a safe space where addicts can take illegal narcotics under medical supervision. But who uses such places and how do they work? On a cold and wet Thursday morning, there are already users inside Skyen, one of Copenhagen's fix rooms. Angelea Let, 49, sits in one of the cubicles in the smoking room to take crack cocaine. ""I get a good feeling from my legs to my head, it has already taken away 50% of my pain,"" she says as she smokes. Angelea told theVictoria Derbyshire programmeshe can spend around Â£600 a week on crack. She is one of hundreds of users who visit Skyen each day. The irony of the situation is not hard to see. The fix room has an area where people can inject themselves with drugs While the hard drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, are illegal, in a fix room they can be taken under the watchful gaze of medical supervisors. The equipment they are given, including needles for injecting, is clean and supplied by the shelter. Everything is laid on - bar the drugs, which users must bring with them. Injecting rooms have been around for more than 30 years. Drug rooms exist officially in several European countries, including Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Spain, as well as in Canada and Australia. Recently a Paris hospitalstarted housing France's first ""shooting gallery"". There are six fix rooms in Denmark, and many others around Europe And Britain could be next in line.Glasgow is planning to openthe UK's first drugs consumption room and those behind it have been looking to countries like Denmark for inspiration. Denmark opened its first fix room in 2012 and Skyen, which started three years ago, is one of six now running in the country. Funded by public money, it costs about Â£1m a year to run. The set-up is organised and managed. There are two separate areas for people to take drugs - the injecting room, which seats up to nine people, and another room with eight seats, for those who want to smoke hard drugs. But don't such facilities encourage illegal drug use? Rasmus Koberg Christiansen, manager of Skyen, believes not. ""The situation in the area before we had the drug consumption room was that we had all the drug users sitting around in the streets, shooting drugs in public,"" says Christiansen. ""After we opened this place, about 90% of the outdoor drugs use is gone. ""We have had hundreds of overdose situations, not a single one has been fatal. Rasmus Koberg Christiansen says it is better to take people's drug use away from the streets ""Our purpose is harm reduction, however, if or when a user expresses a wish to stop or cut down on their drug use, we react immediately and help the person to make contact to a relevant facility."" Located in the heart of the Danish capital's red light district, Skyen is conveniently situated for Angelea, who volunteers in a soup kitchen by day and works as prostitute by night. It was the effects of a car accident almost 20 years ago that led to her drug habit, she says. ""After I was in the accident, there was no feeling in my left leg and arm for about six years. I have the feeling back now, but I'm in constant pain."" To take the edge off, Angelea smokes mostly crack cocaine, and occasionally heroin. She feels safe in the fix room, knowing that the staff and one of the nurses constantly on duty will watch over her. They are there to prevent people from dying from overdosing. This video can not be played 'Could you live my life for one week?' 700,000 drug intakes in the facility since it opened More than 500 overdoses on site, but no-one has died Open 23 hours a day Houses between 500-700 drug intakes per day Has 5,772 registered users People are allowed 35 minutes in the smoking room and 45 minutes in the injecting room There is a constant flow of people in an out of the Skyen rooms throughout the day. Some of them are new faces to the staff, but many are regular users and can come multiple times in a few hours. Angelea is back later in the afternoon to smoke crack again. ""I'm here again because I'm in so much pain,"" she says as she rushes into the smoking room. The drugs room stays open through the night, closing only for an hour each morning for cleaning. It is not a treatment facility to get addicts off drugs, and many people will use it before going back to their difficult and sometimes dangerous lifestyles. Late in the evening, only a few streets away, Angelea is out working, trying to find customers to pay for her next fix. ""I'm going to work, make some money and then smoke cocaine, then go back to work, make more money and smoke more cocaine again in the fix room. This is my lovely life,"" she says, laughing bitterly.

Was 27 December the busiest day in NHS history?9 January 2017 (17:33:37),"The claim:Tuesday 27 December was the busiest day in the history of the National Health Service. Reality Check verdict:In relation to attendance at type-one accident and emergency departments (the general A&E departments at big hospitals), Mr Hunt is correct. That's a reasonable measure of how busy the NHS is, but other measures suggest different days were busier. Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt made the claim on BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he thanked staff for their work over Christmas. NHS Englandpublishes daily statistics,externalduring the winter for several metrics to do with NHS services, so we can look into whether it is the case. We can assume he was talking about the NHS in England only, because health is devolved, so he is not in charge of the NHS in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The number of people attending accident and emergency departments is an important indicator of demand for hospital services. On 27 December, there were 60,215 attendances at A&E departments. That is a high level, but it's not the highest for the month, which was set at 60,692 on 5 December. But it turns out that Mr Hunt was talking about only type-one A&E departments, which is what most people would think of as an A&E department. Type-two are specialist units, such as Moorfields Eye Unit, while type-three are GP-led walk-in centres. There were 46,315 attendances at type-one A&E departments, which is the highest of the month. Comparisons with previous years are difficult due to changes in coverage and figures not being broken down in the same way. Another important measure is the number of emergency admissions, which was 13,715 on 27 December. That is a high figure, but the number was higher on each of the following three days - it was 14,649 on 28 December. Looking at the proportion of beds occupied: on 27 December, 90.5% of the total number of available beds were occupied. That's actually quite low by the standards of last month - there were higher figures on 24 days in December. NHS England says that the week ending 1 January 2017 was the busiest week for the NHS 111 24-hour non-emergency service since it began in August 2010, but we do not get that figure broken down by day so cannot say whether the Tuesday was the busiest day. We also do not have daily figures for how busy other parts of the NHS were, such as GPs.

The inside story of the firstÂ iPhoneDave LeeNorth America technology reporter9 January 2017 (07:43:38),"Steve Jobs unveiling the first iPhone in 2007 ""Steve had expressly told me it was totally top secret. He said he was going to fire anyone who tells the world. ""I was sweating bullets."" Tony Fadell was pondering just how he was going to explain to Steve Jobs that he'd lost the prototype of what would become the most successful technology product of all time, the Apple iPhone which launched 10 years ago on Monday. He'd just got off a plane, felt his pockets, and... nothing. ""I was walking through every scenario thinking about what could happen,"" he told me. None of them ended well. After two hours, relief - thanks to the efforts of a search party that didnât know what it was trying to find. ""It fell out of my pocket and it was lodged in between the seats!"" Tony Fadell, known as the ""godfather"" of the iPod Within just a few months, the world would know all about the little device - but for now, Fadell was holding it tight. 60s future phone Tony Fadell is sometimes referred to as the ""godfather"" of the iPod. He left Apple in 2010, and went on to found Nest, the smart home company now owned by Alphabet, Googleâs parent company.He left that company last year*. As far as Fadell is concerned, today is in fact the 12-and-a-half year anniversary of the first iPhone. Thatâs when he started working on the idea, born out of an acceptance that the iPod, which was turning around Appleâs fortunes, was a platform that could be developed further. By this point the iPod had got video capabilities, even games. ""We were like, 'Wait a second, data networks are coming',"" he told the BBC. ""We should be looking at this as a general purpose platform."" Starting this way was the magic ingredient that meant the iPhone broke boundaries, Fadell said. While competitors like Microsoft were trying to shrink the PC into a phone, Apple was looking to grow the iPod into something more sophisticated. Indeed, one early iPhone concept design used the iPod's distinctive click-wheel as its input method. That was soon ditched. This video can not be played A look back at the launch of the first iPhone in January 2007 ""We were turning it into a rotary phone from the sixties,"" Fadell remembered. ""We were like, 'This doesnât work! It's too hard to use'."" It just so happened that in another part of Apple, work had started on a touchscreen Macintosh computer. ""They had been working on this in secret. It was the size of a ping pong table. Steve showed it to me and said, 'I want to take that and put it on an iPod'."" Fadell warned Jobs that to make a touchscreen device like the one he envisioned would take time, money and new dedicated infrastructure. They went for it. ""We needed thousands of people working on all of this, at the same time, for it to land together for the launch. ""And then we only had six months after that to ship it. Obviously we pulled it off, but it was not easy."" Malmo Mystery Apple had many of the best brains in the business, but until that point it hadnât ever made a phone of its own. And so Fadell planned a fact-finding world tour to meet experts and check out research labs of telecoms experts. The first iPhone drew a crowd of journalists when it was launched It began with one manufacturer in Malmo, Sweden - a trip which ended with all of their bags, notes and equipment being stolen from their cars while they were inside a restaurant having dinner. ""They knew we were building a phone,"" Fadell said. ""We asked our host where to get to dinner,â we were there all of 20 or 30 minutes because we were tired. ""When we got back to the car, every single thing in the car was gone. Every single bag. We swear it was corporate espionage."" If it was, there were few secrets lost. The team returned home without many of their belongings, but heads full of ideas. iPhones continue to be very popular - though annual sales fell for the first time in the product's history last year Meanwhile, one fiery debate was just getting started. Keyboard killed off It was of course: Should the iPhone have a keyboard or not? ""That fight raged on for around four months,"" Fadell said. ""It was a very ugly situation."" Jobs, who had his heart set on a touchscreen, became so incensed with people disagreeing with his ideas that he enforced a blunt policy. A Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were ""a fragment of the true cross"", and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we'd had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. Read Rory'sblog post ""Until you can agree with us you canât come back in this room,""â Fadell recalled Jobs saying to pro-keyboarders. ""If you donât want to be on the team, donât be on the team."" The disagreements soon stopped. ""One person got sent out of the room and everybody got the message and fell in line."" But while the argument left the room, it didnât leave the iPhone teamâs minds. Indeed, some people still think it was the wrong decision not to go for a Blackberry-style keyboardââwhich, back then at least, was the phone to beat. ""We laid out all the risks of using just a touchscreen. We had to work around each one."" Fans gawp at the new device - it went on sale six months after the first unveiling Secret Stylus Strategy From the word go, Jobs was clear: the iPhone didnât need to work with a stylus because your finger is all you should need. But Fadell told the team working on the multi-touch screenâ-âarguably the greatest breakthrough the iPhone heralded - to make sure it was compatible with a stylus anyway. ""I thought, 'We must make this work with a stylus',"" Fadell remembered. ""Because we knew it was right, even though Steve was making a philosophical point initially saying you can just use your finger. We knew there will come a day when youâre going to need a stylus. ""We did it without his knowledge, it was behind the scenes. He would've ripped my head off."" The latest iPhone was launched in September 2016 Doing things in secret was a common strategy for stubborn engineers and designers who took the view that what Jobs didnât know couldn't hurt him.â And if you were eventually proven right, you could accept the praise. ""It was the same thing that happened with the iPod working on a PC,"" Fadell said. ""Steve wanted nothing to do with it, but when iPod growth stalled, we said, 'Oh by the way we've been working on this background'."" ""I asked Steve how much a song on iTunes cost, and he said, '99 cents'.  I said, 'No, itâs the cost of an iPod, plus the songs, plus a Mac! We only have 1% market share, Steve!' âHe understood.â Jobs may have relented on having Apple products work on Windows, but he took his hatred of the stylus to his grave, though his successor, Tim Cook, introduced the Apple Pencil in 2015. Steve Ballmer's laughter And so to the 9th January 2007. Hordes of fans and media shuffled into San Franciscoâs Moscone Center to see what Jobs brought on as his ""one more thing"" at the end of a keynote address at that yearâs Macworld event. The device on stage was ""only half-baked"", Fadell recalled, but was quickly referred to as the ""Jesus phone"". The success of the iPhone likely helped to popularise smartphones in general The press mocked the cultish manner in which iPhone was unveiled. Steve Ballmer, at the time Microsoft's chief executive,famously laughed at the device,external, calling it ""not a very good email machine"" that wouldn't appeal to business users. ""We all laughed at him,"" Fadell remembered. ""We also laughed at Blackberry. Whenever I create a new productâ, and I learned this with Steve [Jobs], if the incumbents laugh at you and the press laugh at you, you go, 'weâve hit a nerve'."" Since that day, more than a billion iPhones have been sold, helping make Apple the richest company in the world.

Amazon Echos activated by TV comment,"Alexa made its debut on Amazon's Echo speakers An on-air comment by a US TV presenter activated Amazon Echo gadgets in viewers' homes across San Diego. The comment was made by presenter Jim Patton after a news item on a child who accidentally ordered a doll's house via the voice-activated gadget. Reacting to the report, Mr Patton said: ""I love the little girl saying 'Alexa ordered me a dollhouse'."" This reportedly prompted,externalEcho devices in some homes to wake up and try to order some of the toys. The original CW6 TV report Mr Patton reacted to was about six-year-old Brooke Neitzel from Dallas who had been talking to her family's Echo Dot while playing. Brooke asked Alexa to get her a doll's house and cookies and, because the family had not turned on any buying controls, the Echo responded by placing an order for both. The doll's house and a large tin of cookies arrived the next morning, prompting mother Megan to investigate their arrival. Soon after the news item about the accidental purchase aired on San Diego's CW6 morning show, Mr Patton mentioned Alexa and that woke up other Echos in viewers' homes, leading to complaints from their owners. Security expert Graham Cluley said owners of the Echo needed to be aware that voice-driven buying was enabled by default. ""Consider disabling voice purchasing or enabling a four-digit confirmation code to prevent accidental purchases,""he wrote.,external ""There is the potential for mischief-makers to abuse the system in other ways if it can't tell the difference between the voices of authorised and unauthorised users,"" he warned. The Alexa incident is not the first time that TV comments have forced a reaction by voice-driven gadgets. In 2014, a TV advert for the Xbox console featuring actor Aaron Paul during which he said ""Xbox On"" woke up many consoles fitted with the Kinect sensor.

U2 to tour The Joshua Tree this summer,"The band recreated Anton Corbijn's famous cover shoot to announce the tour Rock band U2 will celebrate the 30th anniversary of their seminal Joshua Tree album this summer by playing the album in full around the world. The 25 shows include dates in London and at Dublin's Croke Park, where the band played a triumphant homecoming show on the original Joshua Tree tour. Released in 1987, the album included hits such as Where the Streets Have No Name and With or Without You. It sold 25 million copies, turning the band into stadium-filling superstars. In aninterview with Rolling Stone,external, U2 guitarist The Edge said the band had not yet decided how to structure the concerts. ""The show might not necessarily start with track one, side one - Where the Streets Have No Name - because we feel like maybe we need to build up to that moment,"" he said. ""So we're still in the middle of figuring out exactly how the running order will go."" Alongside the hits, fans will be looking forward to hearing some rarely-performed album tracks, including Trip Through Your Wires and In God's Country. The Joshua Tree tour began in arenas but had to upgrade to stadiums to meet demand The band will perform throughout Europe and North America The song Red Hill Mining Town, a response to the 1980s miners' strike, will also receive its first live performance, having never featured in the band's setlists - although they rehearsed it during soundchecks in 1987. ""Recently I listened back to The Joshua Tree for the first time in nearly 30 years,"" said U2 frontman Bono, ""It's quite an opera. ""A lot of emotions which feel strangely current, love, loss, broken dreams, seeking oblivion, polarisationâ¦ all the greats. ""I've sung some of these songs a lot but never all of them.  I'm up for it, if our audience is as excited as we areâ¦ it's gonna be a great night."" ""It seems like we have come full circle from when The Joshua Tree songs were originally written, with global upheaval, extreme right wing politics and some fundamental human rights at risk,"" added guitarist The Edge. ""To celebrate the album - as the songs seem so relevant and prescient of these times too - we decided to do these shows, it feels right for now. We're looking forward to it."" Support acts confirmed for the tour include OneRepublic, The Lumineers and, in the UK and Europe, Noel Gallagher.

Famous sequoia tree toppled by US storm,"The giant sequoia, which was carved into a living tunnel over a century ago, has fallen Storms in California have toppled one of America's most famous trees - the Pioneer Cabin Tree. The giant sequoia was known for having a hole cut through its trunk - big enough for a car to drive through. The tree, estimated to be more than 1,000-years-old, was felled by the strongest storm to have hit the area in more than a decade. California and Nevada have been hit by unusually high rainfall levels, leading to flooding and falling trees. The Calaveras Big Trees Association first reported that the drive-through Pioneer Cabin Tree - carved 137 years ago - was no more. The storm was ""just too much for it"", the group wrote ina Facebook post,externalthat has drawn nearly 2,000 comments. ""Many memories were created under this tree,"" one read. ""They will remain good memories."" Others pointed out that the tree might have survived for longer if a tunnel had not been carved into it. ""You can't cut a hole in a tree like this and expect it to live,"" said one comment. ""This hole always bothered me so much. Why not just drive around it?"" Park volunteer Jim Allday said the sequoia, also known as the Tunnel Tree, shattered as it hit the ground. ""We lost an old friend today,"" he wrote in a social media post. Giant sequoia are closely related to the redwood tree, which is considered thetallest tree species on earth, reaching 250ft (76 metres). They can only grow naturally in the groves of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. A 1899 stereograph shows the Pioneer Cabin tree The tree fell as parts of California and Nevada were drenched by a seasonal weather system known as the Pineapple Express. Not to be confused with the Seth Rogen movie of the same name, the Pineapple Express is an ""atmospheric river"" that extends across the Pacific from Hawaii to the US West Coast, meteorologists say. ""This is a serious flood situation,"" the National Weather Service said in a special flood statement late Sunday night after the Russian River in California and the Truckee River in Nevada burst their banks. Hundreds of people have been forced to flee their homes in Northern California and Nevada as water levels rise, and avalanches and mudslides close roads.

Michelle Roberts: Are patients starving to death on NHS wards?,"The Sun newspaper on Monday carries the headline ""Kill by mouth: Two die in NHS each day of thirst or starvation"". A shocking claim, based on figures from the Office of National Statistics. The data for England and Wales shows that in 2015, hunger and/or dehydration were a factor in 828 patient deaths in hospitals and care homes. But that doesn't mean all of these patients starved to death or died of thirst, experts at the ONS were quick to point out when I spoke with them about it. Malnutrition may be recorded on the death certificate as a factor contributing directly to a death when it was a complication of a different underlying cause, such as cancer of the stomach, for example.

The LCP was scrapped in 2015 after relatives complained that their loved ones had been put on it without their knowledge and denied fluids, which hastened their deaths.

Joan Morris suffered a heart attack and died four weeks after being admitted to Stafford General Hospital Joan Morris, 83, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in December 2006 with a chest infection. Her family said that food and water had been left on a table instead of being given to her. Another patient, Tom Wilhelms, resorted to drinking from a vase. In response to the Francis Inquiry into the failings at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust, the government published new hospital standards including around nutritional and hydration care. And it asked the Care Quality Commission to make sure that the hospitals and care homes it inspected were following these standards. The CQC's first dedicated review was in 2012. It inspected 500 care homes and 50 hospitals in England and found 83% of care homes and 88% of hospitals it inspected met people's nutritional needs, which means patients were provided a suitable choice of food and drink and given help to eat and drink when they needed it. It says this shows things have improved. Prof Sir Mike Richards, CQC Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: ""We expect the food provided to be nutritious, to meet people's dietary requirements, and for this to be included as part of patients care planning while in hospital, and we look closely at this on our inspections. Where we find this is not happening or identify concerns that people's nutritional needs are not being met we take action and have a range of enforcement powers at our disposal where required."" Age UK agrees that there's been progress, but says malnutrition in the NHS is still a big issue. Lesley Carter, who works of the charity and is programme manager of the Malnutrition Task Force, says a third of people going into hospitals and care homes are already malnourished or at risk of malnutrition when they are admitted. ""That means they are already vulnerable to start with."" She said that on busy wards, mealtimes might get rushed or overlooked without the right staffing. ""Older people in particular might need help to eat and drink, and they aren't always getting this. Food can still be left out of reach. ""Some hospitals have employed nutrition nurses to spot those patients that need help, and nutrition assistants to help with the feeding, which is good. ""But it is time consuming to feed someone properly."" She says friends and families have a responsibility to keep a check on elderly loved ones too. ""We all need to realise that it's not natural to lose weight as we age."" Although elderly people should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet, she says this can backfire. A salad might be worse than cake in terms of nutrition for someone who is old and frail and has a poor appetite, for example. ""Some residents in care homes are being given low fat yoghurt and semi-skimmed milk when instead they should get full fat milk."" Food for thought.

The shared society - more than a slogan?,"When she began her leadership campaign to move into No 10, in an uncharacteristically brash statement, the then home secretary stood up and said: ""I'm Theresa May and I'm the best person to be prime minister."" But in the six months since she did take charge, far, far faster than she had anticipated, politics has been dominated by the questions the prime minister doesn't want to answer yet - on how she plans to negotiate our EU exit. And without very much evidence of a bold vision on that front in recent weeks, charges that her government is directionless, drifting, have started to gain currency. That's why her first big speech of the year, the start of what aides describe as a ""lot more activity"", matters, as the prime minister seeks to try to explain to the public why she believes she is the best person to be prime minister. After her speech on the steps of Downing Street, and the Tory party conference in October, and under the glittering chandeliers of the Mansion House before Christmas, today was one of what's still only a handful of opportunities she has taken to sketch her own image as the occupant of Downing Street. If you were hoping for radical departures from the PM, you'd have been disappointed. May: Brexit can 'change UK for better' PM pledges to improve mental health care In fact it was striking how familiar today's speech was to those previous few - whole sections were more or less identical, with another strong restatement of her belief that for millions of people, life just doesn't feel very fair. She is not a politician trying to sell a cheery vision, not a politician claiming that nirvana is around the corner. She mentioned the word injustice 17 times, what she described as ""everyday"" injustice that breeds resentment between young and old, London and the rest of the country, rich and poor. Listening to her on all of those big occasions, despite having been at the top table of the government for six years, you sense that Theresa May fundamentally thinks that there is quite a lot that is wrong with Britain. But alongside what feels by now, a familiar and rather downbeat analysis of the state we are in, for the first time came what the prime minister wants us to see as her solution to all that. This video can not be played Theresa May warns about rise of 'fringe' politics Not the Big Society of David Cameron, nor even Margaret Thatcher's much misquoted statement, ""there is no such thing as society - there are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first"". But for Theresa May it is a ""shared society"", where we all have responsibilities to each other, and an ""active"" government has a responsibility to step in to help, not just the poorest, but the millions in the middle too. After a while, every political leader finds themselves in need of a slogan, and it's certainly not the worst that's ever been dreamed up. She wants you to see her and her party as the sensible middle, on the side of ordinary families, not veering away from the centre ground. It's about as clear an appeal to Middle England, where elections are traditionally won, as you can find. But while she gave today the skeleton of a philosophy, there was not a fully fleshed-out body of policy to accompany it. And even before the speech was given, the policy that she did talk more about crashed into the common problem of reality versus political rhetoric. Theresa May's desire to make sure that people who need help with their mental health, particularly children, get what they need as soon as possible, and that society sheds the stigma around it, seems genuinely felt. But she is not the first Conservative politician to have made such a promise. Her predecessor made a similar big one exactly a year ago. And more importantly perhaps, there is deep scepticism from opposition politicians and those who work in the sector, that the system can work properly without a significant amount of extra cash. What's happening on the ground was described to me as a ""car crash"" today by someone in the sector. However many times the prime minister says she wants to make sure mental health is treated just a seriously as physical health, the pressures on funding right across the NHS do matter. Today's measures are also about where money is being allocated, not opening up the taxpayer's chequebook to top up health budgets. But that's not the only political problem that Theresa May's vision of a ""shared society"" will face. Prime ministers are always defined by what they choose to pursue but also by what they can't control. In managing our departure from the EU, she faces the biggest challenge any leader has had in decades. Preventing her government from becoming consumed by that will take more than a series of speeches and a new slogan.

The inside story of the firstÂ iPhone,"Steve Jobs unveiling the first iPhone in 2007 ""Steve had expressly told me it was totally top secret. He said he was going to fire anyone who tells the world. ""I was sweating bullets."" Tony Fadell was pondering just how he was going to explain to Steve Jobs that he'd lost the prototype of what would become the most successful technology product of all time, the Apple iPhone which launched 10 years ago on Monday. He'd just got off a plane, felt his pockets, and... nothing. ""I was walking through every scenario thinking about what could happen,"" he told me. None of them ended well. After two hours, relief - thanks to the efforts of a search party that didnât know what it was trying to find. ""It fell out of my pocket and it was lodged in between the seats!"" Tony Fadell, known as the ""godfather"" of the iPod Within just a few months, the world would know all about the little device - but for now, Fadell was holding it tight. 60s future phone Tony Fadell is sometimes referred to as the ""godfather"" of the iPod. He left Apple in 2010, and went on to found Nest, the smart home company now owned by Alphabet, Googleâs parent company.He left that company last year*. As far as Fadell is concerned, today is in fact the 12-and-a-half year anniversary of the first iPhone. Thatâs when he started working on the idea, born out of an acceptance that the iPod, which was turning around Appleâs fortunes, was a platform that could be developed further. By this point the iPod had got video capabilities, even games. ""We were like, 'Wait a second, data networks are coming',"" he told the BBC. ""We should be looking at this as a general purpose platform."" Starting this way was the magic ingredient that meant the iPhone broke boundaries, Fadell said. While competitors like Microsoft were trying to shrink the PC into a phone, Apple was looking to grow the iPod into something more sophisticated. Indeed, one early iPhone concept design used the iPod's distinctive click-wheel as its input method. That was soon ditched. This video can not be played A look back at the launch of the first iPhone in January 2007 ""We were turning it into a rotary phone from the sixties,"" Fadell remembered. ""We were like, 'This doesnât work! It's too hard to use'."" It just so happened that in another part of Apple, work had started on a touchscreen Macintosh computer. ""They had been working on this in secret. It was the size of a ping pong table. Steve showed it to me and said, 'I want to take that and put it on an iPod'."" Fadell warned Jobs that to make a touchscreen device like the one he envisioned would take time, money and new dedicated infrastructure. They went for it. ""We needed thousands of people working on all of this, at the same time, for it to land together for the launch. ""And then we only had six months after that to ship it. Obviously we pulled it off, but it was not easy."" Malmo Mystery Apple had many of the best brains in the business, but until that point it hadnât ever made a phone of its own. And so Fadell planned a fact-finding world tour to meet experts and check out research labs of telecoms experts. The first iPhone drew a crowd of journalists when it was launched It began with one manufacturer in Malmo, Sweden - a trip which ended with all of their bags, notes and equipment being stolen from their cars while they were inside a restaurant having dinner. ""They knew we were building a phone,"" Fadell said. ""We asked our host where to get to dinner,â we were there all of 20 or 30 minutes because we were tired. ""When we got back to the car, every single thing in the car was gone. Every single bag. We swear it was corporate espionage."" If it was, there were few secrets lost. The team returned home without many of their belongings, but heads full of ideas. iPhones continue to be very popular - though annual sales fell for the first time in the product's history last year Meanwhile, one fiery debate was just getting started. Keyboard killed off It was of course: Should the iPhone have a keyboard or not? ""That fight raged on for around four months,"" Fadell said. ""It was a very ugly situation."" Jobs, who had his heart set on a touchscreen, became so incensed with people disagreeing with his ideas that he enforced a blunt policy. A Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were ""a fragment of the true cross"", and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we'd had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. Read Rory'sblog post ""Until you can agree with us you canât come back in this room,""â Fadell recalled Jobs saying to pro-keyboarders. ""If you donât want to be on the team, donât be on the team."" The disagreements soon stopped. ""One person got sent out of the room and everybody got the message and fell in line."" But while the argument left the room, it didnât leave the iPhone teamâs minds. Indeed, some people still think it was the wrong decision not to go for a Blackberry-style keyboardââwhich, back then at least, was the phone to beat. ""We laid out all the risks of using just a touchscreen. We had to work around each one."" Fans gawp at the new device - it went on sale six months after the first unveiling Secret Stylus Strategy From the word go, Jobs was clear: the iPhone didnât need to work with a stylus because your finger is all you should need. But Fadell told the team working on the multi-touch screenâ-âarguably the greatest breakthrough the iPhone heralded - to make sure it was compatible with a stylus anyway. ""I thought, 'We must make this work with a stylus',"" Fadell remembered. ""Because we knew it was right, even though Steve was making a philosophical point initially saying you can just use your finger. We knew there will come a day when youâre going to need a stylus. ""We did it without his knowledge, it was behind the scenes. He would've ripped my head off."" The latest iPhone was launched in September 2016 Doing things in secret was a common strategy for stubborn engineers and designers who took the view that what Jobs didnât know couldn't hurt him.â And if you were eventually proven right, you could accept the praise. ""It was the same thing that happened with the iPod working on a PC,"" Fadell said. ""Steve wanted nothing to do with it, but when iPod growth stalled, we said, 'Oh by the way we've been working on this background'."" ""I asked Steve how much a song on iTunes cost, and he said, '99 cents'.  I said, 'No, itâs the cost of an iPod, plus the songs, plus a Mac! We only have 1% market share, Steve!' âHe understood.â Jobs may have relented on having Apple products work on Windows, but he took his hatred of the stylus to his grave, though his successor, Tim Cook, introduced the Apple Pencil in 2015. Steve Ballmer's laughter And so to the 9th January 2007. Hordes of fans and media shuffled into San Franciscoâs Moscone Center to see what Jobs brought on as his ""one more thing"" at the end of a keynote address at that yearâs Macworld event. The device on stage was ""only half-baked"", Fadell recalled, but was quickly referred to as the ""Jesus phone"". The success of the iPhone likely helped to popularise smartphones in general The press mocked the cultish manner in which iPhone was unveiled. Steve Ballmer, at the time Microsoft's chief executive,famously laughed at the device,external, calling it ""not a very good email machine"" that wouldn't appeal to business users. ""We all laughed at him,"" Fadell remembered. ""We also laughed at Blackberry. Whenever I create a new productâ, and I learned this with Steve [Jobs], if the incumbents laugh at you and the press laugh at you, you go, 'weâve hit a nerve'."" Since that day, more than a billion iPhones have been sold, helping make Apple the richest company in the world.

Why RBS's recovery is lagging Lloyds',"Eight years ago the government rescued Lloyds by taking a 43% stake for just over Â£20bn. The fact that the government is no longer even the biggest shareholder marks an important return to near normality. Since 2013, the government stake has been sold off at first in a couple of big chunks and then in a gradual trickle and so this moment was bound to happen at some stage. The government still owns nearly 6%, but global investor Blackrock now eclipses that and Lloyds is on trajectory to return to full private ownership later this year when taxpayers should recoup all the money they put in. It hasn't been an easy ride.  The huge compensation costs of PPI mis-selling and intermittent market turbulence have hampered and delayed the process, but Lloyds, while not risk-free, can be considered pretty much out of the woods. As a plain vanilla UK savings and lending bank, Lloyds was always going to be an easier bank to fix than RBS which is still about 71% owned by the taxpayer. As a global bank with fingers in most of the pies that got burnt during the crisis, RBS has paid out over Â£50bn in fines and compensation and has its biggest reckoning yet to come. It is still facing a bill from US authorities which could end up in the double digit billions for its role in the subprime mis-selling scandal that started the whole financial crisis in the first place. While those negotiations could come to a head as early as this week (watch out for separate blog on this), RBS won't reach the point Lloyds did today for many, many years to come.

How Conservative leaders have attempted to define society,"Theresa May has set out her vision for a ""shared society"" in which the state has a role in helping people who are struggling to get by. It marks the latest attempt by a Conservative leader to spell out what society should, or should not, be. Margaret Thatcher's remark about society was one of her most famous In a 1987 interview with Woman's Own magazine, Margaret Thatcher said there was ""no such thing as society"", and that line went on to become one of her most famous. It has been much debated over the years, with critics seeing it as evidence of a heartless approach where needy individuals are left to fend for themselves. But Thatcher's supporters complain the quote is taken out of context, and in her memoirs the former PM said it had been ""distorted beyond recognition"". More recently, polling hasfound,externalthat while a strong majority of people disagreed with the ""no such thing"" line in isolation, most agreed with the longer version. Here it is: ""I think we've been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it's the government's job to cope with it... They're casting their problem on society. ""And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families, and no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first. ""It's our duty to look after ourselves and then, also, to look after our neighbour. People have got the entitlements too much in mind, without the obligations. There's no such thing as entitlement, unless someone has first met an obligation."" Thatcher's successor, John Major, entered Downing Street in 1990 promising to create a ""classless society"", which he described as a ""a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement"". He was still talking about it in his party conference speech the following year: ""I spoke of a classless society. I don't shrink from that phrase. ""I don't mean a society in which everyone is the same, or thinks the same, or earns the same. But a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement; where every promotion, every certificate is respected; and each person's contribution is valued. And where the greatest respect is reserved for the law."" William Hague promised a 'responsible society' Next up was William Hague, who called for a ""responsible society"", and said Thatcher's famous line had been wilfully misinterpreted and used against the Conservatives. ""A strong society rests on responsible individuals and families. They need to be able to turn to straightforward, reliable help when times are bad,"" the Tories' 2001manifesto,externalsaid. ""But that should not become dependence on the state when times are good."" This video can not be played David Cameron: ""I think we're onto a really big idea, a really exciting future for our country"" ""There is such a thing as society; it's just not the same thing as the state,"" declared David Cameron in his 2005 victoryspeech,externalafter becoming Conservative leader. Five years later, the idea of a Big Society was a key strand of the Conservatives' 2010 general election manifesto. It involved allowing voluntary groups and charities to run public services, encouraging people to do more volunteering and giving local groups more power to take decisions affecting their area. After becoming PM, Cameron described building the Big Society as his ""great passion"", hoping ""people power"" would help keep pubs and museums open and mean more residents getting involved with their communities. But there were reports Conservative candidates found it a hard concept to explain on the doorstep, and the Tories' political opponents said it was simply a way of hiding cuts to local services as the new government reduced public spending. Mentions of the Big Society became less prominent over the course of the Parliament, and the theme featured little in the 2015 general election campaign. Having quit frontline politics after the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Cameron now works with the National Citizen Service, describing the organisation as ""the Big Society in action"". This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to ""build a better Britain"" In what has been seen as a break from David Cameron's championing of voluntary work, Theresa May has stressed the role of the state in creating ""a society that works for everyone"". The so-called shared society, she says, ""doesn't just value our individual rights but focuses rather more on the responsibilities we have to one another"" and respects ""the bonds of family, community, citizenship and strong institutions that we share as a union of people and nations"". In a speech setting out her vision, she said there was ""more to life than individualism and self-interest"". ""We form families, communities, towns, cities, counties and nations. And we embrace the responsibilities those institutions imply. ""And government has a clear role to play to support this conception of society.""

Michelle Roberts: Are patients starving to death on NHS wards?9 January 2017 (14:23:55),"The Sun newspaper on Monday carries the headline ""Kill by mouth: Two die in NHS each day of thirst or starvation"". A shocking claim, based on figures from the Office of National Statistics. The data for England and Wales shows that in 2015, hunger and/or dehydration were a factor in 828 patient deaths in hospitals and care homes. But that doesn't mean all of these patients starved to death or died of thirst, experts at the ONS were quick to point out when I spoke with them about it. Malnutrition may be recorded on the death certificate as a factor contributing directly to a death when it was a complication of a different underlying cause, such as cancer of the stomach, for example. If you are very sick, it might not be feasible or desirable to eat and drink. Having a disease such as advanced cancer can cause malnutrition.

""That means they are already vulnerable to start with."" She said that on busy wards, mealtimes might get rushed or overlooked without the right staffing. ""Older people in particular might need help to eat and drink, and they aren't always getting this. Food can still be left out of reach. ""Some hospitals have employed nutrition nurses to spot those patients that need help, and nutrition assistants to help with the feeding, which is good. ""But it is time consuming to feed someone properly."" She says friends and families have a responsibility to keep a check on elderly loved ones too. ""We all need to realise that it's not natural to lose weight as we age."" Although elderly people should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet, she says this can backfire. A salad might be worse than cake in terms of nutrition for someone who is old and frail and has a poor appetite, for example. ""Some residents in care homes are being given low fat yoghurt and semi-skimmed milk when instead they should get full fat milk."" Food for thought.

The steel box that changed global trade9 January 2017 (00:26:28),"Perhaps the defining feature of the global economy is precisely that it is global. Toys from China, copper from Chile, T-shirts from Bangladesh, wine from New Zealand, coffee from Ethiopia, and tomatoes from Spain. Like it or not, globalisation is a fundamental feature of the modern economy. In the early 1960s, world trade in merchandise was less than 20% of world economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP). Now, it is around 50% but not everyone is happy about it. There is probably no other issue where the anxieties of ordinary people are so in conflict with the near-unanimous approval of economists. Arguments over trade tend to frame globalisation as a policy - maybe even an ideology - fuelled by acronymic trade deals like TRIPS and TTIP. But perhaps the biggest enabler of globalisation has not been a free trade agreement, but a simple invention: the shipping container. It is just a corrugated steel box, 8ft (2.4m) wide, 8ft 6in (2.6m) high, and 40ft (12m) long but its impact has been huge. BBC World Service's50 Things That Made the Modern Economyprogramme highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the global economy. You can find more information about its sources andlisten onlineordownload the programme podcast. Consider how a typical trade journey looked before its invention. In 1954, an unremarkable cargo ship, the SS Warrior, carried merchandise from New York to Bremerhaven in Germany. It held just over 5,000 tonnes of cargo - including food, household goods, letters and vehicles - which were carried as 194,582 separate items in 1,156 different shipments. Just keeping track of the consignments as they moved around the dockside warehouses was a nightmare. But the real challenge was physically loading such ships. Longshoremen would pile the cargo onto a wooden pallet on the dock. The pallet would be hoisted in a sling and deposited in the hold. More longshoremen carted each item into a snug corner of the ship, poking the merchandise with steel hooks until it settled into place against the curves and bulkheads of the hold, skilfully packed so that it would not shift on the high seas. There were cranes and forklifts but much of the merchandise, from bags of sugar heavier than a man to metal bars the weight of a small car, was shifted with muscle power. This was dangerous work. In a large port, someone would be killed every few weeks. In 1950, New York averaged half a dozen serious incidents every day, and its port was safer than many. Researchers studying the SS Warrior's trip to Bremerhaven concluded the ship had taken ten days to load and unload, as much time as it had spent crossing the Atlantic. In today's money, the cargo cost around $420 (Â£335) a tonne to move. Given typical delays in sorting and distributing the cargo by land, the whole journey might take three months. Sixty years ago, then, shipping goods internationally was costly, chancy, and immensely time-consuming. Surely there had to be a better way? Indeed there was: put all the cargo into big standard boxes, and move those. But inventing the box was the easy bit - the shipping container had already been tried in various forms for decades. The real challenge was overcoming the social obstacles. To begin with, the trucking companies, shipping companies, and ports could not agree on a standard size. Some wanted large containers while others wanted smaller versions; perhaps because they specialised in heavy goods or trucked on narrow mountain roads. Then there were the powerful dockworkers' unions, who resisted the idea. Yes the containers would make the job of loading ships safer but it would also mean fewer jobs. Malcom McLean understood how revolutionary containerisation could be for shipping US regulators also preferred the status quo. The sector was tightly bound with red tape, with separate sets of regulations determining how much that shipping and trucking companies could charge. Why not simply let companies charge whatever the market would bear - or even allow shipping and trucking companies to merge, and put together an integrated service? Perhaps the bureaucrats too were simply keen to preserve their jobs. Such bold ideas would have left them with less to do. The man who navigated this maze of hazards, and who can fairly be described as the inventor of the modern shipping container system, was called Malcom McLean. McLean did not know anything about shipping but he was a trucking entrepreneur. He knew plenty about trucks, plenty about playing the system, and all there was to know about saving money. As Marc Levinson explains in his book, The Box, McLean not only saw the potential of a shipping container that would fit neatly onto a flat bed truck, he also had the skills and the risk-taking attitude needed to make it happen. First, McLean cheekily exploited a legal loophole to gain control of both a shipping company and a trucking company. Then, when dockers went on strike, he used the idle time to refit old ships to new container specifications. He repeatedly plunged into debt. He took on ""fat cat"" incumbents in Puerto Rico, revitalising the island's economy by slashing shipping rates to the United States. He cannily encouraged New York's Port Authority to make the New Jersey side of the harbour a centre for container shipping. But probably the most striking coup took place in the late 1960s, when Malcom McLean sold the idea of container shipping to perhaps the world's most powerful customer: the US Military. Faced with an unholy logistical nightmare in trying to ship equipment to Vietnam, the military turned to McLean's container ships. Containers work much better when they are part of an integrated logistical system, and the US military was perfectly placed to implement that. Even better, McLean realised that on the way back from Vietnam, his empty container ships could collect payloads from the world's fastest growing economy, Japan. And so trans-Pacific trading began in earnest. A modern shipping port would be unrecognisable to a hardworking longshoreman of the 1950s. Even a modest container ship might carry 20 times as much cargo as the SS Warrior did, yet disgorge its cargo in hours rather than days. Gigantic cranes weighing 1,000 tonnes apiece lock onto containers which themselves weigh upwards of 30 tonnes, and swing them up and over on to a waiting transporter. The colossal ballet of engineering is choreographed by computers, which track every container as it moves through a global logistical system. The refrigerated containers are put in a hull section with power and temperature monitors. The heavier containers are placed at the bottom to keep the ship's centre of gravity low. The entire process is scheduled to keep the ship balanced. And after the crane has released one container onto a waiting transporter, it will grasp another before swinging back over the ship, which is being simultaneously emptied and refilled. Not everywhere enjoys the benefits of the containerisation revolution. Many ports in poorer countries still look like New York in the 1950s. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, remains largely cut off from the world economy because of poor infrastructure. But for an ever-growing number of destinations, goods can now be shipped reliably, swiftly and cheaply. Rather than the $420 (Â£335) that a customer would have paid to get the SS Warrior to ship a tonne of goods across the Atlantic in 1954, you might now pay less than $50 (Â£39). Indeed, economists who study international trade often assume that transport costs are zero. It keeps the mathematics simpler, they say, and thanks to the shipping container, it is nearly true.

Johnson's meeting with Trump team and 'polar blast',"The Daily Telegraph leads with Boris Johnson meeting Donald Trump's top advisors in what its headline calls a ""Brexit boost"". It says the foreign secretaryseized the opportunity to strengthen trade deals,externaland the ""special relationship"". But The Guardian saysit came against a backdrop of critical remarks,externalby Theresa May, who on Sunday declared the president-elect's remarks about women ""unacceptable"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is in New York visiting Donald Trump's advisors The paper also highlights Mr Johnson's past comments, describing Donald Trump as ""betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him unfit to hold the office of president"" before, after his victory, calling for an end to the ""whinge-o-rama"". The past insults are remembered too byThe Daily Mail,external, which says the trip came as ministers tried to mend fences with the incoming US president. The Financial Times,external, meanwhile, says one of those Boris Johnson met - Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner - has also held recent talks with a man it calls ""one of China's most politically connected tycoons"". For the paper, the meeting, about a potential real estate deal, raises fresh questions about conflicts of interest in the incoming administration. The Times leads with Theresa May calling for what its headline describes as a""revolution in child mental health care"",external. The paper sees it as a significant but overdue victory for its campaign and believes her determination to tackle the issue will ""be a yardstick by which her social compassion is judged."" ""May declares war on school cyber-bullies"" is the headline forThe Daily Mail,external, whileThe Financial Times,externalfocuses on Mrs May's plan to shift away from David Cameron's Big Society and use the power of government to help struggling working families. There's much coverage too of the prime minister's hint in an interview on Sunday that Britain won't stay in the single market after Brexit. ""I'll dig my heels in"" is the headline forThe Sun,external, which believes Mrs May is instead hoping to retain tariff-free access with ""a jumbo trade deal"". The Daily Express' editorial,externalsays she spoke ""the words we have all been waiting to hear"". But The Daily Mirror's associate editor, Kevin Maguire, says the prime minister was""afraid to give straight answers to direct, pertinent questions about the future."",external A government source is quoted by boththe Daily Mail,externalandThe Telegraph,externalas saying this week's wave of strikes has been co-ordinated by unions to inflict ""maximum pain"" on the public. With the headline""Millions left stranded as strikes bring transport system to a halt"",external, the Daily Express argues, in its editorial, that the reasons given for the Tube and rail walkouts are just a smokescreen for a crude political agenda. But, with the headline ""Army of new drivers to defeat rail strikes,external"", The Times says a national recruitment campaign will be launched under government plans to combat the industrial action. Snowy scenes from across Europe abound in many of the papers - with what The Daily Star's front page dubs a ""killer arctic storm""set to reach Britain,externallater this week. But The Times reports that tens of thousands of winter holidays face ruin because of alack of snow in the Alps,external. The Times reports that there has been a lack of snow in the Alps It says dozens of the most popular resorts could have to turn off their snow cannons, which have proved vital in creating ski runs during weeks of unseasonably dry weather. And finally The Daily Mail reports that, while many women spend hundreds of pounds on lotions and potions, scientists in the US have found the secret to looking youthful could come fromstimulating the skin's own fat cells,external. The Expressbelieves it could lead to a new generation of anti-aging treatments,externaland scar-free healing for wounds.

Leisha Chi: Aviation trends to watch in 2017,"The XB-1 supersonic prototype has been nicknamed ""Baby Boom"" It has been a tough few years for the aviation industry and 2016 proved no different. Carriers had to navigate the collapse in oil prices and multiple plane tragedies includingEgyptAirin May and theChapecoense crashin Colombia, as well as fire-proneSamsung phones. However, it is worth noting that last year was actually one of the safest in modern aviation history. So what does 2017 hold in store? Here are some trends to watch out for. Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson reportedly tried to buy the Concorde fleet but was rebuffed RememberConcorde? It's been more than a decade since the plane was retired from service. But British billionaire Sir Richard Branson is looking to usher in the age of the supersonic flight once again; and make it affordable to the masses. His company Virgin Galactic is working with US start-upBoom,externalto develop the XB-1, which is being plugged as the world's fastest civil aircraft ever made. Boom is developing Concorde's successor but you'll have to wait until at least 2023 for a flight Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also developing supersonic passenger jets, but Sir Richard is hoping to beat them to the punch. The prototype, nicknamed ""Baby Boom"", will see its first test flight take place later this year though the first commercial flight of its scaled-up successor is not expected until 2023. It has a cruising speed 10% faster than the Concorde (which flew at more than twice the speed of sound) and is nearly three times the speed of a regular plane. Boom's airliner is designed to carry 40 passengers at a time and fly between London and New York in just three hours and 15 minutes. The price for a flight? A mere Â£2,500 each way. Oil prices are creeping back upward but airlines are set to remain profitable in 2017. The International Air Transport Association(IATA),externalforecasts the global airline industry will make $29.8bn (Â£24bn) in 2017,  its third straight year of profit. Last year the sector logged a record $35.6bn. ""These three years are the best performance in the industry's history, irrespective of the many uncertainties we face,"" says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. ""After many years of hard work in restructuring and re-engineering the business the industry is also more resilient"". But the profits won't be evenly spread; the strongest performance is expected to be come from North America, which has seen a wave of airline consolidation in recent years. Forget about comparing plane sizes, this year will be focused on route lengths and who can claim the title of world's longest flight operator. Emirates currently holds the crown with the 14,200km (8,820 miles) journey between Dubai and Auckland. That flight takes 16 hours and 5 minutes eastbound and 17h 25m westbound. Its rival Qatar Airways will overtake that in February, when it also launches a non-stop flight from Doha to New Zealand's largest city, covering 14,542km, with a flight time of between 17 and a half hours and 18 and a half hours. In terms of kilometres, the longest route is Air India's Delhi to San Francisco (15,300km) - which now flies over the Pacific Ocean instead of the Atlantic -  but because of favourable tailwinds takes only 14 and a half hours. From cars to trains to planes: Asia is the world's fastest-growing travel market Air France plans to launch a new budget carrier in late 2017 serving cities in Asia, followed by routes to the US. The Air-France KLM group already operates the Hop and Transavia budget brands in Europe. Within Europe, Ryanair and Easyjet dominate much of the market, leading many companies to look at the transatlantic route for more profits. Iceland's Wow Air will also be expanding its budget routes to the United States in June 2017. It plans to add four weekly flights via Reykjavik. Delta's new A350s will feature 32 business suites, 48 premium economy seats (pictured) and 226 main cabin economy seats There used to be first class, business class and economy, but for those of us constantly relegated to cattle class there is now an extra twist - premium economy. You're still towards the back of the plane, but you get extra legroom, service and amenities. Later this year, for example, on long-haul international flights on its new Airbus A350s, Delta Air Lines launches what it calls its ""Delta Premium Select"" option. You get ""up to 38in of pitch, up to 19in of width and up to 7in of recline"", a branded blanket with pillow and an amenity kit, it promises. The catch? The more expensive tickets are around three times the price of the standard economy fare. Hawaiian Airlines is changing its employees' uniforms for the first time since 2008 In the post-war air travel boom, the centre aisle was marketed as a runway for glamorous stewardesses. Some carriers are now looking to recapture some of that chic with newly-revamped wardrobes. Hawaiian Airlines is changing its employees' outfits for the first time since 2008, while Delta has worked with New York designer Zac Posen to update its uniforms. Delta says its 60,000 employees will now be draped in a ""wholly re-imagined"" mix of colours dubbed ""Passport Plum, Cruising Cardinal and Groundspeed Graphite"". Which sounds more glamorous than just calling them purple, red or grey. Follow Leisha on Twitter:@BBCLeishaChi,external Does the 'superjumbo' have a future?

Gangman style,"As a young child in the capital of North Korea, Sungju Lee lived a pampered life. But by the time he was a teenager, he was starving and fighting for survival in a street gang. It was one of many twists of fate on a journey that has led him to postgraduate studies at a British university. In the early 1990s, Sungju Lee was living comfortably with his parents in a three-bedroom apartment in Pyongyang. He attended school and Taekwondo classes, visited parks and rode on Ferris wheels. He assumed that, like his father, he would grow up to become an officer in the North Korean army. But in 1994, this life came to an abrupt end with the death of North Korea's founding father, Kim Il-Sung. Although Sungju did not know it at the time, his own father, who had been working as a bodyguard, had fallen out of favour with the new regime. The family was forced to flee the capital. To hide from their child the danger they were in, his parents told him they were taking a holiday. Sungju wanted to believe his father, but when he boarded a dirty, damaged train he had doubts. ""I saw beggars - kids my age - and I was shocked,"" he says. ""I asked my father, 'Are we in North Korea?' Because when I was in Pyongyang, I was taught that North Korea was one of the richest countries in the world."" Their destination was the north-western town of Gyeong-seong, where they moved into a tiny, unheated house. At school Sungju found the other students malnourished and behind in their classes. One morning his teachers marched the children to an outside arena where they were told to sit and watch. Three police officers with guns appeared and a man and woman were led out and tied to wooden poles. The crowd was told the man had been caught stealing and the woman had tried to escape into China. They had both been convicted of high treason, and this was a public execution. ""Each of the police officers shot three bullets for each person. Bang, bang, bang,"" Sungju says. ""Blood came out. There was a hole in their forehead, and at the back of their head there was nothing left."" As the months passed, Sungju struggled to adapt to his new harsh circumstances. Food was becoming more scarce as North Korea descended into a crippling famine and many of his classmates had dropped out of school to forage for squirrels or to steal from the local market. Then suddenly Sungju's father announced he was leaving. He told his son he was going to China to look for food, and would come back in a week with rice cakes. The week passed, but Sungju's father did not return. Soon afterwards, his mother told him she was going to travel to his aunt's house to find food. Fearing she would also not return, Sungju refused to leave her side. But eventually he fell asleep and she slipped away, leaving a note telling him to eat salt with water if he was hungry. He never saw her again. ""I started hating my parents,"" he says. ""They were so irresponsible. They just left me and I completely lost everything."" This video can not be played Sungju Lee fought other children and stole food to survive the streets of North Korea At that point Sungju realised the only way he would survive was to form a street gang. He banded together with six other boys and they studied how to pick pockets and distract merchants so they could grab produce from their market stalls. ""We trusted each other. We could die for each other and we were all bound to each other and that's how we survived,"" he says. Every few months, when the merchants began to recognise them, the gang had to move to another town. Finding new territory also meant fighting the gang that was already working there. ""I was picked as a leader by my brothers because I knew how to do Taekwando,"" says Sungju. ""They thought I was really good at fighting, but it was different from street fighting. I lost many times, but my brothers believed in me. Their trust made me stronger,"" he says. Although, as time went on, Sungju began to win his fights the boys in his gang were still only young teenagers. When they came up against older teens armed with weapons, the fights became more dangerous. In one such encounter, one of his gang members was hit on the head and died.  Then Sungju's closest friend was killed by a farm guard for trying to steal a potato. Sungju was devastated. After more than three years fighting on the streets, the gang began to drift apart and Sungju turned to opium for solace. With few options left open to them, the boys decided to return to Gyeong-seong. It was there that Sungju was approached by an elderly man, whom he recognised as his grandfather. After Sungju's family had left Pyongyang, his grandparents had never given up searching for them and had eventually moved to a farm a few hours' walk from Gyeong-seong. Every Sunday the old man would travel into the town in the hope of finding his grandson. Now rescued from the streets, Sungju spent a few happy months living on his grandparents' farm. Once a week he walked to the market, carrying with him a backpack of food to share with his gang members, who had now found jobs helping the merchants. Then a stranger arrived with an important message. ""The messenger passed me a letter that said: 'Son, I'm living in China. Come to China to visit me,'"" Sungju says. The stranger was a broker - a person who helped North Koreans escape from the country. He had arrived to smuggle Sungju over the border. ""I had two emotions in my heart,"" says Sungju. ""The first one was anger, I just wanted to punch my father. And the second emotion was that I missed him so much. I told my grandparents that I wanted to go to China to see my father and to punch him and then to come back,"" he says. With the broker's help, Sungju crossed into China by foot and then, after he was given fake documents, he boarded a plane to South Korea. It was here that he was finally reunited with his father. ""My father hugged me and we cried together,"" he says. ""I had tons of questions, but I just said, 'I've missed you dad.' He said, 'Where is your mother?' and I cried again because I didn't know."" Despite years of searching, Sungju and his father still do not know where his mother is. In 2009, a broker told them about a woman living in China who was similar to her in appearance and background. It turned out not to be Sungju's mother, but his father helped her leave China anyway. Sungju has also lost touch with the other boys in his gang, despite paying brokers to find them. He suspects they have been drafted into the North Korean army. For a while, Sungju struggled with his identity in South Korea. When he first arrived he felt isolated. His accent marked him out as someone from the North, and  many South Koreans believe North Koreans are brainwashed, he says. ""South Koreans keep saying that North Koreans are their brothers and sisters, but many times they treated me as a foreigner. Sometimes worse than that,"" he says. He also struggled with the concept of freedom, saying he was told constantly that he now had it, but he wasn't sure what it meant. It was only when he was standing in a shop deciding what brand of pen to buy that he understood. ""I tried every pen, it took two hours,"" he said. ""I suddenly thought that this must be freedom, because I can choose a pen that I like."" Sungju says he came to terms with his new life by defining himself as someone from the Korean peninsula. Since then, he has decided to devote his life to the reunification of both Koreas, which he believes could happen within a generation. ""Those born after the 1990s don't have any respect for the government,"" he says. ""They only care about their private lives."" He believes that the markets where he once stole food are where change will begin, as North Koreans will realise they can make money from buying and selling goods without government control. ""In time, these people will become the core power of North Korea. The country will not collapse but one day the government will evolve, based on the market,"" he says. Sungju's studies have taken him out of South Korea to the US and the UK. He now hopes to complete a PhD on Korean reunification. Initially he was reluctant to speak out about his own painful journey from privilege to poverty, and finally escape. But over time he came to realise that by telling his story he could overcome his own personal trauma and give others insight into the struggles that many North Korean children face. He has now turned his story into a book for young adults, Every Falling Star, which was released in September. ""I have had so much encouragement and thanks from my readers,"" he says. His dearest dream is to one day return to the North Korea of his childhood. To see the Ferris wheels and parks of Pyongyang, but also to find the friends who helped him through the darkest time of his life. ""I dream of my brothers,"" he says. ""Sometimes we're swimming in a river and catching fish, laughing and wrestling together. ""Going home means seeing the people I love.""

My teenage self,"One in four young people ""doesn't feel in control"" of their lives, according to a new study carried out by The Prince's Trust charity. It heard from more than 2,200 16 to 25-year-olds across the UKin an online surveyand found worries about finding jobs, housing and mental health problems. So Newsbeat's asked three people who have been helped by the charity to give advice to their younger selves. This is what they said. Alice left school at 16. She enrolled on a fashion design course, but after dropping out she spent the next three years struggling to find a job and suffered from anxiety and depression. The Prince's Trust helped her to find work in the NHS and she's now training to be a nurse. ""You leave school with nothing, no idea of what to do,"" she says. ""I chose something I really wasn't that interested in, purely because there was so much pressure to stay in education and get a degree. ""Then I was in and out of jobs. I had no motivation at all, I was low and didn't feel good about myself. ""When all your friends are going off to university or in really good jobs and you're just looking at yourself and thinking... It breaks you"". ""Nursing's always been something that I've thought about, but never thought that I could do."" She says training has made her feel more confident to apply for her current job. ""I wasn't getting paid for it, and I think [because of that] I learned about who I was as a person. ""Offering voluntary experience to young people would be beneficial, because it's quite scary when you're applying to [a job]."" ""Being a nurse, you're working with the general public every day [so] life experience is really important,"" she says. ""I feel a lot more confident about my future."" Daniel abused drugs for five years and struggled with self-confidence. Now he's founded the brand Milk For Tea, to help young men talk about their problems. ""For so much of my life I hated myself,"" he says. ""I hated the way I looked, I hated the way I talked, I hated pretty much everything about myself and the drugs were a way of escape for me. ""It wasn't just the physical feelings of the high. It was also the emotional connection I felt with [drugs]. ""It was really challenging for me to get off them."" ""The advice I would give myself is to remain hopeful. As soon as you lose hope, it's hard to move forward,"" he says. ""I would also tell myself to relax, you don't have to know everything all at once. ""Take your time and find who you are because once you do everything changes."" After leaving school at 16, Paul was in and out of jobs and ended up having to use food banks to help him survive. Now he's re-trained and is working at a college. ""I grew up in a small industrial town and sometimes that mentality sticks, that small-town syndrome,"" he says. ""I'd been told that it was pretty much university or nothing. ""After completing my GCSEs I went on to a new apprenticeship scheme for engineers. It wasn't for me - I just kind of did it because it was something I was decent at at school. ""I didn't imagine that I could ever re-skill or do anything differently."" ""The advice that I'd give my younger self would be to just keep strong. Try not to listen to other people's view of the world. ""I just had to stop listening to all these ideas, that 'young people aren't good enough to do this or that.'""

Barack's Brack,"A newly discovered flatworm is named for Mr Obama As Barack Obama closes out his final days as US president, local governments are naming the usual libraries, motorways and schools in his honour. The Barack Obama Presidential Center library is being erected in Chicago and students across the country are already enrolled in schools named after the nation's first African-American president. But as well as the ceremonial plaques, sculptures, and buildings there are a few other things bearing Mr Obama's name that you may not have expected. Holotype of Baracktrema obamai, named after President Barack Obama Baracktrema obamaiis the second parasite whose moniker was inspired by Mr Obama. The flatworm species, which has a long, thread-like body, infects Malaysian freshwater turtles and can be fatal. ""This is clearly something, in my small way, done to honour our president,"" said Dr Thomas R Platt, an expert on turtle parasites who discovered the species. He also said he was a distant relative of Mr Obama. Researchers have previously named a hairworm, theParagordius obamai, found in Kenya, after Mr Obama. The worm was discovered near where Mr Obama's father lived. The fish is found inside the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument As part of a tribute to Mr Obama's marine conservation efforts in the Pacific, scientists named a maroon and gold fish found off Kure Atoll at the PapahÄnaumokuÄkea Marine National Monument off Hawaii. In 2012, researchers named a vibrant blue and orange freshwater darter, Etheostoma Obama, after Mr Obama. The fish is found in the Duck and Buffalo Rivers of the Tennessee River drainage. The Obamadon, an extinct, foot-long lizard with straight teeth, was named for the president due to his smile. Mr Obama is among the US presidents to have the distinction of a mountain named in his honour - but in Antigua. The island nation renamed Boggy Peak, its highest mountain, for Mr Obama on his birthday in 2009. Researchers named Caloplaca obamae in honour of Mr Obama's support for science education In 2007, researchers named the fungus,Caloplaca obamae, after Mr Obama at the close of his first presidential campaign. Scientists made the distinction in honour of Mr Obama's support for science education. The County Offaly village of Moneygall was the birthplace of Barack Obama's great-great-great-grandfather AnIrish countryside service station,externallocated in County Offaly, between Dublin and Limerick, was officially named for the US president. The Barack Obama Plaza includes a petrol station, food court and visitor centre that provides information on Mr Obama's connections to Moneygall. Obama in Ireland: Villagers ready to greet US president In 2011 Irish bakers made Brack bread in the president's honour Ahead of Mr Obama's visit to Ireland in 2011, bakers rushed to create Irish ""Brack"" bread - something Americans might refer to as a fruit loaf. Moneygall resident Joseph Kearney delivered fresh orders to Mr Obama's ancestral Irish family members preparing for ""O'Bama's"" visit. No word on if Mr Obama sampled one of the Irish treats A Western Striolated puffbird, known asNystalus obamai, is also named in honour of the president. The bird is found in western Amazonia. A Kenyan village names two schools after Mr Obama A Kenyan school in the village of Kogelo, where Mr Obama's father was born and buried, bears the name of Mr Obama. The Senator Obama Kogelo Primary School and Senator Obama Kogelo Secondary School were named in his honour while he was an Illinois politician. 'New era' for Obama's Kenyan home,external Aptostichus barackobamai is one of 33 trapdoor spider species discovered in 2013 A trapdoor spider,Aptostichus barackobamai, was also named for Mr Obama, a known Spider-Man fan.

First Nokia Android phone spurns the West2:36Clothes-folding robot readies for launch2:04The drone that takes flying selfiesSearching for the sounds of CES,"The Nokia 6 is the first Android smartphone to bear the brand under a deal with HMD Global The first in a series of Nokia-branded Android phones is to be released exclusively in China. The devicewill be marketed in partnership,externalwith the local internet retail giant JD.com. The team behind the Nokia 6 phone said the handset's ""premium design"" would appeal to the local market. The announcement coincided with the final day of the CES tech show in Las Vegas, where other new mobile phones and gadgets have been launched. Nokia no longer manufactures phones that carry its name but has instead licensed its brand to another Finnish company, HMD Global. Until now, the only phones that had been released under the deal had been more basic ""feature phone"" models. HMD Global may wait to unveil details of Android smartphones for other markets until next month in Barcelona The Android device had been highly anticipated and marks Nokia's return to the smartphone market after a series of Windows Phone models. Nokia also briefly sold Android-based handsets - known as Nokia X - in 2014. Microsoft used Nokia's brand for a short time after buying the company's mobile devices the same year, but later referred to the devices solely by their Lumia name. Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system. HMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017. It is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February. ""The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,""the firm said in a statement,external. ""With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers."" HMD Gobal sells feature phones, including the Nokia 150, in other parts of the world The Nokia 6 phone runs Android 7.0 - the latest version, also known as Nougat - and features: a 5.5in 1080p ""full high definition"" screen a 16 megapixel rear camera four gigabyte of RAM memory and 64GB of storage two amplifiers supported by Dolby Atmos audio processing, which HMD says creates audio that ""seems to flow all around users"" The specifications are mid-range, and so is the price: 1,699 yuan ($245; Â£200). That makes it slightly more expensive than Huawei's Honor 6X but cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi 5s. ""Nokia remains one of the most recognised mobile phone brands on the planet,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight technology consultancy. ""HMD Global will be hoping it can capitalise on this as it seeks to relaunch Nokia devices in 2017. ""It will be hoping the brand will help it stand out in the incredibly crowded Android smartphone market, which is characterised by cut-throat competition and a sea of design sameness. "" Brandon Ackroyd, Head of Customer Insight atTiger Mobiles,externalbelieves that Nokia will launch the Nokia 6 globally if the device has a successful launch in Asia. ""If the Nokia 6 performs well in China then it's highly likely we will see a new international variant of the handset sometime in 2017. We'll be keeping our eyes on the certification websites in the coming months looking for a variant with more connectivity options like GSM, LTE, and CDMA that will make the device compatible with networks worldwide.""

Muesli queen,"Carolyn struggled in her first years of business When an 18-year-old Carolyn Creswell was told she might lose her job, she decided to take a leap of faith. While at university in Melbourne, Australia, she supported herself by working part-time for a little company that made muesli for a handful of cafes and shops. This was in 1992, and the husband and wife who owned the business said they were putting it up for sale. They warned Carolyn that this would probably mean she would be out of work. Wanting to save a job she enjoyed, Carolyn decided to try to buy the business. Pooling her savings with those of her friend and co-worker Manya van Aker, their offer of the princely sum of 1,000 Australian dollars ($735; Â£590) was accepted. They dubbed the new incarnation Carman's, combining the first three letters of their names. Despite their youthful enthusiasm, increased sales were hard to come by, and Manya left the business two years later. Carolyn, however, persevered on her own, and in 1997 the company got its big break when Australia's second largest supermarket chain, Coles, started to stock its muesli. Supermarket group Coles gave Carman's its big break in 1997 Today Carman's Fine Foods is worth 83m Australian dollars ($60m; Â£50m), while Carolyn is dubbed the ""muesli queen"" by the Australian media. The company's breakfast cereals and other products are stocked by more than 3,000 outlets across the country, and exported to 32 other nations. ""I wasn't afraid of hard work,"" says Carolyn, now 42. ""[But] the first few years were really hard. If I could have given it away I would have."" For the first three years of the business Carolyn continued with her arts degree at Melbourne's Monash University. She would make deliveries early in the morning before lectures, and then do the business's bookkeeping in the college library over lunch. After she graduated Carman's still wasn't making enough money for it to be Carolyn's only source of income, so she also held a number of part-time jobs, including working behind the till at a supermarket. Carolyn bought out her co-founder two years into the business She was so hard up at times that she had to ask her brother to siphon petrol from their mother's car. ""I was really broke,"" says Carolyn. ""I remember I couldn't see my way out of it."" However, sales to independent stores and cafes starting to rise thanks to word of mouth. With no money for advertising, Carolyn's mum helped with an unusual marketing initiative - she'd stand in shops and loudly tell people how good her daughter's muesli was. Then after five years the company's fortunes were transformed when it started being stocked by Coles. At the time Carolyn still didn't have any formal staff, instead relying on help from her husband Pete. Today the company has 25 employees at its Melbourne head office, and another 160 people at its manufacturing facilities. In addition to six types of muesli it now makes other granolas, plus breakfast and snack bars. Although Carolyn says she will never regret her decision to set up Carman's, she says she had to miss out on many of the fun experiences that come with being young. For example, she never partied or travelled the way her friends were able to. And she wonders whether her age might have hindered early success. ""It might have happened a bit quicker if I was a little bit more mature,"" she says. Carolyn balances running the company with helping to look after her four children Carolyn also says she faced challenges as a young woman running a business that are - thankfully - less common than they are today. She says being a 20-something female meant she struggled to convince banks to lend her money. Much more distressingly, she says she occasionally faced sexual harassment from suppliers and other men who wouldn't take her seriously. ""Now I'd be like, 'you've got to be joking, that is so inappropriate.' [But] I think 20 years ago I was a bit nervous to stand up and go, 'hey that is not cool,'"" she says. While Carman's has continued to grow strongly following the first Coles contract, it has not all been plain sailing. For a brief period eight years ago Carman's lost another supermarket deal because of a temporary dip in sales. Carolyn says she was able to win back the contract, and that the episode was one of the biggest learning experiences of her career. ""I wouldn't be living with the healthy paranoia I have now,"" she says. ""That is never going to happen to me again."" The business has expanded beyond muesli Nathan Cloutman, a senior food industry analyst at research group Ibis World, says Carman's is able to charge premium prices for its products. ""Consumers see Carman's as promoting that healthy, rustic lifestyle that people are moving towards,"" he says. Mr Cloutman says the two main challenges for the company in the future are to cope with the big cereal producers increasingly trying to copy what it is doing, and for it to expand without sacrificing its local, homemade feel. With Carman's now entering the giant Chinese market, Carolyn says she continues to set three-year goals for the business, while regularly testing and measuring her chances of success.

The iPhone launch - a moment in history,"Not the greatest shot - but a landmark moment Ten years ago I was running from San Franciscoâs Moscone Centre to a nearby hotel to edit a piece for the Ten OâClock News when my phone rang. Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. âHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?â shouted a producer in London. âIf not, why not?â This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled,externalthe iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Appleâs marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten OâClock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were âa fragment of the true crossâ, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if weâd had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. We have become accustomed to having a quality camera a hand's reach away One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. Itâs not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldnât be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch -expressed at the time in a blog- I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.

Tech's bad bromance,"This video can not be played ""There's a dominant face of a programmer - young, male, they've gone to a top school"" Silicon Valley is so male-dominated that there's a name for the young, brash men who populate the region's many start-ups and high-tech firms: ""brogrammers"". Brogrammers are not your standard, introverted computer programmers. They are a more recent stereotype: the macho, beer swilling players who went to top schools and are often hired by their friends or former fraternity brothers in the technology industry. ""If there's a group of a hundred candidates and they're from multiple different backgrounds, different races, different genders, we noticed across the board there was a certain type of programmer that would still move forward in interviews,"" says Iba Masood, the 27-year-old chief executive and co-founder of Tara.ai, an artificial intelligence project manager that aims to change the world by combating bias. ""The brogrammer,"" says Ms Masood when asked what type of candidate she is referring to. ""It's a type that's known in the Valley."" Syed Ahmed and Iba Masood created Tara so job candidates can be assessed without bias Ms Masood's company created Tara, which stands for Talent Acquisition and Recruiting Automation. Tara analyses and ranks programmers' code, removing biographical information such as age, race, gender or where you have worked in the past or where you went to university. The algorithm means that people are judged on the work they have produced rather than who they are or who they know. ""We're very passionate about creating a meritocracy,"" says Ms Masood, who along with her co-founder Syed Ahmed, were born and raised in the United Arab Emirates. They wanted to create opportunities for people like themselves: smart and entrepreneurial, but not graduates of brand-name schools. Tara is a project manager that recruits and manages the best programmers for a variety of projects for businesses, from building simple websites to creating advanced applications. To create Tara the two used publicly available code and graded programmers on a 1-10 scale. None of the programmers are a perfect 10 and Tara doesn't tell a candidate their rank, though it does set a minimum standard for recommending work. Their highest-ranking member is a nine - he's a young, US-based programmer who never went to university. The people creating Tara hope it will help those who find it tough to break into the tech industry Mr Ahmed, 28, is the chief technology officer behind Tara. He says the system is much more than a recruiter - it is capable of finding the best people for the job and carrying out the entire recruitment process. He says Tara will increasingly offer opportunities for people working in the freelance economy, and will create more opportunities for women and minorities who have historically had a tough time breaking in to cutting edge start-ups and staying in the tech industry. In the US, women held just 25% of professional computing occupations in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And more than 90% of those women were white. Just 5% were Asian, 3% African American and 1% Hispanic. Women in computing fields in the US have declined since a peak of 36% in 1991.A 2016 report,externalfrom the National Center for Women in Information Technology says that women quit the tech industry in numbers more than double their male counterparts. ""Evidence suggests that workplace conditions, a lack of access to key creative roles, and a sense of feeling stalled in one's career are some of the most significant factors contributing to female attrition from the tech field,"" the report says. Shaherose Charania believes a more diverse workforce will help companies avoid making cultural mistakes that cause offence to customers Shaherose Charania, a board member and also the co-founder of Women 2.0, which advocates for women in technology, says that companies lacking diversity are more prone to make mistakes that offend their users. ""There are so many mistakes that companies like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter have made to exclude some of their most engaged user groups,"" Ms Charania says, referring to Facebook's ""poke"" which annoyed many women and more recently Snapchat's Bob Marley filter, which was criticised as promoting a racist digital version of blackface. While ""bro culture"" might be blamed for failing to retain the few women who do work in tech fields, the reality is there aren't many trained female computer scientists to recruit in the first place. Although women earn 57% of all undergraduate university degrees in the US, they account for just 18% of computer science degrees. Using artificial intelligence may level the playing field when it comes to hiring on merit but it won't solve the recruiting ""pipeline problem"" of having too few women applicants. Ms Charania says bias in hiring is typically not conscious, but a result of people hiring people they feel comfortable with, often from similar backgrounds and universities. If there are no women candidates or just one token female, their likelihood of getting the job is very slim. Whether or not AI changes ""bro culture"" remains to be seen. Some of those ""bros"" are likely to be very talented programmers. But until more women study computer science, gender parity in technology will remain science fiction. But Ms Masood predicts more and more women will enter the field in the future. ""I believe the next 20 to 30 years is going to be transformative for women,"" says Ms Masood. ""There's going to be people from multiple different backgrounds, races, perspectives coming into the field of programming. And I think that's why Tara is so important in this field in particular.""

"One man, 200 refugees","Danby CEO Jim Estill put up $1.5m of his own money to bring 58 Syrian families to Canada One Canadian businessman decided he could do more for desperate Syrians fleeing their war-torn country. So he bankrolled an Ontario town's resettlement of over 200 refugees. Jim Estill was growing frustrated. Over the summer of 2015, the business executive from the southwestern Ontario town of Guelph watched the Syrian refugee crisis unfold a half a world away, night after night on the evening news. ""I didn't think people were doing enough things fast enough,"" he says. So Estill, chief executive of home appliance company Danby, devised a plan. He would put up CA$1.5m (US$1.1m/Â£910,000) of his own money to bring over 50 refugee families to Canada, and co-ordinate a community-wide effort to help settle them into their new life. Newly-arrived Syrian refugee saves Canadian bride's wedding day The unique programme that brings refugees to Canada It would be a volunteer-driven project, but organised like a business. Volunteer directors led multiple teams, each in charge of a different aspect of settling newcomers. Canada allows private citizens, along with authorised sponsorship groups, to directly sponsor refugees by providing newcomers with basic material needs like food, clothing, housing, and support integrating into Canadian society. But Estill was looking to make a big impact, quickly. ""I know how to scale things,"" says Estill, who made his fortune as an entrepreneur, and previously worked as a director at Research in Motion, best known for producing the BlackBerry mobile phone. Jelil Alou, a Syrian refugee sponsored by the Canadian government, stands with Muhamad Abdo and Ibrahim Halil Dudu, who were sponsored by Jim Estill and the Muslim Society of Guelph Estill would be the money man, but he needed partners. So he brought together 10 different faith-based organisations that were already looking at ways to help those affected by the Syrian civil war. Sara Sayyed remembers the night her husband, president of the Muslim Society of Guelph, came back from that meeting and told her about Estill's plan. ""I was completely floored. I said: 'Let's get involved in this.'"" In November 2015, the local Guelph paper published an article about the plan. It was translated into Arabic and spread around the Middle East. ""People started emailing us directly from Turkey, from Lebanon, from within Syria, saying: 'Can you help us? Can you do something?'"" says Sayyed. Ibrahim Halil Dudu, who was sponsored by Jim Estill and the Muslim Society of Guelph, made international headlines when his skills as a tailor were called on to save a bride's wedding day As Estill recalls it: ""At first you get one email. You get one or two and say: 'Let's see what I can do.' Then it turns into a hundred. And then it's very difficult."" Sayyed's dining room table disappeared under a pile of sponsorship applications. Fifty-eight families were eventually selected. But that was just the first challenge. The sponsored families arrived at a trickle. Long delays in government processing came at a cost. Hard to find housing sat vacant. Donations languished in warehouses. ""I was completely taken by surprise it would take so long for the Canadian government to let people in,"" says Estill. ""That cost us a lot."" By December 2016, 47 of 58 families had arrived in Guelph. But Estill realised that many newcomers were having difficulty finding work because they lacked experience or English language skills. So he launched a program that provides Syrian refugees with jobs at Danby, along with regular English lessons. He has also assisted others in establishing their own business. This video can not be played Daad reflects on her previous life in a Syrian war zone ""I don't want to bring people in and put them on welfare,"" he says, adding if that happens, ""I've failed."" Sayyed says that Estill does not come across as a typical big business executive. ""You think: CEO of a company, this image based on what you see on TV and stuff right? And he is the most down to earth guy dressed in regular jeans and a shirt driving a really old car, nothing fancy or flashy about him,"" she says. She sees no reason other business people cannot copy his effort. ""The biggest thing is just to have that financial backing. If more people from our business communities just stepped forward and said: 'We'll do this,' it can be done."" Jaya James (left) with Gaziye Fettah and Rojin Haci, who were sponsored by Jim Estill and the Muslim Society of Guelph Jaya James, who worked worked closely with Sayyed and Estill, took a six-month leave from her job as a civil servant to work as a full-time volunteer director of the Guelph Refugee Sponsorship Forum. Estill contributed the big vision and the contacts, she says, while she and Sayyed took care of the details. They screened, trained and mentored 800 volunteers, co-ordinated the organisations involved in the effort, and tackled emergencies, including fielding late night calls about bug-infested donated furniture. James says Estill, who she describes as ""a little bristly"" but ""with a really big heart"", has challenged people to ask: ""What can I give? What can I do?"" Estill says he reads and replies to all the emails he receives from people seeking to come to Canada and is looking to sponsor more, though the focus will be on bringing in relatives of the newcomers who have already arrived. Still, the businessman remains perplexed by the praise the effort has gotten worldwide. Estill says he simply had the means to help and a vision of how to implement the plan. And he says his parents, who sponsored two Ugandan refugees when he was a child, instilled humanitarian values in him. ""I guess I was raised right. That's what I tell my mom,"" he says with a laugh.

Dean is one of the best refs - Halsey,"Mike Dean has been a Premier League referee for 16 years Mike Dean remains one of the Premier League's best referees despite an ""indifferent"" festive period, says former official Mark Halsey. Dean has received criticism for some of his recent performances and the number of red cards he has shown - five in 15 matches this season. Ex-Premier League referee Halsey thinks Dean can come across as ""arrogant"". He also believes only a handful of referees are ""trusted"" for the league's most important games. Dean, who has been a Premier League referee for 16 years, controversially sent off West Ham's Sofiane Feghouli during the Hammers' defeat by Manchester United on 2 January, while the red card was laterrescindedby the Football Association. That dismissal was the official's 26th since the start of the 2013-14 season - the highest number by any current Premier League referee in that period. ""If you look back over the December period, he has had an indifferent period,"" Halsey, 55, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""I have disagreed with some of his decision-making, especially the sendings-off. ""It is not an easy job to do. He is one of the most experienced and is a very good referee - one of the best of the bunch we have got. ""He does come across as a little bit arrogant. I would like to see that taken out of his game and perhaps he would get a lot more respect from the paying public and the media. ""But that is not the way he is off the pitch - if truth be told, the players like him."" Listen to more from Halsey on BBC Radio 5 live Halsey, who retired in 2013, says the standard of officiating has ""got steadily worse"" since Keith Hackett retired as general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) in 2010. ""Mark Clattenburg is by far our best referee, then there is Martin Atkinson, Michael Oliver, Andre Marriner, Anthony Taylor and Mike Dean. The top games, the big derbies, can only be refereed by four or five referees. The PGMOL do not trust the others to take control of those games,"" he said. Halsey also criticised the new way referees are assessed. There is now an ""evaluation system"" that can take up to 10 days to issue feedback rather than an assessor at the ground.

Trash trouble,"Youth for Parivarthan has more than 1,200 volunteers The southern Indian city of Bangalore was long known as the garden city, famed for its lush public parks and gardens, trees and hedges. But four years ago, it was renamed the garbage city, after it began drowning under mounds of rubbish. Some concerned citizens, however, are working to clean up the city, writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey from Bangalore. On a Sunday morning, about two dozen young men and women arrive outside the Aishwarya Agate apartment complex in the JP Nagar district, armed with paint, buckets, brushes and rollers. For the next few hours, these volunteers from the non-governmental organisation Youth for Parivarthan (Youth for Change) get busy, trying to beautify the wall across the compound. Ugly fading pamphlets are peeled off, the grey wall is hosed clean with a jet of water, a coat of terracotta paint is applied, patterns are drawn with chalk and then painted over with fine brush-strokes. Geeta Pandey recently spent 10 days working on a series of stories in Bangalore. This is her seventh and final report. You can find the other reports here: Why is Bangalore stuck in traffic jams? Women from Mars? The restaurant that has a city eating out of its hands The man who looks after 735 dogs The 98-year-old freedom fighter still battling for his idea of India The man behind India's '$74m wedding' The volunteers include lawyers, engineers, accountants, students and even an actor. This is their 94th project, says Amith Amarnath, the group's founder and president. ""We did our first project in June 2014. There was a small children's park near my home, filled with garbage. It would stink all the time, everyone was complaining about it,"" he told the BBC. ""So one day, I thought we should stop complaining and start acting."" Mr Amarnath and a few of his friends went and cleaned up the place. Then they painted the park walls and installed benches to dissuade people from throwing rubbish there again. The volunteers begin by scraping off ugly fading pamphlets Bright paint is used to lend cheer to the surroundings Bangalore is often described as the Silicon Valley of India. The city has witnessed rapid growth in the past two decades. But along with that prosperity have come problems like traffic snarls and thousands of tonnes of daily garbage. The city of 11.5 million people daily generates 8,000 tonnes of rubbish which is collected and transported to landfills outside the city, says Bharath M Palavalli of Fields of View, a non-profit which has been working to create awareness about Bangalore's garbage problems. By law, this garbage should be segregated at source between wet food waste and dry recyclable waste like plastics and paper. Youth for Parivarthan's first project was a small children's park The volunteers cleaned up the park, painted its walls and installed benches to dissuade people from throwing rubbish there ""Ideally what happens in Vegas should remain in Vegas,"" says market researcher and civic evangelist V Ravichandar. ""Garbage should be sorted and dealt with in the neighbourhood and only 15% should go to landfills."" But civic authorities have long followed the policy of collecting and transporting all the city's garbage to nearby villages instead. The flaws of the policy became glaringly obvious in 2012 when garbage collectors went on a strike over a pay dispute with the civic authorities and the city began to drown in rubbish. Debris is removed from the location Volunteers apply a coat of terracotta paint Mr Ravichandar describes what happened next as ""a perfect storm"". ""At the same time, one landfill was closed by the pollution control board for being environmentally hazardous, and another was shut down because local farmers protested. ""For two weeks, untreated waste was being dumped on the city streets daily. It had been drizzling for days and there were things putrefying,"" says Mr Ravichandar. But that became the turning point for the city when it came to garbage management. Most of the volunteers are students or working professionals They work a few hours on each Sunday to beautify their city With more awareness, residents in many areas have now begun to segregate their garbage and dry waste collection centres have come up in several neighbourhoods. ""In areas where people are more aware and the residents' associations are strong, rubbish is getting picked up regularly and things have visibly improved,"" Mr Ravichandar says. But many ""black spots"" remain in the city - and that's where groups like Youth for Parivarthan come in. The wall across from the Aishwarya Agate apartment that the volunteers are beautifying today used to be a garbage dump until a few days ago. Patterns are drawn with chalk on the wall and then painted over with fine brush-strokes Resident Purushottam Joshi says he is very happy that these young men and women have done this wonderful work here For the past 14 years, resident Purushottam Joshi says every time he stepped out of the gates, he would be greeted by the stench of rotting garbage. ""We petitioned the local legislator, our MP, the district collector, even the police, but nothing happened. Now I'm very happy that these young men and women have done this wonderful work here,"" he says. Home-maker Lavanya Shankar says she's ""extremely happy"" to see the ""extremely clean"" wall. ""This is the street where we live, where our children play, and it's wonderful to see this change,"" she says. Mr Amarnath says their reward is the appreciation they receive from the public. The volunteers get down to beautifying the drab wall They pose for a photograph in front of the finished wall ""Initially we would spot places to fix, but now people write to us on social media, seeking our help. Earlier, people thought we were just jobless youth, with nothing to do. But ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched his Swachch Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign), public support has been growing for us."" As the volunteers pose for a photograph in front of the finished wall, they say they know that their efforts are like ""a drop in the ocean"". But, as Mr Amarnath says, ""every drop must count"". ""If we want to see the change, we have to be more involved and aware. If we sit at home and think the government would do everything, then nothing would get done.""

Hope for a fresh settlement in Cyprus,"Nicosia airport was abandoned in 1974 There is small corner of Europe where time has stood still since 1974. Whole neighbourhoods lie deserted. Houses crumble gently into empty streets. Cars that were once new and shiny sit enshrouded in dust in garages. Debris litters the runway of a former international airport, the solitary abandoned passenger jet a ghostly reminder of the tourists who used to arrive here daily. Welcome to the ""buffer zone"" in Cyprus. More than 40 years ago, this thin strip of land more than 100 miles (160km) long was hastily established after a coup inspired by Greece failed and Turkish forces invaded. Since then, UN peacekeepers have patrolled the empty streets and manned the distant watchtowers that separate the Greek Cypriot south from the Turkish Cypriot north in this former British colony. The buffer zone divides the Greek south of Cyprus from the Turkish north For more than 40 years, this is how Cyprus has remained - a divided island in the eastern Mediterranean where no plan to end the conflict has ever quite overcome the status quo. Until now, perhaps. For politicians and diplomats are yet again heading for Geneva hoping that a solution might be in sight. After visiting Athens and Ankara last week,the UK's foreign office minister, Sir Alan Duncan, tweeted,externalhe was ""hopeful"" that a settlement may be in reach. The aim is some kind of united but federal Cyprus where power is shared between the two communities. How this might work in practice has defeated all previous diplomatic efforts. Next week the two sides will meet for a fresh round of talks. If they make progress, then ministers from the three countries that currently guarantee Cyprus's security - Britain, Greece and Turkey - will join. The two British military bases on the island will be unaffected by the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson will represent the UK. New UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will be there. If a deal looks likely, then it is even possible that British Prime Minister Theresa May might attend, along with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Mrs May spoke to Mr Erdogan this weekend and they agreed that these talks were ""a real opportunity to secure a better future for Cyprus and to guarantee stability in the wider region"", according to the Mrs May's office. But - and it is a big but - we have been here before. Previous attempts at a deal have been defeated by the complexities of the island's politics and tensions between Greece and Turkey. So no-one is guaranteeing success next week. Cars from the 1970s are gathering dust in a show room in the buffer zone And yet there are signs that this time there could be some progress. Diplomats say that both the Greek Cypriot leader, Nicos Anastasiades, and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Mustafa Akinci, appear genuinely committed to achieving a deal. For both of them failure is an unattractive option. Turkey appears willing to see if progress can be made. Supporting northern Cyprus is expensive and President Erdogan has more room to manoeuvre than his predecessors. A lot of progress has been made already in talks that have been going on for 19 months. But the sticking points that remain are significant. How can the security of the Turkish Cypriots be guaranteed if Turkey's estimated 30,000 troops leave? Should some stay or should Turkey retain the right to intervene? If not, who or what could act as a guarantor - the UK? Or the EU, of which of course Cyprus is already a member? How much more territory should Greek Cypriots gain to reflect the fact that they make up the majority of the island's population? Where should the lines on the maps be drawn? What should happen to the properties that Greek Cypriots had to abandon in 1974? Should they get the right to take their old homes back or be compensated and if so by how much? How should the two sides share power? There is talk of a rotating presidency but how would that work and could a Turkish Cypriot president really represent the country from time to time at EU summits? And then there is the really hard question - what kind of a deal would be acceptable to the peoples of Cyprus? Any agreement hammered out in Geneva would not just have to be acceptable to both sides' negotiators and the governments of Greece and Turkey. It would also have to backed by the people in both north and south Cyprus in two referendums later this year. The last time there was a putative deal in 2004it was overwhelmingly rejected by Greek Cypriots,external. So there are hurdles ahead and no guarantees of success. But some diplomats are expectant. ""I don't imagine we could be in a better place,"" said one. ""But everything is very fluid and nothing will be easy."" Any potential deal faces many sticking points Even the chance of a deal is quickening pulses in UK government circles. Good news is scarce on the international stage at the moment, and a settlement in Cyprus would be a small beacon of hope. It would be reaffirmation that talking and co-operating can produce results at a time when many countries seem to prefer using force. It would allow Mrs May to show the world that - despite Brexit - Britain is still engaged in the world. And above all it would solve a problem that has bedevilled Greek-Turkish relations for so long and given headaches to both the EU and Nato That is the prize up for grabs over the negotiating tables in Geneva next week.

The iPhone launch - a moment in historyRory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent9 January 2017 (00:01:24),"Not the greatest shot - but a landmark moment Ten years ago I was running from San Franciscoâs Moscone Centre to a nearby hotel to edit a piece for the Ten OâClock News when my phone rang. Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. âHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?â shouted a producer in London. âIf not, why not?â This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled,externalthe iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Appleâs marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten OâClock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were âa fragment of the true crossâ, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if weâd had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. We have become accustomed to having a quality camera a hand's reach away One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. Itâs not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldnât be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch -expressed at the time in a blog- I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.

James Naughtie: What do the Trump tweets reveal?7 January 2017 (01:40:13),"It is as if the campaign is still going on. Two weeks away from his inauguration, Donald Trump seems to prefer the role of ""candidate"" -  flaying his opponents and aiming arrows at the federal government from the enemy camp. It is almost as if he does not want to accept fully that he is the new chief executive who will be dealing with official Washington from the moment he drives back from the Capitol as the president on 20 January. And his weapon of choice, forged for him like a legendary warrior's sword in the furnace of the new technology, is Twitter. No president-elect has battled like this. Most of them go to ground, secluded with the staff who will take over the West Wing, and make their plans. Dream their dreams, you might say. They have followed the golden rule: do not give too much away, because it will make life more difficult when the inauguration is over and the business of power begins. Trump Tweetwatch: 'I'm a big fan' of intelligence agencies Trump Tweetwatch: N Korea nuclear plans 'won't happen' The Trump Twitter account is not just a break with that pattern, but a challenge to the very idea. His New Year tweet (one of them, I should say) wished love to everyone ""including my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do"". Mr Trump wished love to everyone via Twitter at the turn of the year The implication, of course, is that he does know what he is going to do. The trouble with his Twitter account is that it makes you wonder. More than 34,000 tweets to nearly 19 million followers (many ""enemies"" among them, no doubt) and a narrative that has become a kind of stream of consciousness. They read like the unfiltered, disconnected thoughts of someone for whom patience is an ugly word. You always have to say something, even if you say the opposite the next day. On Twitter, who cares? Yet, the messages are powerful. One contemptuous tweet about the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives winding down the Office of Congressional Ethics led them tobeat a humiliating retreatand cancel the plan. Mr Trump's choice as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the other day: ""Whatever he tweets, he is going to drive the news."" And, bizarre though it may seem, the South Korean government is poring over them. The JoongAng Daily reported that a Twitter-watching position had been set up in the foreign ministry in Seoul ""because we don't yet have an insight into his foreign policies"". What insight will they get from tweets which have criticised the Central Intelligence Agency, praised Julian Assange - the Whistleblower of WikiLeaks and a bete noire to most Republicans - and praised President Putin, who gets more friendly treatment than all Democrats and some Republicans at home? And remarkably the tweets take aim at the entire intelligence community in Washington. What precisely are the South Koreans meant to make of that? Not too much, you may think, because who can tell how this mercurial candidate is going to be moulded into a president? We still do not know and what his Twitter account tells us - colourfully, astonishingly, sometimes hilariously - is that he is refusing to let us know. Far from revealing what a Trump presidency is going to be like - as he says his tweets do - they have the effect of enveloping him in a thick fog. Yes we know he will ""make America great again"", cut immigration, build his wall, cut taxes, be Israel's greatest ally and so on. But how he is going to build a White House team on foreign affairs and security, conduct relations with Capitol Hill, deal with allies in Nato and the rolling chaos in the Middle East, we have very little idea. And when the first crisis arrives - as it will before long - will he be able to find the calm that he needs? Where it all began: Trump's Twitter page in April 2009 No president-elect in modern times has said so much and revealed so little. We know how Mr Trump feels about almost everything, but about priorities, his approach to the compromises of power, the way he will deal with the bureaucracy - in practice we know very little. A week or two before election day in November, one of his close associates told me that, if he won, Mr Trump had agreed that in office he would relinquish control of that Twitter account, because it would be inappropriate in the White House. The satirists' loss, certainly. But, if it happens, a step into reality, at last. Some day he has to stop being the candidate and playing that game, even though he enjoys it so much. So the first great test for the Trump White House team is surely getting his finger off that keyboard. Trump Tweetwatch: N Korea nuclear plans 'won't happen' How might China respond to Trump tweets?
