Marmite-owner Unilever bids for GSK consumer arm,"Marmite is one of Unilever's many brands GlaxoSmithKline has rejected three Unilever offers to buy its consumer goods division, including one worth Â£50bn. GSK said the proposals ""fundamentally failed"" to reflect the value of the division. With a successful bid, Unilever - which owns Marmite, Dove and PG Tips - would add Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol to its list of household brands. Such a deal would be one of the biggest ever involving London-listed firms. GSK said in a statement the most recent proposal from Unilever on 20 December contained an offer for Â£41.7bn in cash and Â£8.3bn in Unilever shares. The global healthcare company, which has its headquarters in London, has already been preparing to separate its consumer goods division from its pharmaceutical business in the middle of this year. The firm hascome under pressurefrom investors for failing to develop a Covid vaccine. Unilever said in a statement the GSK consumer arm ""would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio"". The consumer goods giant,which became a fully British company in 2020after previously being separated between the UK and the Netherlands, also approached Pfizer about the potential deal, since the American pharmaceutical giant owns a 34% stake in GSK's consumer goods business. Neither GSK nor Pfizer has any ideological objection to selling to Unilever. GSK had planned to spin off its consumer business later this year anyway through a demerger creating a separate publicly listed company but always said it would have an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right. GSK's problem with the Unilever bid is that the price isn't right. Both Barclays and Goldman Sachs analysts have valued the business at around Â£50bn. However, that does not include a few important things. First, the premium you would normally expect to pay for taking control of a business - somewhere in the range of 30% - although that might be reduced by the debt of about Â£10bn GSK was expected to leave on the books of the consumer business. Second, the value of the cost savings GSK admits could be made to make the business more profitable. Third, it may not reflect the higher sales growth targets GSK boss Emma Walmsley has said are possible for the business. She has also said the benefit of a demerger is current GSK shareholders would get shares in the demerged business so retain their participation in any future growth in the consumer business. Some will say if higher growth and greater cost reductions are possible, why haven't they happened already? Emma Walmsley has been in charge for more than four years. That's one of the questions activist shareholder Elliot Management has implicitly asked by encouraging other shareholders to agitate for a more radical greater break up of one of the UK's most valuable companies. The BBC understands the very different ideas on what this business is worth means there are no active and ongoing discussions between GSK and Unilever. But Unilever's intentions are very clear. The ""for sale"" sign is now very visible and the elbows will get sharper as this basket of household consumer goods gets closer to the checkout. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Unilever's chief executive Alan Jope was under pressure because the business had recently missed targets for sales and profit margins. ""Unilever has strong cashflow, but the heat is on Mr Jope. He wants to be seen to do something,"" Mr Mould said. ""But this is a high risk deal. Many investors see GSK as underperforming. But at a time when inflation is rising, consumer goods with loyal customers represent a good way for firms to try to manage profits."" The move was first reported inthe Sunday Times.,external GSK said its consumer goods division had the potential to increase sales by up to 6% a year in the medium term, and Unilever's offers did not take that into account. It said the proposals were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders. Preliminary figures show sales for GSK's consumer division reached Â£9.6bn in 2021. Other brands in the division include Centrum vitamins, Aquafresh toothpaste and Nicorette gum. The company has said it is in late stage trails of a Covid vaccine it was developing with the French pharmaceutical firm, Sanofi.

a winner that isnât him or Roger Federer for the first time in eight years. Daniil Medvedev, winner of last yearâs US Open, is now said to
be the favourite. Federer is not attending while he recovers from
a knee injury. Djokovic has dominated the tournament in recent years, winning nine
titles, more than any other male player in the Australian Openâs history. Federer has won the Australian Open six times. The last time the men's tournament was won by a player other than
Djokovic and Federer was when Stan Wawrinka clinched the title in 2014, beating
Rafael Nadal. Nadal is now the only member of âthe big threeâ players to be at
this yearâs tournament. Djokovic has won the Australian Open title nine times Deportation from Australia usually comes with a three-year

According to Australian media, he could argue that hispresence at the Melbourne grand slam is in the national interest.,external âDjokovic can apply to the government to ask for the ban to
be waived on compelling and compassionate grounds,â Abul Rizvi, former deputy secretary

Before any of this week's craziness, Djokovic was already a divisive player. When the world men's number one faced Roger Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final, his misses were clapped and he was jeered in a partisan atmosphere more commonly found at football stadiums. ""You cannot make people love you and that's been the situation a little bit,"" his former coach Boris Becker had told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. ""He's a fine young sportsman with the right attitude and the right character, he just has a different view on life. He has a different view how he eats, how he drinks, how he sleeps. That's where you can't criticise him. Maybe that's the reason he's so successful, but he's not for everybody - I get it."" Read more on Djokovic and why he's such a polarising player. Australian journalist Paul Sakkal, who has covered Novak Djokovic's visa saga on the ground for Melbourne paper The Age, says it has caused ""anger"" and ""embarrassment"" and cast a shadow over the tennis tournament. Sakkal was speaking to the BBC's Sunday Morning from Melbourne. He says the ""visceral reaction"" to Djokovic's arrival in the country without a vaccine is partly down to the ""really large Covid wave"" which has driven 35,000 daily cases in Victoria where the Australian Open will be held. ""There was a sense that Djokovic, a wealthy entitled person [...] had somehow found a loophole to get into Australia through a back door,"" he says. ""I think that fed a lot of the anger and that anger hasn't really dissipated, even though he had his first legal challenge that was successful. ""I think the government made the political calculation that they were still on quite popular political grounds in deporting him and they made that decision on Friday and a court has upheld it today.""

Caruso, ranked 175th in the world, failed to qualify for Melbourne - but will now take Djokovic's place in a first-round match tomorrow night. Guy DelauneyBBC News, Belgrade Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic believes the tennis star's nationality influenced his treatment Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has told the BBC Novak Djokovic was âtortured and tormentedâ by the Australian government and âtreated like a mass murdererâ. He said the decision taken today could have been made 10 days ago, and that he has âno doubtâ Djokovic would have been treated ""totally differently"" if he wasnât from Serbia. Vucic said: ""He came to Australia with a medical exemption proposal and then you were mistreating him for 10 days. Why did you do it? Doing a witch hunt against him? This is something that no one can understand."" He added: ""I believe that Novak is not humiliated. The people who are humiliated are those who organised this witch hunt process."" Djokovic will be leaving Australia tonight at 2230 local time (1130 GMT), some Australian media are reporting. Both Sky News and Melbourne paper The Age say he will be flying out of the country on an Emirates flight to Dubai. The player arrived in the country on an Emirates flight last week, before he was then detained at Melbourne's airport.

"Family's shock at boy, 3, found wandering streets","Three-year-old Miles was found walking the streets during school time The parents of a three-year-old boy who wandered home from school alone are demanding answers from the authorities. Georgia Wilcox said her family were shocked when Miles turned up at their home in Trealaw, Rhondda Cynon Taf, during school time. A woman followed Miles, who is non-verbal, to make sure he got home after being spotted walking alone. Rhondda Cynon Taf council said a full investigation into the ""serious incident"" was under way. Ms Wilcox was at home with her partner and two-year-old son when the woman knocked on the door just before 11:00 GMT on Friday.

""He said 'you need to get on to the school' because a woman had found him on the hill. ""I went up to the school and the receptionist looked shocked."" Miles is too young to understand the dangers, says his mother Ms Wilcox said they had not been contacted by Trealaw Primary School, about a 10-minute walk away, to say Miles was missing. ""They were adamant they had been looking for Miles, but the school has refused to let us see the CCTV,"" she said. ""We are definitely under the impression they didn't know he was gone. ""The woman had found him on of the hills near our road, he would have been walking on his own."" Ms Wilcox said Miles had been been spotted ""running in and out of the road"" in footage found on neighbours' CCTV. She added: ""We feel really shaken up. We just want them to realise they should be held accountable. He must have wanted to go home but the gate shouldn't be open.

Kuenssberg: What's a PM to do when even kids joke about his future?,"The prime minister is fighting to stay in No 10 - and the next few days could prove decisive. MPs can't skulk, plotting, in Westminster's corridors at weekends. But for Boris Johnson, the time his colleagues spend back in their constituencies could prove even worse. One senior MP described how on Friday, during a standard school visit, he was asked by a group of nine-year-olds whether or not the prime minister was going to resign, and then was catcalled by teenage pupils about Boris Johnson's behaviour. As much as the prime minister's seemingly dwindling number of backers may wish this saga was merely a preoccupation of his many enemies or the press, the question of whether he stays or goes has become a national conversation. Boris Johnson is driven away from Parliament on Wednesday On Wednesday, presenters on cosy daytime TV sofas crossed live to the Commons for PMQs. Music radio presenters challenged each other to race to the Co-op on London's Strand to fill a carry-on case with a carry-out, after the latest claims about No 10 staff filling a suitcase with booze. One minister admits there is a ""lot of discontent"" among local party associations - which MPs will hear in person this weekend. And many report their email inboxes have been filling up with party members and constituents seething about what's been going on. The prime minister's future is now the subject of playground teasing. As the MP who had that awkward conversation with the nine-year-olds suggested, if many of his colleagues have similar experiences, ""Monday morning could be a very difficult moment"". Another senior MP, who has already been told by their local party chairman that the prime minister should quit, predicted that MPs will hear so much concern this weekend, ""it could all be over on Monday"". But hang on. There is nothing automatic about what happens next. The consensus among MPs right now seems to be at least to wait until the conclusions ofSue Gray's reportare made public. One cabinet minister who says ""there is no getting away from the situation - it is very bad"", also cautions: ""It is very hard to get rid of a leader who doesn't want to go."" The minister says Johnson will ""want to go on and on and on"" - whatever the findings of the report. Another senior cabinet minister believes that while MPs are angry, ""they are not at the stage when they want to get rid of him"". Importantly, too, the cabinet itself does not seem to be taking a collective view about what to do. The mood among ministers is that the situation is pretty desperate. But they don't seem to be trying to take concerted action together, either, to find a way out. For one member of the cabinet, that's in contrast with memories they have of regular discussions about how to manage the political horror during the worst days of Theresa May's premiership. This may be in part down to the fact we are now in very different political times. There aren't bonds between groups at the most influential table in the land in the same way - no Brexiteer band determined to get their way whatever the cost, and no group like the one that was determined to protect Mrs May. There is, however, an acceptance that Boris Johnson faces a moment of real peril and has to change. One says: ""A lot of people say he has three months to significantly raise his game."" The question of whether the prime minister himself believes he has to change, or can, is an argument for another day. The precise wording of the Sue Gray report will be vital in all of this. Will she criticise the overall culture in No 10, or point to individuals or blame the prime minister himself? Remember, the report is official and Sue Gray's reputation is fearsome, but that's not the same as being an outsider. She is a senior government employee, not an independent arbiter. That's not to suggest that she will pull any punches, but it would be quite something if she were to suggest that Boris Johnson himself had directly broken the rules. Whatever the specifics of her conclusions, the position will still be difficult. And some of the rising generation of ministers not yet in cabinet may take a harsher view than those already at the top table. Sources suggest there are conversations taking place among the lower ranks, those who see themselves as the future of the party, about the possibility of taking action. The idea has been mooted that some of them may go to the prime minister once the report is out and say that either he goes, or they do instead. This doesn't seem to be a concrete plan, but an apparent lack of organisation in cabinet doesn't mean that there's no threat from others on the payroll. Johnson's ministers may not all be prepared to tolerate many more weeks like this. It's on the backbenches where MPs are far more open about the action they may take. One former minister, not a usual troublemaker, predicted confidently there will be enough letters calling for a vote of no confidence to bring about a contest next month. Another, who backed Boris Johnson originally, told me they will call for him to resign when the Gray report is published and expect enough others will agree to trigger a fight for him to stay in the job. But it is one thing threatening all of this privately right now. It's another to follow through. Another backbencher told me they were pleading with colleagues to remember the turmoil that changing a leader creates, saying: ""We might not be that far from an election - I just wish everyone would remember that."" Another told the BBC ""I can see no scenario where he's the PM going into the next election"" but ""it's not the right time"" to act. The pandemic is still with us. There is growing pressure on family finances. Yet the levels of frustration with No 10 are sky-high, in part because the fiasco is seen as being entirely self-inflicted. The behaviour itself, behind closed doors, is almost unbelievable to many. The handling of it a product of what's often seen as Johnson's credo - never apologise, never explain - which means rather than confronting the claims at the start and coming clean, allegations have been left to fester and grow, resulting yesterday in the most extraordinary apology, even, to the Queen. It's not at all clear how No 10 believes they can get through this crisis. REALITY CHECK:What rules did Downing Street party break? PROFILE:Who is Sue Gray and what is she investigating? TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings Regular briefings to the press this week have been surreal and unproductive. I'm told the mood inside the building is terrible, one source telling me staff are unsure if colleagues are telling each other the truth. Some, it's said, are still holding on to the conviction that what happened can be explained away that the gatherings were ""events"" not parties, and that the technicalities of the rules may somehow see them through. The mood outside Downing Street is rather different, with disbelief that, as one cabinet minister suggested, ""Boris has persuaded himself he's the victim here"". There was ""consternation"" when the prime minister went to talk to MPs moments after his Commons apology and - as one of them described to me - told them ""he was bravely taking the blame for other people's mistakes"". The fate of Boris Johnson is certainly not yet sealed. The details of the Gray report matter. The bravado of MPs can melt away. The absence of an obvious, ready-to-go rival may protect him (although there are plenty who are lining up to have a go). The prime minister may be able to rediscover what one of his colleagues describes as ""his magic"". It could prove in time that this was simply an appalling bout of the mid-term blues. And those who know him well think the chance of Boris Johnson concluding it's best to step away are extremely slim. But with each new day of allegations and embarrassment it's more likely that the decision could be taken out of his hands.

"Marmite-owner Unilever bids for GSK consumer armGlaxo Smith Kline rejected three offers, saying they ""undervalued"" its consumer goods business.Business","Marmite is one of Unilever's many brands GlaxoSmithKline has rejected three Unilever offers to buy its consumer goods division, including one worth Â£50bn. GSK said the proposals ""fundamentally failed"" to reflect the value of the division. With a successful bid, Unilever - which owns Marmite, Dove and PG Tips - would add Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol to its list of household brands. Such a deal would be one of the biggest ever involving London-listed firms. GSK said in a statement the most recent proposal from Unilever on 20 December contained an offer for Â£41.7bn in cash and Â£8.3bn in Unilever shares. The global healthcare company, which has its headquarters in London, has already been preparing to separate its consumer goods division from its pharmaceutical business in the middle of this year. The firm hascome under pressurefrom investors for failing to develop a Covid vaccine. Unilever said in a statement the GSK consumer arm ""would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio"". The consumer goods giant,which became a fully British company in 2020after previously being separated between the UK and the Netherlands, also approached Pfizer about the potential deal, since the American pharmaceutical giant owns a 34% stake in GSK's consumer goods business. Neither GSK nor Pfizer has any ideological objection to selling to Unilever. GSK had planned to spin off its consumer business later this year anyway through a demerger creating a separate publicly listed company but always said it would have an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right. GSK's problem with the Unilever bid is that the price isn't right. Both Barclays and Goldman Sachs analysts have valued the business at around Â£50bn. However, that does not include a few important things. First, the premium you would normally expect to pay for taking control of a business - somewhere in the range of 30% - although that might be reduced by the debt of about Â£10bn GSK was expected to leave on the books of the consumer business. Second, the value of the cost savings GSK admits could be made to make the business more profitable. Third, it may not reflect the higher sales growth targets GSK boss Emma Walmsley has said are possible for the business. She has also said the benefit of a demerger is current GSK shareholders would get shares in the demerged business so retain their participation in any future growth in the consumer business. Some will say if higher growth and greater cost reductions are possible, why haven't they happened already? Emma Walmsley has been in charge for more than four years. That's one of the questions activist shareholder Elliot Management has implicitly asked by encouraging other shareholders to agitate for a more radical greater break up of one of the UK's most valuable companies. The BBC understands the very different ideas on what this business is worth means there are no active and ongoing discussions between GSK and Unilever. But Unilever's intentions are very clear. The ""for sale"" sign is now very visible and the elbows will get sharper as this basket of household consumer goods gets closer to the checkout. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Unilever's chief executive Alan Jope was under pressure because the business had recently missed targets for sales and profit margins. ""Unilever has strong cashflow, but the heat is on Mr Jope. He wants to be seen to do something,"" Mr Mould said. ""But this is a high risk deal. Many investors see GSK as underperforming. But at a time when inflation is rising, consumer goods with loyal customers represent a good way for firms to try to manage profits."" The move was first reported inthe Sunday Times.,external GSK said its consumer goods division had the potential to increase sales by up to 6% a year in the medium term, and Unilever's offers did not take that into account. It said the proposals were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders. Preliminary figures show sales for GSK's consumer division reached Â£9.6bn in 2021. Other brands in the division include Centrum vitamins, Aquafresh toothpaste and Nicorette gum. The company has said it is in late stage trails of a Covid vaccine it was developing with the French pharmaceutical firm, Sanofi.

"Ex-supermarket boss Lord Sainsbury dies aged 94The company's current chief executive described John Sainsbury as a ""shopkeeper to his core"".","Lord Sainsbury hosted a visit by the Queen to celebrate the supermarket's 150th anniversary The former chairman and chief executive of supermarket chain Sainsbury's, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, has died aged 94, the company has announced. During his 40-year career with the firm he covered several roles, becoming a director in 1958 before being promoted to lead the business in 1969. Lord Sainsbury retired from the company in 1992, becoming its life president. Sainsbury's current CEO Simon Roberts described him as ""one of the great retailers of his time"". He added he was ""a shopkeeper to his core"" and ""was ambitious for the company and led Sainsbury's through an unprecedented period of growth; he was a truly inspirational man"". Martin Scicluna, chairman of Sainsbury's, said he would be ""greatly missed"" by all his friends and colleagues. John Sainsbury photographed in 1973 as the company went on the London Stock Exchange John Davan Sainsbury started working in his family's business in 1950, after national service and university, initially taking on a role in the grocery department. His time at Sainsbury's saw the company grow from a regional, middle-sized grocery chain, to a national household name. Lord Sainsbury became biscuit buyer in 1951 and bacon buyer from 1956, according toThe Sainsbury's Archive.,external A visit to Canada inspired a new method of producing bacon for the new self-service market which he developed and piloted at the abattoir at Haverhill, the archive said. He was also heavily involved in the development of Sainsbury's own range of products, personally approving every packaging design, it said. Lord Sainsbury led the company through other significant changes, including conversion to scanning, the introduction of debit and credit cards, and energy management, it added. John Sainsbury, centre left, at a celebration of the company's centenary on 15 April 1969 In 1980 he was knighted by the Queen for services to the food retailing industry and with his brothers Simon and Timothy helped transform Sainsbury's. In 1991, former managing director Sir Roy Griffiths said no senior member of a family ever cherished the family traditions more closely than Lord Sainsbury. He added: ""No chairman has ever looked after the corporate values so committedly, and nothing has been too much, no generosity too great for people who serve the customer, and by definition the company well.""

Call to follow Sheen's lead to save charitiesMichael Sheen's donated suits raised cash at a time when charities face huge losses due to Covid.Wales,"Michael Sheen asked his parents, Irene and Meyrick, to donate his suits to a good cause Charities are urging people to follow Michael Sheen's lead and donate unwanted items following huge losses during the Covid lockdown. British Heart Foundation (BHF) Cymru said it lost about Â£50m in the first year of Covid due to shop closures. Other charities echoed this loss and urged people to make donations,like the suits from Michael Sheen's parents. Adam Fletcher, head of BHF Cymru, said Covid had been ""devastating"" for charities who rely on retail income. The BHF has 720 shops across the UK - 32 in Wales. All of them had to close when lockdowns hit during the pandemic. Charities lose Â£620m as Covid demand increases Sheen becomes 'not for profit' actor Charity shops tell donors: 'Think before giving' Back in December, the parents of Twilight and Underworld actor Michael Sheen answered the plea and donated some of his old suits to the BHF store in Port Talbot.

They have since sold for hundreds of pounds a piece on eBay. Mr Fletcher said: ""We had a fantastic donation before Christmas from Michael Sheen's family who are strong supporters of the BHF, because as a family they have benefitted from the research."" He said he hoped people follow suit after a ""Christmas declutter"". Adam Fletcher says charity shop losses directly affect research and support that charities can offer He said: ""The coronavirus crisis has had a devastating impact on the BHF's income, leading to research funding being cut in half and the delay of important scientific breakthroughs. ""The impact is on the amount of new research we can fund and it is important we can address a lot of the questions through research and we can only do that through raising money and through our fundraising opportunities. ""Every item sold will be turned into funds for research that could help transform the lives of those 340,000 people in Wales living with heart and circulatory diseases."" The BHF is not the only charity that has taken a hit by Covid shutting shops. Barnardo's said they had seen their retail income fall by Â£47.9m to Â£30m in 2020-21 because of the impact of lockdown closures. Loss-making stores were closed, but Barnardo's was able to triple online sales to Â£330,000 and increase eBay sales from Â£1m to Â£1.4m thanks to continued donations. Ty Hafan said they used to get a third of their funding from their charity shops and added this had now ""reduced significantly"". For Cancer Research Wales there has been a 50% drop in income across the board but, in particular, retail income saw a loss of 83% last year - which translates into about Â£400,000. Charities have urged people to donate quality items to charity shops to keep them open and help fund their work Rhodri Davies, head of income generation at Cancer Research Wales, said: ""As a charity that looks to generate about Â£3m a year, that is a big loss for us and it has had a wider impact on resources, staff and the way we operate as a charity."" He said as a result stores have had to undergo a ""restructure"" to keep them afloat. ""We think about how we present, stock and staff our shops because we have seen a number of people leave, but we have got to make sure that we keep them open to make sure they are profitable for the charity to help fund cancer research. ""We know the pandemic has had a significant impact on the economy and we want to keep customers coming through our doors shopping, but also we desperately need someone to bring their donated goods to us. ""Every donation is valued and appreciated because it means every donation we receive we can raise income for the charity to benefit people with cancer in Wales.""

Marmite-owner Unilever bids for GSK's consumer armAnalysts say a successful bid would represent one of the biggest ever deals involving firms trading in London.Business,"Marmite is one of Unilever's many brands GlaxoSmithKline has rejected three Unilever offers to buy its consumer goods division, including one worth Â£50bn. GSK said the proposals ""fundamentally failed"" to reflect the value of the division. With a successful bid, Unilever - which owns Marmite, Dove and PG Tips - would add Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol to its list of household brands. Such a deal would be one of the biggest ever involving London-listed firms. GSK said in a statement the most recent proposal from Unilever on 20 December contained an offer for Â£41.7bn in cash and Â£8.3bn in Unilever shares. The global healthcare company, which has its headquarters in London, has already been preparing to separate its consumer goods division from its pharmaceutical business in the middle of this year. The firm hascome under pressurefrom investors for failing to develop a Covid vaccine. Unilever said in a statement the GSK consumer arm ""would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio"". The consumer goods giant,which became a fully British company in 2020after previously being separated between the UK and the Netherlands, also approached Pfizer about the potential deal, since the American pharmaceutical giant owns a 34% stake in GSK's consumer goods business. Neither GSK nor Pfizer has any ideological objection to selling to Unilever. GSK had planned to spin off its consumer business later this year anyway through a demerger creating a separate publicly listed company but always said it would have an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right. GSK's problem with the Unilever bid is that the price isn't right. Both Barclays and Goldman Sachs analysts have valued the business at around Â£50bn. However, that does not include a few important things. First, the premium you would normally expect to pay for taking control of a business - somewhere in the range of 30% - although that might be reduced by the debt of about Â£10bn GSK was expected to leave on the books of the consumer business. Second, the value of the cost savings GSK admits could be made to make the business more profitable. Third, it may not reflect the higher sales growth targets GSK boss Emma Walmsley has said are possible for the business. She has also said the benefit of a demerger is current GSK shareholders would get shares in the demerged business so retain their participation in any future growth in the consumer business. Some will say if higher growth and greater cost reductions are possible, why haven't they happened already? Emma Walmsley has been in charge for more than four years. That's one of the questions activist shareholder Elliot Management has implicitly asked by encouraging other shareholders to agitate for a more radical greater break up of one of the UK's most valuable companies. The BBC understands the very different ideas on what this business is worth means there are no active and ongoing discussions between GSK and Unilever. But Unilever's intentions are very clear. The ""for sale"" sign is now very visible and the elbows will get sharper as this basket of household consumer goods gets closer to the checkout. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Unilever's chief executive Alan Jope was under pressure because the business had recently missed targets for sales and profit margins. ""Unilever has strong cashflow, but the heat is on Mr Jope. He wants to be seen to do something,"" Mr Mould said. ""But this is a high risk deal. Many investors see GSK as underperforming. But at a time when inflation is rising, consumer goods with loyal customers represent a good way for firms to try to manage profits."" The move was first reported inthe Sunday Times.,external GSK said its consumer goods division had the potential to increase sales by up to 6% a year in the medium term, and Unilever's offers did not take that into account. It said the proposals were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders. Preliminary figures show sales for GSK's consumer division reached Â£9.6bn in 2021. Other brands in the division include Centrum vitamins, Aquafresh toothpaste and Nicorette gum. The company has said it is in late stage trails of a Covid vaccine it was developing with the French pharmaceutical firm, Sanofi.

What did he do after testing positive?,"Novak Djokovic sought a medical exemption from Australia's strict Covid visa regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in mid-December. Mr Djokovic was tested in Serbia, where you are legally required to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid test. After days of speculation over public engagements he apparently attended following his positive test, he has now said he did appear in public during this period of isolation. Here is a timeline of events from what we know so far. Mr Djokovic attended a Euroleague basketball game in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, between Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona. After the game, numerous people who attended tested positive for Covid-19, so it is possible this is where Mr Djokovic became infected. Mr Djokovic had front row seats at the Euroleague basketball game in Belgrade on 14 December Mr Djokovic says he took a lateral flow test on 16 December following the Covid outbreak at the basketball game. He says this came back negative, but that he also took a PCR test ""out an abundance of caution"". In court documents, Mr Djokovic's lawyerssubmitted evidence,externalthat confirms he took a PCR test just after 13:00 on 16 December. The document from the Institute of Public Health of Serbia states the result came back positive seven hours later, at about 20:00 on the same day. Mr Djokovic says he wasn't notified about his positive PCR result until the following day. Mr Djokovic attended a panel discussion and a ceremony for the unveiling of a stamp in his honour in Belgrade on 16 December (before 20:00), which he posted about on Twitter the next day.

Before attending the event Mr Djokovic says he produced another negative lateral flow test, and he was ""asymptomatic and felt good"". It was after this event that Mr Djokovic says he received notification that his PCR test was positive. At this point he should have began 14 days of isolation. It has beenreported by French newspaper L'Equipe,externalthat Mr Djokovic attended an interview and photo shoot with their paper in Belgrade on 18 December. He has since admitted attending this engagement, which he says was ""an error of judgement and I accept I should have rescheduled"". Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic told the BBCthat it was ""a clear breach of the rules"" if Mr Djokovic continued with public events, knowing he had Covid. The paper says he wore a face mask during the interview, but removed it for the photo shoot. He posed with the newspaper's Champion of Champions trophy - an award which recognises the outstanding sportsperson of the year. Allow Twitter content?

In Mr Djokovic's Australian travel entry form -  released by the federal court - it was stated that he had not travelled anywhere else in the 14 days prior to his arrival there. Mr Djokovic says the form was filled in by a member of his team who - in ""human error"" - had ticked the wrong box about his previous travel before coming to Australia. Australian immigration officials said on Tuesday they were investigating whether he had made a ""false declaration"" - which would be grounds for a visa cancellation.

Baldwin hands phone to Rust shooting investigators,"Alec Baldwin has turned over his mobile phone to police investigating a fatal shooting on a New Mexico film set. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was shot as Mr Baldwin, 63, rehearsed drawing a prop gun on the set of the movie Rust in October last year. Santa Fe Sheriff's Office confirmed the actor had turned over his device to authorities near his home in New York. Police had said earlier this week that the actor was not co-operating with the inquiry. Santa Fe County Sheriff spokesperson Juan Rios told the Los Angeles Times on Friday that police intend to gather data like text messages and voicemails off the handset as part of their investigation into the incident. This video can not be played Adam Egypt Mortimer said Hutchins' death is ""unfathomable"" Aaron Dyer, Mr Baldwin's attorney, told BBC partner CBS News that his client had voluntarily turned over the phone. ""But this matter isn't about his phone, and there are no answers on his phone,"" Mr Dyer said. ""Alec did nothing wrong."" Mr Baldwin was rehearsing drawing a prop gun while filming Rust, a western, when it discharged, but he has insisted he ""didn't pull the trigger"". A lawsuit against Mr Baldwin alleges that a film script did not require him to fire a gun when he fatally shot Ms Hutchins. Lawyers handling the legal action described the behaviour of Mr Baldwin and the film's producers as ""reckless"", and accused them of failing to follow safety protocols.

'My kidney transplant was saved by blue-light taxi',"Eoin Madden and his wife, Michelle, underwent surgery at Belfast City Hospital With a one-in-a-100,000 chance of finding a compatible kidney transplant match, Eoin Madden almost fainted when he received a call to say a suitable donor had been found. The odds were greatly against him due to the high level of antibodies in his system - a by-product of having undergone two previous transplants. The Galway man thought he had overcome all hurdles but then his car broke down just as he crossed the Irish border on the way to the operation in Belfast. But all hope was not lost thanks to a special taxi service - courtesy of the police. Eoin was first diagnosed with IgA nephropathy when he was in his late teens. The condition effectively means that part of his immune system attacks his kidneys. At the time, he was told it probably would not affect him too much until later in life. But during an annual check up at the age of 21, he was told he needed to start dialysis straight away. He travelled to hospital three times a week for the best part of a year before he was told a cadaver kidney had been found. After a successful operation, the organ worked well for seven years before the initial condition reappeared. A second deceased donor match was found for Eoin but he lost kidney function very suddenly when he contracted pneumonia. Eoin was put back on dialysis and was able to have the treatment at home, meaning he could spend time with his young family. He said while dialysis works ""it takes a toll on your body, and you get more sick and more tired as years go on"". His siblings offered to donate but were unsuitable. Eoin's wife, Michelle, also put herself forward as a living donor. Eoin said dialysis ""takes a toll on your body and you get more sick and more tired as years go on"" ""She's not a living match, which we expected,"" explained Eoin, but they found another option. ""The UK has this fantastic scheme called the Shared Exchange Scheme, where Michelle could give a kidney to someone in the UK and their partner could give a kidney to me, if they could find a donor to match me. ""The doctors said that because the UK has a larger population, there was a better chance of a match."" They went to Belfast to meet the team at Belfast City Hospital and were accepted on to the scheme. Shortly before Halloween, Eoin was in a shop buying decorations when he received a call about a match. ""I could've just fainted there and then,"" he said. ""I went home and told Michelle and they'd called her as well."" On 16 December, as Michelle was wheeled down to theatre, the operation was called off because another member of the exchange group was ill. The surgery was rescheduled for the new year, which made for an anxious Christmas with the family ""totally cocooned"" to avoid the threat of Covid-19. So after a five-year wait, on 3 January, Michelle and Eoin retraced their journey from Galway to Belfast. But just as they crossed the border, disaster struck when their car broke down. With less than 40 miles of the 250-mile trip to go, the couple were, as they put it, ""stressed out of our heads"". Utterly resigned and devastated, the couple thought their luck had run out. While out on a regular patrol, Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Constables Aaron Chambers and Matthew Millen spotted a car pulled up at the side of the motorway. The couple explained to the officers they were having mechanical difficulties and there was somewhere they needed to be, urgently. ""They then told me it was for a transplant,"" said Con Chambers. ""We knew we had to get them there pretty sharpish."" The Maddens' made a ""quick run up the road"" thanks to the help of the police ""The officers were so calm and so kind, from the first moment they appeared, I stopped worrying,"" Michelle said. ""They completely took control and made us their priority for the next 40 minutes."" The officers arranged for the Maddens' car to be safely stored at the local station and packed their luggage into the back of the police car before making the ""quick run up the road"" to Belfast City Hospital. Michelle underwent her operation first while Eoin ""paced the room"" nervously waiting for her return. He was up next, and after almost 12 hours on the operating table, ""the kidney just started functioning immediately,"" he said. Now discharged from hospital, Eoin told BBC News NI: ""My kidney function is perfect, literally the best it's been in my life. ""My wife's kidney function is perfect and the pair we exchanged with over in Great Britain are doing really well as well. This will be a new lease of life for me."" Eoin hopes that his story will help those awaiting donation to ""keep the faith"", while also encouraging others to think about becoming an organ donor. ""It's a fantastic gift that you can give to someone else when you pass on,"" he said. As for the two officers who rescued the couple, they said: ""We don't think we've done anything special, we just did what anyone would do in that situation."" ""The real people who deserve any recognition are the ones that donated the organs,"" added Con Aaron Chambers. ""We were just a taxi with blue and yellow chevrons and a couple of traffic exemptions.""

Jailed 'Pharma Bro' ordered to repay $64m,"Martin Shkreli in 2017 Martin Shkreli, the former drug firm executive who ordered dramatic price hikes of a life-saving medicine, has been barred from the industry for life. In a decision on Friday, Judge Denise Cote ordered him to repay $64.6m (Â£47m) in profits he made from the scheme. She ruled that Mr Shkreli's actions had violated laws against monopolies. Mr Shkreli is currently serving a prison sentence for defrauding investors. But this decision is about action he took in 2015 to raise the price of Daraprim, a long-established medicine used to treat toxoplasmosis, from $13.50 to $750 - around 4,000% - overnight. He also designed supply agreements to block competitors from offering a generic version of the unpatented medicine, which is used to treat the parasitic disease in pregnant women and patients with Aids. The moves were unpopular, and earned him the nick-name ""Pharma Bro"". Seven states and the Federal Trade Commission brought a lawsuit over the conduct in 2020, saying he had violated state and federal laws that ban anti-competitive conduct. In her opinion, US District Judge Cote called Mr Shkreli the ""prime mover"" in the scheme. ""It was his brainchild and he drove it each step of the way,"" she wrote. Vyera Pharmaceuticals, which Mr Shkreli founded and was previously known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, earlier agreed to pay $40m. New York Attorney General Letitia James, one of the officials who brought the suit, celebrated the decision. She said Mr Shkreli and his partner had illegally raised the ""price of a life-saving drug as Americans' lives hung in the balance"".

Canadian doctor delivers 'Miracle' baby on flight,"A Canadian doctor has told of her joy after delivering a ""Miracle"" baby on an overnight flight to Uganda. Dr Aisha Khatib, a professor at the University of Toronto, was about one hour into her Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Entebbe when the call went out. A Ugandan migrant worker travelling home from Saudi Arabia was about to deliver her first child. The baby, early at 35 weeks, was born healthy, and was named Miracle Aisha, after the doctor. Dr Khatib, bleary-eyed from a gruelling work schedule back in coronavirus-plagued Toronto, was enjoying a well-earned rest on the third leg of her trip. But she did not hesitate when a voice on the intercom asked if there was a doctor aboard. ""I see a crowd of people gathered around the patient,"" Dr Khatib told BBC News. At this point she was assuming it was a critical situation, like a heart attack. ""As I got closer see this woman lying on the seat with her head toward the aisle and feet towards the window. And the baby was coming out!"" The mother was brought to sit in business class after giving birth Dr Khatib was helped by two other passengers - an oncology nurse and a paediatrician from Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The baby was crying ""robustly"", she said. Following a quick check, she passed the infant to the paediatrician for a closer inspection. ""I looked at the baby, and she was stable, and I looked at the mom and she was OK,"" says Dr Khatib. ""So I was like, 'Congratulations it's a girl.' Then the entire plane started clapping and cheering and was like 'Oh right, I'm on a plane and everybody is watching this.'"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The best part of the story is that she decided to name the baby after me."" As a gift to her namesake, she gave Miracle Aisha the gold necklace that she was wearing with the name Aisha written in Arabic. ""I thought I'd give it to her and she'll have a little token of the doctor that delivered her 35,000ft in the air while flying over the Nile."" The delivery happened on 5 December, but Dr Khatib has been too busy treating Covid patients in Toronto to share the pictures until this week. She was called back from Uganda - where was training local workers - on 18 December. On her flight home, there was yet another call for a medical expert on her plane. ""Luckily there was another doctor there,"" Dr Khatib laughs. ""And I kinda said: This one's you. I delivered a baby two weeks ago. If you need me I'm in seat 25A.'""

He added he was ""a shopkeeper to his core"" and ""was ambitious for the company and led Sainsbury's through an unprecedented period of growth; he was a truly inspirational man"". Martin Scicluna, chairman of Sainsbury's, said he would be ""greatly missed"" by all his friends and colleagues.
