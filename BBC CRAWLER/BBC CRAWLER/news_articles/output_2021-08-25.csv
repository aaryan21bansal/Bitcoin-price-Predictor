"'My husband refused a divorce for nine years'Under orthodox Jewish law, a husband must give his wife a document to allow the marriage to end.UK","Rifka Meyer was finally granted a religious divorce last year Rifka Meyer was 32 when she entered into a religious marriage. Two-and-a-half years later, she became what is known among orthodox Jews as a ""chained wife"" - trapped in a religious marriage with a man who refused to let her have a divorce. ""You feel hopeless and you feel very alone,"" she tells BBC Newsnight. ""You feel like you're screaming and not being heard."" It would take her nearly 10 years to get a religious divorce. But more than 100 women from the Charedi Jewish community remain trapped in religious marriages in the UK, according to Labour Peer Jonathan Mendelsohn, who is part of a cross-party parliamentary group that formed to help them. ""The thing that has shocked me [is] that I alone have been contacted by people since I raised this issue,"" he says. ""Tens of cases, tens of cases, including a number of people in the Jewish community in which I live."" Under orthodox Jewish law, the husband must grant his wife a document called a ""get"" in Hebrew. Without this, worshippers believe she remains married to him even if they are legally divorced. The women stuck in these religious marriages are known as Agunot, or ""chained wives"". Ms Meyer says it meant she was not permitted to have another partner. ""You're stuck. I can't even think of meeting anyone, or dating or moving my life forward because I am stuck in this corner without a view and I just can't go anywhere from there,"" she says. ""There's not enough communication and support to help you through it. You feel very desperate and very alone. It's a very lonely journey to go through."" Ms Meyer, who lives in London, finally received her get last year. She now runs a charity called GETT Out to help women who are in the same situation. The woman is forbidden from getting married again as it is considered adultery She is also not allowed to have children with anybody else. If she does, the child is labelled a ""mamzer"" or an estranged person If the man is seen as being pressured into giving the get, the Jewish Court - called the Beth Din - rules the divorce invalid An amendment to the statutory guidance under the Domestic Abuse Act now says that withholding a get can be a form of domestic abuse. If it is deemed controlling or coercive behaviour, the man could be charged and, if found guilty, imprisoned. Ministers hope the change will give women more power to complain to the authorities about their former partners for not granting a religious divorce. But the Federation of Synagogues, a group representing orthodox Jews, says any get ""given under duress, whether due to physical threats, financial threats or the threat of imprisonment, is absolutely invalid"" under Jewish law. ""The couple would remain married to one another, notwithstanding the granting of a get,"" it said in a letter. The federation added that any woman using the provisions of the Domestic Abuse Act will have ""tied... the hands"" of the Jewish court, as ""clearly the husband in such a situation will be acting under duress"". Eli Spitzer, a headteacher who is part of the orthodox Jewish community in London, says some rabbis believe that women seeking help under the legislation ""would start a process which is then irreversible"". ""The husband is no longer in a position to grant a divorce or to give the divorce to his wife out of free will because obviously he faces prosecution, and therefore what the rabbis are saying [is] this has undermined what a Jewish divorce is all about, that it has to be given out of free will,"" he says. But Lord Mendelsohn, who is Jewish, believes there is no clash between religious and non-religious law, and questions the motives of the rabbis who say there is. ""They've chosen to create a conflict where none really exists. And I don't know why that is, I suspect [it] is because they feel they're losing control of parts of the process,"" he says. ""But in any situation where a religious minority exists in a democracy, you have to balance these things... I think they really have to get a grip of the situation and come to realise that this is Britain, this is Britain in 2021."" Some worshippers have told Newsnight they believe the Torah did not intend for women to feel stuck in unhappy marriages. But there is concern among some in the orthodox community that secularism is overriding religion, wiping away centuries of deep-rooted tradition and law practised by millions. Ms Meyer says that while the amendment to the guidance under the Domestic Abuse Act helps women, it is necessary to ""work with the rabbis as well"". ""The women feel desperate and they'll take whatever they can get in order to achieve their get,"" she says. ""It's a lifetime of these women being stuck in a marriage that's dead.""

Supermarket bosses warn over Christmas supplies,"The boss of supermarket Iceland says the supply chain chaos is getting worse, just as retailers start planning for the key Christmas period. Richard Walker told the BBC he estimated the UK's shortage of lorry drivers was now about 100,000, with the company itself about 100 short. Tesco boss John Allan said ""there may be some shortages"", but people should not ""over-dramatise"" and panic-buy. ""It's very easy to make a drama out of a modest crisis,"" he told the BBC. The continuing shortage of HGV drivers is starting to make retailers nervous, as they are about to start planning for the key trading period. The government said there was a ""highly resilient"" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage. But Mr Walker said: ""The reason for sounding the alarm now is that we've already had one Christmas cancelled at the last minute. ""I'd hate this one to be problematic as well,"" he added. ""We start to stock-build from September onwards for what is a hugely important time of year,"" he added. ""We've got a lot of goods to transport between now and Christmas and a strong supply chain is vital for everyone."" Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told How serious is the HGV driver shortage? ""The driver shortage is impacting the food supply chain on a daily basis and leading to shortages on the shelves,"" Mr Walker said. ""We've had deliveries cancelled for the first time since the pandemic began, about 30 to 40 deliveries a day."" The simple solution he said, was for heavy goods vehicle drivers to be added to the UK's skilled workers list, to help get drivers recruited from overseas. ""These men and women, these HGV drivers, have kept the show on the road for 18 months during the pandemic and it's criminal that we're not viewing them as skilled workers,"" he told the BBC. Asked if Brexit is responsible for the supply chain problems, Mr Walker responded: ""I think so, but it's a 'self-inflicted wound' rather than an inevitable consequence of Brexit, caused by the government's failure to appreciate the importance of HGV drivers and the work they do for us."" Tesco chairman Mr Allan echoed the warnings, but felt the situation was unlikely to develop into a crisis. ""There may be some shortages at Christmas, but I wouldn't want to overdramatise the extent to which that would be the case."" He said that normally, the supermarket industry would start building stocks now in readiness for Christmas, but ""at the moment we're running very hard just to keep on top of the existing demand and there isn't the capacity to build stocks that we would like to see"". He said Tesco, like all its rivals, was ""very short of drivers"". Firms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers. Steve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, warned that current food shortages were ""at a worse level than at any time I have seen"". He told the Times that the Co-op had significantly reduced its range of some products to help serve customers. Mr Murrells said the disruption to supply had been driven by ""Brexit and issues caused by Covid"" and the firm was retraining staff as lorry drivers to help fill vacant roles. A government spokesperson said: ""We have a highly resilient food supply chain. We have well-established ways of working with the food sector and are working closely with them to ensure businesses have the labour they need. ""We have put in place a package of measures to tackle the HGV driver shortage. Additionally, our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. As part of this, we are streamlining the process for people to get their HGV licence."" Tesco has been offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. On Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem. Problems with shipping goods in from overseas could also hit Christmas, according to toy retailer boss Gary Grant. The chairman of The Entertainertold the Mail Online,externalthat he had to contend with shortages of containers to bring goods in from Asia and a jump in shipping costs. ""What is unique to us is that Christmas is a fixed date, so we are under extreme pressure at the moment to move as much stock as we can, but are significantly behind with the shipment of products,"" he said. ""There's not a shortage of toys, but what will happen as when we get nearer to Christmas, the suppliers will not have back-up stock that we've previously relied upon. So the range of stock we have may be narrower."" He warned that popular toys such as Paw Patrol, Barbie and Rainbocorns could be in short supply.

Nearly 200 arrests at climate change protestsCampaigners have glued themselves to a giant table and formed a human chain around Oxford Circus.,"This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion protesters have erected a structure in the centre of Oxford Circus Nearly 200 people have been arrested at Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in London over the past four days. On Wednesday, the climate change protesters blocked off roads near Oxford Circus, glued themselves to a giant table and formed a human chain around the area cordoned off by police. Dozens were carried to police vans by officers who used loudspeakers to warn the crowd to leave or risk arrest. At least 10,000 people congregated near the rallies since they began on Sunday. Currently, 196 people have been arrested on suspicion of a variety of offences. What is Extinction Rebellion and what are its aims? The Brazilian embassy, Piccadilly Circus and the Department for International Trade (DIT) were also targeted, with thousands listening to speeches and parading through the streets. The group gave the DIT a mock award for ""making an outstandingly awful contribution to climate change"" and the embassy gathering was ""to show solidarity with indigenous people in the Amazon rainforest"". The table, which hadpreviously been erected in Seven Dials, represents an invitation to ""come to the table"" for discussions about fossil fuel. Chairs were left empty to represent an invitation to all those who identify as female, nonbinary or trans. Extinction Rebellion coordinate these actions very carefully. Just after 14:00 BST about 50 female protestors converged on the road junction at the centre of Oxford Circus. A van drew up, the back doors were flung open, and women began to unload what looked like giant pieces of pink Lego. Quickly they began to assemble these in the middle of the road. At the same time, 30 or so women formed a circle and superglued their hands together. Others lay down in the road and padlocked themselves together with locks inside steel tubes. The idea is to make it as difficult and as time consuming as possible for the police to dismantle the protest. Within minutes, dozens of police officers arrived, charging into the middle of the group amid screams from the protesters. And the now familiar stand-off began, with police gradually tightening their cordons until - probably early tomorrow morning - they will go in and clear the remaining protesters from the streets. The demonstrations are planned to continue next week The demonstrations are planned to continue next week, when the activists will protest against the links between ""big finance, fossil fuels and the fossil of politics that is Westminster"".

OnlyFans suspends policy change after backlash,"OnlyFans has announced that it will delay making changes to policy on content creation, following a widespread backlash by its users. The content subscription service announced plans last week toblock sexually explicit photos and videos from October. On Wednesday, it tweeted that it has ""suspended the planned 1 October policy change"". It is currently unclear if the delay will be permanent. OnlyFans wrote on twitter that it would ""continue to provide a home for all creators"". ""Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard,"" said the company. ""We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned 1 October policy change. ""OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators."" And in an email to its content creators, it said: ""The proposed 1 October 2021 changes are no longer required, due to banking partners' assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators. ""OnlyFans is committed to providing a safe and dependable platform for all creators and their fans."" One OnlyFans creator, from London, welcomed the announcement but said those who had already found new homes for their content may still not return. ""So it is short-term good news for sex workers reliant on the platform - and I would like to see this as the start of increased support, celebration and championing of sex-worker rights by OnlyFans,"" he told BBC News. OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos Under the skin of OnlyFans OnlyFans must act on underage use, watchdog says ""But I think there may well have been enough anxiety caused to see many models continuing the move to other platforms."" OnlyFans makes its money by taking 20% of all payments made to its content creators. The platform reported a 75% increase in new creators in May last year, during lockdown. Wariness from investors was originally claimed to be the reason for last week's announcement. But founder Tim Stokely blamed banks penalising the company for supporting sex workers. ""JPMorgan Chase is particularly aggressive in closing accounts of sex workers or...â any business that supports sex workers,"" he told theFinancial Times,externalon Tuesday. But a JPMorgan spokeswoman told BBC News it had ""no such policy"". In June, a BBC News investigation foundchildren had used fake ID to set up accounts on the site. And the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop under-age users. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.

Doctors told to ration blood testsNHS Wales issues guidelines which include a temporary pause of a number of blood tests.Wales,"New GP guidance says regular blood tests should be staggered if clinically safe Family GPs are being told to ""ration"" non-essential blood analysis due to a test tube shortage. The vials used to collect samples to be sent to labs for testing are made in the US. BD, which makes the vials for the NHS across the UK, has warned of serious supply chain issues due to the pandemic and transportation issues. NHS Wales has issued guidelines which include a temporary pause of a number of blood tests. The Aneurin Bevan Health Board has written to GPs in its area telling them to halve the number of blood tests they carry out. ""It's not something I've come across before,"" said one GP, who didn't want to be named. Their surgery has had to postpone routine blood tests for patients who usually have an annual medication or chronic disease review. They will continue at the moment for patients who clinically need them. Heart app aims to cut NHS waiting lists in Wales Â£551m extra funding for NHS and social care Rebuilding Wales' NHS 'could be bigger challenge than pandemic' ""Until the bottles run out, we will continue to carry out blood tests for those who clinically need them,"" the doctor said. BD said the shortage was being driven by the need for the tubes for testing Covid patients as well as routine testing for procedures that had been delayed due to the pandemic. It said it was also facing ""transportation challenges that have affected all industries, including port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges"". It is manufacturing at optimal levels to improve supply availability and has invested in manufacturing capacity expansion, it added. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the new clinical guidance was to preserve supplies for urgent cases. ""Patient safety remains the priority, and a test would only be delayed if the NHS have assessed it is clinically safe to do so,"" she said. ""People who require urgent care should continue to seek it as normal."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the new clinical guidance was to preserve supplies for urgent cases The new guidance says GPs can ""reduce non-essential testing"" including vitamin D testing, and deferring routine infertility testing unless the patient is over 35. It says allergy testing is ""not a priority at this time unless there is clinical need"" and routine wellness screening is ""not a priority"". NHS England has temporarily stopped some screening for infertility, pre-diabetes and allergies. The new GP guidance says regular blood tests should be staggered if clinically safe and general practices in Wales have been advised to not stockpile vials. They have also been told to not carry out blood tests at the surgery if patients are being referred on to hospital for further treatment. Tests for patients at immediate high risk will be prioritised for the next three months. This includes patients with conditions where tests might affect how it is treated. BMA Cymru, which represents doctors, has worked with the Welsh government and NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership on guidance on how to conserve supplies. It is worried about balancing the effect of the shortage with the patients' needs and that it could lead to a backlog of cases after the pandemic. BMA Cymru worked with the Welsh government on guidance on how to conserve supplies BMA Cymru chairman, Dr David Bailey, said ""We've got a massive shortage across the UK for the next two or three months. ""We rely on these bottles for almost all of the blood tests that we do for patients, both in general practice and in hospitals, so we're going to have to ration them essentially. ""Patient care will be impacted and while we hope that impact will be minimal, we're coming out of a massive pandemic and have a big backlog of work. ""The very last thing we need is to push more work down the line, because we haven't actually got the tools to do the job."" Diabetes Cymru's Joshua James said blood tests were ""essential"" in diagnosing type 2 diabetes. He said: ""It is very important that those previously identified by their GP as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes receive their annual checks, including checking their blood glucose levels,  and do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue."" NHS Wales said it and the Welsh government were working closely with other nations to source alternatives to affected products.

A government spokesperson said: ""We have a highly resilient food supply chain. We have well-established ways of working with the food sector and are working closely with them to ensure businesses have the labour they need. ""We have put in place a package of measures to tackle the HGV driver shortage. Additionally, our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. As part of this, we are streamlining the process for people to get their HGV licence."" Tesco has been offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. On Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem. Problems with shipping goods in from overseas could also hit Christmas, according to toy retailer boss Gary Grant. The chairman of The Entertainertold the Mail Online,externalthat he had to contend with shortages of containers to bring goods in from Asia and a jump in shipping costs. ""What is unique to us is that Christmas is a fixed date, so we are under extreme pressure at the moment to move as much stock as we can, but are significantly behind with the shipment of products,"" he said. ""There's not a shortage of toys, but what will happen as when we get nearer to Christmas, the suppliers will not have back-up stock that we've previously relied upon. So the range of stock we have may be narrower."" He warned that popular toys such as Paw Patrol, Barbie and Rainbocorns could be in short supply.

'The plane hit the tower and all our lives changed',"Same scene, different time... Afghans flee Kabul in 2001 Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary saw the Taliban toppled in 2001 and his country transformed. But in his view, as he explains here, the US missed an opportunity to try to bring lasting peace. And in the last two weeks the path of his homeland took a terrifying twist, one that put his own life in danger. In 2001, I was a carpet salesman at the Pearl Continental Hotel in Peshawar, Pakistan, having yet another unremarkable day at work. I'll never forget glancing up at the TV in a brief moment between sales, only to witness firsthand the dramatic footage as a passenger plane careered into the World Trade Center in New York. Then the second plane, and another at the Pentagon. None of our lives would ever be the same. International attention immediately focused on Afghanistan where the ruling Taliban were accused of providing a sanctuary for the attack's prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and his al-Qaeda movement. Only the next day, there were suddenly hundreds of foreign media crews crowding the hotel's lobby, desperate for anyone who could speak English to assist them as a translator as they crossed the nearby border into Afghanistan. I took up that offer and I haven't stopped since. Bilal Sarwary in 2014 in Paghman, Afghanistan I hadn't lived in Afghanistan since I was a child - our family had fled the violence during the civil war in the 1990s when the Soviet troops withdrew. So when I entered Kabul for the first time again after all those years, I was shocked to discover the destruction, with buildings reduced to rubble and twisted metal. All signs of hustle and bustle had vanished. The people were so poor, and there was so much fear. I was initially working with Abu Dhabi TV and was based in the Intercontinental Hotel with five other journalists. I woke up every morning clouded in a haze of fear, as Kabul became the primary focus of American airstrikes. Known al-Qaeda operatives and Taliban came and went from our hotel, and we saw them wandering in nearby streets. Explosions rang through the night. I wondered if our hotel would be next. And then one morning in early December, the Taliban were gone. Within hours, people were lining up again outside barber shops to have their beards trimmed. Rhythmic Afghan music filled the streets, filling the vacuum left by explosions. Afghanistan was born again that morning. Men had their beards shaved after the Taliban were driven out From that moment onwards, I was intimately involved in observing the lives of ordinary Afghans firsthand, as they transitioned back to normality, no longer as a translator but as a journalist in my own right. From covering Tora Bora in the East to the Shai Koat battle in Paktia, I had seen the Taliban toppled. Their fighters vanished into the mountainous rural areas, and their leadership fled to Pakistan. In retrospect, it is clear to me that this was a missed opportunity, a time when the US should have sat down with the Taliban to discuss a peace deal. I saw a genuine willingness amongst the rank-and-file of the Taliban to lay down their arms, and resume their lives. But the Americans didn't want that. From my reporting, it seemed to me and many other Afghans that their motivation was revenge after 9/11. The ensuing years were a catalogue of errors. Poor and innocent Afghan villagers were bombed and detained. The Afghan government's willingness to allow foreigners to drive the war effort created a gulf between it and the people. I remember clearly an incident where the Americans had mistakenly arrested and detained a taxi driver named Sayed Abasin on the highway between Kabul and Gardez. His father, Mr Roshan, was elderly and a legendary employee of Ariana airlines. After we exposed the error, Mr Abasin was eventually freed. But others were not so connected and not so lucky. Russian tanks used for training in 2009 The Americans persisted with a heavy-handed approach, causing excess loss of life among ordinary Afghans. In a clear attempt to minimise American casualties, they prioritised bombs and drones over the use of ground troops. Trust for the Americans continued to erode and hopes for peace talks faded. There were brief glimpses of what Afghanistan could become. I could now drive on an open road for thousands of kilometres without fear of death. I criss-crossed the country, driving all the way from Kabul to remote villages in Khost and Paktika provinces late at night or early in the morning. Afghanistan's extraordinary countryside could be traversed. The year 2003 was the turning point. It was when the insurgents started to strike back with a renewed strength. I remember one day very clearly - it was the day that a huge truck bomb pierced the heart of Kabul, shaking the city and shattering windows. I was one of the first journalists on the scene and I'm still traumatised by what I found. It was my first experience of witnessing what would become the new normal, an imposed fact of life - carnage, flesh, and dead corpses littering the blood-splattered ground. And it just got worse. Later we would come to understand that the truck bombs and suicide attacks against Afghan forces, foreign forces and unarmed civilians in the middle of the city would mark the start of a very brutal chapter of the conflict. In response, the Americans escalated their reliance on airstrikes, this time expanding their list of Taliban targets - weddings and funerals in rural parts of the country. Who are the Taliban? Where will all the Afghan refugees go? What is Sharia law? Why can't UK hold Kabul airport without US? Ordinary Afghans came to see the sky as a source of fear. Gone were the days of gazing at the sunrise, sunset or the stars as a source of inspiration. On one trip to the lush green Arghandab river valley, close to the city of Kandahar, I arrived eager to see the country's most famous pomegranates. But when I arrived, it was the blood of its residents, not the fruit, that was flowing. What I saw was a microcosm of what has happened in so many rural areas in Afghanistan. The Taliban had thrust their fighters into the valley, but government forces were doing all they could to push them back. Control of the area teetered back and forth between the two sides, with ordinary Afghans caught in the middle. On that day, I counted 33 separate airstrikes ringing out. I lost count of the number of suicide car bombings launched in response by the Taliban. Homes, bridges and orchards were all destroyed. A bomb destroyed a wedding in 2019, killing 60 Many of the US airstrikes were led by false intelligence, provided by someone who wanted to settle a bitter personal rivalry or land dispute at a village level. The growing lack of trust between ground forces and ordinary Afghans meant that US forces couldn't tell the truth from the lies. The Taliban used these attacks to wedge Afghans against their own government, which proved to be fertile ground for their recruitment drives. It was also during this period (between 2001 to 2010) that Afghanistan's 9/11 generation - young Afghans who had been granted opportunities to study overseas in India, Malaysia, the US, and Europe - came back to join the country's effort to rebuild. This new generation had hopes of being part of a great national rejuvenation. Instead, they found themselves confronted by new challenges. They returned to see newly empowered warlords enlisted by the Americans. And they saw that corruption was rife. When a country's reality drifts too far from its ideals, day-to-day pragmatism becomes a person's primary driver. A culture of impunity started to prevail. Our country's landscape is deceptive. It is easy to be struck by its beautiful valleys, sharp peaks, winding rivers, and little hamlets. But what presents as a peaceful image hasn't provided ordinary Afghans with any peace. You can't find peace without safety in your own home. About four years ago, I was at a small village in Wardak province for a wedding. As the night fell, people had gathered and they were eating food under the stars. The sky was so clear. But suddenly, the night erupted into the sound of thundering drones and planes. There was clearly an operation taking place nearby. A sense of doom fell upon the wedding party. Northern Alliance fighters in 2001 Later that evening, I found myself sharing Kabuli pilau, bread, and meat with the father of a Taliban fighter who described in excruciating detail how his son had been killed in Helmand. His son was only 25 and left behind a widow and two small children. I was left speechless when the father explained with melancholy pride that although he was only a humble farmer, his son was a talented fighter who had believed in fighting for a different life. All I could see in the face of this old man was pain and sadness. Under Taliban control, music wasn't permitted, even at weddings. Instead, all gatherings of villagers were just full of these sad stories. People often overlook the human cost for the Taliban - there are widows, fathers who have lost their sons, and young people crippled by war on the other side too. When I asked this father of the Taliban fighter what he wanted, his eyes filled with tears and he said: ""I want an end to the fighting. Enough is enough. I know the pain of losing a son. I know Afghanistan must have a peace process, must have a ceasefire."" My Kabul office was only a few kilometres from a large military hospital. Friends, family and acquaintances visiting from my home province, Kunar, often asked me to accompany them to the hospital to identify the corpses of relatives who were members of the Afghan National Security Forces. Sometimes I felt like the spirit of my province was being crushed by the weight of these coffins. When the Americans recently commenced negotiations with the Taliban in Doha, we were initially overwhelmed with hope. The country was pining for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the negotiations were seen as the only pathway through. I, like so many millions of Afghans, had not seen peace in my country in my lifetime. A US-Taliban deal was struck in Doha in 2020 It didn't take long for our dreams to be shattered. It became clear that the talks were only about capitalising on battlefield victories, not trying to agree on a vision of peace. From an ordinary Afghan's perspective, they were meaningless. The Americans released 6,000 Taliban fighters and commanders from jail, which was sold as a means to a credible and meaningful peace process, and a permanent ceasefire. But that never happened. Instead, the peace process became clouded in a heartbreaking campaign of high-profile assassinations. Some of our country's most capable people from the media, legal sector, and judiciary were being killed on their doorsteps in Kabul and across the country. As talks between the Americans and Taliban took place, I remember a local police chief stood up in the middle of a war council meeting and suddenly accused the Americans of abandoning Afghan forces by talking to the enemy. ""They've stabbed us in the back,"" he said angrily. Like many Afghans his relationship with America is steeped in pain. Afghan working women to stay at home for now Bittersweet relief for Afghan evacuee now in UK One of my former classmates is a member of the Taliban and we are the same age. Over the last 20 years, we have continued to talk despite the fact that he's adhering to a different ideology. But recently, I saw him at a wedding and I could see how his attitude had hardened and soured. I saw and felt how this conflict has really divided Afghans. When we met, we could barely converse. He wasn't the guy that I remember from our days in Peshawar, playing cricket and stuffing our faces with juicy oranges. How could I know that all these years later I would find him on the other side? His story is also one of deep personal loss. His brother, father, and uncle were killed in a raid that was based on false intelligence and petty local rivalries. Separated as we are, I can't help but hope for a future of national reconciliation. But that seems a distant possibility now. I covered the regional capitals falling to the Taliban in recent weeks, with massive surrenders where no one put up a fight. But I didn't think they could make it into Kabul and take over the city. Refugees at the airport The night before it happened, officials I spoke to still thought they could hold it with the help of US air strikes. And there was talk of a peaceful transition of power into an inclusive government. But then [former president] Ghani left by helicopter and suddenly the Taliban were in the city. There was fear hanging in the air - people were very scared to see them back. Then I was told that my life was in danger. I took two changes of clothes and was taken to an undisclosed location with my wife, my baby daughter and my parents. This is a city I know intimately - every inch of it. I belong to this city and it's unbelievable to think no place was safe for me. I thought about my daughter Sola - her name means ""peace"" - and it was simply devastating to think the future we had hoped for her was now in tatters. As I left for the airport, I was reminded that for the second time in my life, I was leaving Afghanistan behind. When I got there, memories from years of work came back to overwhelm me - trips I had taken with officials or as a journalist heading to the front lines of the war. Then I saw all these people, all these families lining up to flee. A generation of Afghans burying their dreams and aspirations. But this time I wasn't there to cover the story. I was there to join them.

Where will Afghan refugees go?,"Thousands of people are scrambling to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban seized back control of the country, almost two decades after they were ousted by a US-led coalition. The United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. The current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders. The US-led operation to evacuate people by air has now ended, with the last flight taking off from Kabul airport just after midnight on Tuesday - a deadline agreed with the Taliban for foreign forces to withdraw. More than 123,000 civilians were evacuated by US forces and its coalition partners after the Taliban took control of the capital on 14 August - but it's unclear exactly how many of those were Afghan nationals. The US has said that it flew nearly 80,000 civilians out of Kabul and of those, about 5,500 were Americans and more than 73,500 were either Afghans or other foreign nationals. While the UK Ministry of Defence, which ended its evacuations on Saturday, said it had flown out more than 15,000 people and some 8,000 of them were Afghans. At the height of the operation, the US said its military planes were departing the airport every 39 minutes - although the evacuations did slow down after the suicide bomb attack on the 26 August outside the airport, which killed about 170 people, including 13 American troops. Many of those flown out of the country were taken to emergency processing centres set up in several countries, including Spain, Germany, Qatar and Uzbekistan. The Ramstein military base in Germany has become a makeshift camp for thousands of Afghans As many as 300,000 Afghans have been affiliated with US operations in the country since 2001,according,externalto the International Rescue Committee, and tens of thousands of them are eligible to obtain a US visa - but many will now have to find a different way out of the country. At the weekend, the US said it had received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan nationals who are issued with valid travel documents by another country will be allowed to leave Afghanistan. The Taliban control all the main land crossing points with Afghanistan's neighbours (shown on the map below) and reports suggest they are only allowing traders or those with valid travel documents to leave the country. However, many of those trying to flee because they fear for their safety under Taliban rule will not have any paperwork. The UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees and called on the international community to support those countries. But Uzbekistan, which borders the north of Afghanistan, has said its main crossing point is closed to ""ensure security"" and there are no plans to open it. Pakistan, which has the longest border with Afghanistan, has also said it will not accept refugees - with its US ambassador telling the BBC: ""We are already overburdened by the refugees, and it is beyond our capacity to host any more refugees."" Last week, satellite imagery of the Spin Boldak crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed a large crowd of people gathered on the Afghan side. The BBC's Shumaila Jaffery, who was at the crossing point, said it was a chaotic scene with many Afghans not being allowed to enter Pakistan. Last Friday, two Afghans were reportedly killed by Pakistani security forces at the Torkham border crossing after trying to enter Pakistan illegally. There have also been reports of thousands of Afghans trying to cross the western border with Iran, but it's unclear how many have been successful. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I can't get out, I'll die The latest movement of Afghans is part of a historical exodus from a country that has suffered instability and conflict over many years. Even before the Taliban retook control, more than 550,000 people had been forced to flee their homes this year due to fighting, according to the UNHCR. That means an estimated 3.5 million Afghans are currently internally displaced within the country. In addition to those within Afghanistan's borders, about 2.2 million refugees and asylum seekers were also seeking sanctuary in neighbouring nations as of the end of last year. This year, Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought and food shortages across most of the country. A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger. Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the ""already horrendous situation"" would become ""an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster"". Neighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year. Almost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures. Germany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000. When looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively. Although there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems. The UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in ""their darkest hour of need"" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis. BothPakistanandIranhave said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan. Uzbekistanhas said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. TheTajikistangovernment previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet.Turkmenistanhas said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself. Turkish security forces patrolling the border with Iran help an exhausted Afghan family InTurkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be ""Europe's migrant storage unit"". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally. Officials in severalEuropean Unioncountries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory. France, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number.Germanyhas also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered. Polish soldiers have been erecting a fence along the border with Belarus to stop illegal crossings Other EU countries, likeAustria,PolandandSwitzerlandhave said they will not accept any new Afghan arrivals and are upping their border security to guard against illegal arrivals. TheUKhas said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban. TheUShas not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (Â£367m) for ""unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees"".Canadahas said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans whileAustraliahas said it will take in 3,000. Several countries, includingKosovoandUganda, have also accepted US requests to temporarily accept Afghan refugees before they are resettled elsewhere.

Extinction Rebellion activists block Oxford Circus,"This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion protesters have erected a structure in the centre of Oxford Circus Nearly 200 people have been arrested at Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in London over the past four days. On Wednesday, the climate change protesters blocked off roads near Oxford Circus, glued themselves to a giant table and formed a human chain around the area cordoned off by police. Dozens were carried to police vans by officers who used loudspeakers to warn the crowd to leave or risk arrest. At least 10,000 people congregated near the rallies since they began on Sunday. Currently, 196 people have been arrested on suspicion of a variety of offences. What is Extinction Rebellion and what are its aims? The Brazilian embassy, Piccadilly Circus and the Department for International Trade (DIT) were also targeted, with thousands listening to speeches and parading through the streets. The group gave the DIT a mock award for ""making an outstandingly awful contribution to climate change"" and the embassy gathering was ""to show solidarity with indigenous people in the Amazon rainforest"". The table, which hadpreviously been erected in Seven Dials, represents an invitation to ""come to the table"" for discussions about fossil fuel. Chairs were left empty to represent an invitation to all those who identify as female, nonbinary or trans. Extinction Rebellion coordinate these actions very carefully. Just after 14:00 BST about 50 female protestors converged on the road junction at the centre of Oxford Circus. A van drew up, the back doors were flung open, and women began to unload what looked like giant pieces of pink Lego. Quickly they began to assemble these in the middle of the road. At the same time, 30 or so women formed a circle and superglued their hands together. Others lay down in the road and padlocked themselves together with locks inside steel tubes. The idea is to make it as difficult and as time consuming as possible for the police to dismantle the protest. Within minutes, dozens of police officers arrived, charging into the middle of the group amid screams from the protesters. And the now familiar stand-off began, with police gradually tightening their cordons until - probably early tomorrow morning - they will go in and clear the remaining protesters from the streets. The demonstrations are planned to continue next week The demonstrations are planned to continue next week, when the activists will protest against the links between ""big finance, fossil fuels and the fossil of politics that is Westminster"".

Doctors told to ration blood tests,"New GP guidance says regular blood tests should be staggered if clinically safe Family GPs are being told to ""ration"" non-essential blood analysis due to a test tube shortage. The vials used to collect samples to be sent to labs for testing are made in the US. BD, which makes the vials for the NHS across the UK, has warned of serious supply chain issues due to the pandemic and transportation issues. NHS Wales has issued guidelines which include a temporary pause of a number of blood tests. The Aneurin Bevan Health Board has written to GPs in its area telling them to halve the number of blood tests they carry out. ""It's not something I've come across before,"" said one GP, who didn't want to be named. Their surgery has had to postpone routine blood tests for patients who usually have an annual medication or chronic disease review. They will continue at the moment for patients who clinically need them. Heart app aims to cut NHS waiting lists in Wales Â£551m extra funding for NHS and social care Rebuilding Wales' NHS 'could be bigger challenge than pandemic' ""Until the bottles run out, we will continue to carry out blood tests for those who clinically need them,"" the doctor said. BD said the shortage was being driven by the need for the tubes for testing Covid patients as well as routine testing for procedures that had been delayed due to the pandemic. It said it was also facing ""transportation challenges that have affected all industries, including port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges"". It is manufacturing at optimal levels to improve supply availability and has invested in manufacturing capacity expansion, it added. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the new clinical guidance was to preserve supplies for urgent cases. ""Patient safety remains the priority, and a test would only be delayed if the NHS have assessed it is clinically safe to do so,"" she said. ""People who require urgent care should continue to seek it as normal."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the new clinical guidance was to preserve supplies for urgent cases The new guidance says GPs can ""reduce non-essential testing"" including vitamin D testing, and deferring routine infertility testing unless the patient is over 35. It says allergy testing is ""not a priority at this time unless there is clinical need"" and routine wellness screening is ""not a priority"". NHS England has temporarily stopped some screening for infertility, pre-diabetes and allergies. The new GP guidance says regular blood tests should be staggered if clinically safe and general practices in Wales have been advised to not stockpile vials. They have also been told to not carry out blood tests at the surgery if patients are being referred on to hospital for further treatment. Tests for patients at immediate high risk will be prioritised for the next three months. This includes patients with conditions where tests might affect how it is treated. BMA Cymru, which represents doctors, has worked with the Welsh government and NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership on guidance on how to conserve supplies. It is worried about balancing the effect of the shortage with the patients' needs and that it could lead to a backlog of cases after the pandemic. BMA Cymru worked with the Welsh government on guidance on how to conserve supplies BMA Cymru chairman, Dr David Bailey, said ""We've got a massive shortage across the UK for the next two or three months. ""We rely on these bottles for almost all of the blood tests that we do for patients, both in general practice and in hospitals, so we're going to have to ration them essentially. ""Patient care will be impacted and while we hope that impact will be minimal, we're coming out of a massive pandemic and have a big backlog of work. ""The very last thing we need is to push more work down the line, because we haven't actually got the tools to do the job."" Diabetes Cymru's Joshua James said blood tests were ""essential"" in diagnosing type 2 diabetes. He said: ""It is very important that those previously identified by their GP as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes receive their annual checks, including checking their blood glucose levels,  and do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue."" NHS Wales said it and the Welsh government were working closely with other nations to source alternatives to affected products.

LiveLiveNo need to restart vaccine programme - JCVI memberLess than a minute ago,"There is no need to restart the UK's vaccine programme, government adviser Adam Finn says He was speaking after a study showed waning protection for the double-jabbed Scottish deputy first minister wants to avoid school closures 'at all costs' as cases hit record high Report into Covid origin ordered by Joe Biden 'inconclusive', reports say Japan extends state of emergency into eight more regions as Paralympics begin Oregon becomes first US state to re-introduce outdoor mask mandate New South Wales in Australia reports record Covid cases, despite lockdowns The UK recorded another 30,838 cases on Monday, and 174 deaths Edited by Owen Amos We're wrapping up our live coronavirus coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of some of the main stories we've been reporting on. As ever, do scroll down for the full story on what's been going on.  Today's live page was edited by Owen Amos and Hamish Mackay. The writers were Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Katie Wright. There have been another 35,847 coronavirus cases recorded in the UK - a rise from 30,838 the previous day. And there have been a further 149 deaths of people who had tested positive in the previous 28 days. On Tuesday, 174 deaths were reported. Scientists have previously said there is a ""strong association"" between the early outbreak and the sale of live animals in a market Authors of the World Health Organization (WHO) report into how coronavirus emerged are warning that time is running out for their inquiry. They're calling for international leaders and the scientific community to help speed up the follow-up research on where Covid-19 came from. In their comments, in the Nature journal, the members of the joint WHO-China team point out the report was published in March - and that it was ""meant to be the first step in a process that has stalled"". ""The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast: any delay will render some of the studies biologically impossible,"" say the authors. ""Understanding the origins of a devastating pandemic is a global priority, grounded in science."" They say opportunities are decreasing because Covid-19 antibodies wane, so it becomes more difficult with time to get samples from those who might have been exposed before December 2019. A separate intelligence report into the origins of the pandemic, requested by US President Joe Biden, is inconclusive,US media reports say. We mentioned earlier that Scotland has had another record day for reported Covid cases. Now, NHS Highlandhas warnedof a ""large number of outbreaks"" in schools in its area. The health board, which covers the Highlands and Argyll and Bute, says about 60 schools have been affected so far. There have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week. NHS Highland says this represents almost 10% of its total cases since the start of the pandemic. We mentioned that Prof Ravindra Gupta, who advises the government on Covid, has been speaking to the BBC. In his interview, he also says he'd like children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated. ""I think personally, yes, I think certainly individuals of the age of 12 and above. Twelve to 18 certainly,"" he says.
""I think that for younger children, I think a sort of further discussion would need to be had, but we need to start with the older children first."" As things stand, everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine. Children aged 12-15 who are clinically vulnerable to Covid, or live with adults who have greater health risks, are also being invited to get a jab.There are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of that age. Prof Gupta adds he'd also like those who are immune-suppressed and the over-80s to get booster jabs. Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach (left) watching a Paralympics event Japan's top medical adviser has criticised the president of the International Olympic Committee for visiting Tokyo again when the country is expanding emergency curbs to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Japan will expand states of emergency to eight more prefectures from Friday, taking the total to 21 regions from Hokkaido in the north to the southern island of Okinawa and covering nearly 80% of its population. Dr Shigeru Omi suggests Olympics president Thomas Bach's decision to fly into Japan again for this week's Paralympics opening ceremony has undermined efforts to persuade people to avoid travel and work from home. In response, the IOC says Bach's visit has been authorised by the Japanese government and is meant to show support for Paralympic athletes. Scotland has recorded more than 5,000 Covid cases in the past 24 hours - the highest figure for a single day since the pandemic began. The government figures show a rise of 698 from the previous day - which had been a record itself - taking the total to 5,021. There have also been five deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged the ""sharp rise"" in cases - but notes the percentage testing positive is lower than the previous day, reflecting the fact more tests have been done. ""Vaccines still protecting against serious illness, but we all need to take care and act in a way that minimises risk of getting/spreading the virus,"" she adds. Hospital admissions have risen in Scotland too, for the fifth day in a row. It is ""realistic"" to say there will be a ""significant"" surge in coronavirus infections as schools return and people attend summer festivals, an expert advising the government on the virus has told the BBC. Prof Ravindra Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, says: ""Of course there is going to be an associated surge in cases, given that the young people in these events are largely going to be unvaccinated. ""So that's just something that is predictable and will happen, despite best efforts."" He adds that when the government carried out pilot music events earlier this year, the Delta variant was not dominant and community transmission was relatively low. Those pilot events were concluded to lead to ""no substantial outbreaks"" - but Prof Gupta says if a study were to be carried out now, ""you may find something different"". We reported earlier this week thatmore than 4,000 Covid casescould be linked to a music and surfing festival in Cornwall. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The Chinese newspaper Global Times has today
slammed reports from earlier this month by theWashington Post,externaland theWall Street Journal,externalthat suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in a Wuhan laboratory. Global Times says the articles,which cited a US Republican congressional report,external, featured âjaw dropping mistakesâ and says this
âcould be the âtip of the icebergâ in the US made-up evidence in framing China
on the virus-origins tracing issueâ. China has repeatedly stressed that the joint China-WHO
investigation into the origin of the coronavirus earlier this year concluded by
saying that it was âextremely unlikelyâ the virus had spread from a lab leak. However, in May, US president Joe Biden ordered a 90-day
probe into whether the virus came from a lab accident, or emerged from human
contact with an infected animal. As this probe draws to a close, Chinese media have been
increasingly pumping out articles criticising the US for âpoliticisingâ the
origin of the coronavirus. At the same time, they have gone on the offensive,
and pushed a counter theory suggesting that the virus was madeand leaked from a US military base. US media are reporting that the Biden-ordered report - which has not been published -is likely to be inconclusive. There has been a push to boost vaccinate rates in Sydney, Australia Sydney reported a daily record of 838 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, amid a growing Delta variant outbreak in Australia. Despite two months of lockdowns in Sydney, the wider New South Wales state reported 919 new cases, taking Australia's daily case numbers to just below 1,000 - a new high. The rise has put parts of the health
system under pressure in Sydney, which has a total of 113 people in intensive
care. Australia has locked down more than
half of its 25 million population - including its largest cities, Sydney and
Melbourne - as it tries to tackle a third wave of the virus. The country is also accelerating its
vaccine rollout. Around 31% of people aged over 16 have been fully vaccinated, while 54% have had at
least one dose. US Vice President Kamala Harris says the US will donate one million vaccines to Vietnam Vietnam has reported a record 12,096
new Covid cases, with most of those coming in Ho Chi Minh City, the epicentre of
the countryâs outbreak. The South East Asian country has so far
recorded more than 380,000 cases - 99.6% of which have been detected since May
this year. Vietnam successfully contained coronavirus
for most of last year, but since April has been dealing with a sizeable outbreak
in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the Delta variant. Just 2% of its population of 98
million people have been vaccinated, among the lowest in Asia, after its
government opted for a containment policy. Earlier today US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on a visit to Vietnam, announced the US will donate one million Pfizer doses to the country. Hospitals in Switzerland could be overrun by a rising number of serious cases within weeks, the federal government has warned. The government is considering ordering staff and visitors to show a Covid-19 certificate - providing proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test result - in most public indoor spaces, The requirement would cover events, as well as restaurants,bars and recreational sites like cinemas and museums, as well assports centres and cultural activities, said the government. ""If hospital admissions continue to rise as strongly as theyhave recently, hospital overload cannot be ruled out in just afew weeks,"" the federal government said in a statement. ""The government has therefore decided on a precautionarybasis to consult the cantons and social partners on strengthenedmeasures against the spread of the coronavirus,"" it said. Switzerland is being hit by a fourth wave of the coronaviruswith a ""very worrying"" rise in infections, the head of thegovernment's crisis team said on Tuesday. The number of new infections in Switzerland and neighbour Liechtensteinrose by 3,212 on Wednesday,external, taking the total above 765,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll is nearing 10,500. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst President Tsai Ing-wen gets Taiwan's domestically-produced vaccine, Medigen, on Monday Taiwan has recorded no new local cases of Covid-19 for the first time since 9 May. Taiwan - which has a population of more than 23 million - saw a huge outbreak in the middle of May that led to
more than 800 deaths. Before this outbreak, there had been only 12 deaths since
the start of the pandemic. At its peak, Taiwan was recording more than 500 confirmed
local cases a day. This huge outbreak led to all but essential businesses
closing, and a mask mandate being implemented. Most cases were recorded in
northern Taiwan, in New Taipei and Taipei City. However, today, life in Taiwan looks a lot more normal.
Venues are allowed to host 80 people indoors, and 300 outdoors. Yesterday, indoor amusement parks and water parks were given the green light to
reopen again for the first time. And students are allowed to start back in the
classroom from September. Nightclubs, bars and video games venues remain closed, however. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This study on waning vaccine effectivenessonce again
illustrates why we need to get used to Covid circulating. This is not a virus thatâs
going to go away. The vaccines do not work like
they do for measles which provide life-long immunity. Immunity was always expected
to wane. And another factor to
consider is that repeated exposure to the virus is likely to increase the risk
of a breakthrough infection â the increased likelihood over time of infection
post-jabbing may not be all related to waning immunity. Whatever the cause though, experts have been clear we should expect to be repeatedly infected over our
lifetimes. The important thing is that
each re-infection should be milder as the vaccines remain highly effective at
preventing serious illness. What the vaccines have
effectively done is taken the edge off the virus â given our immune system a
head-start so those early infections are milder than they would have been for
most. Whatâs not clear yet is the
merits of offering the most vulnerable a booster jab. It is likely to be a fine
judgement call as there are so many unknowns â although the expectation is some
will be offered it. Japan has decided to extend a virus state of emergency
to eight more regions as rising coronavirus infections put hospitals under
pressure. It comes a day after the opening ceremony for the Paralympics, which runs until 5 September, was
held in Tokyo. ""Maintaining the health system is
the top priority to protect the lives of citizens,"" Prime Minister
Yoshihide Suga said after announcing the extension. Months of emergency curbs in the capital, Tokyo, and
surrounding areas have failed to reverse a surge in infections and about 90% of
the city's critical care beds are occupied. Japan, which reported 21,561 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, will expand the states of emergency from Friday,
taking the total to 21 regions - from Hokkaido in the north to the southern
island of Okinawa - and covering nearly 80% of its population. A US intelligence report requested by President Biden into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic is inconclusive, US media reports say. Agencies are reportedly divided on whether the virus - first seen in China - was the result of a natural spillover from animal to human or was caused by a laboratory accident. A summary of the report is expected to be published in the coming days. In May President Biden gave the US intelligence agencies 90 days to assess the data and produce a report that ""could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"" on the virus's origins. Intelligence that several researchers at the Wuhan lab were hospitalised in November 2019, and China's refusal to allow a thorough investigation into the lab theory, is said to have prompted Mr Biden's decision. Hospitals in Houston, Texas, are struggling to cope with a surge in cases The powerful US gun rights group, the
National Rifle Association, has cancelled its annual meeting because of a rise
in Covid-19 infections in Texas. The conference was due to be held next week, but the group decided to scrap it ""after analysing
relevant data regarding Covid-19 in Harris County, Texas"". ""We are mindful that NRA Annual
Meeting patrons will return home to family, friends and co-workers from all
over the country, so any impacts from the virus could have broader implications,""
the group said in a statement. The NRA's yearly Meeting &
Exhibits event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees from across the
country for several days of social gatherings, assemblies and firearms
displays. The US government's massive
vaccination effort is facing resistance in politically conservative states like
Texas, where many are also reluctant to wear masks. People in Oregon protesting against Covid vaccines Masks will have to be worn outside in the
US state of Oregon from Friday as the country grapples with a surge in Covid-19
cases. The announcement by the stateâs
governor makes the north-western state the first in the US to reintroduce the
rule. ""The Delta variant is spreading
fast and wide, throwing our state into a level of crisis we have not yet seen
in the pandemic,"" said governor Kate Brown. ""Cases and hospitalisations are at a record high.â The rules mean everyone - whether vaccinated
or not - must wear a mask in any public place where people from different
households are mixing. Oregon, along with other states,
already requires the wearing of masks indoors, but it is the first to require them
routinely outside. Around half of all Americans are fully vaccinated, although take-up varies considerably from region to region. The effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines against infection dropped from 91% before the Delta variant became dominant to 66% afterwards, according to a large study of health workers in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been examining the performance of the two vaccines since they were authorised among healthcare staff and other frontline workers. Thousands of workers across six states were tested weekly and upon onset of Covid-19 symptoms, allowing researchers to estimate efficacy. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 91% in the initial study period of 14 December 2020 to 10 April 2021. But during weeks in the run-up to 14 August, when the more contagious Delta variant became dominant, effectiveness fell to 66%. The report's authors said there were a number of caveats, including that the protection from vaccines could be waning over time anyway, and the 66% estimate was based on a relatively short study period with few infections. As we have been reporting today, a UK study has found that protection against infection in peoplewho have been double-jabbed seems to fade over time.  Premier Foods, the owner of Mr Kipling cakes, has told its 800 office staff members they will be able to decide where they work,as it adopts a new hybrid model. The offer applies to staff at its St Albans head office, as well as its Manchester, Lutterworth, Southampton, and High Wycombe locations. David Wilkinson, group HR director, said: ""Work is a verb, not a place, and whether it's for a meeting or just personal preference, our office remains open for anyone who wants to use it."" The changes will not apply to Premier's 4,000 factory workers. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

There have been another 35,847 coronavirus cases recorded in the UK - a rise from 30,838 the previous day. And there have been a further 149 deaths of people who had tested positive in the previous 28 days. On Tuesday, 174 deaths were reported. Scientists have previously said there is a ""strong association"" between the early outbreak and the sale of live animals in a market Authors of the World Health Organization (WHO) report into how coronavirus emerged are warning that time is running out for their inquiry. They're calling for international leaders and the scientific community to help speed up the follow-up research on where Covid-19 came from. In their comments, in the Nature journal, the members of the joint WHO-China team point out the report was published in March - and that it was ""meant to be the first step in a process that has stalled"". ""The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast: any delay will render some of the studies biologically impossible,"" say the authors. ""Understanding the origins of a devastating pandemic is a global priority, grounded in science."" They say opportunities are decreasing because Covid-19 antibodies wane, so it becomes more difficult with time to get samples from those who might have been exposed before December 2019. A separate intelligence report into the origins of the pandemic, requested by US President Joe Biden, is inconclusive,US media reports say. We mentioned earlier that Scotland has had another record day for reported Covid cases. Now, NHS Highlandhas warnedof a ""large number of outbreaks"" in schools in its area. The health board, which covers the Highlands and Argyll and Bute, says about 60 schools have been affected so far. There have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week. NHS Highland says this represents almost 10% of its total cases since the start of the pandemic. We mentioned that Prof Ravindra Gupta, who advises the government on Covid, has been speaking to the BBC. In his interview, he also says he'd like children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated. ""I think personally, yes, I think certainly individuals of the age of 12 and above. Twelve to 18 certainly,"" he says.
""I think that for younger children, I think a sort of further discussion would need to be had, but we need to start with the older children first."" As things stand, everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine. Children aged 12-15 who are clinically vulnerable to Covid, or live with adults who have greater health risks, are also being invited to get a jab.There are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of that age. Prof Gupta adds he'd also like those who are immune-suppressed and the over-80s to get booster jabs. Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach (left) watching a Paralympics event Japan's top medical adviser has criticised the president of the International Olympic Committee for visiting Tokyo again when the country is expanding emergency curbs to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Japan will expand states of emergency to eight more prefectures from Friday, taking the total to 21 regions from Hokkaido in the north to the southern island of Okinawa and covering nearly 80% of its population. Dr Shigeru Omi suggests Olympics president Thomas Bach's decision to fly into Japan again for this week's Paralympics opening ceremony has undermined efforts to persuade people to avoid travel and work from home. In response, the IOC says Bach's visit has been authorised by the Japanese government and is meant to show support for Paralympic athletes. Scotland has recorded more than 5,000 Covid cases in the past 24 hours - the highest figure for a single day since the pandemic began. The government figures show a rise of 698 from the previous day - which had been a record itself - taking the total to 5,021. There have also been five deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged the ""sharp rise"" in cases - but notes the percentage testing positive is lower than the previous day, reflecting the fact more tests have been done. ""Vaccines still protecting against serious illness, but we all need to take care and act in a way that minimises risk of getting/spreading the virus,"" she adds. Hospital admissions have risen in Scotland too, for the fifth day in a row. It is ""realistic"" to say there will be a ""significant"" surge in coronavirus infections as schools return and people attend summer festivals, an expert advising the government on the virus has told the BBC. Prof Ravindra Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, says: ""Of course there is going to be an associated surge in cases, given that the young people in these events are largely going to be unvaccinated. ""So that's just something that is predictable and will happen, despite best efforts."" He adds that when the government carried out pilot music events earlier this year, the Delta variant was not dominant and community transmission was relatively low. Those pilot events were concluded to lead to ""no substantial outbreaks"" - but Prof Gupta says if a study were to be carried out now, ""you may find something different"". We reported earlier this week thatmore than 4,000 Covid casescould be linked to a music and surfing festival in Cornwall. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The Chinese newspaper Global Times has today
slammed reports from earlier this month by theWashington Post,externaland theWall Street Journal,externalthat suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in a Wuhan laboratory. Global Times says the articles,which cited a US Republican congressional report,external, featured âjaw dropping mistakesâ and says this
âcould be the âtip of the icebergâ in the US made-up evidence in framing China
on the virus-origins tracing issueâ. China has repeatedly stressed that the joint China-WHO
investigation into the origin of the coronavirus earlier this year concluded by
saying that it was âextremely unlikelyâ the virus had spread from a lab leak. However, in May, US president Joe Biden ordered a 90-day
probe into whether the virus came from a lab accident, or emerged from human
contact with an infected animal. As this probe draws to a close, Chinese media have been
increasingly pumping out articles criticising the US for âpoliticisingâ the
origin of the coronavirus. At the same time, they have gone on the offensive,
and pushed a counter theory suggesting that the virus was madeand leaked from a US military base. US media are reporting that the Biden-ordered report - which has not been published -is likely to be inconclusive. There has been a push to boost vaccinate rates in Sydney, Australia Sydney reported a daily record of 838 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, amid a growing Delta variant outbreak in Australia. Despite two months of lockdowns in Sydney, the wider New South Wales state reported 919 new cases, taking Australia's daily case numbers to just below 1,000 - a new high. The rise has put parts of the health
system under pressure in Sydney, which has a total of 113 people in intensive
care. Australia has locked down more than
half of its 25 million population - including its largest cities, Sydney and
Melbourne - as it tries to tackle a third wave of the virus. The country is also accelerating its
vaccine rollout. Around 31% of people aged over 16 have been fully vaccinated, while 54% have had at
least one dose. US Vice President Kamala Harris says the US will donate one million vaccines to Vietnam Vietnam has reported a record 12,096
new Covid cases, with most of those coming in Ho Chi Minh City, the epicentre of
the countryâs outbreak. The South East Asian country has so far
recorded more than 380,000 cases - 99.6% of which have been detected since May
this year. Vietnam successfully contained coronavirus
for most of last year, but since April has been dealing with a sizeable outbreak
in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the Delta variant. Just 2% of its population of 98
million people have been vaccinated, among the lowest in Asia, after its
government opted for a containment policy. Earlier today US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on a visit to Vietnam, announced the US will donate one million Pfizer doses to the country. Hospitals in Switzerland could be overrun by a rising number of serious cases within weeks, the federal government has warned. The government is considering ordering staff and visitors to show a Covid-19 certificate - providing proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test result - in most public indoor spaces, The requirement would cover events, as well as restaurants,bars and recreational sites like cinemas and museums, as well assports centres and cultural activities, said the government. ""If hospital admissions continue to rise as strongly as theyhave recently, hospital overload cannot be ruled out in just afew weeks,"" the federal government said in a statement. ""The government has therefore decided on a precautionarybasis to consult the cantons and social partners on strengthenedmeasures against the spread of the coronavirus,"" it said. Switzerland is being hit by a fourth wave of the coronaviruswith a ""very worrying"" rise in infections, the head of thegovernment's crisis team said on Tuesday. The number of new infections in Switzerland and neighbour Liechtensteinrose by 3,212 on Wednesday,external, taking the total above 765,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll is nearing 10,500. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst President Tsai Ing-wen gets Taiwan's domestically-produced vaccine, Medigen, on Monday Taiwan has recorded no new local cases of Covid-19 for the first time since 9 May. Taiwan - which has a population of more than 23 million - saw a huge outbreak in the middle of May that led to
more than 800 deaths. Before this outbreak, there had been only 12 deaths since
the start of the pandemic. At its peak, Taiwan was recording more than 500 confirmed
local cases a day. This huge outbreak led to all but essential businesses
closing, and a mask mandate being implemented. Most cases were recorded in
northern Taiwan, in New Taipei and Taipei City. However, today, life in Taiwan looks a lot more normal.
Venues are allowed to host 80 people indoors, and 300 outdoors. Yesterday, indoor amusement parks and water parks were given the green light to
reopen again for the first time. And students are allowed to start back in the
classroom from September. Nightclubs, bars and video games venues remain closed, however. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This study on waning vaccine effectivenessonce again
illustrates why we need to get used to Covid circulating. This is not a virus thatâs
going to go away. The vaccines do not work like
they do for measles which provide life-long immunity. Immunity was always expected
to wane. And another factor to
consider is that repeated exposure to the virus is likely to increase the risk
of a breakthrough infection â the increased likelihood over time of infection
post-jabbing may not be all related to waning immunity. Whatever the cause though, experts have been clear we should expect to be repeatedly infected over our
lifetimes. The important thing is that
each re-infection should be milder as the vaccines remain highly effective at
preventing serious illness. What the vaccines have
effectively done is taken the edge off the virus â given our immune system a
head-start so those early infections are milder than they would have been for
most. Whatâs not clear yet is the
merits of offering the most vulnerable a booster jab. It is likely to be a fine
judgement call as there are so many unknowns â although the expectation is some
will be offered it. Japan has decided to extend a virus state of emergency
to eight more regions as rising coronavirus infections put hospitals under
pressure. It comes a day after the opening ceremony for the Paralympics, which runs until 5 September, was
held in Tokyo. ""Maintaining the health system is
the top priority to protect the lives of citizens,"" Prime Minister
Yoshihide Suga said after announcing the extension. Months of emergency curbs in the capital, Tokyo, and
surrounding areas have failed to reverse a surge in infections and about 90% of
the city's critical care beds are occupied. Japan, which reported 21,561 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, will expand the states of emergency from Friday,
taking the total to 21 regions - from Hokkaido in the north to the southern
island of Okinawa - and covering nearly 80% of its population. A US intelligence report requested by President Biden into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic is inconclusive, US media reports say. Agencies are reportedly divided on whether the virus - first seen in China - was the result of a natural spillover from animal to human or was caused by a laboratory accident. A summary of the report is expected to be published in the coming days. In May President Biden gave the US intelligence agencies 90 days to assess the data and produce a report that ""could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"" on the virus's origins. Intelligence that several researchers at the Wuhan lab were hospitalised in November 2019, and China's refusal to allow a thorough investigation into the lab theory, is said to have prompted Mr Biden's decision. Hospitals in Houston, Texas, are struggling to cope with a surge in cases The powerful US gun rights group, the
National Rifle Association, has cancelled its annual meeting because of a rise
in Covid-19 infections in Texas. The conference was due to be held next week, but the group decided to scrap it ""after analysing
relevant data regarding Covid-19 in Harris County, Texas"". ""We are mindful that NRA Annual
Meeting patrons will return home to family, friends and co-workers from all
over the country, so any impacts from the virus could have broader implications,""
the group said in a statement. The NRA's yearly Meeting &
Exhibits event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees from across the
country for several days of social gatherings, assemblies and firearms
displays. The US government's massive
vaccination effort is facing resistance in politically conservative states like
Texas, where many are also reluctant to wear masks. People in Oregon protesting against Covid vaccines Masks will have to be worn outside in the
US state of Oregon from Friday as the country grapples with a surge in Covid-19
cases. The announcement by the stateâs
governor makes the north-western state the first in the US to reintroduce the
rule. ""The Delta variant is spreading
fast and wide, throwing our state into a level of crisis we have not yet seen
in the pandemic,"" said governor Kate Brown. ""Cases and hospitalisations are at a record high.â The rules mean everyone - whether vaccinated
or not - must wear a mask in any public place where people from different
households are mixing. Oregon, along with other states,
already requires the wearing of masks indoors, but it is the first to require them
routinely outside. Around half of all Americans are fully vaccinated, although take-up varies considerably from region to region. The effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines against infection dropped from 91% before the Delta variant became dominant to 66% afterwards, according to a large study of health workers in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been examining the performance of the two vaccines since they were authorised among healthcare staff and other frontline workers. Thousands of workers across six states were tested weekly and upon onset of Covid-19 symptoms, allowing researchers to estimate efficacy. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 91% in the initial study period of 14 December 2020 to 10 April 2021. But during weeks in the run-up to 14 August, when the more contagious Delta variant became dominant, effectiveness fell to 66%. The report's authors said there were a number of caveats, including that the protection from vaccines could be waning over time anyway, and the 66% estimate was based on a relatively short study period with few infections. As we have been reporting today, a UK study has found that protection against infection in peoplewho have been double-jabbed seems to fade over time.  Premier Foods, the owner of Mr Kipling cakes, has told its 800 office staff members they will be able to decide where they work,as it adopts a new hybrid model. The offer applies to staff at its St Albans head office, as well as its Manchester, Lutterworth, Southampton, and High Wycombe locations. David Wilkinson, group HR director, said: ""Work is a verb, not a place, and whether it's for a meeting or just personal preference, our office remains open for anyone who wants to use it."" The changes will not apply to Premier's 4,000 factory workers. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Supermarket bosses warn over Christmas suppliesBut Tesco's chairman says don't ""overdramatise"" lorry driver crisis, as Iceland warns problem getting worse.","The boss of supermarket Iceland says the supply chain chaos is getting worse, just as retailers start planning for the key Christmas period. Richard Walker told the BBC he estimated the UK's shortage of lorry drivers was now about 100,000, with the company itself about 100 short. Tesco boss John Allan said ""there may be some shortages"", but people should not ""over-dramatise"" and panic-buy. ""It's very easy to make a drama out of a modest crisis,"" he told the BBC. The continuing shortage of HGV drivers is starting to make retailers nervous, as they are about to start planning for the key trading period. The government said there was a ""highly resilient"" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage. But Mr Walker said: ""The reason for sounding the alarm now is that we've already had one Christmas cancelled at the last minute. ""I'd hate this one to be problematic as well,"" he added. ""We start to stock-build from September onwards for what is a hugely important time of year,"" he added. ""We've got a lot of goods to transport between now and Christmas and a strong supply chain is vital for everyone."" Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told How serious is the HGV driver shortage? ""The driver shortage is impacting the food supply chain on a daily basis and leading to shortages on the shelves,"" Mr Walker said. ""We've had deliveries cancelled for the first time since the pandemic began, about 30 to 40 deliveries a day."" The simple solution he said, was for heavy goods vehicle drivers to be added to the UK's skilled workers list, to help get drivers recruited from overseas. ""These men and women, these HGV drivers, have kept the show on the road for 18 months during the pandemic and it's criminal that we're not viewing them as skilled workers,"" he told the BBC. Asked if Brexit is responsible for the supply chain problems, Mr Walker responded: ""I think so, but it's a 'self-inflicted wound' rather than an inevitable consequence of Brexit, caused by the government's failure to appreciate the importance of HGV drivers and the work they do for us."" Tesco chairman Mr Allan echoed the warnings, but felt the situation was unlikely to develop into a crisis. ""There may be some shortages at Christmas, but I wouldn't want to overdramatise the extent to which that would be the case."" He said that normally, the supermarket industry would start building stocks now in readiness for Christmas, but ""at the moment we're running very hard just to keep on top of the existing demand and there isn't the capacity to build stocks that we would like to see"". He said Tesco, like all its rivals, was ""very short of drivers"". Firms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers. Steve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, warned that current food shortages were ""at a worse level than at any time I have seen"". He told the Times that the Co-op had significantly reduced its range of some products to help serve customers. Mr Murrells said the disruption to supply had been driven by ""Brexit and issues caused by Covid"" and the firm was retraining staff as lorry drivers to help fill vacant roles. A government spokesperson said: ""We have a highly resilient food supply chain. We have well-established ways of working with the food sector and are working closely with them to ensure businesses have the labour they need. ""We have put in place a package of measures to tackle the HGV driver shortage. Additionally, our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work. As part of this, we are streamlining the process for people to get their HGV licence."" Tesco has been offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. On Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem. Problems with shipping goods in from overseas could also hit Christmas, according to toy retailer boss Gary Grant. The chairman of The Entertainertold the Mail Online,externalthat he had to contend with shortages of containers to bring goods in from Asia and a jump in shipping costs. ""What is unique to us is that Christmas is a fixed date, so we are under extreme pressure at the moment to move as much stock as we can, but are significantly behind with the shipment of products,"" he said. ""There's not a shortage of toys, but what will happen as when we get nearer to Christmas, the suppliers will not have back-up stock that we've previously relied upon. So the range of stock we have may be narrower."" He warned that popular toys such as Paw Patrol, Barbie and Rainbocorns could be in short supply.

OnlyFans suspends policy change after backlashThe platform had sparked controversy when it revealed plans to ban sex workers from its platform.Technology,"OnlyFans has announced that it will delay making changes to policy on content creation, following a widespread backlash by its users. The content subscription service announced plans last week toblock sexually explicit photos and videos from October. On Wednesday, it tweeted that it has ""suspended the planned 1 October policy change"". It is currently unclear if the delay will be permanent. OnlyFans wrote on twitter that it would ""continue to provide a home for all creators"". ""Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard,"" said the company. ""We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned 1 October policy change. ""OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators."" And in an email to its content creators, it said: ""The proposed 1 October 2021 changes are no longer required, due to banking partners' assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators. ""OnlyFans is committed to providing a safe and dependable platform for all creators and their fans."" One OnlyFans creator, from London, welcomed the announcement but said those who had already found new homes for their content may still not return. ""So it is short-term good news for sex workers reliant on the platform - and I would like to see this as the start of increased support, celebration and championing of sex-worker rights by OnlyFans,"" he told BBC News. OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos Under the skin of OnlyFans OnlyFans must act on underage use, watchdog says ""But I think there may well have been enough anxiety caused to see many models continuing the move to other platforms."" OnlyFans makes its money by taking 20% of all payments made to its content creators. The platform reported a 75% increase in new creators in May last year, during lockdown. Wariness from investors was originally claimed to be the reason for last week's announcement. But founder Tim Stokely blamed banks penalising the company for supporting sex workers. ""JPMorgan Chase is particularly aggressive in closing accounts of sex workers or...â any business that supports sex workers,"" he told theFinancial Times,externalon Tuesday. But a JPMorgan spokeswoman told BBC News it had ""no such policy"". In June, a BBC News investigation foundchildren had used fake ID to set up accounts on the site. And the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop under-age users. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.

probe into whether the virus came from a lab accident, or emerged from human
contact with an infected animal. As this probe draws to a close, Chinese media have been
increasingly pumping out articles criticising the US for âpoliticisingâ the
origin of the coronavirus. At the same time, they have gone on the offensive,
and pushed a counter theory suggesting that the virus was madeand leaked from a US military base. US media are reporting that the Biden-ordered report - which has not been published -is likely to be inconclusive. There has been a push to boost vaccinate rates in Sydney, Australia Sydney reported a daily record of 838 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, amid a growing Delta variant outbreak in Australia. Despite two months of lockdowns in Sydney, the wider New South Wales state reported 919 new cases, taking Australia's daily case numbers to just below 1,000 - a new high. The rise has put parts of the health
system under pressure in Sydney, which has a total of 113 people in intensive
care. Australia has locked down more than
half of its 25 million population - including its largest cities, Sydney and
Melbourne - as it tries to tackle a third wave of the virus. The country is also accelerating its
vaccine rollout. Around 31% of people aged over 16 have been fully vaccinated, while 54% have had at
least one dose. US Vice President Kamala Harris says the US will donate one million vaccines to Vietnam Vietnam has reported a record 12,096
new Covid cases, with most of those coming in Ho Chi Minh City, the epicentre of
the countryâs outbreak. The South East Asian country has so far
recorded more than 380,000 cases - 99.6% of which have been detected since May
this year. Vietnam successfully contained coronavirus
for most of last year, but since April has been dealing with a sizeable outbreak
in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the Delta variant. Just 2% of its population of 98
million people have been vaccinated, among the lowest in Asia, after its
government opted for a containment policy. Earlier today US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on a visit to Vietnam, announced the US will donate one million Pfizer doses to the country. Hospitals in Switzerland could be overrun by a rising number of serious cases within weeks, the federal government has warned. The government is considering ordering staff and visitors to show a Covid-19 certificate - providing proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test result - in most public indoor spaces, The requirement would cover events, as well as restaurants,bars and recreational sites like cinemas and museums, as well assports centres and cultural activities, said the government. ""If hospital admissions continue to rise as strongly as theyhave recently, hospital overload cannot be ruled out in just afew weeks,"" the federal government said in a statement. ""The government has therefore decided on a precautionarybasis to consult the cantons and social partners on strengthenedmeasures against the spread of the coronavirus,"" it said. Switzerland is being hit by a fourth wave of the coronaviruswith a ""very worrying"" rise in infections, the head of thegovernment's crisis team said on Tuesday. The number of new infections in Switzerland and neighbour Liechtensteinrose by 3,212 on Wednesday,external, taking the total above 765,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll is nearing 10,500. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst President Tsai Ing-wen gets Taiwan's domestically-produced vaccine, Medigen, on Monday Taiwan has recorded no new local cases of Covid-19 for the first time since 9 May. Taiwan - which has a population of more than 23 million - saw a huge outbreak in the middle of May that led to
more than 800 deaths. Before this outbreak, there had been only 12 deaths since
the start of the pandemic. At its peak, Taiwan was recording more than 500 confirmed
local cases a day. This huge outbreak led to all but essential businesses
closing, and a mask mandate being implemented. Most cases were recorded in
northern Taiwan, in New Taipei and Taipei City. However, today, life in Taiwan looks a lot more normal.
Venues are allowed to host 80 people indoors, and 300 outdoors. Yesterday, indoor amusement parks and water parks were given the green light to
reopen again for the first time. And students are allowed to start back in the
classroom from September. Nightclubs, bars and video games venues remain closed, however. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This study on waning vaccine effectivenessonce again
illustrates why we need to get used to Covid circulating. This is not a virus thatâs
going to go away. The vaccines do not work like
they do for measles which provide life-long immunity. Immunity was always expected
to wane. And another factor to
consider is that repeated exposure to the virus is likely to increase the risk
of a breakthrough infection â the increased likelihood over time of infection
post-jabbing may not be all related to waning immunity. Whatever the cause though, experts have been clear we should expect to be repeatedly infected over our
lifetimes. The important thing is that
each re-infection should be milder as the vaccines remain highly effective at
preventing serious illness. What the vaccines have
effectively done is taken the edge off the virus â given our immune system a
head-start so those early infections are milder than they would have been for
most. Whatâs not clear yet is the
merits of offering the most vulnerable a booster jab. It is likely to be a fine
judgement call as there are so many unknowns â although the expectation is some
will be offered it. Japan has decided to extend a virus state of emergency
to eight more regions as rising coronavirus infections put hospitals under
pressure. It comes a day after the opening ceremony for the Paralympics, which runs until 5 September, was
held in Tokyo. ""Maintaining the health system is
the top priority to protect the lives of citizens,"" Prime Minister
Yoshihide Suga said after announcing the extension. Months of emergency curbs in the capital, Tokyo, and
surrounding areas have failed to reverse a surge in infections and about 90% of
the city's critical care beds are occupied. Japan, which reported 21,561 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, will expand the states of emergency from Friday,
taking the total to 21 regions - from Hokkaido in the north to the southern
island of Okinawa - and covering nearly 80% of its population. A US intelligence report requested by President Biden into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic is inconclusive, US media reports say. Agencies are reportedly divided on whether the virus - first seen in China - was the result of a natural spillover from animal to human or was caused by a laboratory accident. A summary of the report is expected to be published in the coming days. In May President Biden gave the US intelligence agencies 90 days to assess the data and produce a report that ""could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"" on the virus's origins. Intelligence that several researchers at the Wuhan lab were hospitalised in November 2019, and China's refusal to allow a thorough investigation into the lab theory, is said to have prompted Mr Biden's decision. Hospitals in Houston, Texas, are struggling to cope with a surge in cases The powerful US gun rights group, the
National Rifle Association, has cancelled its annual meeting because of a rise
in Covid-19 infections in Texas. The conference was due to be held next week, but the group decided to scrap it ""after analysing
relevant data regarding Covid-19 in Harris County, Texas"". ""We are mindful that NRA Annual
Meeting patrons will return home to family, friends and co-workers from all
over the country, so any impacts from the virus could have broader implications,""
the group said in a statement. The NRA's yearly Meeting &
Exhibits event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees from across the
country for several days of social gatherings, assemblies and firearms
displays. The US government's massive
vaccination effort is facing resistance in politically conservative states like
Texas, where many are also reluctant to wear masks. People in Oregon protesting against Covid vaccines Masks will have to be worn outside in the
US state of Oregon from Friday as the country grapples with a surge in Covid-19
cases. The announcement by the stateâs
governor makes the north-western state the first in the US to reintroduce the
rule. ""The Delta variant is spreading
fast and wide, throwing our state into a level of crisis we have not yet seen
in the pandemic,"" said governor Kate Brown. ""Cases and hospitalisations are at a record high.â The rules mean everyone - whether vaccinated
or not - must wear a mask in any public place where people from different
households are mixing. Oregon, along with other states,
already requires the wearing of masks indoors, but it is the first to require them
routinely outside. Around half of all Americans are fully vaccinated, although take-up varies considerably from region to region. The effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines against infection dropped from 91% before the Delta variant became dominant to 66% afterwards, according to a large study of health workers in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been examining the performance of the two vaccines since they were authorised among healthcare staff and other frontline workers. Thousands of workers across six states were tested weekly and upon onset of Covid-19 symptoms, allowing researchers to estimate efficacy. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 91% in the initial study period of 14 December 2020 to 10 April 2021. But during weeks in the run-up to 14 August, when the more contagious Delta variant became dominant, effectiveness fell to 66%. The report's authors said there were a number of caveats, including that the protection from vaccines could be waning over time anyway, and the 66% estimate was based on a relatively short study period with few infections. As we have been reporting today, a UK study has found that protection against infection in peoplewho have been double-jabbed seems to fade over time.  Premier Foods, the owner of Mr Kipling cakes, has told its 800 office staff members they will be able to decide where they work,as it adopts a new hybrid model. The offer applies to staff at its St Albans head office, as well as its Manchester, Lutterworth, Southampton, and High Wycombe locations. David Wilkinson, group HR director, said: ""Work is a verb, not a place, and whether it's for a meeting or just personal preference, our office remains open for anyone who wants to use it.""

Here's a reminder of some of the main stories we've been reporting on. As ever, do scroll down for the full story on what's been going on.  Today's live page was edited by Owen Amos and Hamish Mackay. The writers were Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Katie Wright. There have been another 35,847 coronavirus cases recorded in the UK - a rise from 30,838 the previous day. And there have been a further 149 deaths of people who had tested positive in the previous 28 days. On Tuesday, 174 deaths were reported. Scientists have previously said there is a ""strong association"" between the early outbreak and the sale of live animals in a market Authors of the World Health Organization (WHO) report into how coronavirus emerged are warning that time is running out for their inquiry. They're calling for international leaders and the scientific community to help speed up the follow-up research on where Covid-19 came from. In their comments, in the Nature journal, the members of the joint WHO-China team point out the report was published in March - and that it was ""meant to be the first step in a process that has stalled"". ""The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast: any delay will render some of the studies biologically impossible,"" say the authors. ""Understanding the origins of a devastating pandemic is a global priority, grounded in science."" They say opportunities are decreasing because Covid-19 antibodies wane, so it becomes more difficult with time to get samples from those who might have been exposed before December 2019. A separate intelligence report into the origins of the pandemic, requested by US President Joe Biden, is inconclusive,US media reports say. We mentioned earlier that Scotland has had another record day for reported Covid cases. Now, NHS Highlandhas warnedof a ""large number of outbreaks"" in schools in its area. The health board, which covers the Highlands and Argyll and Bute, says about 60 schools have been affected so far. There have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week. NHS Highland says this represents almost 10% of its total cases since the start of the pandemic. We mentioned that Prof Ravindra Gupta, who advises the government on Covid, has been speaking to the BBC. In his interview, he also says he'd like children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated. ""I think personally, yes, I think certainly individuals of the age of 12 and above. Twelve to 18 certainly,"" he says.
""I think that for younger children, I think a sort of further discussion would need to be had, but we need to start with the older children first."" As things stand, everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine. Children aged 12-15 who are clinically vulnerable to Covid, or live with adults who have greater health risks, are also being invited to get a jab.There are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of that age. Prof Gupta adds he'd also like those who are immune-suppressed and the over-80s to get booster jabs. Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach (left) watching a Paralympics event Japan's top medical adviser has criticised the president of the International Olympic Committee for visiting Tokyo again when the country is expanding emergency curbs to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Japan will expand states of emergency to eight more prefectures from Friday, taking the total to 21 regions from Hokkaido in the north to the southern island of Okinawa and covering nearly 80% of its population. Dr Shigeru Omi suggests Olympics president Thomas Bach's decision to fly into Japan again for this week's Paralympics opening ceremony has undermined efforts to persuade people to avoid travel and work from home. In response, the IOC says Bach's visit has been authorised by the Japanese government and is meant to show support for Paralympic athletes. Scotland has recorded more than 5,000 Covid cases in the past 24 hours - the highest figure for a single day since the pandemic began. The government figures show a rise of 698 from the previous day - which had been a record itself - taking the total to 5,021. There have also been five deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged the ""sharp rise"" in cases - but notes the percentage testing positive is lower than the previous day, reflecting the fact more tests have been done. ""Vaccines still protecting against serious illness, but we all need to take care and act in a way that minimises risk of getting/spreading the virus,"" she adds. Hospital admissions have risen in Scotland too, for the fifth day in a row. It is ""realistic"" to say there will be a ""significant"" surge in coronavirus infections as schools return and people attend summer festivals, an expert advising the government on the virus has told the BBC. Prof Ravindra Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, says: ""Of course there is going to be an associated surge in cases, given that the young people in these events are largely going to be unvaccinated. ""So that's just something that is predictable and will happen, despite best efforts."" He adds that when the government carried out pilot music events earlier this year, the Delta variant was not dominant and community transmission was relatively low. Those pilot events were concluded to lead to ""no substantial outbreaks"" - but Prof Gupta says if a study were to be carried out now, ""you may find something different"". We reported earlier this week thatmore than 4,000 Covid casescould be linked to a music and surfing festival in Cornwall. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The Chinese newspaper Global Times has today
slammed reports from earlier this month by theWashington Post,externaland theWall Street Journal,externalthat suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in a Wuhan laboratory. Global Times says the articles,which cited a US Republican congressional report,external, featured âjaw dropping mistakesâ and says this
âcould be the âtip of the icebergâ in the US made-up evidence in framing China
on the virus-origins tracing issueâ. China has repeatedly stressed that the joint China-WHO

Jagger and Richards pay tribute to bandmate Watts,"Sir Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have paid tribute to their bandmate Charlie Watts, following the death of the Rolling Stones drummer. In posts onTwitter,externalandInstagram,external, singer Sir Mick shared a photograph of Watts smiling while seated behind a drum kit. Guitarist Richards also took to social media toshare a picture,externalof a set of drums with a ""closed"" sign on them. Watts died aged 80 in a London hospital on Tuesday, the band's publicist said. The news came weeks afterit was announcedthat he would miss the Rolling Stones' US tour starting next month to recover from an unspecified medical procedure. Watts was previously treated for throat cancer in 2004. This video can not be played ""Charlie Watts' drumming will live on forever,"" says The Who's Kenney Jones He had been a member of the Stones since January 1963, when he joined Sir Mick, Keith Richards and Brian Jones in their fledgling group. Watts helped them become, with the Beatles, one of the bands who took rock 'n' roll to the masses in the 1960s with classics such as (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Get Off My Cloud and Sympathy for the Devil. The photograph chosen by Sir Mick in his social media posts does not carry a caption. It shows Watts performing with his own jazz band, The ABC and D of Boogie Woogie, at the Casino in Herisau, Switzerland in January 2010. Allow Twitter content?

And folk singerJoan Baez,externalremembered him as ""a prince among thieves"" and ""a gentleman through and through"". By BBC music reporter Mark Savage Charlie Watts was never the most flashy drummer. He wasn't known for the frenzied solos of Cream's Ginger Baker, or for placing explosives in his kick drum like The Who's Keith Moon. Instead, he was the subtle, stoic heartbeat of The Rolling Stones for almost 60 years. A jazz aficionado, he fell in love with the drums after listening to Chico Hamilton play brushes onWalking Shoes,external; and was only introduced to the dark arts of rock 'n' roll by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in the early 1960s. He joined the Stones in 1963 after the band had discarded several other drummers - and they never looked back. ""Charlie Watts gives me the freedom to fly on stage,"" Richards later observed. Obituary: Charlie Watts In pictures: Look back at Charlie Watts' life Five of Charlie Watts' best drum beats Charlie Watts: Rolling Stones drummer dies at 80 His jazz-inflected swing gave the Stones' songs their swagger, pushing and pulling at the groove, creating room for Jagger's lascivious drawl. He was at his best on the cowbell-driven Honky Tonk Women or the locked-down groove Gimme Shelter (where he even threw in some uncharacteristically showy fills). On and off the stage, he was quiet and reserved - sticking to the shadows and letting the rest of the band suck up the limelight. ""I've actually never been interested in all that stuff and still am not,""he told the San Diego Tribune in 1991,external. ""I don't know what showbiz is and I've never watched MTV. There are people who just play instruments, and I'm pleased to know that I'm one of them."" In 2016, Watts was ranked 12th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest drummers of all time. He is survived by his wife Shirley, daughter Seraphina and granddaughter Charlotte.

Church 'regrets' suicide of falsely accused priest,"Fr Alan Griffin previously tried to take his own life after testing positive for HIV The Church of England has expressed ""deep regret and sorrow"" over a mishandled inquiry into a priest who killed himself after false child abuse allegations. Father Alan Griffin, 78, who died last November, spent a year under scrutiny without ever hearing the claims. A coroner previously said the claims were ""supported by no complainant, no witness and no accuser"". ""We take responsibility for what went wrong,"" the Church said. ""We acknowledge that there were either poor processes or systems, or mistakes, that led to unreasonable pressures on Fr Alan,""the Diocese of London and Lambeth Palace said,externalin a submission to the coroner. It added a new head of safeguarding ""with 30 years policing experience"" had been installed at the start of the month. Last month, Coroner Mary Hassell'sPrevention of Future Deaths report,externalwas published following the inquest into Fr Griffin's death at his home in Wapping, east London, on 8 November 2020. Copies of the coroner's report were sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury's residence at Lambeth Palace Recording the death as a suicide, the coroner said: ""He was an HIV positive (viral load undetectable) gay priest. ""He killed himself because he could not cope with an investigation into his conduct, the detail of and the source for which he had never been told. ""Fr Griffin did not abuse children. He did not have sex with young people under the age of 18. He did not visit prostitutes. He did not endanger the lives of others by having sex with people whilst an HIV risk."" CofE criticised over suicide of abuse claims priest Information and support: HIV The investigation into Fr Griffin began because an official in the Anglican Diocese of London suggested to his archdeacon that he undertake a ""brain dump"" of information he had acquired before his retirement. ""We accept that the concerns raised in respect of Fr Griffin were unsubstantiated,"" the church said in its submission to the coroner. ""We accept that good practice around evidence gathering, verification, and evaluation of information prior to action was lacking. ""We fully accept that there was no subsequent verification of the information shared by/with the head of operations."" Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was sent a detailed report by the coroner The coroner addressed many concerns in her report, which she sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury, pointing out the ""breadth of the systemic and individual failings that have come to light during the course of this inquest"". The Church apologised to the coroner for the delay in responding to the inquest process and ""for the points at which we did not engage as effectively as we could have done"". ""It is a matter of significant regret that, even following the death of Father Griffin, there were a number of lost opportunities to review learning from the handling of this case prior to the inquest,"" it added.

"Jagger and Richards pay tribute to bandmate WattsThe Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards salute drummer Charlie Watts, who has died aged 80.Entertainment & Arts","Sir Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have paid tribute to their bandmate Charlie Watts, following the death of the Rolling Stones drummer. In posts onTwitter,externalandInstagram,external, singer Sir Mick shared a photograph of Watts smiling while seated behind a drum kit. Guitarist Richards also took to social media toshare a picture,externalof a set of drums with a ""closed"" sign on them. Watts died aged 80 in a London hospital on Tuesday, the band's publicist said. The news came weeks afterit was announcedthat he would miss the Rolling Stones' US tour starting next month to recover from an unspecified medical procedure. Watts was previously treated for throat cancer in 2004. This video can not be played ""Charlie Watts' drumming will live on forever,"" says The Who's Kenney Jones He had been a member of the Stones since January 1963, when he joined Sir Mick, Keith Richards and Brian Jones in their fledgling group. Watts helped them become, with the Beatles, one of the bands who took rock 'n' roll to the masses in the 1960s with classics such as (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Get Off My Cloud and Sympathy for the Devil. The photograph chosen by Sir Mick in his social media posts does not carry a caption.

By BBC music reporter Mark Savage Charlie Watts was never the most flashy drummer. He wasn't known for the frenzied solos of Cream's Ginger Baker, or for placing explosives in his kick drum like The Who's Keith Moon. Instead, he was the subtle, stoic heartbeat of The Rolling Stones for almost 60 years. A jazz aficionado, he fell in love with the drums after listening to Chico Hamilton play brushes onWalking Shoes,external; and was only introduced to the dark arts of rock 'n' roll by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in the early 1960s.

He was at his best on the cowbell-driven Honky Tonk Women or the locked-down groove Gimme Shelter (where he even threw in some uncharacteristically showy fills). On and off the stage, he was quiet and reserved - sticking to the shadows and letting the rest of the band suck up the limelight. ""I've actually never been interested in all that stuff and still am not,""he told the San Diego Tribune in 1991,external. ""I don't know what showbiz is and I've never watched MTV. There are people who just play instruments, and I'm pleased to know that I'm one of them."" In 2016, Watts was ranked 12th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest drummers of all time.

Consultation begins on beaver reintroductionsThe UK government is seeking people's views on whether beavers should return to England's rivers.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played ARCHIVE: A 2019 film looked ahead to the beaver consultation. A consultation is launching to seek people's views on whether beavers should be reintroduced to England's rivers. The creatures were once widespread throughout Britain, but were hunted to extinction 400 years ago. Studies have shown that the return of the mammals could help to restore river habitats. But the National Farmers' Union warned that beavers' dams can cause disruption. The consultation will last for 12 weeks. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Today marks a significant milestone for the reintroduction of beavers in the wild. ""But we also understand that there are implications for landowners, so we are taking a cautious approach to ensure that all potential impacts are carefully considered."" The steps towards bringing beavers back to England follows reintroduction programmes in Scotland, which have led to established wild beaver populations. Trials in Wales and England have also been assessing the mammal's impact on the environment. Afive-year study of beavers,externalthat were reintroduced to the River Otter in Devon found that the creatures were beneficial to the environment. Beavers are often described as eco-engineers - their dams create wetland habitats where wildlife can flourish. The animals transport logs, branches, stones and mud to build the barriers across rivers. The dams help create pools of deep water that deter predators. The River Otter study found that the natural constructions also act as natural flood barriers, protecting homes downstream. Beavers were once native to Britain but were wiped out 400 years ago Eva Bishop, from the Beaver Trust, said a national policy for the animals was an important step. ""We hope to see beavers accepted back in the countryside like any other native wild animal - particularly as they have a role to play in nature's recovery and British wildlife resilience in the climate emergency,"" she said. However, the River Otter study also concluded that beavers can cause localised problems for some landowners. And the National Farmers' Union urged caution over widespread reintroductions, warning that beavers can damage trees and impede drainage from farmland. NFU spokesman Richard Bramley said: ""Where there is a financial impact on a farm business, adequate compensation must be made and an exit strategy must be in place should major issues occur."" The government has also announced plans to give beavers legal protection in England as a native species. This makes it an offence to deliberately capture, kill, disturb or injure the mammals, or to damage breeding sites or resting places.

Here's a reminder of some of the main stories we've been reporting on. As ever, do scroll down for the full story on what's been going on.  Today's live page was edited by Owen Amos and Hamish Mackay. The writers were Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Katie Wright. There have been another 35,847 coronavirus cases recorded in the UK - a rise from 30,838 the previous day. And there have been a further 149 deaths of people who had tested positive in the previous 28 days. On Tuesday, 174 deaths were reported. Scientists have previously said there is a ""strong association"" between the early outbreak and the sale of live animals in a market Authors of the World Health Organization (WHO) report into how coronavirus emerged are warning that time is running out for their inquiry. They're calling for international leaders and the scientific community to help speed up the follow-up research on where Covid-19 came from. In their comments, in the Nature journal, the members of the joint WHO-China team point out the report was published in March - and that it was ""meant to be the first step in a process that has stalled"". ""The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast: any delay will render some of the studies biologically impossible,"" say the authors. ""Understanding the origins of a devastating pandemic is a global priority, grounded in science."" They say opportunities are decreasing because Covid-19 antibodies wane, so it becomes more difficult with time to get samples from those who might have been exposed before December 2019. A separate intelligence report into the origins of the pandemic, requested by US President Joe Biden, is inconclusive,US media reports say. We mentioned earlier that Scotland has had another record day for reported Covid cases. Now, NHS Highlandhas warnedof a ""large number of outbreaks"" in schools in its area. The health board, which covers the Highlands and Argyll and Bute, says about 60 schools have been affected so far. There have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week. NHS Highland says this represents almost 10% of its total cases since the start of the pandemic. We mentioned that Prof Ravindra Gupta, who advises the government on Covid, has been speaking to the BBC. In his interview, he also says he'd like children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated. ""I think personally, yes, I think certainly individuals of the age of 12 and above. Twelve to 18 certainly,"" he says.
""I think that for younger children, I think a sort of further discussion would need to be had, but we need to start with the older children first."" As things stand, everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine. Children aged 12-15 who are clinically vulnerable to Covid, or live with adults who have greater health risks, are also being invited to get a jab.There are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of that age. Prof Gupta adds he'd also like those who are immune-suppressed and the over-80s to get booster jabs. Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach (left) watching a Paralympics event Japan's top medical adviser has criticised the president of the International Olympic Committee for visiting Tokyo again when the country is expanding emergency curbs to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Japan will expand states of emergency to eight more prefectures from Friday, taking the total to 21 regions from Hokkaido in the north to the southern island of Okinawa and covering nearly 80% of its population. Dr Shigeru Omi suggests Olympics president Thomas Bach's decision to fly into Japan again for this week's Paralympics opening ceremony has undermined efforts to persuade people to avoid travel and work from home. In response, the IOC says Bach's visit has been authorised by the Japanese government and is meant to show support for Paralympic athletes. Scotland has recorded more than 5,000 Covid cases in the past 24 hours - the highest figure for a single day since the pandemic began. The government figures show a rise of 698 from the previous day - which had been a record itself - taking the total to 5,021. There have also been five deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged the ""sharp rise"" in cases - but notes the percentage testing positive is lower than the previous day, reflecting the fact more tests have been done. ""Vaccines still protecting against serious illness, but we all need to take care and act in a way that minimises risk of getting/spreading the virus,"" she adds. Hospital admissions have risen in Scotland too, for the fifth day in a row. It is ""realistic"" to say there will be a ""significant"" surge in coronavirus infections as schools return and people attend summer festivals, an expert advising the government on the virus has told the BBC. Prof Ravindra Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, says: ""Of course there is going to be an associated surge in cases, given that the young people in these events are largely going to be unvaccinated. ""So that's just something that is predictable and will happen, despite best efforts."" He adds that when the government carried out pilot music events earlier this year, the Delta variant was not dominant and community transmission was relatively low. Those pilot events were concluded to lead to ""no substantial outbreaks"" - but Prof Gupta says if a study were to be carried out now, ""you may find something different"". We reported earlier this week thatmore than 4,000 Covid casescould be linked to a music and surfing festival in Cornwall. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The Chinese newspaper Global Times has today
slammed reports from earlier this month by theWashington Post,externaland theWall Street Journal,externalthat suggested that Covid-19 might have originated in a Wuhan laboratory. Global Times says the articles,which cited a US Republican congressional report,external, featured âjaw dropping mistakesâ and says this
âcould be the âtip of the icebergâ in the US made-up evidence in framing China
on the virus-origins tracing issueâ. China has repeatedly stressed that the joint China-WHO
investigation into the origin of the coronavirus earlier this year concluded by
saying that it was âextremely unlikelyâ the virus had spread from a lab leak. However, in May, US president Joe Biden ordered a 90-day
probe into whether the virus came from a lab accident, or emerged from human
contact with an infected animal. As this probe draws to a close, Chinese media have been
increasingly pumping out articles criticising the US for âpoliticisingâ the
origin of the coronavirus. At the same time, they have gone on the offensive,
and pushed a counter theory suggesting that the virus was madeand leaked from a US military base. US media are reporting that the Biden-ordered report - which has not been published -is likely to be inconclusive. There has been a push to boost vaccinate rates in Sydney, Australia Sydney reported a daily record of 838 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, amid a growing Delta variant outbreak in Australia. Despite two months of lockdowns in Sydney, the wider New South Wales state reported 919 new cases, taking Australia's daily case numbers to just below 1,000 - a new high. The rise has put parts of the health
system under pressure in Sydney, which has a total of 113 people in intensive
care. Australia has locked down more than
half of its 25 million population - including its largest cities, Sydney and
Melbourne - as it tries to tackle a third wave of the virus. The country is also accelerating its
vaccine rollout. Around 31% of people aged over 16 have been fully vaccinated, while 54% have had at
least one dose. US Vice President Kamala Harris says the US will donate one million vaccines to Vietnam Vietnam has reported a record 12,096
new Covid cases, with most of those coming in Ho Chi Minh City, the epicentre of
the countryâs outbreak. The South East Asian country has so far
recorded more than 380,000 cases - 99.6% of which have been detected since May
this year. Vietnam successfully contained coronavirus
for most of last year, but since April has been dealing with a sizeable outbreak
in Ho Chi Minh City, driven by the Delta variant. Just 2% of its population of 98
million people have been vaccinated, among the lowest in Asia, after its
government opted for a containment policy. Earlier today US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on a visit to Vietnam, announced the US will donate one million Pfizer doses to the country. Hospitals in Switzerland could be overrun by a rising number of serious cases within weeks, the federal government has warned. The government is considering ordering staff and visitors to show a Covid-19 certificate - providing proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test result - in most public indoor spaces, The requirement would cover events, as well as restaurants,bars and recreational sites like cinemas and museums, as well assports centres and cultural activities, said the government. ""If hospital admissions continue to rise as strongly as theyhave recently, hospital overload cannot be ruled out in just afew weeks,"" the federal government said in a statement. ""The government has therefore decided on a precautionarybasis to consult the cantons and social partners on strengthenedmeasures against the spread of the coronavirus,"" it said. Switzerland is being hit by a fourth wave of the coronaviruswith a ""very worrying"" rise in infections, the head of thegovernment's crisis team said on Tuesday. The number of new infections in Switzerland and neighbour Liechtensteinrose by 3,212 on Wednesday,external, taking the total above 765,000 since the pandemic began. The death toll is nearing 10,500. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst President Tsai Ing-wen gets Taiwan's domestically-produced vaccine, Medigen, on Monday Taiwan has recorded no new local cases of Covid-19 for the first time since 9 May. Taiwan - which has a population of more than 23 million - saw a huge outbreak in the middle of May that led to
more than 800 deaths. Before this outbreak, there had been only 12 deaths since
the start of the pandemic. At its peak, Taiwan was recording more than 500 confirmed
local cases a day. This huge outbreak led to all but essential businesses
closing, and a mask mandate being implemented. Most cases were recorded in
northern Taiwan, in New Taipei and Taipei City. However, today, life in Taiwan looks a lot more normal.
Venues are allowed to host 80 people indoors, and 300 outdoors. Yesterday, indoor amusement parks and water parks were given the green light to
reopen again for the first time. And students are allowed to start back in the
classroom from September. Nightclubs, bars and video games venues remain closed, however. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This study on waning vaccine effectivenessonce again
illustrates why we need to get used to Covid circulating. This is not a virus thatâs
going to go away. The vaccines do not work like
they do for measles which provide life-long immunity. Immunity was always expected
to wane. And another factor to
consider is that repeated exposure to the virus is likely to increase the risk
of a breakthrough infection â the increased likelihood over time of infection
post-jabbing may not be all related to waning immunity. Whatever the cause though, experts have been clear we should expect to be repeatedly infected over our
lifetimes. The important thing is that
each re-infection should be milder as the vaccines remain highly effective at
preventing serious illness. What the vaccines have
effectively done is taken the edge off the virus â given our immune system a
head-start so those early infections are milder than they would have been for
most. Whatâs not clear yet is the
merits of offering the most vulnerable a booster jab. It is likely to be a fine
judgement call as there are so many unknowns â although the expectation is some
will be offered it. Japan has decided to extend a virus state of emergency
to eight more regions as rising coronavirus infections put hospitals under
pressure. It comes a day after the opening ceremony for the Paralympics, which runs until 5 September, was
held in Tokyo. ""Maintaining the health system is
the top priority to protect the lives of citizens,"" Prime Minister
Yoshihide Suga said after announcing the extension. Months of emergency curbs in the capital, Tokyo, and
surrounding areas have failed to reverse a surge in infections and about 90% of
the city's critical care beds are occupied. Japan, which reported 21,561 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, will expand the states of emergency from Friday,
taking the total to 21 regions - from Hokkaido in the north to the southern
island of Okinawa - and covering nearly 80% of its population. A US intelligence report requested by President Biden into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic is inconclusive, US media reports say. Agencies are reportedly divided on whether the virus - first seen in China - was the result of a natural spillover from animal to human or was caused by a laboratory accident. A summary of the report is expected to be published in the coming days. In May President Biden gave the US intelligence agencies 90 days to assess the data and produce a report that ""could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"" on the virus's origins. Intelligence that several researchers at the Wuhan lab were hospitalised in November 2019, and China's refusal to allow a thorough investigation into the lab theory, is said to have prompted Mr Biden's decision. Hospitals in Houston, Texas, are struggling to cope with a surge in cases The powerful US gun rights group, the
National Rifle Association, has cancelled its annual meeting because of a rise
in Covid-19 infections in Texas. The conference was due to be held next week, but the group decided to scrap it ""after analysing
relevant data regarding Covid-19 in Harris County, Texas"". ""We are mindful that NRA Annual
Meeting patrons will return home to family, friends and co-workers from all
over the country, so any impacts from the virus could have broader implications,""
the group said in a statement. The NRA's yearly Meeting &
Exhibits event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees from across the
country for several days of social gatherings, assemblies and firearms
displays. The US government's massive
vaccination effort is facing resistance in politically conservative states like
Texas, where many are also reluctant to wear masks. People in Oregon protesting against Covid vaccines Masks will have to be worn outside in the
US state of Oregon from Friday as the country grapples with a surge in Covid-19
cases. The announcement by the stateâs
governor makes the north-western state the first in the US to reintroduce the
rule. ""The Delta variant is spreading
fast and wide, throwing our state into a level of crisis we have not yet seen
in the pandemic,"" said governor Kate Brown. ""Cases and hospitalisations are at a record high.â The rules mean everyone - whether vaccinated
or not - must wear a mask in any public place where people from different
households are mixing. Oregon, along with other states,
already requires the wearing of masks indoors, but it is the first to require them
routinely outside. Around half of all Americans are fully vaccinated, although take-up varies considerably from region to region. The effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines against infection dropped from 91% before the Delta variant became dominant to 66% afterwards, according to a large study of health workers in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been examining the performance of the two vaccines since they were authorised among healthcare staff and other frontline workers. Thousands of workers across six states were tested weekly and upon onset of Covid-19 symptoms, allowing researchers to estimate efficacy. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 91% in the initial study period of 14 December 2020 to 10 April 2021. But during weeks in the run-up to 14 August, when the more contagious Delta variant became dominant, effectiveness fell to 66%. The report's authors said there were a number of caveats, including that the protection from vaccines could be waning over time anyway, and the 66% estimate was based on a relatively short study period with few infections. As we have been reporting today, a UK study has found that protection against infection in peoplewho have been double-jabbed seems to fade over time.  Premier Foods, the owner of Mr Kipling cakes, has told its 800 office staff members they will be able to decide where they work,as it adopts a new hybrid model. The offer applies to staff at its St Albans head office, as well as its Manchester, Lutterworth, Southampton, and High Wycombe locations. David Wilkinson, group HR director, said: ""Work is a verb, not a place, and whether it's for a meeting or just personal preference, our office remains open for anyone who wants to use it."" The changes will not apply to Premier's 4,000 factory workers. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"UK self-catering holiday prices soar in pandemicHolidaymakers are paying an average of Â£300 more per week than before the pandemic, analysis suggests.Business","Self-catered accommodation in the UK is costing on average 40% more than in the summer of 2019, according to consumer group Which?. Its analysis,external, with BBC Panorama, suggests holidaymakers are paying an average of Â£300 more per week in August compared to before the pandemic. Brighton is among the seaside resorts with soaring prices, with average rental costs almost doubling. The data is from AirDNA, which monitors websites such as Airbnb and Vrbo. BBC News has approached Airbnb for comment. The company has previously claimed figures from third-party organisations can be misleading. Airbnb extends party ban until end of summer How a village is changing to meet staycation demand The quirky holiday lets that are nothing like home Watch BBC Panorama: The Great British Staycation? at 19:30 BST on Wednesday on BBC One, or later on BBC iPlayer More than 20 million Britons planned to holiday in the UK this year,according to research by market research company Opinium,external. The average cost of one night of self-catered accommodation for two people in Brighton was Â£109 in 2019, but is now Â£206 - a rise of 89% - according to AirDNA's data. Meanwhile, stays in St Helier in Jersey increased by 76% on 2019, and Lyme Regis on the south coast jumped up 74%. Catherine Lane, who lets out six properties in Brighton, told BBC Panorama she put up some of her prices this year because her costs had risen considerably. ""Now we have to have cleaning and sanitation costs, which are much higher. We have to have time for the cleaners to disinfect the place,"" she said. She said prices had gone up to meet the high demand, but added: ""A lot of pricing we don't have control over. ""If you're booking by third-party advertising website, they're putting commissions on the actual end price."" Holiday booking site Vrbo told BBC Panorama it ""does not set, change or influence the property prices a host chooses"". Which? also looked at how big the price difference can be between holidaying in the UK and travelling abroad - even when flights are factored in. Its research compared prices for late August getaways for two people in the UK and abroad, looking at the cheapest, highly-rated hotel available in a central location, as well as transport costs. For a coastal break, it found a week in Brighton for Â£1,131, while a hotel in Nice in the south of France, which included flights, cost Â£1,085. Elsewhere, a week in Lake Windermere in the England's Lake District cost Â£2,424, compared to just Â£802 for flights and accommodation for a week in Lake Garda in northern Italy. Which? compared properties near Lake Windermere (left) and Lake Garda (right) Which? travel editor Rory Boland said: ""We're not talking about Â£10, we're not talking about the cost of a meal out. We're talkingâ¦ hundreds and hundreds of pounds."" He said the reason behind the differences in price wasn't just down to the pandemic. ""When we looked at it, accommodation prices in 2019 were more expensive in the UK than they were abroad. So this isn't a pandemic problem only, the pandemic has made it worse,"" Mr Boland added.

World Bank freezes funding for AfghanistanThe announcement comes after the International Monetary Fund halted aid to Afghanistan last week.Business,"The World Bank has halted funding for projects in Afghanistan after the Taliban seized control of the country. It cited concerns over how the Taliban's takeover will affect ""the country's development prospects, especially for women"". The move comes just days after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended payments to Afghanistan. The Biden administration has also frozen the assets of Afghanistan's central bank that are held in the US. Since 2002 the Washington-based financial institution has committed more than $5.3bn (Â£3.9bn) to reconstruction and development projects in Afghanistan. ""We have paused disbursements in our operations in Afghanistan and we are closely monitoring and assessing the situation in line with our internal policies and procedures,"" a World Bank spokesperson told the BBC. ""We will continue to consult closely with the international community and development partners. Together with our partners we are exploring ways we can remain engaged to preserve hard-won development gains and continue to support the people of Afghanistan."" What next for Afghanistan's economy? On Friday, the World Bank told staff that its Kabul-based team and their immediate families had been safely evacuated from Afghanistan to Pakistan. The decision by the World Bank to suspend payments to Afghanistan is the latest financial blow to the country's new government. Last week, the IMF announced that Afghanistan will no longer be able to access the global lender's resources. An IMF spokesperson said it was due to ""lack of clarity within the international community"" over recognising a government in Afghanistan. About $440m of new monetary reserves had been set to be made available to the country from 23 August. Also in the days after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the White House said any assets that Afghanistan's central bank has in the US would not be made available to the Taliban.

Call to investigate cost of Welsh Covid travel tests,"This video can not be played Calls have been made to investigate the cost of PCR travel tests in Wales A Welsh MP has asked the monopolies watchdog to investigate Welsh ministers' insistence people returning to Wales from abroad use a single NHS provider for Covid PCR tests. Tory MP David TC Davies says NHS tests cost more ""than people need to pay"". He contrasts this with travellers in England being able to ""shop around different providers"" to save money. Welsh ministers say NHS testing ensures any positive cases and harmful variants are identified as early as possible. Test requirements apply to travellers returning to Wales, even if they arrive at an airport or port in England. Cost of travellers' PCR tests in Wales criticised The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced areview into the Covid testing system for travellersafter complaints about pricing and performance among some private providers in England. Mr Davies, a UK government Wales Office minister and Conservative MP for Monmouth, then wrote to the CMA agreeing that ""a review is needed to protect holiday makers"" and urging them to ""look very carefully indeed at the cost of PCR testing in Wales"". The cost of an NHS test is set by the UK government. Ithas been reducedfrom Â£88 for a single test to Â£68, but in England people can choose between private providers and could pay less than Â£50 per test. First Minister Mark Drakefordrejected calls to change Wales' policy last month. Welsh ministers are urging people not to travel abroad for holidays this summer and he said: ""I don't intend to divert the activities of my officials into making it easier for people to do something that the Welsh government so clearly thinks is unadvisable."" People over the age of 11 must have proof of a negative coronavirus test before they travel to Wales from overseas,with some exemptions,external. All travellers aged five and over must have a post-arrival testing package booked before they return to Wales. Those travelling to Wales from green-list countries need to take a PCR test on day two after arrival, even if their flight or ferry arrived in England, and do not need to isolate. People who are fully vaccinated and have travelled from an amber country to Wales, excluding France, also need to take a PCR test on day two of quarantine and do not need to isolate. People travelling from an amber country who are not fully vaccinated will need to take another test on day eight and must isolate for 10 days. If you have visited or passed through a red-list country you will only be able to enter Wales via a designated port of entry in England or Scotland. You will need to take a PCR on days two and eight of isolation and quarantine for 10 days in a managed quarantine hotel. Richard Cobourne says travellers from Wales should be offered a choice Richard Cobourne, who lives near Tintern in Monmouthshire, travels to the Canary Islands regularly to run his villa rental business and wants more choice for people living in Wales. ""It seems to me the Welsh government are imposing some strictures here that make it very difficult for travellers -  and remember it's not just holiday-makers that are going abroad, it's business travellers,"" he said. ""We have villa rentals out there which are providing our pension, they are our income."" ""If you travel a mile and a half that way,"" said Mr Cobourne, pointing to the border with England, ""you have a choice of 422 testers"". ""If you use a private provider in Wales, that is prohibited, and you'll be fined Â£1,000."" ""I believe travellers from Wales should be offered a choice."" Suzanne Cumpston says there is confusion over test rules Suzanne Cumpston, of Sam Smith Travel in Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan, said the differing rules on tests had caused confusion, with some travellers buying the wrong tests. ""We've seen people come into the office for advice, who have already booked their holiday - not with us - and they have booked the wrong test. They've gone on to websites looking to compare Covid PCR test prices for international travel and they've booked what they think is the cheapest and best quality test out there. ""I'm sure all of my colleagues in the travel industry would love to see - and the public more importantly - four aligned nations in the United Kingdom. ""We need the governments to be aligned as much as possible,"" she said. Helen Furlong, a personal travel agent based in Aberdare, toldBBC Radio Wales BreakfastÂ£68 per test was a lot of money, especially for families. ""In Wales there are a lot of people who work really very hard and have to save for a long time for their holiday and then to add the extra layer of cost on top of it is almost the straw that breaks the camel's back,"" she said. David TC Davies said Welsh ministers did not have the right to make holidays abroad more difficult On Monday, the UK government removed some of the private testing companies from their list of approved providers in England, because of""cowboy behaviour"". Mr Davies welcomed the clampdown in England, and said: ""We're actually in a worse situation in Wales because we don't even have the possibility of shopping around different providers."" He said the Welsh government should recognise that ""people have a right to go on holiday and they have not got the right to try to make it difficult"". ""They should allow people to have exactly the same access to cheaper private providers as the UK government quite rightly do in England."" ""All of the results are fed into the NHS anyway and test, track and trace kick in in England if you have a positive test, that's the whole purpose for having it."" A spokesperson for the CMA said: ""We can confirm we have received the letter from David TC Davies MP. ""As part of our review we are considering evidence received from across the UK about issues in the PCR testing market."" The Welsh government said: ""It is critical any positive cases and harmful variants are identified at the earliest opportunity. ""For this reason, for the time being, we require the tests to be provided by the NHS, so that we can identify positive cases as quickly as possible for our Test, Trace, Protect system to follow up.""

Serial thief targets designer frames in opticians,"This video can not be played CCTV from optician shops inquiry Designer glasses frames worth tens of thousands of pounds have been stolen from a string of opticians across Scotland. BBC Scotland has spoken to eight affected opticians who have shared CCTV footage of the incidents and believe the same thief targeted their shops. It is understood at least six other opticians have had frames stolen by a man who matches the same description. Police Scotland said its inquiries were ongoing. The suspected thief speaks with a Glaswegian accent, is of stocky build and about 50-years-old. BBC Scotland was told that he will typically come into a shop and ask for a small repair on a pair of glasses and steal frames when staff are distracted. CCTV footage from one opticians shows the man, who has grey hair and wears glasses, appear to place pairs of frames inside his shirt before leaving the shop. Sara Wallwork, practice manager at 20/20 Vision opticians on Easter Road, Edinburgh, had 21 pairs of frames worth about Â£4,500 stolen on 13 August. She said: ""We were incredibly busy that day and he'd asked for a repair but we explained that it was being done by appointment at the moment. ""He said he was going to browse the frames and was in the shop for another five minutes or so, and that's obviously when he's taken advantage of how busy we are. ""We've had pockets of thefts before but nothing like this; it was two or three of each designer, almost as if he was stealing to order."" Gerri O'Hear, practice manager of Mearns Opticians in Glasgow, said her shop had seven frames worth about Â£2,000 taken on 18 August. The thief had taken cheaper frames from a stand in the shop and put them in some of the gaps where he'd taken the more expensive frames. She said: ""The story we got was he wanted the nose pads changed on his Gran's glasses. ""I'm more annoyed than anything, just at the sheer gall of it. ""It's not as if we are a big multiple chain that can take the hit of losing stock like this."" Steven Hislop, director of The Opticians at Marchmont in Edinburgh, reported the theft of frames from his shop to Police Scotland on 6 August. He said: ""I've phoned the police twice since the incident to ask when they will be coming for photos and videos as per their request and not heard back from them. ""This guy will continue to steal from small businesses because nothing has been done about it."" A Police Scotland spokeswoman said nobody has been arrested in connection with the incidents but ""inquiries are ongoing"".

Consultation begins on beaver reintroductions,"This video can not be played ARCHIVE: A 2019 film looked ahead to the beaver consultation. A consultation is launching to seek people's views on whether beavers should be reintroduced to England's rivers. The creatures were once widespread throughout Britain, but were hunted to extinction 400 years ago. Studies have shown that the return of the mammals could help to restore river habitats. But the National Farmers' Union warned that beavers' dams can cause disruption. The consultation will last for 12 weeks. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Today marks a significant milestone for the reintroduction of beavers in the wild. ""But we also understand that there are implications for landowners, so we are taking a cautious approach to ensure that all potential impacts are carefully considered."" The steps towards bringing beavers back to England follows reintroduction programmes in Scotland, which have led to established wild beaver populations. Trials in Wales and England have also been assessing the mammal's impact on the environment. Afive-year study of beavers,externalthat were reintroduced to the River Otter in Devon found that the creatures were beneficial to the environment. Beavers are often described as eco-engineers - their dams create wetland habitats where wildlife can flourish. The animals transport logs, branches, stones and mud to build the barriers across rivers. The dams help create pools of deep water that deter predators. The River Otter study found that the natural constructions also act as natural flood barriers, protecting homes downstream. Beavers were once native to Britain but were wiped out 400 years ago Eva Bishop, from the Beaver Trust, said a national policy for the animals was an important step. ""We hope to see beavers accepted back in the countryside like any other native wild animal - particularly as they have a role to play in nature's recovery and British wildlife resilience in the climate emergency,"" she said. However, the River Otter study also concluded that beavers can cause localised problems for some landowners. And the National Farmers' Union urged caution over widespread reintroductions, warning that beavers can damage trees and impede drainage from farmland. NFU spokesman Richard Bramley said: ""Where there is a financial impact on a farm business, adequate compensation must be made and an exit strategy must be in place should major issues occur."" The government has also announced plans to give beavers legal protection in England as a native species. This makes it an offence to deliberately capture, kill, disturb or injure the mammals, or to damage breeding sites or resting places.

What's the Taliban's record on opium production?,"The Taliban claims opium poppy cultivation was stopped and the flow of illegal drugs halted when it was last in power in Afghanistan. But although there was a sharp drop in 2001 - when it was last in control - opium poppy cultivation in Taliban-held areas has risen in subsequent years. Opium poppy plants can be refined to form the the basis for several highly addictive drugs, including heroin. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium,according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).,external Its opium harvest accounts for more than 80% of the world's supply. In 2018 the UNODC estimated opium production contributedup to 11% of the country's economy.,external After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said: ""When we were in power before there was no production of drugs."" He said ""we will bring opium cultivation to zero again"" and that there would be no smuggling. At first, opium poppy cultivation rose substantially under Taliban rule - from around 41,000 hectares in 1998, to more than 64,000 in 2000,according to the US State Department.,external This was largely in Taliban-controlled Helmand province, which accounted for 39% of the world's illicit opium production. But in July 2000 the Taliban banned opium poppy farming in areas they controlled. Anda UN report in May 2001,external""observed the near total success of the ban in eliminating poppy cultivation in Taliban controlled areas"". Following the Taliban's ban on opium poppy farming, there was a noticeable dip in opium and heroin seizures globally in 2001 and 2002. However, things have since changed. Although there has been cultivation in regions controlled until recently by the former government, most poppy growing has been concentrated in areas held by the Taliban. Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, for example, had the most land used for poppy cultivation in 2020 when controlled by the Taliban. Opium farming is a major source of employment in Afghanistan, and in 2019 opium harvesting provided almost 120,000 jobs, according to theUNODC Afghanistan opium survey,external. The Taliban profits through taxes on the opium crop and indirectly through processing and trafficking, the US State Department says. A 10% cultivation tax is reportedly collected from opium farmers. Afghanistan: How does the Taliban make money? Taxes are also collected from the laboratories converting opium into heroin, as well as the traders who smuggle the illicit drugs. Estimates of the Taliban's annual share of the illicit drug economy range from $100m-$400m. The drug trade accounts for up to 60% of the Taliban's annual revenue,says US commander General John Nicholson in the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (Sigar) report.,external But some experts dispute this figure. David Mansfield, a researcher on the illicit drug trade, says: ""The taxation system as described by the UN and others is unrecognisable on the ground - it's unworkable both administratively and economically. ""The taxes earned on opiates could generate a maximum of $40m per annum."" Heroin made from opium grown in Afghanistan makes up 95% of the market in Europe. However, only 1% of the US supply of heroin comes from Afghanistan, according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Most comes from Mexico. Between 2017 and 2020, more than 90% of opioids were transported by road. But there has recently been a rise in seizures at sea, on routes between the Indian Ocean and Europe. Although there have been fluctuations, opium production and opium-related seizures have shown an upward trend over the last two decades, in line with poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. Drug seizures and arrests have had minimal impact on the country's opium poppy cultivation, according to Sigar. Opium seizures since 2008 were equivalent to just 8% of the opium produced by the country in 2019 alone, it said.

"Consumer 'confusion' threatens net zero homes planPlans to decarbonise homes are too complicated and confusing, say consumer and industry groups.","Government plans to decarbonise homes are too complicated and confusing, according to a coalition of consumer and industry groups. They've written to the prime minister to say that current schemes to adapt homes go wrong far too often. The open letter, from Citizens Advice and others, calls for more financial support for making changes. Otherwise, they argue, efforts to curb emissions from millions of homes in the UK will be at risk. Europe's extreme rains made more likely by humans Talks resume on global plan to protect nature Climate change protesters erect giant pink table Tackling energy use in the residential sector is seen as key to the government's aim of getting to net zero by 2050. Net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and then balancing out any further releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees. The carbon generated by home heating amounts to about 20% of all UK emissions. But the government's current efforts to help householders to adapt their homes are ""too complicated"", and too often things go wrong, say industry and consumer groups. Traditional gas boilers will need to be replaced if the UK is to hit net zero emissions by 2050 The coalition includes Citizens Advice, the Federation of Master Builders, the Aldersgate Group and Which? They argue that the process of installing low-carbon heating, upgrading insulation or putting in smart technologies is ""time consuming, confusing and stressful"". They cite the example of the Green Homes Grant, a scheme that was designed to help people insulate their homes. It was scrapped in March this year afterreaching just 10% of the housesthat the government had promised would be improved. According to the coalition, simply choosing the right technology or finding a reputable installer demands huge amounts of time, knowledge and effort. Far too often, things go wrong with poor installation and technologies not working as expected. The letter to the prime minister says there are three key concerns that need to be addressed to ensure that plans to decarbonise homes don't fail. Information:According to the coalition, people need more accessible and unbiased information on steps, including installing low-carbon heating and upgrading their insulation. Consumer protections:The letter points out that previous energy efficiency schemes, such as the Green Homes Grant, have been marred by scammers and rogue traders. The coalition says consumer protections for decarbonising homes must be fit for purpose. Costs:The coalition is calling for a comprehensive, long-term policy framework that provides certainty for businesses and consumers and which offers financial support such as grants, low-cost loans and financing. ""Our evidence is clear. Right now, making green changes to homes is too confusing and too often things go wrong for those trying to do the right thing,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""The public is behind the net zero transition, but they need the right information and tools, particularly when it comes to adapting their home. ""By getting things right now, the government can give people the confidence to make changes and play their part in getting to net zero."" A close up look at solar panels on a rooftop ""I think solar panels are a very good idea, especially for people who want to contribute to a cleaner environment."" That's the view of Michael, a homeowner in Liverpool who decided to ditch his gas heating for solar power a few years ago. All went well until his roof began to leak and damaged the ceiling in a bedroom. The first time it happened, the fitter repaired the problem. When it happened again in the same spot, Michael found the company had gone out of business. ""This trader had not been properly checked, I don't think they had a necessary qualification to be to be installing solar panels."" Despite an insurance scheme that was meant to help out in circumstances like this, Michael has been unable to get his roof fixed. ""There is no effective guarantee, no effective accountability and responsibility which should have been in place to stop all this happening,"" he said. In response to the letter, a government spokesperson said: ""We are investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures in their homes, with upgrades to 50,000 low-income households already underway. ""Our Simple Energy Advice service offers clear information on what financial support is available for people to make home improvements so they can save money on their energy bills."" In a separate study, the National Housing Federation said that England's homes produce more carbon emissions every year than all the country's cars. The Federation, which represents housing associations across England, says that the emissions from homes are so high because of gas central heating and poor insulation.

Goldman Sachs mandates vaccines for US staff,"Goldman Sachs will introduce the policy from 7 September Goldman Sachs has made it compulsory for its staff to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus in order to work in its US offices. The investment bank said from 7 September all employees, along with clients and visitors, would need to be doubled jabbed to enter its buildings. Goldman said it would also introduce mandatory once-a-week testing from the same date for staff. Workers who are not fully vaccinated will be expected to work from home. Goldman told the BBC the policy was being introduced in the US, where workers returned the office in July, and not at its sites around world. Proof of vaccination status will be required via an app from October, it added. A spokesperson said that from Wednesday face masks would also be required - regardless of vaccination status - in all common areas of its buildings, such as lobbies, lifts, hallways, restrooms and cafes, except while seated for eating and drinking. The bank had previously ordered its US bankers todisclose their vaccine status before returning to the officebut refrained from mandating them. The announcement comes after Pfizer's two-dose vaccinereceived full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The vaccine had initially only been given emergency use authorisation. The approval is expected to set off more vaccine mandates by employers and organisations in the US at time when infections are rising and vaccine hesitancy remains high. The City of London skyline Last month, Goldman announced bankers returning to its London head office would be required to wear masks in the building,despite the easing of the UK government's coronavirus restrictions. But Richard Gnodde, the head of Goldman Sachs International, said the bank would not insist on people being vaccinated, nor would it force people to return if they felt uncomfortable doing so. ""[We will] continue to manage our exit from this in a cautious and appropriate way to make sure that our people feel comfortable,"" he told the BBC. Banks have been split over whether staff should come back to the office full time or work from home for some or all of the week. Goldman Sachs' group chief executive, David Solomon, has described working from home as ""an aberration"", while James Gorman, the boss of rival US investment bank Morgan Stanley said: ""If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office."" Meanwhile, NatWest has said some 55% of its workforce would adopt a hybrid model of working between the office and home.
