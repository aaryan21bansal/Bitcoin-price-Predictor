German energy firm ready to meet Russian pay demand,"One of Germany's biggest energy firms has said it is preparing to buy Russian gas using a payment system that critics say will undermine EU sanctions. Uniper says it will pay in euros which will be converted into roubles, meeting a Kremlin demand for all transactions to be made in the Russian currency. Other European energy firms are reportedly preparing to do the same amid concerns about supply cuts. Uniper said it had no choice but said it was still abiding by EU sanctions. ""We consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""For our company and for Germany as a whole, it is not possible to do without Russian gas in the short term; this would have dramatic consequences for our economy."" Germany's biggest energy supplier RWE declined to comment on how it would pay for Russian gas. In late March, Russia said ""unfriendly countries"" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles to prop up its currency after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas. Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. The European Commission said last week that if buyers of Russian gas could complete payments in euros and get confirmation of this before any conversion into roubles took place, that would not breach sanctions. However there are different views among countries on how to interpret its initial guidance, and this week EC boss Ursula von der Leyen sparked confusion when she said firms could still be breaking the rules. On Thursday, an EU official confirmed that any attempt to convert cash into roubles in Russia would be a ""clear circumvention of sanctions"" as the transaction would involve Russia's central bank. ""What we cannot accept is that companies are obliged to open a second account and that between the first and second account, the amount in euros is in the full hands of the Russian authorities and the Russian Central Bank, and that the payment is only complete when it is converted into roubles."" How much does Europe rely on Russia for gas? Russia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU Russia halts gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria On Tuesday, Poland and Bulgaria both refused to pay for gas in roubles leading to Russian state gas firm Gazprom shutting off supplies. Both countries had already planned not to renew their contracts with Gazprom when they expired later in 2022. Poland - one of the staunchest advocates of tougher sanctions on Russia - said the EU should penalise countries that used roubles to pay for Russian gas. Climate minister Anna Moskwa singled out Germany, Hungary and Austria as resisting a gas embargo. ""We are counting on there being consequences for these countries [which pay in roubles] and that as a result they will cease paying in roubles,"" she said. The move by Russia - which has not given countries the same deadline to begin paying in roubles - is seen as an attempt to divide Western allies in their response over Ukraine. The majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Hungary and Slovakia have both said they will use Russia's conversion payment method, while German economy minister Robert Habeck said on Wednesday that it was ""the path that the EU marked out for us"". ""It's the path that is compatible with sanctions, and as far as I understand the German companies that are doing it this way are inÂ compliance with their contracts,"" he said. ""Most EU countries are taking this approach."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, but it is much higher for some countries and sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. ""A lot of European companies will say OK, we'll pay into a euro-denominated bank account and there will be a back-to-back trade so they stay within the limits of the EU sanctions,"" said Nathan Piper, an energy analyst at Investec. ""But there are two sides of this - those firms need to supply gas to consumers and in Germany there is no alternative to supplies of Russian gas right now."" According to the Financial Times,external, Austrian energy giant OMV is also planning to adopt the mechanism while Italy's Eni is considering the move. Eni declined to comment while OMV denied it was opening a Swiss account with Gazprom. It told the BBC: ""We have analysed the Gazprom request about payment methods in light of the EU-sanctions and are now working on a sanctions-compliant solution.""

Big jump in number of firms at risk of going under,"A growing number of UK businesses are at risk of going under, as costs spiral and Covid loan repayments come due, a report has found. Construction and hospitality are the sectors struggling most, according to insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. Loan repayment schedules should be extended to ease the pressure, it said. The government said it had given businesses an ""unprecedented package of support"" and increased flexibility in paying back Covid loans. In the first three months of this year there was a 19% rise in businesses in critical financial distress compared to the start of 2021, the report by Begbies Traynor said. Julie Palmer, a partner at the insolvency and restructuring specialist firm, said without further action to help struggling businesses there would be a wave of business failures. ""It's just a case of when the dam holding it back finally bursts,"" she said. Businesses face perfect storm as tax rise kicks in Retail sales fall as rising cost of living bites Begbies Traynor, which publishes regular health checks on the state of British businesses, said its ""Red Flag Alert"" research reflected the strain two years of extraordinary financial pressures have had on thousands of companies. It said 1,891 firms now fell into the category of critical, suggesting their outlook is precarious. Although Covid restrictions have been lifted, some firms are still feeling the impact of disruptions to supply chains and the price of energy and other inputs have risen sharply. Firms are finding it hard to recruit staff in some sectors, and wage costs, including the minimum wage and National Insurance payments, have gone up. With the cost of living rising, many UK households are looking for ways to save money, putting further pressure on businesses that rely on discretionary spending, like bars and restaurants. ""Inflation... gets referred to as the silent thief of the economy, I think it's actually becoming a bit of an armed robber, with real inflation probably running much higher than the [official figure] of 7%,"" Ms Palmer said. There is also a ""post-Brexit hangover"" and these factors combined are ""a perfect storm"" of pressures on businesses, she said. Begbies Traynor's research highlights a sharp rise in County Court Judgements (CCJs), an early sign of future insolvencies, because they show creditors are making legal claims. CCJs were up 157% compared to a year ago, the report said. Courts were effectively closed for business for creditors to take action during the pandemic, Ms Palmer said, and the logjam of court cases due to Covid meant the current level of CCJs was likely to be the tip of the iceberg. She added that from Saturday landlords will be able to start making legal claims against businesses. ""We think the landlords, who are a very impatient lobby, will swell those figures,"" she said. Government insolvency figures for March also illustrate the trend towards more insolvencies. They show creditors voluntary liquidations, the most common way for firms to be wound up, had more than doubled compared to a year earlier. During the acute phase of the pandemic many firms relied on state support. But that support was now gone while firms were now facing a perfect storm of rising wage, energy and borrowing costs, Begbies Traynor said. Ms Palmer said the government faced a choice: ""Do they rush to recover funds handed out during the pandemic to ensure there was a functioning economy afterwards? Or [do they] look for ways to control the number of businesses that fail? ""Having put so much money into protecting businesses over the past two years, ministers won't want to see it wasted as companies collapse, unable to repay their debts,"" she said. She said leniency, or taking a longer-term view of repayments of the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, would help embattled businesses. A government spokesperson said support offered to businesses during the pandemic included VAT cuts, business rates holidays and government-backed loans worth around Â£400bn. ""We have given businesses increased flexibility in repaying their Covid-19 loans, with borrowers under the Bounce Back Loan scheme able to extend their repayment term by ten years, as well as apply for repayment holidays,"" the spokesperson added.

LiveLiveBlasts hit Kyiv as UN chief visits President Zelensky9 minutes ago,"An operation to evacuate civilians trapped in a steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol is under way, the UN says The Ukrainian president says a group of about 100 people have left and should arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow An evacuation plan for residents from other parts of Mariupol has been postponed until Monday morning The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has led a Congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky She promises American support ""until the fight is done"" and says Congress will move quickly to approve $33bn in aid for Ukraine Russian troops controlling the city of Kherson say the rouble will be used there from Sunday Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer Reuters saw civilians from Mariupol arriving in the Donetsk region earlier today We have moved our live page for technical reasons -please follow us at this webpage for all the latest. We leave you with some of Sunday's main developments: Ukrainians have been honouring dead friends and relatives, as is traditional on the first Sunday after Orthodox Easter. Alla Krotkikh comforts her 10-year-old son Savelii, as they mourn his father Ihor Krotkikh, 47, who she says was a soldier killed by shelling Anatolii and Olena visit the grave of their son Oleksandr, a soldier, as part of the Easter tradition known as Hrobki or Provody Crosses and floral wreaths are seen in a cemetery in Irpin, outside Kyiv, which saw intense fighting earlier in the war Disabled athletes were among those in Lviv mourning soldier Dmytro Sydoruk, who also coached soldiers with disabilities for the Invictus Games Mourners visit Tairovske Cemetery in Odesa, where graves have been damaged and destroyed by a Russian missile strike And now back to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has said the upcoming anniversary of
Russia's liberation at the end of World War II will not affect Russia's actions in Ukraine. Last week, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Vladimir Putin was ""rolling the pitch"" for a major announcement to mark the historic 9 May ""Victory Day"". ""Our soldiers won't base their actions on a specific date,"" Lavrov said when asked if the anniversary
would be a turning point in the war. ""We'll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner but the
timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on
the need to minimise risks for civilians and Russian solders,""
he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region. The news agency also said that UN staff were in the area. Images taken by Reuters show emotional reunions between civilians and their loved ones. Civilians have arrived in Bezimenne, which is in Russian-controlled territory Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks Azovstal steel plant worker Natalia arrives at a temporary accommodation centre Russia's foreign minister says the country has not blocked efforts to prevent nuclear war. ""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"".

restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
NHS boss feared waiting for ambulance after stroke,"An NHS boss who had a stroke was taken to A&E by her husband rather than calling for an ambulance because of concerns over long waits. In a series of tweets, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust chief executive Deborah Lee praised his swift actions. She said he had ""bundled her into his car"", last week, after she had showed the signs of a stroke because he had heard her ""lamenting ambulance delays"". She is recovering but says it may have been different if they had called 999. Waits for an ambulance in England are the longest since new targets were introduced, in 2017. And Ms Lee's regional service - the South West - has the longest waits in the country, with category-two calls, which include strokes, taking nearly two hours, on average, to reach patients in March. The target is 18 minutes. In the tweets, Ms Lee said: ""Naturally, I am eternally grateful to my husband for his swift actionsâ¦ but I can't get one thing out of my head. ""What if my husband hadn't been there and my daughter had called for an ambulance and I'd been put in the cat[egory]-two stack?"" She went on to say it was not the fault of the ambulance service and the whole system was ""working unrelentingly to solve this but to no great avail"". Ms Lee said hospitals were struggling to discharge patients, because of a lack of social care, and so delays were building up in the rest of the system. Allow Twitter content?

Amazon posts loss as online sales falter,"Amazon has reported its first quarterly loss since 2015 due to lower online sales and a fall in the value of its shares in electric vehicle firm Rivian. Online sales at the e-commerce giant slipped 3% in the first three months of the year, as the boom to its business from the pandemic starts to fade. Meanwhile, Apple warned its sales could be hit by up to $8bn (Â£6.4bn) following disruptions from lockdowns in China. Both firms face supply chain issues and the impact of the war in Ukraine. Growth in other parts of Amazon's business, including cloud computing and advertising, remained strong. The company reported a loss of $3.8bn, mainly due to a loss of $7.6bn on the value of its stake in Rivian. Amazon invested in Rivian in 2019 with plans for an electric delivery fleet and owns a near-20% stake in the company. But the electric vehicle maker's share price has more than halved since the beginning of the year as the company has struggled to ramp up production. Overall, Amazon forecast sales growth of as little as 3% in the coming months - a marked slowdown from the double digit growth it has enjoyed in recent years, even before the pandemic. ""The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,"" Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said. He added that the company was also facing increased costs, with ""ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures"". Shares in Amazon fell 12% as trading got under way in the US on Friday. Amazon raises US price for Prime as profits jump Amazon workers win battle to form first US union The firm's overall sales continued to rise, up 7% year-on-year to $116.4bn, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the company's cloud-computing division and reliable profit driver. AWS revenues were up 37% year-on-year, while advertising revenue was also strong, rising 23%. But elsewhere growth showed marked slowdown - especially in its international business, where sales sank 6%. Expenses are also rising rapidly, with inflation adding $2bn in costs during the quarter. The company has increased wages to attract staff in the face of labour shortages and is also facing a widening drive to introduce unions in the US. Meanwhile, higher fuel prices have made delivery costs more expensive. Amazon has already said it is raising the price of its Prime service, which gives subscribers access to benefits like faster shipping, for US customers, citing increased wage and shipping costs. iPhone maker Apple said it was continuing to see strong demand for its products Shares in Apple also slipped as investors worried about possible supply chain disruption in the months ahead. The iPhone maker had reported a 9% rise in second-quarter sales to $97.3bn, while profits climbed more than 10% to $25bn. But executives struck a less optimistic tone in a call with analysts, describing a ""challenging macroeconomic environment"". The company warned of a $4bn-$8bn hit to its sales in the three months to the end of June because of disruptions to global supply chains. ""We are not immune to these challenges but we have great confidence in our teams, in our products and service and in our strategy,"" chief executive Tim Cook said. Covid-related shutdowns in China and chip shortages are limiting the firm's ability to meet demand for its products, Mr Cook said. He added that he was more concerned about those supply issues than that buyers will cut spending. Chinese authorities are trying to contain a coronavirus outbreak in Beijing after locking down the financial and manufacturing hub of Shanghai. Mr Cook said Apple's problems in China were ""primarily centred"" in Shanghai, but noted that infections in the city have now fallen. ""Almost all of [our] affected final assembly factories have now restarted,"" he added. Companies making Apple products have been affected by rising Covid cases in China,with several temporarily suspending production in recent weeks due to lockdown restrictions. Technology company Pegatron, which is a major producer of the iPhone, temporarily suspended production at two of its Chinese factories earlier this month. Apple and Amazon are by no means the only tech giants to be facing tougher times. Earlier this week,Facebook owner Meta reported its slowest revenue growth in a decade, as businesses pull back on advertising amid rising costs and economic uncertainty. Last week,Netflix also warned its revenue growth had slowed considerablyafter it lost subscribers due to stiff competition from rivals and the rising cost of living.

Some men in politics behave like animals - minister,"This video can not be played Watch: Attorney General speaks to BBC Woman's Hour about male behaviour in politics A minority of men in politics ""behave like animals"", Attorney General Suella Braverman has said, as female MPs share experiences of sexism and harassment. Speaking to BBC's Woman's Hour, Ms Braverman said the problem started in wider society and there needed to be a discussion about ""moral standards"". Her comments come as an unnamed minister accused a fellow Tory MP of watching porn in the Commons chamber. Ms Braverman said she was ""ashamed"" the MP ""wore a Conservative rosette"". Ex-minister Baroness Nicky Morgan described the claim as ""a jaw-dropper"" and said: ""If this happened in any other working place somebody would be sacked for gross misconduct."" However, she said the situation for MPs was different. ""There are no employment contracts, nobody is going to take their job away from them - that gives MPs a feeling of invincibility."" Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? Labour figure made lewd comments to MP - claim The allegation that a Tory MP watched pornography in the Commons was made at a meeting on Tuesday night. Chris Heaton-Harris - the government's chief whip - looked into the matter, but has now referred it to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). Prime Minister Boris Johnson said watching pornography in the workplace was ""completely unacceptable"" and that ""the proper procedures"" should be activated. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""nothing wrong"" with the ICGS process, but added: ""I think the Tory party, they know who this is, they should take action now."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has urged the Conservatives to ""get their act together"" and ""get rid"" of the MP in question. Asked about the wider problem, Ms Braverman said she had never ""been made to feel uncomfortable"" during her time in Parliament, but there were some ""bad apples"". She said: ""My personal experience, I've been an MP for seven years, been in the Conservative Party and in politics for 20 years - on no occasion have I been made to feel uncomfortable and all the men I have worked with have been respectful. ""There is however a very small minority of men who fall short - and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing Parliament into disrepute."" She said it was a ""worrying symptom"" of a wider problem in society and said watching porn in public had become ""normalised"". ""We've got to look more profoundly at the coarsening of behaviour in our culture and some of the mixed messages we are sending our children. ""On the one hand we have women saying 'it is my right to post photos of myself in underwear, it is empowering to pose naked online, don't be so prudish, don't curb my liberty' - and on other hand we are denouncing the permissiveness that is enabling that. ""We've got to take this moment to reflect on what we are doing to lower standards of behaviour."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said pornography in the workplace was ""unacceptable"" and that he hoped action would be taken if the claim was proven. Asked about Parliament's working environment, he said: ""The problem in the House of Commons is ultimately the overall culture of long hours, bars and people sometimes under pressure and after all of that, that can create a toxic mix that leads to all sorts of things."" Labour's Jess Phillipstweeted,externalthat ""the culture in Westminster is an excuse oft used by perpetrators to get out of bad behaviour."" Angela Rayner says the ""sexist slurs"" were ""mortifying and deeply hurtful"" Their comments come amid renewed concern over misogyny in Parliament, as well as accusations of sexual harassment. An MP who wished to remain anonymous told the BBC a member of the shadow cabinet had described her as her party's ""secret weapon"" adding, in graphic language, that women want to be her friend and men want to sleep with her. A Labour spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously. They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken."" Two SNP MPs - Patrick Grady and Patricia Gibson - arefacingallegations of sexual harassment. The party has said individuals were entitled to have complaints dealt with confidentially and it would be inappropriate to comment further. And earlier this week, politicians across the partiescondemneda suggestion made in a newspaper that Labour's Angela Rayner tries to distract Boris Johnson in the Commons by crossing and uncrossing her legs. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says sexual harassment is ""intolerable"" and constitutes âgrounds for dismissalâ On Wednesday, Green MP Caroline Lucascited a report in The Sunday Times,externalthat said a total of 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, were facing allegations of sexual misconduct after being reported to the ICGS, and asked the prime minister whether such behaviour was grounds for dismissal under the ministerial code. Mr Johnson replied that sexual harassment was ""of course...grounds for dismissal"". Under aCode of Conduct,externalapproved by the Commons, MPs have a duty to behave at all times in their public life ""with probity and integrity"" Members are expected to observe the principles of ""respect, professionalism, understanding others' perspectives, courtesy, and acceptance of responsibility"" The Code says they should not do anything which would ""cause significant damage to the reputation and integrity"" of the House or MPs in general Allegations of sexual misconduct can be referred to Parliament'sIndependent Complaints and Grievance Scheme,external The current complaints scheme - the ICGS - was set up in 2018 following complaints about how claims of sexual harassment by MPs were dealt with. The new procedure removes MPs from the process of judging whether one of their colleagues had breached rules on bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct. Under the process, an independent panel can recommend sanctions if an MP is found guilty. If it recommends suspending an MP from the Houses of Parliaments, this would need to be approved by MPs. If an MP is suspended for at least 10 days, their constituents can demand a by-election through a recall petition.

"Woman's cake, stolen in 1945, replaced by US Army","Meri Mion, whose cake was stolen during the final days of World War Two The US Army has given a birthday cake to an Italian woman - to replace one that American soldiers stole from her as it cooled by a window 77 years ago. Meri Mion - who turns 90 on Friday - was 13 when her village of San Pietro, near Vicenza, saw fighting between US troops and German soldiers. Her mother made her a birthday cake, but it was taken by the opportunistic - and presumably hungry - Americans. Ms Mion said she would share the replacement cake with her relatives. ""We will eat that dessert with all my family, remembering this wonderful day that I will never forget,"" she said. The US Army presented the cake at a ceremony on Thursday at Giardini Salvi in Vicenza, alongside members of the military, local officials and residents. Sgt Peter Wallis, who handed over the dessert, said it was ""a little awkward"" to replace the stolen goods, ""but it makes me feel great"". At the ceremony, Col Matthew Gomlak, commander of the US Army garrison in Italy, spoke of the fighting in 1945 between US and German forces at Corso San Felice e Fortunato in Vicenza. At least 19 US soldiers were killed or wounded, and several US tanks destroyed. Local Italians offered bread and wine to the American troops. ""That warm welcome by the people of Vicenza continues to this day,"" Col Gomlak said. Sgt Wallis (right) and Col Gomlak (left) present the cake to Meri Mion The night before her birthday, all those years ago, Ms Mion hid with her mother in the attic at their farm as fighting raged nearby. The next morning, her mother made the cake. But ""her happiness turned into disappointment later when the resourceful American soldiers made off with [it]"", Col Gomlak said. Video on the US Army website showsMs Mion wiping away tears,externalas the cake was handed over, while ""happy birthday"" was sung in Italian and English.

Isolated Russia divided over Ukraine offensive,"A mysterious art installation in St Petersburg which translates as ""we will replace"" No one knows who put it here. But something rather odd has appeared in the centre of St Petersburg. A bizarre art installation made up of one word: ""ZAMESTIM"" (""We will replace""). Each letter is the first letter of an international brand that has suspended operations in Russia. Their company logos are featured, too. Z is for Zara. A is for Adidas. M means McDonald'sâ¦ Hundreds of international companies have pulled out of Russia in protest at the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine. Officials here have been trying to sound upbeat, claiming that Russia will find local replacements for foreign items no longer available. But the disappearance of global products and services adds to Russia's growing sense of international isolation. That seems a strange thing to be saying in St Petersburg. After all, Emperor Peter the Great designed and built this city to make Russia feel like a part of Europe. Mural on the side of a building in St Petersburg Out of marshland he created a breathtakingly beautiful Russian Amsterdam or Venice, with myriad canals and stunning palaces. With the help of European artists and architects rose an imperial capital with a European face. Yet three centuries on, the gulf between Russia and Europe grows wider by the day. Do Russians care? Many here claim not to. ""Russia's not Europe. Russia is Russia,"" says Lubov, who has stopped to chat to me by the ""ZAMESTIM"" art installation. Lubov tells me she doesn't follow what's happening in Ukraine. ""It's an unpleasant news story,"" she says. ""So, I try not to watch TV. So that I don't get upset."" My next conversation next to ""ZAMESTIM"" is with Raisa. She gets all her news from Russian TV. ""The Ukrainians are to blame for the violence,"" Raisa says. ""They're ganging up on us. Those nationalists are deploying weapons on our border. How certain are you that what Russian TV is telling you is the truth?"" I ask. ""Knowing the Russian people like I do, I'm 100% sure."" How many Raisas are there in Russia? What percentage of the Russian public support what President Putin calls his ""Special Military Operation"" in Ukraine? More than 80%, according to recent surveys. I'm sceptical. In an authoritarian country like Russia, the accuracy of public opinion polling is questionable. Fear skews results. Over the past two months, most of the Russians we have approached on the streets for interview have declined to speak about Ukraine, preferring to keep their opinions to themselves. Of those who did express views on the record, many repeated almost word for word what state TV has been telling them, reproducing the parallel reality created by the Kremlin. They speak of Russian troops ""liberating Ukraine"" and ""fighting Nazism in Ukraine."" Graffiti reads ""no to war"" But when I take a stroll through the historic centre of St Petersburg, I discover a very different picture. Among the city's famous courtyards, I find plenty of anti-war graffiti. In some cases, anti-Putin slogans, too, have been scrawled on walls. There are other forms of protest. Earlier this month St Petersburg artist Sasha Skochilenko was arrested and charged with spreading fake news about the Russian armed forces. She is accused of replacing price tags in a supermarket with anti-war messages. Sasha is being held in pre-trial detention. ""This shows that free speech in our country is being stamped out,"" Sasha Skochilenko's partner, Sonia Subbotina, tells me. ""It shows that political repression is getting worse and that people with anti-war views are being persecuted and put in prison."" Sasha Skochilenko has been charged with spreading fake news ""There was protest activity in Russia. People were coming out to protest. But each protest is a major risk. You can be arrested, you can be beaten, you can be put in jail. Right now I feel completely lost. I don't know if anything can be done."" Those in power in Russia are demanding unflinching support from the Russian people: for the direction in which the Kremlin is taking Russia, away from Europe; for the anti-Western rhetoric emanating from Moscow; and for Russia's military offensive in Ukraine - no matter what the consequences here at home.

NHS boss feared waiting for ambulance after strokeA hospital chief executive's husband drove her to A&E because of concerns over long 999 waits.,"An NHS boss who had a stroke was taken to A&E by her husband rather than calling for an ambulance because of concerns over long waits. In a series of tweets, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust chief executive Deborah Lee praised his swift actions. She said he had ""bundled her into his car"", last week, after she had showed the signs of a stroke because he had heard her ""lamenting ambulance delays"". She is recovering but says it may have been different if they had called 999. Waits for an ambulance in England are the longest since new targets were introduced, in 2017. And Ms Lee's regional service - the South West - has the longest waits in the country, with category-two calls, which include strokes, taking nearly two hours, on average, to reach patients in March. The target is 18 minutes. In the tweets, Ms Lee said: ""Naturally, I am eternally grateful to my husband for his swift actionsâ¦ but I can't get one thing out of my head. ""What if my husband hadn't been there and my daughter had called for an ambulance and I'd been put in the cat[egory]-two stack?"" She went on to say it was not the fault of the ambulance service and the whole system was ""working unrelentingly to solve this but to no great avail"". Ms Lee said hospitals were struggling to discharge patients, because of a lack of social care, and so delays were building up in the rest of the system. Allow Twitter content?

Brexit import checks delayed for fourth time,"The government has delayed introducing more checks on EU goods entering the UK over fears it will disrupt supply chains and add to rising inflation. New import controls on EU food products had been due to begin in July. The government said ""it would be wrong to impose new administrative burdens and risk disruption at ports"" at a time of higher costs due to the war in Ukraine and rising energy prices. It is the fourth time it has delayed EU import checks since the UK left the EU. Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government was reviewing how it would implement checks on EU goods and ""the new controls regime will come into force at the end of 2023"". He claimed that the delay would save British businesses up to Â£1bn in annual costs. Mr Rees-Mogg said it would have been ""an act of self-harm"" if the government had decided to go ahead with the import controls. He said the checks would have brought ""quite significant"" price increases for people at a time when the government was ""trying to reduce costs."" These would have included a ""71% increase - maximum level - on the retail price"" of small deliveries like cheese. He said: ""You would have been adding potentially Â£500 of costs on a shipment of fish fingers, that then falls through to the consumer."" Business groups welcomed the move. ""We are dealing with significant supply chain stress and inflationary costs this year and this would have made a bad situation much worse,"" said Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation. The Federation of Small Businesses said: ""Imposition of full import controls this summer would have meant yet another burden for small firms which are already wrestling with new trade rules and spiralling operating costs."" However, ports, which have spent millions of pounds gearing up for the checks, said they had been ""landed with the bill of the government Brexit border U-turn"". They have been building border control posts that would allow checks on imports of EU food and animals. But those checks have not only been delayed, but may not be needed if a ""light touch"" regime is brought in, potentially meaning that the new infrastructure will be ""useless"", the British Ports Association said. ""This announcement is a major policy change, meaning the facilities will effectively become white elephants, wasting millions of pounds of public and private funding, not to mention the huge effort there has been to get things ready in time,"" the association's chief executive Richard Ballantyne said. He said ports were looking for ""clarification from policy makers if there will be any type of financial assistance or compensation for ports and also if operators can start to bulldozer the facilities and use the sites for other purposes"". The Major Ports Group, which represents major UK ports and freeports, said they had been ""working incredibly hard and have invested over Â£100m of their own money"" in new border posts which could be ""highly bespoke white elephants"". Meanwhile, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the decision was ""another blow to farm businesses that are already struggling with enormous inflationary costs and ongoing labour shortages"". ""Our producers have to meet stringent controls to export their own products abroad, all while being left at a continued competitive disadvantage to our EU competitors, who are still enjoying an extended grace period which gives them access to the prized UK market relatively cost and burden free,"" NFU president Minette Batters said. She added that checks on agricultural food imports were ""absolutely critical to the nation's biosecurity, animal health and food safety"". The British Veterinary Association also criticised the move, saying it ""flies in the face not only of common sense, but also of the government's commitment to preserving high levels of animal and human health in the UK"". James Russell, the association's senior vice president, said it had repeatedly warned that delaying veterinary checks further ""could weaken vital lines of defence"" against diseases. This is more than just yet another delay on the post-Brexit system for imports. It is, says the government, a significant change of policy that could mean wide-ranging laborious physical checks on food imports from the EU might never be introduced. Such checks were originally thought to be the inevitable consequence of the distant harder Brexit deal struck by Boris Johnson. What is certain is that such checks are in the long grass, and that will come as a huge relief to many in the logistics industry and in particular the supermarkets. The government's plan is that a new digital trade border, applying to the whole world, will be in place at least in trial form by the end of 2023. This will mean that only a tiny proportion of the physical checks on food imports due to have rolled out from this July will be needed. For Mr Rees-Mogg, agreeing lower trade barriers than had been planned is good policy. But it is an about-turn to lower barriers to provide an incentive for the EU to reduce its equivalent stringent checks on UK food exports. For now, the supermarkets will be happy to avoid what could have been an acute source of further supply chain and inflationary pressure. But some UK food exporters face the triple whammy of marathon length haulage queues in Kent, dozens of pages of red tape for sales in Europe, and no equivalent restrictions on competition from abroad for the UK market.

Welsh campaigners' anger over English name change,"The owners of the holiday park say the rebrand is part of a Â£5m investment A holiday park that changed its Welsh name to an English one has come under fire from language campaigners. Glan y MÃ´r holiday park in Ceredigion is now known as Aber Bay. ""We are very concerned that places and properties across Wales are being renamed in English,"" said Welsh language group Cymdeithas yr Iaith, adding the names often replace old and historical ones. Owner Allens Caravans said the site's original farmhouse remains Glan y MÃ´r. ""The holiday park has been known as Glan y MÃ´r for [more than] a century and this is a descriptive and well-known name,"" said Cymdeithas chairman Jeff Smith. The group said the renaming was ""a step in the wrong direction"" and urged the holiday park owners to abandon the renaming proposals. Welsh house names 'should be protected by law' New streets in Cardiff to be given Welsh names 'Proper' spellings of Welsh names unveiled Allens Caravans took over the park in 2017. The firm, which manages nine caravan sites across the UK, is spending Â£5m to redevelop the site with a new clubhouse and facilities. ""Despite our best endeavours to market the park to new customers, we were met with complaints and issues prior to our ownership,"" a spokesperson said. Allens Caravans said it had only been contacted by four people living in the area since the name change. The holiday park, near Aberystwyth, had been known by its Welsh name for more than a hundred years, Cymdeithas yr Iaith said But campaigners want rules in place to stop Welsh names from being changed to English ones. ""The very fact that the owners of the holiday park are allowed to anglicise the original name underlines the need for legislation to protect Welsh language place names,"" Cymdeithas said. ""After years of delay, we need to see action from the Welsh government on this.""

Netflix among streamers facing new UK regulations,"Netflix hits such as Bridgerton would be subject to Ofcom regulations, bringing them into line with public service broadcasters Streaming services are set to be regulated by Ofcom for the first time, under government proposals that also reiterate plans to privatise Channel 4. Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and other streamers will be given new rules bringing them in line with traditional broadcasters.

BBC Newscast asked her about privatising Channel 4, and she said one of the reasons was that ""the money we will get from the capital from the sale will be invested back into that sector, into training and skills"". She talked about ""at least 18 or 19 independent film studios opening in the UK next year"" adding that there are people ""all across the UK"" who would love to work in the creative industries, and the importance of ""putting money back into training, into those areas that need levelling up."" While linear TV channels must currently abide by Ofcom rules, most Video on Demand (VoD) services are not currently subject to the regulator's Broadcasting Code. The changes put forward would oblige VoDs to protect audiences from harmful or offensive material, and adhere to rules regarding accuracy, fairness and privacy. The move will be welcomed by public service broadcasters (PSBs), who have been lobbying for streaming services to face the same regulations as them for several years. Streaming services such as Netflix could now face similar regulation to public service broadcasters The government said the new rules will primarily affect ""TV-like"" VoD services such as Netflix, ITV Hub and Now, and would ""level the playing field"". Currently, the BBC iPlayer is the only VoD service which has to abide by Ofcom's Broadcasting Code. But the proposals mean Ofcom would have the powers to draft and enforce a new VoD Code, to ensure that all streamers are subject to stricter rules. The government said the maximum fine for regulated VoD services which break the rules will be Â£250,000, or an amount up to 5% of an organisation's revenue, whichever is higher. It's A Sin, set during the 1980s Aids crisis, is one of Channel 4's biggest hits of recent years The government's intention to privatise Channel 4, which is currently publicly owned but commercially funded, is also set out in the White Paper. It says a ""change of ownership in Channel 4 will give it the tools it needs to succeed in the future as a public service broadcaster while protecting its distinctiveness"". But the proposals have been unpopular with Channel 4, which said earlier this month it was disappointed with the plans. Chief executive Alex Mahon said,externalthere was no evidence that privatisation would benefit the channel. Labour is also against the move, with shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell telling the Commons: ""Nothing screams rudderless government like fixating on the governance of Channel 4 while people's energy bills are going through the roof. Why sell off Channel 4, and why now?"" Ms Powell added the privatisation of Channel 4 ""will mean fewer British-made programmes for British audiences and fewer British jobs"". However, Ms Dorries said Channel 4 faces ""serious challenges"" which are restricting its growth - and anyone ""choosing to dismiss them"" is ""burying their head in the sand"". In her written statement to the Commons, the culture secretary said that while Channel 4 has ""more than fulfilled the original aim for setting it up"", due to the changing broadcasting environment, like ""every other broadcaster, it now faces huge competition for audience share - and many of its competitors have incredibly deep pockets"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the White Paper would ""usher in a new golden age for British TV and radio"" The government also plans to bring in legislation to ensure public service broadcasters' content is given prominence on connected devices and major online platforms, including smart TVs and set-top boxes. That includes services like BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5. The first five linear channels the public find when switching on their televisions are PSBs, the White Paper notes, because these slots are reserved in electronic programme guides on TV sets, including on platforms such as Sky and Virgin Media. However, the government acknowledged PSBs have been finding it increasingly difficult to secure their presence and maintain their prominence on newer and global platforms, something the new rules would address. The BBC was limited to only two live streams at the Tokyo Olympics because of rights restrictions Plans to change the digital broadcast rights for major sporting events such as the Olympic Games, men's World Cup finals, men's FA Cup final, Grand National and Wimbledon singles finals, are also set out. Current broadcasting rules state that events of national interest should be available to view live, and for free, by the widest possible audience. As a result, broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 currently air most major sporting events. However, digital rights are not covered by the current legislation, known as the listed events regime. That means PSBs can broadcast events live, but do not always have the catch-up rights. The Paper says that if, for example, the Olympic men's 100m final took place overnight and a different broadcaster owned the catch-up rights, a wide audience may miss out on watching it for free. The proposals will strengthen the position of PSBs at a time when many are struggling to keep some of their biggest sporting events. Last year, viewers complained that BBC coverage of the Tokyo Olympics was less than in previous years, afterthe International Olympic Committee (IOC) struck a deal with US broadcast giant Discovery.,external An Ofcom spokesman told BBC News: ""We're pleased to see the government taking forward many of our recommendations, particularly around securing prominence for on-demand public service content. We will continue to offer support with the development of future legislation."" In a statement, ITV said: ""We will engage carefully with the substance of the White Paper once it is published, but many of its proposals - notably reform to prominence and inclusion rules, a more flexible approach to remits, and changes to the listed events regime - look very sensible."" Channel 4 said it ""will study the White Paper issued by DCMS, and a considered response will follow"". It added: ""However, Channel 4 remains committed to upholding and maximising its remit and public service purpose that has enabled it to shape Britain's creative culture and make a significant contribution to the creative industries."" Netflix said: ""As we've previously said, we are supportive of measures to update the legal framework and bring our service in the UK under Ofcom's jurisdiction. We look forward to reviewing the White Paper's other proposals and continuing to engage with the government on their plans."" A BBC spokesman said: ""We welcome the steps to secure the ongoing success of public service broadcasters, including the increased and improved prominence of our services on TVs and platforms. ""We also look forward to engaging with the government on both the forthcoming mid-term review and then the national debate on the next Charter. ""The White Paper recognises the BBC's critical role in supporting the UK creative sector and we remain focused on delivering great value for all licence fee payers and representing the UK to audiences around the world."" $50bn wiped off Netflixâs value as subscribers quit Have we had enough of Netflix?

Holding the line in Donbas,"Lt Denys Gordeev and his men are facing the full force of the Russian Army Ukrainian forces have been holding the line in Donbas since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists. They're still holding the line, but what was sporadic fighting has now turned into a full-blown war. Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. So far they've been gaining ground around the city of Izium in the north, and around Severedonetsk and Popasna to the east. The attacks are coming from multiple directions, though as yet there's been no major Russian breakthrough. Lt Gordeev says he and his men are experiencing the effects. The day before we visited, one of his men was killed and another five wounded. It's just a fraction of the casualties Ukrainian forces are now taking every day, though there are no official figures. We tried to visit a field hospital nearby but were told they were too busy. So is this the big Russian surge that has been widely forecast? Or is this just a prelude to such an onslaught? It's not clear. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. They also concede that Ukraine will probably have to trade space and ground in open areas to defend key cities where the Russians will find it more difficult to fight. I was allowed to visit Lt Gordeev's forward position during a brief lull in the fighting. They've built a religious shrine at a command post. They're praying for victory. But it's not the place for contemplation or peace.  You could still hear the regular blast of artillery. Ukrainian soldiers have made this shrine at a frontline position in the Donbas On the short walk to his trench line, he tells me mortar and sniper fire are constant threats. Their closest position is within 600m of Russian forces. The landscape is mostly wide open countryside. Tree lines provide some cover but we're close enough to hear the occasional burst of small arms fire. The Russians ""are coming and coming and coming into territory of Ukraine. And we don't know when they will stop. We don't know when their journey ends,"" says Lt Gordeev. He was a lawyer before he joined the Ukrainian army. One day he hopes he can return to that life. But for now, he says, he's focused on winning this war. Down in the trenches, out of sight of the enemy, the mood is more relaxed, though the tired faces of soldiers clearly show the strains of recent fighting. They show us some of the weapons they've been using - a DschK Soviet heavy machine gun, still used in conflicts around the world, and a variety of rocket-propelled grenades. It's mostly older Soviet-era kit. but also they proudly show off their one British-made and supplied anti-tank missile - a NLAW (Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon). A Ukrainian soldier carries a UK made and supplied anti-tank missile One of Lt Gordeev's men was trained in how to use it by British troops just before the war started. They've already employed it to destroy a Russian tank, they say. ""We need these weapons,"" says Lt Gordeev repeatedly. Russia, he says, is a ""military state"" - in contrast, Ukraine's ability to keep its own weapons flowing has been severely damaged. What the West supplies, or does not, will heavily influence the outcome of this war. What weapons has the US given Ukraine - and how much do they help? And Lt Gordeev says the morale of his troops remains high. They're fighting for their homeland. But President Putin wants and needs something he can call a win, and soon - possibly by 9 May for Russia's victory day parade. Ukraine may have time on its side - but only if the flow of Western weapons continues and if they can hold back the expected Russian onslaught.

he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region.

""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". Read morehere A Ukrainian soldier guarding the Chernobyl plant Ukraineâs state electricity operator Ukrenergo says it has
restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"".

restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Council criticised over refugee family's home plan,"The court action was brought in Scotland's highest civil court A judge has criticised a council for saying it would ignore a ruling to find larger accommodation for a refugee family with an autistic son. The case at the Court of Session was brought by a woman, known as X, who was granted refugee status in 2020. Glasgow City Council had argued it had fulfilled its obligations by providing a three-bedroom home when no larger properties were available. Lord Ericht said the local authority had ""no choice"" in the matter. The judge's observation was issued at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Scotland's highest civil court, in his findings that it was ""fundamental for the rule of law"" that Glasgow City Council follow its obligation to secure housing for the household. The family of six - comprised of X, her husband, three daughters aged 14, 12 and 10, and the 12-year-old son who was diagnosed with a learning disability. The court heard an occupational therapist had recommended that the family be given a five-apartment home - with four bedrooms and a living room - in the Glasgow City Council area to accommodate the son's needs. However, the local authority told the family that it could not supply a house of that size as it was dependent on housing associations to supply homes and nothing of that size was available. Glasgow City Council believed that it had fulfilled its legal obligations and that X's family could continue to live at a four-roomed house in the city. Solicitor advocate Mike Dailly, from Govan Law Centre, took the case to to the Court of Session, arguing the council had a legal obligation to provide a five-roomed apartment. Lord Erichtruled in X's favour,external. Lawyers for Glasgow City Council had told Lord Ericht that it planned to ignore the order as it could not provide the kind of property required by the family. This submission prompted Lord Ericht to criticise the council. He wrote: ""In this case however the respondent adopted the wholly extraordinary position that an order for specific performance should not be granted because it proposed not to comply with the court's decision and instead continue to act unlawfully. ""It is fundamental to the rule of law that public authorities obey the law and obey the courts."" He added: ""The duty must be discharged: the authority has no choice."" However, the judge pointed out that the court could not decide how the council complied with the law, saying ""the authority must find a way and must allocate appropriate resources to do so"". The family was provided with a four-room house by Glasgow City Council after refugee status was granted in February 2020. Before then they had lived in housing supplied by the Home Office. In August 2021, lawyers wrote to the council saying that it should find them a more suitable house. A caseworker assigned to the family then told them the local authority had transferred all its homes to housing associations and that no larger houses were available. Lawyers for the Glasgow City Council told Lord Ericht that they may have had to use compulsory purchase powers to acquire properties, demolish them and re-build them as five-apartment properties. They also pointed out that the boy could have had his own room in the family's current home if his sisters shared a room. The judge rejected the submissions made by the council and fixed another hearing into the progress that the local authority had made in finding suitable accommodation. Lord Ericht said: ""Having said all that, I appreciate that there may be practical issues for the respondent in complying with an order for specific performance immediately upon the issue of this opinion."" He added: ""It will not be acceptable for the local authority to say that it does not intend to comply.""

Women's running ad 'not representing the truth',"Samsung's advert for the Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Buds shows a young woman running alone in the middle of the night Samsung has apologised for a recent advert which showed a woman getting up at 02:00 to go for a run through the streets of a city alone. The advert has been criticised by some women's running groups and safety campaigners for being ""unrealistic"". Samsung has told Radio 1 Newsbeat it was never its intention to ""be insensitive to ongoing conversations around women's safety."" ""We apologise for how this may have been received,"" it adds. ""The 'Night Owls' campaign was designed with a positive message in mind: to celebrate individuality and freedom to exercise at all hours."" Women's safety group Reclaim These Streets has described it as ""tone deaf"" in light of the death of Ashling Murphy who was killed on a run in January. The 23-year-old's death in Tullamore, Ireland, opened up the conversation about how unsafe some women feel running alone, especially at night. Teacher's killing a 'depraved act of violence' Man, 31, charged with murdering Ashling Murphy How many violent attacks on women are there? It sparked the hashtag #shewasonarun as posts and stories were shared about women being harassed while out running. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Samsung replied to some of the comments on social media saying: ""We can assure you that the meaning for this advert is for all Galaxy customers/viewers to achieve their health and wellness goals on their own schedules"". But one of the main things that Esther Newman points out is that the lead character is running with headphones on. ""Wearing headphones is a contentious point. Most women runners I know don't wear headphones, and that's during the day, because they are concerned about their safety."" Esther Newman is editor of Women's Running magazine and podcast She is keen to point out that her contributors believe ""it's a very, very small portion of blokes who make us feel unsafe"" but suggests advertisers should focus their attention on how men can make female runners feel more at ease. Other critics questioned whether enough female production crew were involved in the making of the advert; a point picked up by the women's safety campaign group Reclaim These Streets, which was set up afterSarah Everard's murder. They told Radio 1 Newsbeat the advert was ""totally tone deaf and demonstrates the lack of female decision makers on the campaign, especially in light of Ashling Murphy having been killed on a jog in January."" Cofounder Jamie Klingler added: ""It's almost laughable how badly this ad lands."" Run Mummy Run, an online running community, agreed that the portrayal of a woman running at night, in those circumstances, was unrealistic. They said: ""The implication seems to be that a woman has the luxury of this type of freedom with her safety, but sadly this is not the current reality.""

German energy firm gives in to Russian rouble demand,"One of Germany's biggest energy firms has said it is preparing to buy Russian gas using a payment system that critics say will undermine EU sanctions. Uniper says it will pay in euros which will be converted into roubles, meeting a Kremlin demand for all transactions to be made in the Russian currency. Other European energy firms are reportedly preparing to do the same amid concerns about supply cuts. Uniper said it had no choice but said it was still abiding by EU sanctions. ""We consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible,"" a spokesman told the BBC. ""For our company and for Germany as a whole, it is not possible to do without Russian gas in the short term; this would have dramatic consequences for our economy."" Germany's biggest energy supplier RWE declined to comment on how it would pay for Russian gas. In late March, Russia said ""unfriendly countries"" would have to start paying for its oil and gas in roubles to prop up its currency after Western allies froze billions of dollars it held in foreign currencies overseas. Under the decree, European importers must pay euros or dollars into an account at Gazprombank, the Swiss-based trading arm of Gazprom, and then convert this into roubles in a second account in Russia. The European Commission said last week that if buyers of Russian gas could complete payments in euros and get confirmation of this before any conversion into roubles took place, that would not breach sanctions. However there are different views among countries on how to interpret its initial guidance, and this week EC boss Ursula von der Leyen sparked confusion when she said firms could still be breaking the rules. On Thursday, an EU official confirmed that any attempt to convert cash into roubles in Russia would be a ""clear circumvention of sanctions"" as the transaction would involve Russia's central bank. ""What we cannot accept is that companies are obliged to open a second account and that between the first and second account, the amount in euros is in the full hands of the Russian authorities and the Russian Central Bank, and that the payment is only complete when it is converted into roubles."" How much does Europe rely on Russia for gas? Russia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU Russia halts gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria On Tuesday, Poland and Bulgaria both refused to pay for gas in roubles leading to Russian state gas firm Gazprom shutting off supplies. Both countries had already planned not to renew their contracts with Gazprom when they expired later in 2022. Poland - one of the staunchest advocates of tougher sanctions on Russia - said the EU should penalise countries that used roubles to pay for Russian gas. Climate minister Anna Moskwa singled out Germany, Hungary and Austria as resisting a gas embargo. ""We are counting on there being consequences for these countries [which pay in roubles] and that as a result they will cease paying in roubles,"" she said. The move by Russia - which has not given countries the same deadline to begin paying in roubles - is seen as an attempt to divide Western allies in their response over Ukraine. The majority - 97% - of EU companies' gas supply contracts with Gazprom stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Hungary and Slovakia have both said they will use Russia's conversion payment method, while German economy minister Robert Habeck said on Wednesday that it was ""the path that the EU marked out for us"". ""It's the path that is compatible with sanctions, and as far as I understand the German companies that are doing it this way are inÂ compliance with their contracts,"" he said. ""Most EU countries are taking this approach."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, but it is much higher for some countries and sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. ""A lot of European companies will say OK, we'll pay into a euro-denominated bank account and there will be a back-to-back trade so they stay within the limits of the EU sanctions,"" said Nathan Piper, an energy analyst at Investec. ""But there are two sides of this - those firms need to supply gas to consumers and in Germany there is no alternative to supplies of Russian gas right now."" According to the Financial Times,external, Austrian energy giant OMV is also planning to adopt the mechanism while Italy's Eni is considering the move. Eni declined to comment while OMV denied it was opening a Swiss account with Gazprom. It told the BBC: ""We have analysed the Gazprom request about payment methods in light of the EU-sanctions and are now working on a sanctions-compliant solution.""

Ukrainian deportees accuse Russia of torture,"Volodymyr Khropun says he was captured by Russian forces and deported to Russia Three weeks since his release, Volodymyr Khropun still looks visibly shaken by the trauma he's endured. A Red Cross volunteer, he was captured by Russian forces, and deported to Russia. On 18 March, Volodymyr was driving a school bus to the village of Kozarovychi, about 40km (25 miles) north-west of Kyiv, to evacuate a few civilians who were stuck there amid the fighting. When he tried to convince Russian soldiers to let him pass their checkpoint, they detained him. For the first few days he was kept in the basement of a factory of a village nearby, along with other civilians, 40 people in a 28 sq m (300 sq ft) room. ""We were beaten with rifles, punched, and kicked. They blindfolded me and tied my hands with duct tape. They used Tasers and kept asking for information about the military,"" Volodymyr said. ""One of the soldiers was very young, almost a child. He used Tasers on people's necks, faces, knees. It's like he was having fun."" After being held for nearly a week in Ukraine, they were transported to Belarus. ""They thought we couldn't see, but I saw the villages we were passing, Ivankiv, Chernobyl and then I saw us crossing the border,"" he said. The ID issued to Volodymyr by the Russian military In Belarus, they were given an identity document. It says it is issued by the military of the Russian Federation and describes Volodymyr's place of birth as the ""Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic"". It is how Ukraine was known prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, before it became an independent country. It is a sign of Russia's ambitions in the region. From Belarus, Volodymyr says, they were taken to a prison in Russia. ""The torture continued. They humiliated us, made us kneel and forced us into uncomfortable positions. If we looked into their eyes, we were beaten. If we did something slowly we were beaten. They treated us like animals,"" he said. One evening Volodymyr counted 72 other people in detention with him. But he could hear there were more. ""We tried to support each other. Some days we couldn't believe this was all happening. It felt like we had been transported to the 16th Century from the 21st Century,"" he said. Two weeks into detention, on 7 April, Volodymyr was taken from prison. He and three female Ukrainian civilians from another detention centre were transported by air to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. The women told Volodymyr they had also been beaten. They didn't understand where they were being taken to, but frequently heard the soldiers use the word ""exchange."" From Crimea they were taken by road to a point 32 km (20 miles) outside Zaporizhzhia, and allowed to walk across a bridge to Ukrainian-controlled territory. The exchange of military prisoners of war from both sides took place before Ukrainian civilians were allowed to walk over. It was 9 April. It had taken them two days to make the journey. Volodymyr struggles to describe how he felt, but he wants the world to hear his story. ""The fact that Ukrainian civilians are being held there [in Russia] is a 100% true."" In the prison, Volodymyr heard that people from the Chernobyl nuclear site were being held in a room next door. It is unclear who exactly the men in the prison were, but 169 Ukrainian National Guard responsible for securing Chernobyl are missing. They were first held in detention in the basement of the nuclear site for weeks when it was occupied by Russian troops. A room where the Ukrainian National Guard were held in Chernobyl Valeriy Semonov, one of the engineers at Chernobyl, said that when Russian forces withdrew at the end of March, they took the guards along. In a village nearby lives the family of one of the missing men. Their identities are being hidden to protect them. On duty in Chernobyl, the serviceman had called his wife on the first day of the invasion, when the nuclear site was taken, to tell her to leave their village. She took her parents and their young son and went to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine. From 24 February to 9 March, she was able to talk to her husband on his mobile phone. ""He would not share much on the phone. He would just say, 'We're OK'. He would tell me to not worry about him,"" she said. ""Then they lost power, so we couldn't connect to his phone."" She still managed to talk to him a few more times over a landline phone at the site. ""The last time I spoke to my husband was on 31 March, on the day they were forcefully taken from Chernobyl. He told me, 'I'm OK physically, but emotionally it's very hard.' I could understand from his voice that he was very worried."" Her son asks about his father all the time. ""I tell him he's at work, but he's very scared. He's worried I will disappear too, and keeps following me around everywhere, to work, to the shops,"" she said. ""It's very tough for us. I just want Russia to release my husband."" Ukraine's interior ministry has told her he is being held in Russia. Married for six-and-a-half years, she said he was always there for her and that he loved his job. The BBC has spoken to the families of more than a dozen people who have been taken hostage by Russian troops. Only a few have returned. The majority are still missing, like Yuliia Payevska. Her husband Vadym told us she was captured by Russian forces on 14 March when she was working as a paramedic in Mariupol, helping evacuate injured soldiers and civilians. Yuliia Payevska's husband says she has been missing since 14 March A propaganda video featuring her was carried by some pro-Kremlin Russian TV channels, which is how he found out she's in Russian captivity. He believes she has been taken to Russia. The Kremlin insists Ukrainian citizens are going to Russia willingly. ""I don't want to respond to these huge liars,"" said Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general. ""There are at least 6,000 civilians who we can identify who have been deported, and from information in mass media in Russia, they say they have taken a million Ukrainians."" She said there have been instances of children being separated from their parents, and that almost everyone who has returned on a prisoner exchange has told them they were tortured and beaten. As the war rages in Ukraine's south and east, every day there are new reports of people being forcibly deported to Russia.

"Shoppers watching every penny, says Sainsbury's","Profits at Sainsbury's have more than doubled but the supermarket has warned it faces tougher times ahead as shoppers see their finances squeezed. It reported an underlying profit of Â£730m for the year to March, up from Â£357m a year earlier. But it expects profits to be lower this year with customers ""watching every penny"" amid the rising cost of living. Sainsbury's said it was trying to limit price increases despite facing higher costs from suppliers. ""We can see the early signs of customers being a bit more cautious, watching every penny, every pound,"" said chief executive Simon Roberts. Consumer goods giant Unilever, which owns brands such as PG Tips and Marmite, said on Thursday that its prices have increased rapidly in the past few months. Prices have gone up by 8.3% as costs for raw materials jumped and Unilever warned it was facing even higher costs for the remainder of the year. Tesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble Why are prices rising so quickly? Sainsbury's said that although it had been raising food prices, the increases were at a slower pace to its rivals. ""We are doing everything we can to keep the prices low on products that really matter to our customers,"" Mr Roberts told the BBC. ""We can see there are challenges and pressures coming in many areas and customers and households are really feeling the pressure on their household finances."" Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's had lowered prices across 150 of its most-purchased fresh products last week. He added the supermarket's own-brand products were also proving more popular with customers, but said it was too early to see if this was a ""long-term trend"". However, households ""still want to buy into the key events"", such as Easter and Mother's Day. Supply chain issues, the Ukraine war and rising raw material costs are all contributing to soaring food prices. Mr Roberts said the situation in Ukraine was pushing up the costs of food production, with the country being a large exporter of fertilisers used in farming. ""We are doing everything we can to pass on [costs] as little as possible [to customers] and we are doing that by working in our business to find cost savings,"" he said. He added shortages in sunflower oil, another product Ukraine exports, meant Sainsbury's was offering alternatives in its stores. Marmite maker Unilever has been putting up its prices Sainsbury's bumper profits come as research suggests the average food bill could increase by Â£271 this year as prices continue to rise. Grocery prices were 5.9% higher in April than a year ago, the biggest increase since December 2011,according to research company Kantar. Sainsbury's has followed the UK's biggest supermarket Tesco in forecasting lower profits for the current year. It said there were ""significant uncertainties"" weighing on the business ahead, due to higher cost pressures and the squeeze on household incomes. The supermarket reported a rise in annual grocery sales, up by 7.6% from two years ago, partly due to dining out being restricted by Covid restrictions. However, non-food sales were hit hard by difficulties with supply chains, with general merchandise sales falling 4.6% on 2019-20. Unilever said its higher prices meant that some customers, especially those in Europe and Latin America, bought less from the company. But the amount of money Unilever made in sales still increased by 7.3% in the first quarter of the year, it said. Chief executive Alan Jope said: ""We are executing well in a very challenging input cost environment.""

Teaching union to take industrial action from 9 May,"The NASUWT is one of the largest teaching unions in Northern Ireland. The NASUWT teaching union is to begin action short of strike in schools in Northern Ireland from 9 May. The action comes afterteaching unions in Northern Ireland rejected a pay offer from the teaching employers. The NASUWT action will affect things like covering for other staff, overseeing exams, lesson plans, inspections and school meetings. The move was detailed in a letter to school principals seen by BBC News NI. It follows a ballot of NASUWT members where more than 80% of those who took part voted for strike action and almost all voted for action short of strike. Separately the NAHT union - which represents many school leaders - has warned that the NASUWT action ""will seriously curtail activities and development across our schools"". In an open letter to the permanent secretary at the Department of Education (DE), the NAHT said ""a fair pay settlement must be pursued with urgency"". They also said it was it was ""unsafe, unreasonable and impossible"" to expect school leaders to take on extra work to keep schools unaffected. Teaching unions brand pay offer inadequate Teachers in NI to be offered 2% pay rise Extra Â£350m needed for pressures in education Teacherspreviously received a 2% pay rise for 2019/20 and 2% again in 2020/21. But the unions rejected as ""inadequate"" a two-year pay offer for the years from 2021 to 2023. The NASUWT say members will not invigilate public examinations The details of the resulting NASUWT action short of strike were contained in a letter sent to school principals. It lists 20 different actions and duties that NASUWT teachers will not carry out in schools from Monday 9 May. Among those are - they will not cooperate with any school inspections or ""attend more than one parents' evening"". They will also ""not attend more than one meeting each month outside pupil session times"" or ""undertake invigilation of public examinations"". The NASUWT also said teachers would not respond to work text messages or emails outside school hours or during lunch. As part of the action, teachers will also not collect money from pupils for school activities, carry out bulk photocopying or cover for staff absence apart from under specific circumstances. Extra-curricular activities could also be affected, but NASUWT said teachers could still organise sports teams, music or drama productions and other clubs if they had volunteered to do so. The NASUWT is one of the largest teaching unions in Northern Ireland. The other unions - INTO, UTU, NEU and NAHT - have also called for ""fair pay for teachers"" but have not yet announced what action they will take if a pay deal is not agreed. The Department of Education haspreviously warned it is facing significant budget pressures in 2022/23. In a separate dispute, members of the Unite union in the Education Authority (EA), local councils and the Housing Executive areon strike over what they have said is an unacceptable 1.75% pay offer. Frances Meehan, of the Education Authority, said special needs schools were being particularly affected by the industrial action. ""We are working with those schools to try and minimise disruption and we have put a number of contingency measures in place,"" she said. ""That disruption can be anything from the child's transport not being available to them, or, indeed, we are aware that two special school establishments have moved to blended or online learning."" She said children who have profound special needs have particular challenges in relation to getting transport. ""Some of them will have medical conditions where, if their normal driver is not available, another driver who would be taking them would need to be trained in the medical equipment they may need en route to school,"" she said. ""We are in contact with and are engaging with our trade union colleagues to try and mitigate the impact that this is having on our special education needs schools and sector. ""Up until now there hasn't been a particularly positive response, but we continue to engage with them.""

Labour figure made lewd comments to MP - claim,"There is concern that the way female MPs are treated will put women off entering politics An MP has spoken out about lewd comments allegedly made to her by a member of the shadow cabinet. She said she was described as a ""secret weapon"" because ""women want to be her friend"" and men want to sleep with her. The Welsh MP, who wants to remain anonymous, said it was not the only sexist or misogynistic behaviour she experienced in Parliament or on parliamentary business. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""deeply concerning"". Sir Keir said he wanted to ""get to the bottom of this and do something about it"" - his Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the claims should be investigated. The MP said that after consulting her team she felt it was not in her best interests to reveal her identity in public or to make a complaint. A spokesperson for the party said that if a complaint was made it would be taken ""extremely seriously"". ""They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken."" Women in politics face 'daily social media abuse' Abuse of women online 'disproportionate' Row over Hamilton's maiden speech The MP described a conversation at an event where someone complimented her on being a ""rising star"" of her party. She said that before she could reply the shadow cabinet member had intervened to describe her as ""a secret weapon. Women want to be her friend"" and, using a swear word, said men want to sleep with her, before adding: ""She is a vote winner."" Mr Ashworth told BBC Breakfast: ""All these claims that we are hearing about, it is shocking, foul [and] disgusting, but is also utterly depressing because parliament in my view is still the arena in which the big issues of the day are sorted out. ""I would now expect the Labour Party to look into that."" BBC Wales has contacted a number of female MPs after the furore over aMail on Sunday articleabout the Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. It contained claims from an unnamed Conservative MP that Ms Rayner crosses and uncrosses her legs in the Commons to distract Boris Johnson. The prime minister condemned the article and the unnamed MP. Ms Rayner said she was""crestfallen"" but had been ""overwhelmed"" by support. But the incident has highlighted concerns over the treatment of women in Parliament and politics. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Fay Jones revealed how she has been subjected to a ""deluge of emails"" after an appearance on the BBC's Newsnight last week. The emails made insulting and offensive comments. ""Ninety-nine per cent of them came from men,"" she said. This video can not be played Welsh MP Fay Jones says she regularly fails to notice harassment because it happens so often She added: ""The language is always about horrible things like suggesting that I was supporting the prime minister - I do not really know how to say this as it is really uncomfortable - but supporting the PM in really untoward measures because that is how I am going to advance my career. I can barely say it."" The MP has since deactivated one of her social media accounts. Ynys Mon Conservative MP Virginia Crosbie did the same in July 2020. Ms Jones said the language in Parliament itself was not as stark, but that there were problems. ""Sometimes I do not notice harassment or someone saying something demeaning or degrading because I am so used to it and that is a problem in and of itself,"" she said. ""It is death by a thousand paper cuts and we have got to a place where we are used to being spoken to in a derogatory way."" Labour's Ruth Jones says women are ""looked up and down"" at Westminster Ruth Jones, who has represented Newport West for Labour since winning a by-election in 2019, drew comparisons between her previous work as a physiotherapist and manager in the NHS, and her work in Parliament. ""Here everybody gets looked up and down,"" she said. ""It is one of those things that unless you are actually in the place I cannot convey to you how demeaning it is sometimes. ""The first time I said 'my face is here', as they were staring elsewhere and they were a bit: 'Oh, you talk back!' ""In my previous role I was a trade union officer and I would have called it out, but here it is: 'accept it, love', and that really bugs me."" Liz Saville Roberts called the Angela Rayner article ""chortling sexism and sheer classist arrogance"" BBC Wales' conversations with MPs have revealed at the very least a consistent theme of female politicians being judged differently to males. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in the Commons, highlighted some media portrayals of female politicians as having a ""constant emphasis on appearance with intent to demean"". She described the Angela Rayner article as a ""combination of chortling sexism and sheer classist arrogance"". Ms Saville Roberts warned that ""you cannot undo the effect of slander"". ""It exists regardless of apologies after the event."" Angela Rayner has said ""sexist slurs"" in the Mail on Sunday were ""mortifying and deeply hurtful"" Labour Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi said it was ""always on her mind"" that a ""woman's appearance is commented on rather than what she is saying"". There was near unanimous concern among the MPs spoken to by BBC Wales that the treatment and portrayal of female politicians could put off other women from pursuing a career in politics. Fay Jones said the experiences of female backbench Conservative MPs were raised on Tuesday night at one of their regular meetings. Also in attendance were the chief whip, leader of the house and party chair. ""All three left the room shocked by what they had heard,"" she said. ""But the fact we are talking about it means we are better able to call it out."" Ruth Jones said the key to change would be to educate people. ""Some people do not even know they are doing it because they are copying others and it has gone on for hundreds of years,"" she said. ""But it does not mean that it is right. We had bubonic plague for hundreds of years and we stopped that. We need to get on with it and get it right.""

Streaming services facing tighter regulation in UK,"Netflix hits such as Bridgerton would be subject to Ofcom regulations, bringing them into line with public service broadcasters Streaming services are set to be regulated by Ofcom for the first time, under government proposals that also reiterate plans to privatise Channel 4. Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and other streamers will be given new rules bringing them in line with traditional broadcasters. The culture secretary said the proposal for Ofcom regulation would protect audiences from harmful material. The reforms are set out in a governmentWhite Paper,external- a policy document. $50bn wiped off Netflixâs value as subscribers quit Have we had enough of Netflix? Channel 4 stars speak out on privatisation plan A private Channel 4 'wouldn't make Derry Girls' Issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), it says the proposals are intended to create a ""new golden age"" of British TV and ""help the nation's public service broadcasters thrive"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said called the UK TV and radio industry ""the envy of the world"", adding they are ""driven by exceptional talent that is delivering groundbreaking public service programming"". ""Today, we are giving British broadcasters the backing and support they need to rule the airwaves for years to come... ""Set against the backdrop of the digital transformation of our viewing habits, today's plans will revamp decades-old laws to help our public service broadcasters compete in the internet age."" BBC Newscast asked her about privatising Channel 4, and she said one of the reasons was that ""the money we will get from the capital from the sale will be invested back into that sector, into training and skills"". She talked about ""at least 18 or 19 independent film studios opening in the UK next year"" adding that there are people ""all across the UK"" who would love to work in the creative industries, and the importance of ""putting money back into training, into those areas that need levelling up."" While linear TV channels must currently abide by Ofcom rules, most Video on Demand (VoD) services are not currently subject to the regulator's Broadcasting Code. The changes put forward would oblige VoDs to protect audiences from harmful or offensive material, and adhere to rules regarding accuracy, fairness and privacy. The move will be welcomed by public service broadcasters (PSBs), who have been lobbying for streaming services to face the same regulations as them for several years. Streaming services such as Netflix could now face similar regulation to public service broadcasters The government said the new rules will primarily affect ""TV-like"" VoD services such as Netflix, ITV Hub and Now, and would ""level the playing field"". Currently, the BBC iPlayer is the only VoD service which has to abide by Ofcom's Broadcasting Code. But the proposals mean Ofcom would have the powers to draft and enforce a new VoD Code, to ensure that all streamers are subject to stricter rules. The government said the maximum fine for regulated VoD services which break the rules will be Â£250,000, or an amount up to 5% of an organisation's revenue, whichever is higher. It's A Sin, set during the 1980s Aids crisis, is one of Channel 4's biggest hits of recent years The government's intention to privatise Channel 4, which is currently publicly owned but commercially funded, is also set out in the White Paper. It says a ""change of ownership in Channel 4 will give it the tools it needs to succeed in the future as a public service broadcaster while protecting its distinctiveness"". But the proposals have been unpopular with Channel 4, which said earlier this month it was disappointed with the plans. Chief executive Alex Mahon said,externalthere was no evidence that privatisation would benefit the channel. Labour is also against the move, with shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell telling the Commons: ""Nothing screams rudderless government like fixating on the governance of Channel 4 while people's energy bills are going through the roof. Why sell off Channel 4, and why now?"" Ms Powell added the privatisation of Channel 4 ""will mean fewer British-made programmes for British audiences and fewer British jobs"". However, Ms Dorries said Channel 4 faces ""serious challenges"" which are restricting its growth - and anyone ""choosing to dismiss them"" is ""burying their head in the sand"". In her written statement to the Commons, the culture secretary said that while Channel 4 has ""more than fulfilled the original aim for setting it up"", due to the changing broadcasting environment, like ""every other broadcaster, it now faces huge competition for audience share - and many of its competitors have incredibly deep pockets"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the White Paper would ""usher in a new golden age for British TV and radio"" The government also plans to bring in legislation to ensure public service broadcasters' content is given prominence on connected devices and major online platforms, including smart TVs and set-top boxes. That includes services like BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5. The first five linear channels the public find when switching on their televisions are PSBs, the White Paper notes, because these slots are reserved in electronic programme guides on TV sets, including on platforms such as Sky and Virgin Media. However, the government acknowledged PSBs have been finding it increasingly difficult to secure their presence and maintain their prominence on newer and global platforms, something the new rules would address. The BBC was limited to only two live streams at the Tokyo Olympics because of rights restrictions Plans to change the digital broadcast rights for major sporting events such as the Olympic Games, men's World Cup finals, men's FA Cup final, Grand National and Wimbledon singles finals, are also set out. Current broadcasting rules state that events of national interest should be available to view live, and for free, by the widest possible audience. As a result, broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 currently air most major sporting events. However, digital rights are not covered by the current legislation, known as the listed events regime. That means PSBs can broadcast events live, but do not always have the catch-up rights. The Paper says that if, for example, the Olympic men's 100m final took place overnight and a different broadcaster owned the catch-up rights, a wide audience may miss out on watching it for free. The proposals will strengthen the position of PSBs at a time when many are struggling to keep some of their biggest sporting events. Last year, viewers complained that BBC coverage of the Tokyo Olympics was less than in previous years, afterthe International Olympic Committee (IOC) struck a deal with US broadcast giant Discovery.,external An Ofcom spokesman told BBC News: ""We're pleased to see the government taking forward many of our recommendations, particularly around securing prominence for on-demand public service content. We will continue to offer support with the development of future legislation."" In a statement, ITV said: ""We will engage carefully with the substance of the White Paper once it is published, but many of its proposals - notably reform to prominence and inclusion rules, a more flexible approach to remits, and changes to the listed events regime - look very sensible."" Channel 4 said it ""will study the White Paper issued by DCMS, and a considered response will follow"". It added: ""However, Channel 4 remains committed to upholding and maximising its remit and public service purpose that has enabled it to shape Britain's creative culture and make a significant contribution to the creative industries."" Netflix said: ""As we've previously said, we are supportive of measures to update the legal framework and bring our service in the UK under Ofcom's jurisdiction. We look forward to reviewing the White Paper's other proposals and continuing to engage with the government on their plans."" A BBC spokesman said: ""We welcome the steps to secure the ongoing success of public service broadcasters, including the increased and improved prominence of our services on TVs and platforms. ""We also look forward to engaging with the government on both the forthcoming mid-term review and then the national debate on the next Charter. ""The White Paper recognises the BBC's critical role in supporting the UK creative sector and we remain focused on delivering great value for all licence fee payers and representing the UK to audiences around the world."" $50bn wiped off Netflixâs value as subscribers quit Have we had enough of Netflix?

Two held for passing S Korea army secrets to North,"An active South Korean army officer was recruited as part of the alleged spy operation Police in South Korea have arrested two people suspected of leaking military secrets to a person believed to be a North Korean agent. The chief executive of a cryptocurrency exchange and an army officer divulged login details for South Korea's joint military command, police say. They are accused of receiving large sums of money in exchange. North and South Korea have been locked in a tense relationship ever since fighting a war between 1950-1953. ""This is the first case in which an active-duty officer and a civilian under orders of a North Korean agent colluded and spying on military secrets is discovered,"" police said. A camera watch and USB device were used to give the agent access to data between January and March, it is alleged. The two men were arrested earlier this month. The whereabouts and identity of the presumed North Korean agent are unclear. The watch and USB device allegedly used in the operation South Korean prosecutors and police announced the arrests of the head of the virtual currency firm, named only as Lee, and the army officer, Captain B, on Thursday. Both are charged with violating the country's National Security Act. Authorities allege the businessman was first approached in July 2021 to try to ""recruit an active-duty officer in order to investigate military secrets"". The following month, he is alleged to have approached Captain B, promising to compensate him with Bitcoin in exchange for military secrets on the orders of the alleged North Korean agent. The army officer subsequently agreed to take part in the operation and divulge the information, police say. In January Lee bought ""a watch-type hidden camera"" and sent it to Captain B by courier, who then managed to bring the camera to his base, Yonhap news agency reported. Lee then purchased parts of a USB-type hacking device known as a poison tap, which gave the agent remote access to data on his laptop. This included the login credentials to the South Korean military's joint command and control system, police say. It is not clear what other information might have been accessed. The officer was paid 48 million Korean won ($37,938; Â£30,203) worth of bitcoin for his role in the operation, while Lee was paid 700 million won in virtual currency, prosecutors said. Police said they were tipped off about the operation in February. Authorities arrested Lee on 2 April and the army officer on 15 April. Police officials said the identity of the spy operation's mastermind was presumed to be North Korean, based on statements made by the suspects and Telegram communication threads. They added the leak was blocked by arresting Lee and the army officer. Police also said the cryptocurrency trader had attempted to approach another military officer, who had rebuffed his advance. Investigations are still under way in relation to another suspect who it is alleged acted as an intermediary between Lee and the army officer.

Sainsbury's to limit price rises as profits soar,"Profits at Sainsbury's have more than doubled but the supermarket has warned it faces tougher times ahead as shoppers see their finances squeezed. It reported an underlying profit of Â£730m for the year to March, up from Â£357m a year earlier. But it expects profits to be lower this year with customers ""watching every penny"" amid the rising cost of living. Sainsbury's said it was trying to limit price increases despite facing higher costs from suppliers. ""We can see the early signs of customers being a bit more cautious, watching every penny, every pound,"" said chief executive Simon Roberts. Consumer goods giant Unilever, which owns brands such as PG Tips and Marmite, said on Thursday that its prices have increased rapidly in the past few months. Prices have gone up by 8.3% as costs for raw materials jumped and Unilever warned it was facing even higher costs for the remainder of the year. Tesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble Why are prices rising so quickly? Sainsbury's said that although it had been raising food prices, the increases were at a slower pace to its rivals. ""We are doing everything we can to keep the prices low on products that really matter to our customers,"" Mr Roberts told the BBC. ""We can see there are challenges and pressures coming in many areas and customers and households are really feeling the pressure on their household finances."" Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's had lowered prices across 150 of its most-purchased fresh products last week. He added the supermarket's own-brand products were also proving more popular with customers, but said it was too early to see if this was a ""long-term trend"". However, households ""still want to buy into the key events"", such as Easter and Mother's Day. Supply chain issues, the Ukraine war and rising raw material costs are all contributing to soaring food prices. Mr Roberts said the situation in Ukraine was pushing up the costs of food production, with the country being a large exporter of fertilisers used in farming. ""We are doing everything we can to pass on [costs] as little as possible [to customers] and we are doing that by working in our business to find cost savings,"" he said. He added shortages in sunflower oil, another product Ukraine exports, meant Sainsbury's was offering alternatives in its stores. Marmite maker Unilever has been putting up its prices Sainsbury's bumper profits come as research suggests the average food bill could increase by Â£271 this year as prices continue to rise. Grocery prices were 5.9% higher in April than a year ago, the biggest increase since December 2011,according to research company Kantar. Sainsbury's has followed the UK's biggest supermarket Tesco in forecasting lower profits for the current year. It said there were ""significant uncertainties"" weighing on the business ahead, due to higher cost pressures and the squeeze on household incomes. The supermarket reported a rise in annual grocery sales, up by 7.6% from two years ago, partly due to dining out being restricted by Covid restrictions. However, non-food sales were hit hard by difficulties with supply chains, with general merchandise sales falling 4.6% on 2019-20. Unilever said its higher prices meant that some customers, especially those in Europe and Latin America, bought less from the company. But the amount of money Unilever made in sales still increased by 7.3% in the first quarter of the year, it said. Chief executive Alan Jope said: ""We are executing well in a very challenging input cost environment.""

"Streaming services facing tighter regulation in UKNetflix and other streaming services are to be regulated by Ofcom, under new government plans.","Netflix hits such as Bridgerton would be subject to Ofcom regulations, bringing them into line with public service broadcasters Streaming services are set to be regulated by Ofcom for the first time, under government proposals that also reiterate plans to privatise Channel 4. Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and other streamers will be given new rules bringing them in line with traditional broadcasters. The culture secretary said the proposal for Ofcom regulation would protect audiences from harmful material. The reforms are set out in a governmentWhite Paper,external- a policy document. $50bn wiped off Netflixâs value as subscribers quit Have we had enough of Netflix? Channel 4 stars speak out on privatisation plan A private Channel 4 'wouldn't make Derry Girls' Issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), it says the proposals are intended to create a ""new golden age"" of British TV and ""help the nation's public service broadcasters thrive"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said called the UK TV and radio industry ""the envy of the world"", adding they are ""driven by exceptional talent that is delivering groundbreaking public service programming"". ""Today, we are giving British broadcasters the backing and support they need to rule the airwaves for years to come... ""Set against the backdrop of the digital transformation of our viewing habits, today's plans will revamp decades-old laws to help our public service broadcasters compete in the internet age."" BBC Newscast asked her about privatising Channel 4, and she said one of the reasons was that ""the money we will get from the capital from the sale will be invested back into that sector, into training and skills"". She talked about ""at least 18 or 19 independent film studios opening in the UK next year"" adding that there are people ""all across the UK"" who would love to work in the creative industries, and the importance of ""putting money back into training, into those areas that need levelling up."" While linear TV channels must currently abide by Ofcom rules, most Video on Demand (VoD) services are not currently subject to the regulator's Broadcasting Code. The changes put forward would oblige VoDs to protect audiences from harmful or offensive material, and adhere to rules regarding accuracy, fairness and privacy. The move will be welcomed by public service broadcasters (PSBs), who have been lobbying for streaming services to face the same regulations as them for several years. Streaming services such as Netflix could now face similar regulation to public service broadcasters The government said the new rules will primarily affect ""TV-like"" VoD services such as Netflix, ITV Hub and Now, and would ""level the playing field"". Currently, the BBC iPlayer is the only VoD service which has to abide by Ofcom's Broadcasting Code. But the proposals mean Ofcom would have the powers to draft and enforce a new VoD Code, to ensure that all streamers are subject to stricter rules. The government said the maximum fine for regulated VoD services which break the rules will be Â£250,000, or an amount up to 5% of an organisation's revenue, whichever is higher. It's A Sin, set during the 1980s Aids crisis, is one of Channel 4's biggest hits of recent years The government's intention to privatise Channel 4, which is currently publicly owned but commercially funded, is also set out in the White Paper. It says a ""change of ownership in Channel 4 will give it the tools it needs to succeed in the future as a public service broadcaster while protecting its distinctiveness"". But the proposals have been unpopular with Channel 4, which said earlier this month it was disappointed with the plans. Chief executive Alex Mahon said,externalthere was no evidence that privatisation would benefit the channel. Labour is also against the move, with shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell telling the Commons: ""Nothing screams rudderless government like fixating on the governance of Channel 4 while people's energy bills are going through the roof. Why sell off Channel 4, and why now?"" Ms Powell added the privatisation of Channel 4 ""will mean fewer British-made programmes for British audiences and fewer British jobs"". However, Ms Dorries said Channel 4 faces ""serious challenges"" which are restricting its growth - and anyone ""choosing to dismiss them"" is ""burying their head in the sand"". In her written statement to the Commons, the culture secretary said that while Channel 4 has ""more than fulfilled the original aim for setting it up"", due to the changing broadcasting environment, like ""every other broadcaster, it now faces huge competition for audience share - and many of its competitors have incredibly deep pockets"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the White Paper would ""usher in a new golden age for British TV and radio"" The government also plans to bring in legislation to ensure public service broadcasters' content is given prominence on connected devices and major online platforms, including smart TVs and set-top boxes. That includes services like BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5. The first five linear channels the public find when switching on their televisions are PSBs, the White Paper notes, because these slots are reserved in electronic programme guides on TV sets, including on platforms such as Sky and Virgin Media. However, the government acknowledged PSBs have been finding it increasingly difficult to secure their presence and maintain their prominence on newer and global platforms, something the new rules would address. The BBC was limited to only two live streams at the Tokyo Olympics because of rights restrictions Plans to change the digital broadcast rights for major sporting events such as the Olympic Games, men's World Cup finals, men's FA Cup final, Grand National and Wimbledon singles finals, are also set out. Current broadcasting rules state that events of national interest should be available to view live, and for free, by the widest possible audience. As a result, broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 currently air most major sporting events. However, digital rights are not covered by the current legislation, known as the listed events regime. That means PSBs can broadcast events live, but do not always have the catch-up rights. The Paper says that if, for example, the Olympic men's 100m final took place overnight and a different broadcaster owned the catch-up rights, a wide audience may miss out on watching it for free. The proposals will strengthen the position of PSBs at a time when many are struggling to keep some of their biggest sporting events. Last year, viewers complained that BBC coverage of the Tokyo Olympics was less than in previous years, afterthe International Olympic Committee (IOC) struck a deal with US broadcast giant Discovery.,external An Ofcom spokesman told BBC News: ""We're pleased to see the government taking forward many of our recommendations, particularly around securing prominence for on-demand public service content. We will continue to offer support with the development of future legislation."" In a statement, ITV said: ""We will engage carefully with the substance of the White Paper once it is published, but many of its proposals - notably reform to prominence and inclusion rules, a more flexible approach to remits, and changes to the listed events regime - look very sensible."" Channel 4 said it ""will study the White Paper issued by DCMS, and a considered response will follow"". It added: ""However, Channel 4 remains committed to upholding and maximising its remit and public service purpose that has enabled it to shape Britain's creative culture and make a significant contribution to the creative industries."" Netflix said: ""As we've previously said, we are supportive of measures to update the legal framework and bring our service in the UK under Ofcom's jurisdiction. We look forward to reviewing the White Paper's other proposals and continuing to engage with the government on their plans."" A BBC spokesman said: ""We welcome the steps to secure the ongoing success of public service broadcasters, including the increased and improved prominence of our services on TVs and platforms. ""We also look forward to engaging with the government on both the forthcoming mid-term review and then the national debate on the next Charter. ""The White Paper recognises the BBC's critical role in supporting the UK creative sector and we remain focused on delivering great value for all licence fee payers and representing the UK to audiences around the world."" $50bn wiped off Netflixâs value as subscribers quit Have we had enough of Netflix?

Parents' joy at Russia's release of US Marine son,"Trevor Reed being escorted to the plane out of Russia on Wednesday The parents of a US Marine freed in a prisoner swap with Russia have spoken of their joy at his release. Trevor Reed had been held in a Russian jail since 2019. He was traded for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian jailed on drug-smuggling charges. Speaking outside the Reed home in Texas, his mother said she felt ""almost as good as the day he was born"". Reed has landed back in the US, a spokesperson said, where he is expected to spend several days in hospital. President Joe Biden said he had been ""delighted"" to share the news of Mr Reed's return with his parents in a phone call. ""The negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly,"" he said. According to parents Joey and Paula Reed, their son was poorly treated in prison and appeared to have contracted tuberculosis. The couple protested outside the White House last month, ultimately securing a meeting with the president. In a media interview outside their home in a suburb of Dallas on Wednesday, they thanked Mr Biden, who his father said ""probably saved our son's life"". They added that Mr Biden's phone call came while they were on the other line with their son. When they told the president they were at that very moment speaking with Trevor, Mr Biden told them to hang up on him. ""Anyone who says he's [Mr Biden's] not a compassionate or kind man is just a liar or an idiot,"" the father said about Mr Biden. Mr Reed, 30, went to Moscow in 2019 to learn Russian and visit his Russian girlfriend. On a drunken night out, he was detained by two police officers after attending a party. While being driven to the police station, he is said to have grabbed the police officer driving, causing him to swerve, and elbowed the other officer who tried to intervene. Maintaining that he had no recollection of the incident, he pleaded not guilty but was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2020 on assault charges. This video can not be played WATCH: Trevor Reed's parents get choked up reacting to their sons release from Russian jail The US government raised concerns about the fairness of his trial, with US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan recently saying that Mr Reed ""remains in prison for a crime he didn't commit"". Senior US officials said on Wednesday that Mr Reed's release was ""the result of months and months of hard, careful work"" and there had been ""growing concern"" over his health while in detention. The prisoner swap was carried out via Turkey after President Biden commuted the sentence of Mr Yaroshenko. The Russian pilot had been serving a 20-year sentence since 2011 for smuggling cocaine into the US. Mr Yaroshenko's lawyer has confirmed his client is also homeward bound. Officials have said Wednesday's exchange was not the start of a broader diplomatic dialogue with Russia and instead focused narrowly on a ""discrete set of prisoner issues"". That means the fate of other Americans currently detained in Russia - includingBrittney Griner, a double Olympic gold medallist in women's basketball- remains unclear for now. Ms Griner has been in regular contact with her Russian lawyer and is awaiting a trial date, a person close to the situation told the BBC. An earlier motion challenging her arrest was denied. In a statement, the family ofPaul Whelan, a former US Marine being held on spying charges, said they were ""full of happiness for the Reeds"", but time was running out for Mr Whelan. ""Paul has already spent three-and-a-quarter years as a Russian hostage,"" they wrote. ""Is President Biden's failure to bring Paul home an admission that some cases are too hard to solve? Is the administration's piecemeal approach picking low-hanging fruit?""

Parliament's culture can create toxic mix - minister,"This video can not be played Watch: Attorney General speaks to BBC Woman's Hour about male behaviour in politics A minority of men in politics ""behave like animals"", Attorney General Suella Braverman has said, as female MPs share experiences of sexism and harassment. Speaking to BBC's Woman's Hour, Ms Braverman said the problem started in wider society and there needed to be a discussion about ""moral standards"". Her comments come as an unnamed minister accused a fellow Tory MP of watching porn in the Commons chamber. Ms Braverman said she was ""ashamed"" the MP ""wore a Conservative rosette"". Ex-minister Baroness Nicky Morgan described the claim as ""a jaw-dropper"" and said: ""If this happened in any other working place somebody would be sacked for gross misconduct."" However, she said the situation for MPs was different. ""There are no employment contracts, nobody is going to take their job away from them - that gives MPs a feeling of invincibility."" Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? Labour figure made lewd comments to MP - claim The allegation that a Tory MP watched pornography in the Commons was made at a meeting on Tuesday night. Chris Heaton-Harris - the government's chief whip - looked into the matter, but has now referred it to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). Prime Minister Boris Johnson said watching pornography in the workplace was ""completely unacceptable"" and that ""the proper procedures"" should be activated. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""nothing wrong"" with the ICGS process, but added: ""I think the Tory party, they know who this is, they should take action now."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has urged the Conservatives to ""get their act together"" and ""get rid"" of the MP in question. Asked about the wider problem, Ms Braverman said she had never ""been made to feel uncomfortable"" during her time in Parliament, but there were some ""bad apples"". She said: ""My personal experience, I've been an MP for seven years, been in the Conservative Party and in politics for 20 years - on no occasion have I been made to feel uncomfortable and all the men I have worked with have been respectful. ""There is however a very small minority of men who fall short - and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing Parliament into disrepute."" She said it was a ""worrying symptom"" of a wider problem in society and said watching porn in public had become ""normalised"". ""We've got to look more profoundly at the coarsening of behaviour in our culture and some of the mixed messages we are sending our children. ""On the one hand we have women saying 'it is my right to post photos of myself in underwear, it is empowering to pose naked online, don't be so prudish, don't curb my liberty' - and on other hand we are denouncing the permissiveness that is enabling that. ""We've got to take this moment to reflect on what we are doing to lower standards of behaviour."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said pornography in the workplace was ""unacceptable"" and that he hoped action would be taken if the claim was proven. Asked about Parliament's working environment, he said: ""The problem in the House of Commons is ultimately the overall culture of long hours, bars and people sometimes under pressure and after all of that, that can create a toxic mix that leads to all sorts of things."" Labour's Jess Phillipstweeted,externalthat ""the culture in Westminster is an excuse oft used by perpetrators to get out of bad behaviour."" Angela Rayner says the ""sexist slurs"" were ""mortifying and deeply hurtful"" Their comments come amid renewed concern over misogyny in Parliament, as well as accusations of sexual harassment. An MP who wished to remain anonymous told the BBC a member of the shadow cabinet had described her as her party's ""secret weapon"" adding, in graphic language, that women want to be her friend and men want to sleep with her. A Labour spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously. They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken."" Two SNP MPs - Patrick Grady and Patricia Gibson - arefacingallegations of sexual harassment. The party has said individuals were entitled to have complaints dealt with confidentially and it would be inappropriate to comment further. And earlier this week, politicians across the partiescondemneda suggestion made in a newspaper that Labour's Angela Rayner tries to distract Boris Johnson in the Commons by crossing and uncrossing her legs. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says sexual harassment is ""intolerable"" and constitutes âgrounds for dismissalâ On Wednesday, Green MP Caroline Lucascited a report in The Sunday Times,externalthat said a total of 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, were facing allegations of sexual misconduct after being reported to the ICGS, and asked the prime minister whether such behaviour was grounds for dismissal under the ministerial code. Mr Johnson replied that sexual harassment was ""of course...grounds for dismissal"". Under aCode of Conduct,externalapproved by the Commons, MPs have a duty to behave at all times in their public life ""with probity and integrity"" Members are expected to observe the principles of ""respect, professionalism, understanding others' perspectives, courtesy, and acceptance of responsibility"" The Code says they should not do anything which would ""cause significant damage to the reputation and integrity"" of the House or MPs in general Allegations of sexual misconduct can be referred to Parliament'sIndependent Complaints and Grievance Scheme,external The current complaints scheme - the ICGS - was set up in 2018 following complaints about how claims of sexual harassment by MPs were dealt with. The new procedure removes MPs from the process of judging whether one of their colleagues had breached rules on bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct. Under the process, an independent panel can recommend sanctions if an MP is found guilty. If it recommends suspending an MP from the Houses of Parliaments, this would need to be approved by MPs. If an MP is suspended for at least 10 days, their constituents can demand a by-election through a recall petition.

Health trust warned after further inadequate report,"Chief executive Stuart Richardson said he was ""deeply sorry"" for not making progress in key areas More than 100 patients died unexpectedly in a two-year period at England's worst-performing mental health trust, inspectors say. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT) has been warned by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) that it must improve. Norwich South Labour MP Clive Lewis has called on the government to take direct control of NSFT with immediate effect. NSFT chief executive officer Stuart Richardson said he was ""deeply sorry"". Following the latest inspection, the trust was downgraded from ""requires improvement"" to ""inadequate"" and remains the only mental health trust within the NHS's improvement regime for not meeting standards. Mr Lewis cites claims from mental health campaigners that there could have been as many ""1,000 avoidable mental illness-related deaths"" at the trust over the years - a figure the trust says it does not recognise. In his letter to the Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr Lewis, a Labour MP, said: ""The inadequate delivery of mental health services puts lives and wellbeing at risk. ""Given this, it is even more imperative that the Government steps in to take over failing trusts, like NSFT."" Jo Churchill, the Conservative MP for Bury St Edmunds, tweeted on Thursday: ""Previous attempts to drive improvements, including a change in leadership has not delivered, my constituents deserve better.""

Two wards were immediately closed to new patients after a CQC visit in November. The trust, which has a Â£305m budget and employs 4,227 staff, was threatened with enforcement action if urgent measures were not taken. Other issues highlighted by the CQC include staffing problems, including an annual nurse vacancy rate of more than 17%, staff not completing regular checks on an adult long-stay ward and a severe deterioration on the Dragonfly Unit in Carlton Colville, Suffolk - an inpatient ward for children and young people. Services for people with autism and learning difficulties, however, were rated ""good"". The trust has been given a deadline to improve services or face enforcement action by the CQC 115 ""unexpected or potentially avoidable"" deaths reported over a two-year period 15 people in contact with trust services were ""thought likely"" to have taken their own lives in the previous three months The long stay unit for adults had one consultant psychiatrist working half a day per week when patient reviews took place, and a locum junior doctor was shared between this service and another A patient's carer shared concerns about illegal substances on a ward with staff not always taking appropriate action A huge rise in referrals within children and adolescent community services - from 95 in August 2020 to 2,547 in July 2021 Craig Howarth, CQC head of inspection for mental health and community services, said: ""Due to our findings, we have served the trust a warning notice so its leaders are clear about what must be done to improve patient care and safety. ""They have a legal obligation to deliver this."" The notice requires improvements in a number of areas, including maintaining safe staffing levels. Activists protested outside the trust headquarters after the report came out, tying hearts to hedges After the report came out, activists from the Campaign to Save Mental Health Services in Norfolk and Suffolk staged a protest outside the trust's Norwich headquarters. They attached paper hearts to hedges with the names of people they claimed had died while in the trust's care. Sheila Preston said she quit from her role as governor after being frustrated by the culture at the trust Sheila Preston was a governor at the trust when her son Leo, who had a serious mental illness, died from an suspected accidental overdose. She was determined to make a difference, but after serving a full term of nine years she had become highly critical at the way the trust had been led. ""They have completely failed in their responsibility to the public,"" she said. ""There doesn't seem to be any accountability when things have been going really wrong. ""I think things have got worse in all respects. ""Unfortunately, I cannot change the fact that I'm angry and I spent a lot of time trying to make things better. I failed."" Transforming a failing trust can't be done overnight. But campaigners say while they're told it's a marathon not a sprint, many don't make it to the end of that journey. Things started to go wrong in 2013, when the trust oversaw a so-called ""radical redesign"". A total of 136 beds were cut and a large number of experienced staff were lost following a 20% cut to its budget over four years. Staffing shortages have persisted and the trust has found it difficult to recruit specialist mental health nurses and consultants. It has meant it's largely become a crisis management service where people are helped in an emergency but quickly end up back in the service as they wait too long to have their underlying condition treated in the community, because staff are overwhelmed. But staffing shortages are a nationwide problem, so why is this mental health provider the only one in the NHS's recovery support programme? Norfolk has the highest number of referrals for young people in the country and a high elderly population, so demand in those age groups is significant. But management instability has also meant ineffective leadership, with eight chief executives in 10 years. It's the oversight to bring in staff with the right skills, join services together and learn from mistakes that appears to be lacking. NSFT has already had an improvement director and managers seconded from another trust in East London, but some services are getting worse not better. There isn't much left to try. Zoe Billingham, who chairs the trust's board, said NSFT had made some improvements Stuart Richardson, chief executive officer at NSFT, said: ""The people of Norfolk and Suffolk deserve good quality mental health services and we are committed to achieving this. ""We recognise that we have not made the expected progress in some key areas, and I am deeply sorry for this and the impact this will have had on people who need support with their mental health. ""We have already taken action that will help us improve, including increasing support and training for our staff, redoubling our efforts to recruit more nurses and doctors, and bringing services closer to people's homes through our community transformation projects."" Zoe Billingham, who chairs the trust's board, said NSFT had made some improvements. ""We now have a leadership team with clear and ambitious plans, and changes in how we work across the health and care system means we have an opportunity to provide mental health services differently,"" she said. ""We are determined to make the required changes with pace and focus."" What are your experiences with the N & S FT? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

The total electorate is just over 1.3 million, which is almost 120,000 more than at the 2019 Westminster election. Polling stations open at 07:00 BST on Thursday 5 Mayto elect a new assembly at Stormont. BBC News NI sampled opinion about the election among young people who have just turned 18 and entitled to vote. Within a group of 12 students at St Ronan's College in Lurgan, eight said they would be voting, three were undecided and one said he would be not be voting. ""I have other things to worry about at the moment, my A-levels and stuff, so I don't feel like it's my place to vote,""said James. Among the undecided contingent, Emma said: ""I don't really know enough about it to make a wise decision on who I should vote for."" Eight out of 12 students at St Ronan's College said they would be voting next week But others were adamant they would be having their say on polling day. ""We live in a democracy and I think it's very important to vote,"" said Molly. ""My granny has never missed a vote and she's 89.""

Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons,"This video can not be played Caroline Lucas asks Boris Johnson if  sexual harassment is âgrounds for dismissalâ An independent investigation could be launched into claims a Tory MP watched porn on his phone while in the Commons. The claims were made at a meeting on Tuesday night at which female Conservative MPs shared accounts of alleged sexism and harassment. One of those who reported the unnamed MP was a female minister who said she saw him viewing the material while sat beside him in the Commons chamber. Tory Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris has escalated a review of the claims. Mr Heaton-Harris, who is in charge of Tory MPs' discipline, was initially said to be looking into the matter - before he asked for it to be referred to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). A spokesperson for his office said: ""Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action."" The female minister said the incident occurred last week and that she had also seen the MP watching pornography during a hearing of a select committee,The Times reported,external. A second female Tory MP said she had witnessed the same man watching pornography inside the Commons and that she had tried but been unable to capture video proof. Rayner: Brushing aside sexism doesn't make it OK Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? 'I had my political career taken away from me' It comes amid a renewed debate about the culture at Westminster after a Mail on Sunday story claimed Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner sometimes tries to distract Boris Johnson during Prime Minister's Questions by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The article was criticised as being misogynistic by numerous figures on both sides of the House, including the prime minister. In the Commons on Wednesday, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas cited areport in The Sunday Times,externalthat said a total of 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, were facing allegations of sexual misconduct, and asked the prime minister whether such behaviour was grounds for dismissal under the ministerial code. Mr Johnson replied that sexual harassment was ""intolerable"" and ""of course... grounds for dismissal"". The claims about the MP viewing pornography were made on Tuesday at a meeting of the 2022 group - a group of female Conservative MPs set up to push for measures to improve the gender balance in the party. They were first reported byThe Sun,externalandThe Mirror,external. Conservative MP Pauline Latham, who was at the meeting, told BBC News many attendees had come out ""totally shell shocked"". ""They couldn't believe something like that could happen in what's really a professional place,"" she said. She said she did not think ""anybody knows who [the accused MP] is"" besides the MP himself, the people who reported him, and the chief whip. She added that, if the allegations were found to be true, the MP should ""lose their job"" and be thrown out of the Conservative Party. ""We are supposed to set an example in this place and that is absolutely appalling. I am totally shocked,"" she said. The Labour Party said it would be a ""sackable offence"" for MPs to watch pornography in the Commons chamber. Shadow Commons Leader Thangam Debbonaire told the BBC she was ""shocked but not surprised"" by the story because ""there is a culture of sexism in Parliament"". SNP MP Kirsty Blackman told Politics Live the culprit should be kicked out of Parliament, adding: ""They have been elected to represent their constituents not to sit in that chamber and watch porn.""

Car production down as firms struggle to get parts,"Car production in the UK has continued to fall as manufacturers struggle with global supply chain problems. Almost 100,000 fewer cars were built in the first three months of 2022 compared to last year. Manufacturing has dropped by nearly a third, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT linked the decline to a global shortage of computer chips and rising energy costs for manufacturers. New number plate fails to boost March car sales Is Europe's computer chip shortage plan too late? During the first three months of the year, a total of 207,347 new cars were built in the UK, down from 306,558 in the same three months in 2021, when the pandemic created added pressures for manufacturers. Manufacturers have been struggling to get hold of the parts they need - in particular semiconductors, or computer chips, which are widely used on modern vehicles. The closure ofHonda's plant in Swindon last yearhas also been a major factor, and has contributed to a steep reduction in the number of cars exported to the US. Exports to the US saw the greatest decrease last month and declined by 63.8% during March, while exports to the EU declined by 24.5%. The war in Ukraine is also having an effect on production, with factories struggling to get hold of parts such as wiring systems that would normally come from the region. Meanwhile, carmakers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of rising energy costs. The UK's car industry had hoped to be well on the road to recovery by now - but it hasn't happened. Last year was a dismal one for the industry - and so far, 2022 has been even worse. Part of the decline in production is down to Honda. Its factory in Swindon shut down last July, removing a significant chunk of the country's output. But the impact of Covid has been huge. The car industry relies on very efficient, very streamlined manufacturing systems - where parts arrive from around the world at the factories where they're needed pretty much exactly when they're needed. But Covid has thrown a huge spanner in the normally smoothly-operating machinery. Supply chains have been disrupted and vital parts - particularly computer chips - have not been there when needed. When that happens production has to be slowed or even stopped. Now there are other problems to contend with as well. The war in Ukraine has pushed energy prices sky high - a major problem for the industry. It has also triggered new parts shortages. This situation isn't unique to the UK. But it comes at a time when the car industry here is desperate to put itself at the forefront of the move to electric vehicles - and attract the new investment which was in very short supply during the years of Brexit-related uncertainty. Some good news is badly needed. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT said that two years after the start of the pandemic, automotive production was ""still suffering badly"". ""Recovery has not yet begun and, with a backdrop of an increasingly difficult economic environment, including escalating energy costs, urgent action is needed to protect the competitiveness of UK manufacturing,"" Mr Hawes continued. ""We want the UK to be at the forefront of the transition to electrified vehicles, not just as a market but as a manufacturer so action is urgently needed if we are to safeguard jobs and livelihoods,"" he added. Responding to the figures, Chris Knight, automotive partner at consultancy firm KPMG, said component and material availability challenges remain, with the problems caused by the pandemic now ""added to by conflict in Ukraine"". ""A focus on prioritising available components and materials into higher-margin vehicle production and sales has been to the detriment of some parts of the fleet industry,"" Mr Knight added.

Indian billionaire plans bid for UK retailer Boots,"A Boots pharmacy in London Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani is planning a takeover bid for the UK high street chain Boots. Mr Ambani is the biggest shareholder and chairman of retail-to-energy group Reliance Industries. Mumbai-based Reliance is working on the potential bid with US buyout firm Apollo Global Management. Earlier this year, the Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a review of the Boots business and reportedly put the company up for sale. Asia richest man to bring 7-Eleven shops to India Asia's richest man, a bomb scare and a murder The deal would see Boots expand into India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East as well as growing the business in the UK. Under the plan, Reliance and Apollo would own stakes in Boots, although it was not clear whether they would be equal partners in the business. Boots - which has more than 2,200 pharmacies, health and beauty stores in the UK - could be valued at as much as Â£6bn ($7.5bn),according to the Financial Times,external, which first reported the story. The Walgreens Boots Alliance declined to comment while Reliance did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Mukesh Ambani is the chairman of Reliance Industries Mr Ambani is the eighth richest person in the world. The 65-year-old is also the second richest person in Asia, with an estimated net worth of more than $100bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His late father Dhirubhai Ambani founded a textile manufacturer that would eventually become Reliance Industries. It is now one of India's largest conglomerates - with businesses including petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail. Mr Ambani currently owns more than 49% of Reliance Industries. The Ambani family already owns assets in the UK worth tens of millions of pounds. In 2019, Reliance Brands Limited, which is owned by Mr Ambani,bought the toy retailer Hamleys for an undisclosed sum. Last year, Reliance Industries bought the historic British country club Stoke Park for Â£57m. The future of the 173-year-old Boots business has been in question for months. In January, its US-based owner, the Walgreens Boots Alliance said it had started a strategic review of the retailer ""in line with its recently announced priorities and strategic direction that include a greater focus on US healthcare"". ""Further announcements will be made in due course, after the right decision has been reached for Boots' future and for all stakeholders,"" the company said. The owners of UK supermarket group Asda - brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital - have also reportedly made an initial bid for Boots. Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi Mukesh Ambani has been increasing his footprint in the retail space by projecting Reliance Industries as a giant in the sector. Its retail ambitions run across categories from luxury fashion to electronics and groceries. The company operates India's fastest growing and most profitable retail business with over 12,000 stores across India. Mr Ambani has also been raking in investments, looking to expand his e-commerce operations to compete against the likes of Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon. In September 2020 alone, Reliance Retail brought in foreign investments worth nearly $3.5bn. Some of the biggest investments came from the likes of Google and Facebook, which helped Mr Ambani integrate his telecoms and online retail businesses. And his ambitions have not been restricted to India as he eyes business around the world, like the iconic toy shop Hamleys - which he bought in 2019. What Reliance has been missing, say analysts, is a piece of the pharmacy and wellness sector - and that is what it plans to achieve through a tie-up with Boots. India has recently seen a rise in online pharmacy retailers and this potential deal would enable Reliance to fast-track its entry into the sector. But as big online retailers like Walmart and Amazon sell everything, retailers offering more specific ranges have struggled to get a foothold in the massive Indian market. It will also be interesting to see how Reliance positions itself in the pharmacy and wellness business abroad.

Labour figure 'made lewd comments to MP',"There is concern that the way female MPs are treated will put women off entering politics An MP has spoken out about lewd comments allegedly made to her by a member of the shadow cabinet. She said she was described as a ""secret weapon"" because ""women want to be her friend"" and men want to sleep with her. The Welsh MP, who wants to remain anonymous, said it was not the only sexist or misogynistic behaviour she experienced in Parliament or on parliamentary business. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""deeply concerning"". Sir Keir said he wanted to ""get to the bottom of this and do something about it"" - his Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the claims should be investigated. The MP said that after consulting her team she felt it was not in her best interests to reveal her identity in public or to make a complaint. A spokesperson for the party said that if a complaint was made it would be taken ""extremely seriously"". ""They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken."" Women in politics face 'daily social media abuse' Abuse of women online 'disproportionate' Row over Hamilton's maiden speech The MP described a conversation at an event where someone complimented her on being a ""rising star"" of her party. She said that before she could reply the shadow cabinet member had intervened to describe her as ""a secret weapon. Women want to be her friend"" and, using a swear word, said men want to sleep with her, before adding: ""She is a vote winner."" Mr Ashworth told BBC Breakfast: ""All these claims that we are hearing about, it is shocking, foul [and] disgusting, but is also utterly depressing because parliament in my view is still the arena in which the big issues of the day are sorted out. ""I would now expect the Labour Party to look into that."" BBC Wales has contacted a number of female MPs after the furore over aMail on Sunday articleabout the Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. It contained claims from an unnamed Conservative MP that Ms Rayner crosses and uncrosses her legs in the Commons to distract Boris Johnson. The prime minister condemned the article and the unnamed MP. Ms Rayner said she was""crestfallen"" but had been ""overwhelmed"" by support. But the incident has highlighted concerns over the treatment of women in Parliament and politics. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Fay Jones revealed how she has been subjected to a ""deluge of emails"" after an appearance on the BBC's Newsnight last week. The emails made insulting and offensive comments. ""Ninety-nine per cent of them came from men,"" she said. This video can not be played Welsh MP Fay Jones says she regularly fails to notice harassment because it happens so often She added: ""The language is always about horrible things like suggesting that I was supporting the prime minister - I do not really know how to say this as it is really uncomfortable - but supporting the PM in really untoward measures because that is how I am going to advance my career. I can barely say it."" The MP has since deactivated one of her social media accounts. Ynys Mon Conservative MP Virginia Crosbie did the same in July 2020. Ms Jones said the language in Parliament itself was not as stark, but that there were problems. ""Sometimes I do not notice harassment or someone saying something demeaning or degrading because I am so used to it and that is a problem in and of itself,"" she said. ""It is death by a thousand paper cuts and we have got to a place where we are used to being spoken to in a derogatory way."" Labour's Ruth Jones says women are ""looked up and down"" at Westminster Ruth Jones, who has represented Newport West for Labour since winning a by-election in 2019, drew comparisons between her previous work as a physiotherapist and manager in the NHS, and her work in Parliament. ""Here everybody gets looked up and down,"" she said. ""It is one of those things that unless you are actually in the place I cannot convey to you how demeaning it is sometimes. ""The first time I said 'my face is here', as they were staring elsewhere and they were a bit: 'Oh, you talk back!' ""In my previous role I was a trade union officer and I would have called it out, but here it is: 'accept it, love', and that really bugs me."" Liz Saville Roberts called the Angela Rayner article ""chortling sexism and sheer classist arrogance"" BBC Wales' conversations with MPs have revealed at the very least a consistent theme of female politicians being judged differently to males. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in the Commons, highlighted some media portrayals of female politicians as having a ""constant emphasis on appearance with intent to demean"". She described the Angela Rayner article as a ""combination of chortling sexism and sheer classist arrogance"". Ms Saville Roberts warned that ""you cannot undo the effect of slander"". ""It exists regardless of apologies after the event."" Angela Rayner has said ""sexist slurs"" in the Mail on Sunday were ""mortifying and deeply hurtful"" Labour Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi said it was ""always on her mind"" that a ""woman's appearance is commented on rather than what she is saying"". There was near unanimous concern among the MPs spoken to by BBC Wales that the treatment and portrayal of female politicians could put off other women from pursuing a career in politics. Fay Jones said the experiences of female backbench Conservative MPs were raised on Tuesday night at one of their regular meetings. Also in attendance were the chief whip, leader of the house and party chair. ""All three left the room shocked by what they had heard,"" she said. ""But the fact we are talking about it means we are better able to call it out."" Ruth Jones said the key to change would be to educate people. ""Some people do not even know they are doing it because they are copying others and it has gone on for hundreds of years,"" she said. ""But it does not mean that it is right. We had bubonic plague for hundreds of years and we stopped that. We need to get on with it and get it right.""

Silly to give more support on bills now - Sunak,"Rishi Sunak said he would ""see where we are"" come the price cap rise in October Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said it would be ""silly"" to provide more support to tackle rising energy bills now, before knowing what will happen to prices in the autumn. Households faced a 54% hike in energy costs this month, along with record-high inflation hitting their pockets. Opposition parties have called for an emergency budget from the government to focus on the cost-of-living crisis. But Mr Sunak said he wanted to see what happened with energy prices first. He pledged the government would look again at more support in the autumn, when the price cap - whichrose by 54% in April- is expected to go up again. Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq, said the remark showed how ""out of touch"" the chancellor was, as people were ""already feeling the cost of living crisis"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called Mr Sunak's comments ""tone deaf in the middle of a cost of living emergency"". Childcare and MOTs considered for cost of living help 'You're sitting here and can't afford to do things' Prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years The cap is the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households for energy, and it is reviewed every six months. Energy prices have been rising worldwide, driven by squeeze on natural gas supplies made worse by the war in Ukraine. The chancellor made the remarksduring a Q&A session with online forum Mumsnet,external. During the 25-minute interview, he was asked whether he would consider introducing a windfall tax on energy companies that have profited from the rise in global prices. He said the measure was ""something I would look at"" if those companies failed to make ""investments in our country and in our energy security"". ""What I don't want to do is discourage investment in our own energy supplies, because we want to improve our energy security so we're not reliant on importing lots of things from abroad,"" he said. Mr Sunak was also asked by one disabled user - who relies on life-saving equipment at home - whether the government would offer more support to cover energy bills. He responded by listing policies the government had already announced for households, including the Â£150 council tax rebate to go towards bills, and said it amounted to Â£9bn. He said: ""Now I know people are anxious about this and wondering if they are going to go up even more, and I have always been clear from the beginning we will see what happens. ""And depending on what happens to bills then, of course, if we need to act and provide support for people, we will. ""But it would be silly to do that now or last month or the month before when we don't know exactly what the situation in the autumn will be,"" the chancellor added. ""So I'd say we'll see where we are with that if we need to do more."" But Labour's Ms Siddiq said it was ""time to act"", adding: ""Families are already feeling the cost of living crisis, hit by record rises in energy prices, record high petrol prices and staggeringly steep hikes in the cost of food and essentials. ""With the chancellor heaping them with the biggest tax burden in 70 years on top of that, people are paying more and getting less."" Mr Sunak's remarks come a day after ministers gathered to pitch ideas on how to tackle the cost of living without spending any additional taxpayers' money. During the cabinet meeting in No 10, Boris Johnson is said to have proposed reducing childcare costs by easing the rules governing how many children one adult can look after. And sources said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested relaxing the frequency of MOTs. But Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the meeting showed the PM was ""completely out of ideas during the most profound crisis in decades"". Sir Ed echoed Labour and the SNP's call for an emergency budget, including a cut in VAT, and backed opposition plans for a windfall tax on the profits of the oil and gas companies. The interview was carried out shortly before Mr Sunak was cleared by the prime minister's independent ethics adviser of breaching the ministerial code over his family's financial interests. Lord Geidt investigated whether he followed the rules and declared any potential conflicts of interest, after it emerged his wife had held non-dom tax status and he had held a US green card. The adviser found all the interests above were declared by the Chancellor in 2018 and all - with the exception of his US green card - were re-declared at later dates.

Tory MP accused of watching porn in CommonsA review of the claims - made by two female MPs - is escalated to an independent complaints scheme.,"This video can not be played Caroline Lucas asks Boris Johnson if  sexual harassment is âgrounds for dismissalâ An independent investigation could be launched into claims a Tory MP watched porn on his phone while in the Commons. The claims were made at a meeting on Tuesday night at which female Conservative MPs shared accounts of alleged sexism and harassment. One of those who reported the unnamed MP was a female minister who said she saw him viewing the material while sat beside him in the Commons chamber. Tory Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris has escalated a review of the claims. Mr Heaton-Harris, who is in charge of Tory MPs' discipline, was initially said to be looking into the matter - before he asked for it to be referred to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). A spokesperson for his office said: ""Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action."" The female minister said the incident occurred last week and that she had also seen the MP watching pornography during a hearing of a select committee,The Times reported,external. A second female Tory MP said she had witnessed the same man watching pornography inside the Commons and that she had tried but been unable to capture video proof. Rayner: Brushing aside sexism doesn't make it OK Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? 'I had my political career taken away from me' It comes amid a renewed debate about the culture at Westminster after a Mail on Sunday story claimed Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner sometimes tries to distract Boris Johnson during Prime Minister's Questions by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The article was criticised as being misogynistic by numerous figures on both sides of the House, including the prime minister. In the Commons on Wednesday, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas cited areport in The Sunday Times,externalthat said a total of 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, were facing allegations of sexual misconduct, and asked the prime minister whether such behaviour was grounds for dismissal under the ministerial code. Mr Johnson replied that sexual harassment was ""intolerable"" and ""of course... grounds for dismissal"". The claims about the MP viewing pornography were made on Tuesday at a meeting of the 2022 group - a group of female Conservative MPs set up to push for measures to improve the gender balance in the party. They were first reported byThe Sun,externalandThe Mirror,external. Conservative MP Pauline Latham, who was at the meeting, told BBC News many attendees had come out ""totally shell shocked"". ""They couldn't believe something like that could happen in what's really a professional place,"" she said. She said she did not think ""anybody knows who [the accused MP] is"" besides the MP himself, the people who reported him, and the chief whip. She added that, if the allegations were found to be true, the MP should ""lose their job"" and be thrown out of the Conservative Party. ""We are supposed to set an example in this place and that is absolutely appalling. I am totally shocked,"" she said. The Labour Party said it would be a ""sackable offence"" for MPs to watch pornography in the Commons chamber. Shadow Commons Leader Thangam Debbonaire told the BBC she was ""shocked but not surprised"" by the story because ""there is a culture of sexism in Parliament"". SNP MP Kirsty Blackman told Politics Live the culprit should be kicked out of Parliament, adding: ""They have been elected to represent their constituents not to sit in that chamber and watch porn.""

Indian billionaire plans bid for Boots - reports,"A Boots pharmacy in London Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani is planning a takeover bid for the UK high street chain Boots. Mr Ambani is the biggest shareholder and chairman of retail-to-energy group Reliance Industries. Mumbai-based Reliance is working on the potential bid with US buyout firm Apollo Global Management. Earlier this year, the Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a review of the Boots business and reportedly put the company up for sale. Asia richest man to bring 7-Eleven shops to India Asia's richest man, a bomb scare and a murder The deal would see Boots expand into India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East as well as growing the business in the UK. Under the plan, Reliance and Apollo would own stakes in Boots, although it was not clear whether they would be equal partners in the business. Boots - which has more than 2,200 pharmacies, health and beauty stores in the UK - could be valued at as much as Â£6bn ($7.5bn),according to the Financial Times,external, which first reported the story. The Walgreens Boots Alliance declined to comment while Reliance did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Mukesh Ambani is the chairman of Reliance Industries Mr Ambani is the eighth richest person in the world. The 65-year-old is also the second richest person in Asia, with an estimated net worth of more than $100bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His late father Dhirubhai Ambani founded a textile manufacturer that would eventually become Reliance Industries. It is now one of India's largest conglomerates - with businesses including petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail. Mr Ambani currently owns more than 49% of Reliance Industries. The Ambani family already owns assets in the UK worth tens of millions of pounds. In 2019, Reliance Brands Limited, which is owned by Mr Ambani,bought the toy retailer Hamleys for an undisclosed sum. Last year, Reliance Industries bought the historic British country club Stoke Park for Â£57m. The future of the 173-year-old Boots business has been in question for months. In January, its US-based owner, the Walgreens Boots Alliance said it had started a strategic review of the retailer ""in line with its recently announced priorities and strategic direction that include a greater focus on US healthcare"". ""Further announcements will be made in due course, after the right decision has been reached for Boots' future and for all stakeholders,"" the company said. The owners of UK supermarket group Asda - brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital - have also reportedly made an initial bid for Boots. Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi Mukesh Ambani has been increasing his footprint in the retail space by projecting Reliance Industries as a giant in the sector. Its retail ambitions run across categories from luxury fashion to electronics and groceries. The company operates India's fastest growing and most profitable retail business with over 12,000 stores across India. Mr Ambani has also been raking in investments, looking to expand his e-commerce operations to compete against the likes of Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon. In September 2020 alone, Reliance Retail brought in foreign investments worth nearly $3.5bn. Some of the biggest investments came from the likes of Google and Facebook, which helped Mr Ambani integrate his telecoms and online retail businesses. And his ambitions have not been restricted to India as he eyes business around the world, like the iconic toy shop Hamleys - which he bought in 2019. What Reliance has been missing, say analysts, is a piece of the pharmacy and wellness sector - and that is what it plans to achieve through a tie-up with Boots. India has recently seen a rise in online pharmacy retailers and this potential deal would enable Reliance to fast-track its entry into the sector. But as big online retailers like Walmart and Amazon sell everything, retailers offering more specific ranges have struggled to get a foothold in the massive Indian market. It will also be interesting to see how Reliance positions itself in the pharmacy and wellness business abroad.

"Ukrainian deportees accuse Russia of tortureOne man says he was captured and taken over the border, where he was blindfolded and beaten.Europe","Volodymyr Khropun says he was captured by Russian forces and deported to Russia Three weeks since his release, Volodymyr Khropun still looks visibly shaken by the trauma he's endured. A Red Cross volunteer, he was captured by Russian forces, and deported to Russia. On 18 March, Volodymyr was driving a school bus to the village of Kozarovychi, about 40km (25 miles) north-west of Kyiv, to evacuate a few civilians who were stuck there amid the fighting. When he tried to convince Russian soldiers to let him pass their checkpoint, they detained him. For the first few days he was kept in the basement of a factory of a village nearby, along with other civilians, 40 people in a 28 sq m (300 sq ft) room. ""We were beaten with rifles, punched, and kicked. They blindfolded me and tied my hands with duct tape. They used Tasers and kept asking for information about the military,"" Volodymyr said. ""One of the soldiers was very young, almost a child. He used Tasers on people's necks, faces, knees. It's like he was having fun."" After being held for nearly a week in Ukraine, they were transported to Belarus. ""They thought we couldn't see, but I saw the villages we were passing, Ivankiv, Chernobyl and then I saw us crossing the border,"" he said. The ID issued to Volodymyr by the Russian military In Belarus, they were given an identity document. It says it is issued by the military of the Russian Federation and describes Volodymyr's place of birth as the ""Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic"". It is how Ukraine was known prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, before it became an independent country. It is a sign of Russia's ambitions in the region. From Belarus, Volodymyr says, they were taken to a prison in Russia. ""The torture continued. They humiliated us, made us kneel and forced us into uncomfortable positions. If we looked into their eyes, we were beaten. If we did something slowly we were beaten. They treated us like animals,"" he said. One evening Volodymyr counted 72 other people in detention with him. But he could hear there were more. ""We tried to support each other. Some days we couldn't believe this was all happening. It felt like we had been transported to the 16th Century from the 21st Century,"" he said. Two weeks into detention, on 7 April, Volodymyr was taken from prison. He and three female Ukrainian civilians from another detention centre were transported by air to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. The women told Volodymyr they had also been beaten. They didn't understand where they were being taken to, but frequently heard the soldiers use the word ""exchange."" From Crimea they were taken by road to a point 32 km (20 miles) outside Zaporizhzhia, and allowed to walk across a bridge to Ukrainian-controlled territory. The exchange of military prisoners of war from both sides took place before Ukrainian civilians were allowed to walk over. It was 9 April. It had taken them two days to make the journey. Volodymyr struggles to describe how he felt, but he wants the world to hear his story. ""The fact that Ukrainian civilians are being held there [in Russia] is a 100% true."" In the prison, Volodymyr heard that people from the Chernobyl nuclear site were being held in a room next door. It is unclear who exactly the men in the prison were, but 169 Ukrainian National Guard responsible for securing Chernobyl are missing. They were first held in detention in the basement of the nuclear site for weeks when it was occupied by Russian troops. A room where the Ukrainian National Guard were held in Chernobyl Valeriy Semonov, one of the engineers at Chernobyl, said that when Russian forces withdrew at the end of March, they took the guards along. In a village nearby lives the family of one of the missing men. Their identities are being hidden to protect them. On duty in Chernobyl, the serviceman had called his wife on the first day of the invasion, when the nuclear site was taken, to tell her to leave their village. She took her parents and their young son and went to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine. From 24 February to 9 March, she was able to talk to her husband on his mobile phone. ""He would not share much on the phone. He would just say, 'We're OK'. He would tell me to not worry about him,"" she said. ""Then they lost power, so we couldn't connect to his phone."" She still managed to talk to him a few more times over a landline phone at the site. ""The last time I spoke to my husband was on 31 March, on the day they were forcefully taken from Chernobyl. He told me, 'I'm OK physically, but emotionally it's very hard.' I could understand from his voice that he was very worried."" Her son asks about his father all the time. ""I tell him he's at work, but he's very scared. He's worried I will disappear too, and keeps following me around everywhere, to work, to the shops,"" she said. ""It's very tough for us. I just want Russia to release my husband."" Ukraine's interior ministry has told her he is being held in Russia. Married for six-and-a-half years, she said he was always there for her and that he loved his job. The BBC has spoken to the families of more than a dozen people who have been taken hostage by Russian troops. Only a few have returned. The majority are still missing, like Yuliia Payevska. Her husband Vadym told us she was captured by Russian forces on 14 March when she was working as a paramedic in Mariupol, helping evacuate injured soldiers and civilians. Yuliia Payevska's husband says she has been missing since 14 March A propaganda video featuring her was carried by some pro-Kremlin Russian TV channels, which is how he found out she's in Russian captivity. He believes she has been taken to Russia. The Kremlin insists Ukrainian citizens are going to Russia willingly. ""I don't want to respond to these huge liars,"" said Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general. ""There are at least 6,000 civilians who we can identify who have been deported, and from information in mass media in Russia, they say they have taken a million Ukrainians."" She said there have been instances of children being separated from their parents, and that almost everyone who has returned on a prisoner exchange has told them they were tortured and beaten. As the war rages in Ukraine's south and east, every day there are new reports of people being forcibly deported to Russia.

Labour figure 'made lewd comments to woman MP',"There is concern that the way female MPs are treated will put women off entering politics An MP has spoken out about lewd comments allegedly made to her by a member of the shadow cabinet. She said she was described as a ""secret weapon"" because ""women want to be her friend"" and men want to sleep with her. The Welsh MP, who wants to remain anonymous, said it was not the only sexist or misogynistic behaviour she experienced in Parliament or on parliamentary business. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""deeply concerning"". Sir Keir said he wanted to ""get to the bottom of this and do something about it"" - his Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the claims should be investigated. The MP said that after consulting her team she felt it was not in her best interests to reveal her identity in public or to make a complaint. A spokesperson for the party said that if a complaint was made it would be taken ""extremely seriously"". ""They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken."" Women in politics face 'daily social media abuse' Abuse of women online 'disproportionate' Row over Hamilton's maiden speech The MP described a conversation at an event where someone complimented her on being a ""rising star"" of her party. She said that before she could reply the shadow cabinet member had intervened to describe her as ""a secret weapon. Women want to be her friend"" and, using a swear word, said men want to sleep with her, before adding: ""She is a vote winner."" Mr Ashworth told BBC Breakfast: ""All these claims that we are hearing about, it is shocking, foul [and] disgusting, but is also utterly depressing because parliament in my view is still the arena in which the big issues of the day are sorted out. ""I would now expect the Labour Party to look into that."" BBC Wales has contacted a number of female MPs after the furore over aMail on Sunday articleabout the Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. It contained claims from an unnamed Conservative MP that Ms Rayner crosses and uncrosses her legs in the Commons to distract Boris Johnson. The prime minister condemned the article and the unnamed MP. Ms Rayner said she was""crestfallen"" but had been ""overwhelmed"" by support. But the incident has highlighted concerns over the treatment of women in Parliament and politics. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Fay Jones revealed how she has been subjected to a ""deluge of emails"" after an appearance on the BBC's Newsnight last week. The emails made insulting and offensive comments. ""Ninety-nine per cent of them came from men,"" she said. This video can not be played Welsh MP Fay Jones says she regularly fails to notice harassment because it happens so often She added: ""The language is always about horrible things like suggesting that I was supporting the prime minister - I do not really know how to say this as it is really uncomfortable - but supporting the PM in really untoward measures because that is how I am going to advance my career. I can barely say it."" The MP has since deactivated one of her social media accounts. Ynys Mon Conservative MP Virginia Crosbie did the same in July 2020. Ms Jones said the language in Parliament itself was not as stark, but that there were problems. ""Sometimes I do not notice harassment or someone saying something demeaning or degrading because I am so used to it and that is a problem in and of itself,"" she said. ""It is death by a thousand paper cuts and we have got to a place where we are used to being spoken to in a derogatory way."" Labour's Ruth Jones says women are ""looked up and down"" at Westminster Ruth Jones, who has represented Newport West for Labour since winning a by-election in 2019, drew comparisons between her previous work as a physiotherapist and manager in the NHS, and her work in Parliament. ""Here everybody gets looked up and down,"" she said. ""It is one of those things that unless you are actually in the place I cannot convey to you how demeaning it is sometimes. ""The first time I said 'my face is here', as they were staring elsewhere and they were a bit: 'Oh, you talk back!' ""In my previous role I was a trade union officer and I would have called it out, but here it is: 'accept it, love', and that really bugs me."" Liz Saville Roberts called the Angela Rayner article ""chortling sexism and sheer classist arrogance"" BBC Wales' conversations with MPs have revealed at the very least a consistent theme of female politicians being judged differently to males. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in the Commons, highlighted some media portrayals of female politicians as having a ""constant emphasis on appearance with intent to demean"". She described the Angela Rayner article as a ""combination of chortling sexism and sheer classist arrogance"". Ms Saville Roberts warned that ""you cannot undo the effect of slander"". ""It exists regardless of apologies after the event."" Angela Rayner has said ""sexist slurs"" in the Mail on Sunday were ""mortifying and deeply hurtful"" Labour Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi said it was ""always on her mind"" that a ""woman's appearance is commented on rather than what she is saying"". There was near unanimous concern among the MPs spoken to by BBC Wales that the treatment and portrayal of female politicians could put off other women from pursuing a career in politics. Fay Jones said the experiences of female backbench Conservative MPs were raised on Tuesday night at one of their regular meetings. Also in attendance were the chief whip, leader of the house and party chair. ""All three left the room shocked by what they had heard,"" she said. ""But the fact we are talking about it means we are better able to call it out."" Ruth Jones said the key to change would be to educate people. ""Some people do not even know they are doing it because they are copying others and it has gone on for hundreds of years,"" she said. ""But it does not mean that it is right. We had bubonic plague for hundreds of years and we stopped that. We need to get on with it and get it right.""

UK car production down as energy costs rise,"Car production in the UK has continued to fall as manufacturers struggle with global supply chain problems. Almost 100,000 fewer cars were built in the first three months of 2022 compared to last year. Manufacturing has dropped by nearly a third, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT linked the decline to a global shortage of computer chips and rising energy costs for manufacturers. New number plate fails to boost March car sales Is Europe's computer chip shortage plan too late? During the first three months of the year, a total of 207,347 new cars were built in the UK, down from 306,558 in the same three months in 2021, when the pandemic created added pressures for manufacturers. Manufacturers have been struggling to get hold of the parts they need - in particular semiconductors, or computer chips, which are widely used on modern vehicles. The closure ofHonda's plant in Swindon last yearhas also been a major factor, and has contributed to a steep reduction in the number of cars exported to the US. Exports to the US saw the greatest decrease last month and declined by 63.8% during March, while exports to the EU declined by 24.5%. The war in Ukraine is also having an effect on production, with factories struggling to get hold of parts such as wiring systems that would normally come from the region. Meanwhile, carmakers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of rising energy costs. The UK's car industry had hoped to be well on the road to recovery by now - but it hasn't happened. Last year was a dismal one for the industry - and so far, 2022 has been even worse. Part of the decline in production is down to Honda. Its factory in Swindon shut down last July, removing a significant chunk of the country's output. But the impact of Covid has been huge. The car industry relies on very efficient, very streamlined manufacturing systems - where parts arrive from around the world at the factories where they're needed pretty much exactly when they're needed. But Covid has thrown a huge spanner in the normally smoothly-operating machinery. Supply chains have been disrupted and vital parts - particularly computer chips - have not been there when needed. When that happens production has to be slowed or even stopped. Now there are other problems to contend with as well. The war in Ukraine has pushed energy prices sky high - a major problem for the industry. It has also triggered new parts shortages. This situation isn't unique to the UK. But it comes at a time when the car industry here is desperate to put itself at the forefront of the move to electric vehicles - and attract the new investment which was in very short supply during the years of Brexit-related uncertainty. Some good news is badly needed. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT said that two years after the start of the pandemic, automotive production was ""still suffering badly"". ""Recovery has not yet begun and, with a backdrop of an increasingly difficult economic environment, including escalating energy costs, urgent action is needed to protect the competitiveness of UK manufacturing,"" Mr Hawes continued. ""We want the UK to be at the forefront of the transition to electrified vehicles, not just as a market but as a manufacturer so action is urgently needed if we are to safeguard jobs and livelihoods,"" he added. Responding to the figures, Chris Knight, automotive partner at consultancy firm KPMG, said component and material availability challenges remain, with the problems caused by the pandemic now ""added to by conflict in Ukraine"". ""A focus on prioritising available components and materials into higher-margin vehicle production and sales has been to the detriment of some parts of the fleet industry,"" Mr Knight added.
