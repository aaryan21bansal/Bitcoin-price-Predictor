Asda limits sales of budget range items,"Asda has temporarily limited purchases of its new budget range Just Essentials, blaming soaring demand. The supermarket said customers would be limited to buying three items at most of each product until further notice. It launched Just Essentials in May, promising an expanded line of low-cost products to help shoppers with the cost of living. That came after food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe criticised Asda for cutting back its budget ranges in some stores. But on Wednesday, the supermarket said demand was outstripping availability, with sales growing almost 20% faster than the market average. ""Just Essentials is proving very popular with customers and we are working hard to improve availability across the range,"" a spokesman said. ""To ensure as many customers as possible can buy these products, we are temporarily limiting purchases to a maximum of three of each product for a short period of time. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."" Waitrose in row with Asda over budget range name Asda in food promise after Jack Monroe complaints Aldi becomes Britainâs fourth-largest supermarket It comes as the price of food soars, with consumers paying a record Â£571 more on average for their groceries than last year, according to data from research firm Kantar. Asda's new value range, which features 300 budget products, replaced its smaller Smart Price range in May. Ms Monroe had criticised the supermarket in April for taking value ranges off its shelves and raising prices at time when many household budgets were being squeezed. Earlier this year trade magazine The Grocer said suppliers were given just four weeks to come up with new products for Just Essentials. The supermarket has also faced criticism that the range's bright yellow packaging ""stigmatises"" hard up shoppers - claims it rejects. Asda, which was bought by the billionaire Issa brothers and their backers TDR Capital in 2020, is the UK's third largest grocer. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 9.9% in the year to August, easing slightly from 10.1% in July. According to the Office for National Statistics, food prices rose at their fastest pace since 2008 last month as the war in Ukraine continued to help drive up prices at supermarket tills. Shoppers are seeking discounts and the budget chainAldi overtook Morrisons in Augustto become the fourth-largest UK supermarket for the first time, according to Kantar. People are also cutting back on spending by buying more own-brand products, with sales of the very cheapest value own-label products up by a third compared to last year.

Kwarteng seeks to scrap bankersâ bonus cap,"New Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng The Treasury is considering removing a cap on bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Sources said no final decisions had been made, but confirmed chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng considered it a way of making London a more attractive place for global banks to do business. City bosses have long complained about the EU-wide bonus rules which cap bonuses at twice an employee's salary. They say they lead to higher base pay that pushes up banks' fixed costs. Those costs cannot be adjusted in line with the firm's financial performance, they add, making the UK less attractive than the US or Asia. People close to Mr Kwarteng confirmedreports in the Financial Times,externalthat the new chancellor is considering the move. Kwasi Kwarteng: Chancellor who likes a challenge Review of workers' employment rights scrapped Critics have argued that uncapped bonuses lead to the kind of excessive risk taking that spawned the financial crisis of 2008. But others argue that other new rules that can hold senior managers personally and potentially criminally responsible for misconduct, plus the ability to claw back bonuses years after they are granted, achieve a sufficient disincentive. Taking the lid off bankers' pay at a time when many households are facing hardship from the rising cost of living will undoubtedly provoke outrage in many quarters. The proposal ""sends a rather confused signal when people are being squeezed in terms of the cost of living, and the government is trying to encourage pay restraint in the public sector"", Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, told the BBC. ""To appear to allow bankers to have bigger bonuses at the same time, doesn't look very well timed. There may be some longer term arguments for pursing this policy but I think the timing would be very bad if they did it now."" Rachel Winter, from Killick & Co, told the BBC: ""It's an absolutely terrible time for this headline when you've got inflation [at] a 40-year high, you've got so many people struggling with the cost of living, do we really want to be reading headlines about banker bonuses? ""Arguably the banks do pay a lot of tax, so I think the chancellor is looking at ways to boost the UK economy to get more banks to come to London, to stay in London and pay more tax."" Removing the cap is just one of a number of deregulation initiatives being considered. The government is also keen to relax rules limiting the amount insurance and pension funds can invest in assets that are harder to sell at short notice - such as long-term infrastructure projects. These rules are part of pan-European regulations collectively known as Solvency II. But the Bank of England is concerned that relaxing the rules could expose pensioners' savings to greater long-term risk and that lowering the amount of ready cash firms are required to hold could see them pay out any money freed up to their shareholders rather than invest in projects favoured by the government. Pitting the Treasury and the financial services industry against the Bank of England is seen as a key test of the Bank's independence and senior officials at the Bank have privately conceded the fight over Solvency II is a political one they could well lose. Kwasi Kwarteng laid out his ""unashamedly pro-growth plan"" for the economy at a gathering of senior bankers two weeks ago. He would argue that the instincts that persuade him to cut banking regulations are the same instincts that persuaded him to throw a Â£100bn-plus shield over businesses and households to prevent high energy prices causing a job-and-growth-killing recession.

Further backlash against Center Parcs closure plan,"The company's five UK villages will close on 19 September Center Parcs is facing further backlashafter deciding to close its UK villages on the day of the Queen's funeral. The company originally told guests they would need to leave by 10:00 BST on Monday and not return until Tuesday. Guests already on holiday will now be able to stay, but people due to arrive on Monday will not be able to start their holidays until the following day. Some of them have told the BBC it had cost them extra expense and also a lot of stress. Ellie Walters, who is getting married on Thursday, was due to check in on Monday for her honeymoon. ""I just think it's actually quite a disgrace because I'm so stressed about it,"" said Ms Walters, who is due to go to Center Parcs in Nottinghamshire. ""The trouble is you can't even get on the phone to them. ""You go away to have that relaxation and that stress-free time and just spend really nice quality time together, and you're left worrying and I don't think you should be doing that on your holiday."" Ellie Walters is due to stop at Center Parcs for her honeymoon Center Parcs has said it is closing its villages ""as a mark of respect and to allow as many of our colleagues as possible to be part of this historic moment"". However, Ms Walters said it would have been better for staff and guests to watch the funeral together. ""Can you imagine how nice it would have been if everybody was at Center Parcs and they got a couple of screens up somewhere and everyone was together and watching it?"" she said. ""I think that would have been a better scenario than having to shut everywhere and create a lot of stress for all the guests."" Allow Twitter content?

Center Parcs told some guests on Twitter they would need to ""remain in their lodges"" on Monday, leading some people to compare the sites to prisons. However, Center Parcs has now said guests will be able to walk around the villages, which are in Cumbria, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire, Suffolk and Bedfordshire. The facilities, such as restaurants and swimming pools, will be closed. Emma Sherlock, 37, planned to arrive at Center Parcs in Nottinghamshire on Monday with her husband and three disabled children. She said they had spent a long time saving up Â£1,200 to go on the five-night trip, and have now had to spend an extra Â£300 to stay in a hotel for the first night. ""We need a family room for the equipment because I've got three disabled children,"" she explained. ""Feeding tubes, suction machines, specialist beds, we've had to organise and hire. ""We're not going to have another holiday for ages now because of the cost of living going up."" Their holiday had already been postponed twice due to the coronavirus pandemic. She sympathised with Center Parcs staff who had been dealing with frustrated customers. ""I was on hold for two hours yesterday before they picked up and the lady was sobbing her heart out,"" she said. Guests will not be able to use Center Parcs facilities on Monday but can walk around David Tomlinson is among guests already staying at Center Parcs who were previously told they would need to leave for a day. For him, this would have meant driving home to Solihull for two-and-a-half hours, then driving back to Nottinghamshire the day after. He said the situation was still ""not ideal"". ""People are still paying for the use of those facilities they can't touch,"" he said.

Swedish PM resigns as right-wing parties win vote,"Magdalena Andersson was Sweden's first female prime minister Sweden's prime minister has resigned after her government was defeated in Sunday's election. Magdalena Andersson's centre-left bloc lost narrowly to a bloc of right-wing parties, 176 seats to 173, with 99% of the votes counted. Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson is now expected to form a government. His right-wing grouping includes the Sweden Democrats, a far-right party that has campaigned againstrising gang shootings. It is a huge blow to Andersson's Social Democrats, which gained votes compared to the last election, and remain Sweden's largest party. But in Sweden, it is bloc politics that usually decides who gets into power and the right bloc has scored a razor-thin majority. The final result is still to be confirmed after a recount, which is standard practice in Sweden. Ms Andersson accepted defeat at a news conference on Wednesday. She formally offered her resignation on Thursday. ""In parliament, they have a one or two seat advantage,"" she said. ""It's a thin majority, but it is a majority."" The close-fought election campaign was dominated by gangs, immigration and integration issues, as well as soaring electricity prices. Ms Andersson was the Nordic nation's first female PM when she took office last year - she quit on the first day, before returning soon after. How a neo-Nazi movement became Sweden's kingmakers The woman who became Sweden's first female PM - twice She has been edged out by a four-party right-wing block made up of the Sweden Democrats, Moderate Party, Christian Democrats and Liberals. It is a momentous turning point for Swedish politics - the Sweden Democrats was once treated as a pariah by political parties, but has now won around 20% of the vote. It vowed to ""make Sweden safe again"" by bringing in longer prison sentences and restricting immigration. However the party's leader Jimmie Akesson will not become prime minister, because he does not have the support of the other right-wing parties to take on the job. Instead, Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderates has said he will start work to form a government. ""I am ready to do all I can to form a new, stable and vigorous government for the whole of Sweden and all its citizens,"" he said on Wednesday. It remains unclear whether Mr Kristersson's government will involve a coalition or formal cooperation with the Sweden Democrats. He has already held talks this week with the leaders of the Christian Democrats and Liberal parties as well as the nationalists. The Sweden Democrats is a party born out of a neo-Nazi movement at the end of the 1980s, which has slowly grown stronger while attempting to polish its image. Although many of its policies are right-wing, it sits to the left of some other parties in the bloc on some economic issues, such as protecting the current level of unemployment insurance. It started off growing its support base among rural working class voters, but this has now broadened. This year it has almost doubled its support amongst first-time voters, with some 22% of 18-21-year-olds voting for the party according to Swedish Public Service broadcaster SVT's exit poll survey. In 2019 Mr Kristersson started talks with the Sweden Democrats after years of declining to cooperate with them - a move which has now changed Sweden's political landscape. Ms Andersson told reporters on Wednesday that she understood those concerned at the party's growing popularity. ""I see your concern and I share it,"" she said. Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrats had governed Sweden since 2014 and dominated the country's political landscape since the 1930s. Sunday's vote was one of the closest elections ever in Sweden, with thousands of overseas and postal votes needed to be counted to get a clearer picture of who the winner was.

Europe moves to cut peak electricity use by 5%,"Ursula von der Leyen was making her annual State of the Union speech EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has called for cuts to electricity use across the bloc and windfall taxes on energy firms to tackle high prices. She told the European Parliament that gas and electricity prices had hit all-time highs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. She called for electricity consumption to be cut at peak hours by at least 5%. But plans for a cap on the price of natural gas, a key Russian export to the EU, were put on hold. The plan outlined in Strasbourg,externaltargets ""excess revenues"" with proposals to skim the profits of low-carbon electricity producers and implement a de facto windfall tax on the oil, gas and coal sectors. The money raised, estimated to be â¬140bn (Â£121bn; $141bn), would go to families and businesses across the EU's 27 states. Companies producing energy from low-carbon sources such as wind, solar and nuclear would face a cap of â¬180 per megawatt hour (MWh) on their revenue. By comparison, the front-year electricity price in Germany, the EU's biggest economy, was trading at just below â¬500/MWh on Wednesday. ""Power generators with lower operating costs have been able to reap extraordinary profits, way beyond what may have reasonably expected based on investment decisions,"" European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said. The windfall tax on fossil fuel producers and refiners would require them to contribute 33% of their taxable surplus profit. The EU's member states will pore over the proposals with hopes of an agreement by the end of this month. Ms von der Leyen also announced she would be visiting Ukraine again later on Wednesday for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying: ""Europe's solidarity with Ukraine will remain unshakeable."" Mr Zelensky's wife Olena was in the parliament as guest of honour to hear the speech. Ms von der Leyen said that ""making ends meet"" was ""becoming a source of anxiety for millions of businesses and households"". ""In these times, it is wrong to receive extraordinary record revenues and profits benefiting from war and on the back of our consumers,"" she argued. Defending EU sanctions on Russia, she said: ""This is the time for us to show resolve, not appeasement."" ""Russia's financial sector is on life-support,"" she asserted, with nearly 1,000 international companies having left the country. ""The Russian military is taking chips from dishwashers and refrigerators to fix their military hardware because they ran out of semiconductors. Russia's industry is in tatters."" Russia has so far largely managed to avoid the economic meltdown predicted back in the spring when sweeping sanctions were imposed. It has cushioned the blow with revenue from oil and gas sales. Ukraine has officially been a candidate for accession to the EU since June. It recently began a counter-offensive to drive back Russian troops, reportedly regaining thousands of sq km of territory in the east and the south this month. ""This is the time for us to show resolve, not appeasement,"" said Ms von der Leyen. ""We are in it for the long haul."" It was her conviction, she said, ""that with courage and solidarity, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin will fail and Europe will prevail"". Russia, a global energy supplier, is locked in an economic struggle with the EU which imposed sweeping sanctions in response to the invasion. Before the invasion, Russia accounted for 40% of the EU's imported gas. That figure has since fallen to below 10%. This summer, European gas prices were about 10 times higher than their average level over the past decade. A portion of the gas is also burnt to generate electricity, meaning that high gas prices push up power bills too. Ms von der Leyen said EU states had managed to stockpile gas reserves for the winter to 84% of capacity, well ahead of an October deadline. She named the US, Norway and Algeria as ""reliable"" gas suppliers. She also announced plans to set up a European hydrogen bank to promote investment of up to â¬3bn in that fuel as a green alternative to fossil fuels. This video can not be played Watch: What is hydrogen energy and why is it important? By Jessica Parker, BBC Brussels correspondent State of the Union speeches are always wide-ranging and, in that sense, this one was no different. But of course the circumstances have dramatically changed from Ursula von der Leyen's last address, one year ago. The fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated an energy crisis that is now the dominant issue within the bloc. Deep, longer-term, energy market reforms are being mooted but I understand those will not be ready until next year. The more immediate proposals, to tackle high prices, centre on cuts to consumption and de facto windfall taxes on energy companies. The European Commission president was trying to send a message about European resolve this winter. Sanctions against Russia were ""here to stay"", she said. But questions still hang over the EU's readiness to impose more penalties against President Putin, while promises of integrating Ukraine more into the EU's orbit and economy will be closely watched by its government and citizens. How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports? What pushed gas prices to extreme highs? Germany vows â¬65bn package to combat energy crisis Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Israel and Hamas reach Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, sources tell BBC UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Why the small drop in inflation matters to you The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

Some hospital treatments being postponed on Monday,"Thousands of NHS operations and appointments look set to be cancelled on the day of the Queen's funeral. The introduction of a last-minute bank holiday has meant hospitals are now postponing some routine treatments which had been booked in for Monday. A host of leading hospitals told the BBC there would be some disruption to their services. The NHS said patients should be contacted by hospitals to let them know whether their appointment is on or not. Patients are being asked not to contact hospitals directly. Some trusts also reported patients were cancelling their appointments themselves because of the funeral. The disruption is affecting planned treatments, such as hip replacements and outpatient appointments. Emergency care services will be running as normal. Covid vaccination clinics are largely carrying on, with the NHS asked in particular to prioritise those being done in care homes. One of those affected is John Coyle, from Kent. He was due to have a stent removed, but that procedure has been put off until the end of October. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I've almost lost count of how many procedures I've had postponed or cancelled. ""I'm sure if the Queen knew what was happening she wouldn't have let it happen. It's totally unnecessary."" Doctors' leaders said hospitals needed greater clarity on what was expected of them, as there is quite a wide variation in terms of approaches being taken. For example, London's Barts Health said it would be keeping planned surgery going, but neighbouring trusts in the city said most routine treatments would be postponed. GPs allowed to close on day of Queen's funeral Prof Philip Banfield, of the British Medical Association, said: ""There remains confusion over what NHS services will be provided in hospitals. NHS England must urgently clarify their advice about the services they are expected to provide and how they will be resourced to do so."" Imperial College Healthcare, which runs five hospitals in London, said it had ""decided on balance it is best to postpone much of the planned care that was due to take place"". In a statement, the trust said it would continue with all urgent and emergency services and routine appointments that were ""time-critical"". Other NHS trusts which confirmed there would be some disruption to routine services include Bedfordshire Hospitals, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham and King's College Hospital and the Royal Free, both of which are in London. Bosses in Greater Manchester said some treatments would be affected across its network of hospitals, but it would prioritise urgent treatment. In Scotland, NHS bosses said there may be some scaling back of operations in some areas - although in parts of the nation Monday had already been designated as a regional holiday. In Wales, there is expected to be some disruption too with the Aneurin Bevan health board, which covers Gwent, saying only urgent treatments would proceed. One of the key issues hospitals are trying to work through is which staff will be available, with schools closed and normal childcare arrangements possibly disrupted. But some hospitals said they feared significant numbers of patients would also cancel their appointments themselves or not turn up, because of a desire to watch the funeral or take part in events. Dr Layla McCay, of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said it was vital patients let services know if they would not be attending. She said where the NHS was rescheduling appointments, this would be communicated early and re-booked as soon as possible: ""The NHS is very familiar with providing support for its patients every day of the year, including over public holidays.""

Milk and cheese push food inflation to 14-year high,"The soaring price of milk, cheese and eggs has pushed food inflation to its highest level for 14 years. Food prices rose at their fastest pace since 2008 in the year to August as the war in Ukraine continued to help drive up prices at supermarket tills. Falling petrol and diesel prices meant the overall inflation rate eased slightly but it remains near a 40-year high, official figures show. Rising costs are eating into budgets,with prices rising further than wages. Overall UK inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, eased for the first time in almost a year in August, slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. The figure was not as high as economists had feared but some have warned the inflation rate is likely to continue to rise, noting that the cost of food, clothing and services - which include things such as shops and restaurant prices - were all continuing to rise sharply. The Bank of England has warned inflation could top 13% this year, and is expected to keep raising interest rates to try to control it. However,the government plan to try and prevent widespread hardshipby limiting rises in household energy bills, is likely to mean inflation will now not rise as high as previously expected. ""High inflation continues to drive Britain's cost-of-living crisis, but the outlook has brightening considerably over the past week,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""The Energy Price Guarantee should prevent a second winter surge in prices."" ""However, high inflation is set to be with us for some time, particularly for low-income who continue to be hit hardest by high prices."" Food prices have been going up around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. The war has disrupted supplies from the two countries, which are major exporters of goods such as sunflower oil, wheat, and fertiliser. The easing in the inflation rate reflects some respite at the petrol pumps over summer. The real question is whether we are now past the peak? That would have been a ridiculous suggestion a week ago before the Energy Price Guarantee. But that should take 4 to 6 percentage points off headline inflation in the coming months. The problem is that other sources of inflation are still surging. Food prices rose over the month of August, by the highest rate since 1995, driven by basics such as milk, cheese and eggs. Services inflation, which captures rising wages in large parts of the economy, is still going up too. And, of course, even at 9.9%, prices are rising much faster than wages, and much higher than the Bank of England's 2% target. The Bank is still likely to raise interest rates repeatedly in the coming months. So the expectation is that this is a dip, before further rises alongside the increase in energy bills next month. However, the peak, when it comes, should be much closer to where we are now, perhaps 11 or 12%, than anticipated before the Prime Minister's energy guarantee. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Central banks around the world, including the Bank of England, have been trying to get soaring inflation under control by hiking interest rates. Raising rates is a way of controlling inflation, as it increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow and spend less. It also encourages people to save more. The Bank had been widely expected to increase rates again on Thursday, butit postponed that decision following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The Monetary Policy Committee's decision will now be announced on 22 September. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors said she still expected interest rates to go up when the Bank of England announced its latest decision. ""The fact that the falling headline rate is due to changes in the price of petrol and diesel, which is driven predominantly by the international price of oil rather than by domestic factors, means news is unlikely to alter expectations of a rise in interest rates,"" she said, noting the Bank would act to try to stem UK price rises, such as food and services. According to separate figures published by the ONS, house prices recorded their biggest annual increase in 19 years in the year to the end of July. The 15.5% rise compared with a 7.8% annual increase the previous month. The jump was mainly due to the effects of the stamp duty holiday last year. The stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland was reduced from July last year, before being phased out in October 2021. A similar property tax holiday in Wales ended at the end of June last year and the equivalent holiday in Scotland ended at the end of March. All were a response to concerns about the economic effect of Covid lockdowns. As a result, the jump recorded for this July was mainly because of the contrast with the falls in prices seen this time last year. The average UK house price was Â£292,000 in July, the ONS said.

YouTuber guilty of Oval pitch trespass,"Daniel Jarvis collided with England batsman Jonny Bairstow during the fourth Test at the Oval A self-styled YouTube prankster who collided with England cricketer Jonny Bairstow after invading the pitch at the Oval has been found guilty of aggravated trespass. Daniel Jarvis, 34, ran into the batter at the non-striker's end after sprinting on to the field to bowl at Ollie Pope on day two of thefourth Test against Indialast September. He said he did not believe he was trespassing because he had a ticket. Jarvis will be sentenced next month. The defendant, from Gravesend in Kent, has a YouTube account with more than 170,000 subscribers. He said that some people ""run out naked"" during games but do not get arrested. Jarvis told Croydon Magistrates' Court that he ""accidentally"" made contact with Bairstow, adding: ""I can't remember the man's name."" Bairstow scored a total of 37 runs in the Test match, which India won by 157 runs District Judge Daniel Benjamin said: ""The issue in the case is straightforward, namely whether he intended to disrupt the Test match."" He concluded this was the defendant's intention, adding: ""I find Mr Jarvis guilty of aggravated trespass."" The court was shown broadcast footage of Jarvis running on to the pitch, as well as a video he recorded showing him hiding in a toilet before sprinting on to the field after receiving a phone call telling him the time was right. The court also viewed videos of him invading the pitch at two previous matches between England and India last year, at Lord's on 12 August and at Headingley on 25 August. Jarvis, who represented himself, said he was not arrested over those pitch invasions, adding ""no-one has been prosecuted for these things before"". ""I didn't intend to disrupt the match,"" he told the court. ""I didn't know when I was coming out. Why wasn't I arrested before? Why is everyone attacking me for it?"" Jarvis said he got ""positive feedback"" on his videos, which he made for ""people's pleasure"". He was granted unconditional bail.

Flight with Queen's coffin most tracked in history,"The flight taking the Queen's coffin to London was the most tracked in history, website Flightradar24 has said. Nearly six million people tried to follow the plane's route from Edinburgh to RAF Northolt within its first minute in the air, the website said. The huge traffic caused disruptions to the site, where users can track the path of planes in the air. More than 4.79 million people watched on its site and app and 296,000 were watching on a YouTube stream, it said. The previous record was when a flight carrying US politician Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan last month was followed by 2.2 million people on Flightradar24. The Queen's coffin was flown on an RAF Globemaster C-17, after lying in state at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. The flight used the callsign ""Kittyhawk"", used for any military flight with the Queen on board. Princess Anne and her husband Sir Timothy Laurence accompanied the coffin, with the princess saying she had felt fortunate to be able to share the final hours of the life of her ""dearest mother"". ""It has been an honour and a privilege to accompany her on her final journeys,"" she added. Prime Minister Liz Truss and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace were among those waiting at RAF Northolt for the flight, which landed just before 19:00 BST. Flightradar24 said it had taken steps to make its platform as stable as possible before the plane took off. The flight to Taiwan taken byMs Pelosi, the US House of Representatives Speaker, in Augustattracted interest as she was the highest-ranking American official in 25 years to visit Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province. Explaining how Tuesday's figures had dwarfed that traffic, Flightradar24 said: ""Based on our experience last month, we expected a large influx of users, but this immediate, massive spike was beyond what we had anticipated."" It said about 600,000 users were able to ""successfully follow the flight before performance degraded"". ""Even though our platform suffered under such heavy load, Queen Elizabeth II's final flight from Edinburgh to RAF Northolt is by far the all-time most tracked flight on Flightradar24 and will likely remain at the top for a long while,"" it said.

Detail on promised energy help for firms delayed,"Government support for businesses struggling with energy bills may not arrive until November. However, the help would be backdated, and cover the period from 1 October, a government spokesperson said. Last week Prime Minister Liz Truss said firms would get ""equivalent support"" to the help that was announced for households. But companies have been in the dark as to what that actually means, including how much support they will get. A government spokesperson said: ""We will confirm further details of the business support scheme next week. The scheme will support businesses with their October energy bills, including through backdating if necessary."" The help may be backdated because the precise mechanism and amount of support may not be finalised till November, a government source said. The support for business was also time-limited to six months, with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but there was little indication of what that means either. Energy bills to be capped at Â£2,500 for typical household Energy bills: 'The government help is no use to me' Alan Soady from The Federation for Small Business told the BBC ""all businesses are vulnerable if they are energy users and let's face it, the problems in the gas market don't look they are going away in six months"". Unlike households - where a cap on the unit price for gas and electricity means an average household will pay Â£2,500 per year for energy - there is no such mechanism for businesses. Firms have a huge variety of different contracts based on the intensity of their usage and the mix between gas and electricity. Many big businesses also have their own energy buying departments and systems to insure themselves, or ""hedge"", against extreme price movements. Also, unlike households, there is no price cap, and therefore no moment when everyone's bills will change. Firms typically have one or two-year fixed contracts, but a significant number - the CBI estimates a third - traditionally come up for renewal before winter and in October. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said meetings continue, to thrash out the details of their approach, and the business of government goes on during the official mourning period. That will be little comfort to a business owner I spoke to last week agonising over whether to hand back the keys to his premises ahead of this winter. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have written a blank cheque trying to avert a recession. Households' knowledge their bills are fixed for the next two years will help in that endeavour, but few businesses will invest, hire, or sign a new lease until they know what help is coming their way, when and for how long. If recession is to be avoided, the government will need to provide more detail, and reassurance as soon as possible.

How long is the queue to see the Queen's coffin?,"There were huge queues along the banks of the River Thames, where people waited to pay their respects to the Queen. People were told not to set off to see the lying-in-state on Sunday, as the queue reached full capacity. Just after 22:40, the queue was closed to new entrants. At 06:30 BST on Monday the lying-in-state ended. Here's what else you need you to know about the queue. At its longest, the wait time was more than 24 hours. The queue's maximum length was 10 miles - with 6.9 miles from Westminster to Southwark, and a three-mile zigzag queue in Southwark Park. For updates, the government published alive queue tracker for people to follow on YouTube,external. YouTube: DCMS,external Twitter: DCMS,external Facebook: DCMS,external People were warned they would need to stand for many hours with little opportunity to sit down, as the queue is constantly moving. On Sunday morning, thegovernment tracker,externaladvised people not to set off to join the queue as the entry point might soon close. The queue finally closed late on Sunday evening. People in the queue received coloured wristbands so they could leave for a drink, or go to the toilet, and then return. Those in the queue were asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Watch live: The Queen's lying-in-state What is lying in state? As people passed through Albert Embankment they were directed across Lambeth Bridge, into Victoria Tower Gardens, towards Parliament. They went through airport-style security before entering Westminster Hall, inside the Palace of Westminster. There were more than 500 portable toilets at various points along the route. Local venues and museums - including the Southbank Centre, the National Theatre, BFI Southbank and Shakespeare's Globe - stayed open for extended hours and in some cases for 24 hours, for people to use their facilities. This video can not be played People have queued through the night for the chance to pay their respects to the Queen lying in state Anyone hoping to pay their respects had until 06:30 BST on Monday when the lying-in-state ended. But organisers warned the queue would be closed well before this so that people did not join the line and fail to reach Westminster Hall in time. The announcement was published on government social media accounts at 22:41 on Sunday. What's a state funeral? Will shops close? And other questions How can I pay my respects to the Queen? What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral The accessible queue reached full capacity at 16:44 on Saturday and was permanently closed, according to the organisers. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that all time slots for the accessible queue had been allocated and it was permanently shut. It also asked people not to attempt to join it. The accessible queue had already been paused on on Friday evening, due to high demand, but entry resumed for several hours from midday on Saturday. For anyone already allocated a time slot for the accessible queue, step-free access was available to Westminster Hall and guide dogs and other assistance dogs were allowed. British Sign Language interpreters were available. Visitor assistants in Parliament guided wheelchair users and any people with mobility issues (and their carers) along a route to access Westminster Hall. Transport bosses confirmed extra train serviceswould be running. Transport for London said the Westminster area of London would be ""exceptionally busy"". People were asked to avoid driving into London if possible. Some roads were closed, especially around Westminster itself, which disrupted bus services. Travel providers said the best way to get around central London was by using London Underground and rail services, although there was the possibility of temporary Tube station closures at short notice, along with special queuing arrangements. Network Rail said that some London train stations, including King's Cross and London Victoria,would remain open for 24 hours,externalto provide shelter for mourners waiting to take the train home. It added that many toilets, shops and restaurants within the stations would also stay open during this time. Visitors were advised toplan ahead,external, check real-time travel information, and consider walking instead wherever possible. People were also asked to avoid Green Park Tube station unless they needed step-free access. There was no ticketing system. There were a number of rules about what you could take into Westminster Hall, and how visitors should behave - there was further informationon the Houses of Parliament website,external. People did not need to show formal identification to enter the hall, but airport-style security checks were in place. People were advised tocheck the weather conditions in advance, and dress accordingly. They were also advised to bring: food and drink - although these would need to be consumed or thrown away before reaching the security checks any essential medication or equipment a portable mobile phone charger There wasdetailed guidance about what cannot be brought into the hall,external, which included: flasks or non-clear bottles - only clear water bottles were allowed in flowers or other tribute items - flowers could be taken to the dedicated area in Green Park any sharp items including knives coolers, hampers, sleeping bags and other camping equipment non-foldable pushchairs banners, placards, flags, advertising or marketing messages Any prohibited items would be confiscated and not returned. Police could also conduct security checks along parts of the queue. Each person was only allowed to take in one small bag with a single opening or zip. There was a bag-drop facility with limited capacity. People were asked to respect the dignity of the event, and to remain silent while inside the Palace of Westminster and dress appropriately, Anyone wearing clothes with ""political or offensive slogans"" would not be allowed in. Mobile phones and other electrical devices had to be turned off or put on silent mode. Once inside Westminster Hall, the queue was divided to pass on either side of the catafalque, which is the raised platform where the closed coffin lies. Visitors were asked to keep moving forward at all times while in line, until they have exited into Parliament Square. Not inside. Filming, photography and the use of mobile phones or other devices was not allowed in the security search area or once inside the Palace of Westminster. There were eight first aid stations run by St John Ambulance along the route. They were at Southwark Park, Potters Fields Park, the Tate Modern, the Southbank Centre, Belvedere Road, Archbishop's Park, Lambeth Palace and Victoria Tower Gardens. And more than 1,000 volunteers, stewards and police officers were on hand to help anyone who needed it. Volunteers were from the Scouts, Girlguiding, Samaritans, the British Red Cross, First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and the Salvation Army. There were water stations along the route, and venues and museums will provide refreshments. A one-minute silence was held across the UK at 20:00 BST on Sunday 18 September, the night before the Queen's funeral. A two-minute silence will then be observed at the end of the Queen's funeral, at about 11:55 BST on Monday 19 September. Large numbers of floral tributes have been placed by the public at royal residences around the UK. The Royal Household has issued guidance on where they can be left: AtBuckingham Palace, dedicated sites have been set up in Green Park and Hyde Park. AtWindsor Castle, they can be left at Cambridge Gate on the Long Walk and at the Royal Family'sSandringham Estatein Norfolk, flowers can be left at the Norwich Gates.

Google loses appeal over record EU anti-trust fine,"An EU court has largely upheld a record fine against Google for using the Android platform to cement its search engine's dominance. The â¬4.125bn (Â£3.5bn) penalty is the largest anti-trust fine ever handed down by the European Commission. It said Google had breached its laws by forcing Android phone-makers to carry its search and web browser apps in order to access the Google Play Store in 2018. Google has since changed its terms. The firm said it was ""disappointed"" by the verdict. ""Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world,"" Google said in a statement. Google acquired the mobile phone operating system developer, which today powers roughly 70% of the world's mobile phones, in 2005 for $50m (Â£43m). The European General Court reducedthe European Commission's original fineslightly in Wednesday's final ruling on Google's appeal. It said this was to reflect ""the gravity and the duration"" of the infringement. ""The General Court largely confirms the Commission's decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,"" it said. A European Commission spokesperson said it will ""carefully study the judgement and decide on possible next steps"". The European Consumer Organisation, which represents a network of consumer groups across the EU,welcomed the ruling.,external Monique Goyens, its director general, said the ruling ""confirms that Europe's consumers must enjoy meaningful choice between search engines and browsers on their phones and tablets"". She said Google had deprived consumers of ""genuine choice"" over which search engines to use. ""If they preferred, for example, to use more innovative and privacy-friendly services, Google's restrictions prevented them from doing so."" The court's ruling shores up the European Commission's efforts to clamp down on Big Tech, after anti-trust fines against Intel and Qualcomm were quashed by the European General Court earlier this year. Google says it was acting like any other business when it told other manufacturers using Android that in order to include the Play Store on their smartphones and tablets, they also had to pre-install Google's own search and web apps. Without that store, the devices would have had limited access to other apps, making them a lot less desirable to buy. The EU says this was unlawful. The appeal has dragged on for four years now, but Google did change its terms after the original ruling, in 2018. The European court lowered the fine slightly to reflect this - but it's still the largest anti-trust penalty it has ever given out. Google says Android offers more choice, not less, and that anyone is free to change their search and web browser apps - but the reality is that most people never stray from the option that came with their phone. The EU argues Google used its position to obtain too large a share of the search pie A number of different manufacturers use Android as the operating system for their devices. Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines. But at the time of the original 2018 judgement the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that only 1% of users downloaded a rival search app, and 10% a different browser. Google rejected the accusation. ""Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,"" chief executiveSundar Pichai blogged,external. In that original ruling, the EU commission said that Google had abused its ""dominant position"" by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on manufacturers because: it required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and its own web browser Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store it prevented manufacturers from selling any smart devices powered by alternative ""forked"" versions of Android by threatening to refuse them permission to pre-install its apps it made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators so that they agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices Google was required to ""stop and to not re-engage in any of the three types of practices"" or do anything else that might have the same effect. In denying Google's appeal, the court agreed with all but the last of these findings - concerning payments to manufacturers - which it annulled. The European Commission first began scrutinising Android in April 2015, after a complaint by FairSearch - a lobby group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members. Clifford Chance, a law firm representing FairSearch, said the latest judgment was a ""vindication"" of its client's complaint. A partner of the firm, Dieter Paemen, said in a statement: ""The annulment of one of the infringements found and the reduction of the fine won't lighten up the mood in Mountain View - that's just a drop in the bucket for Google. ""This is a positive outcome for consumers who stand a better chance of real choices on their mobile devices."" Now, Mr Paemen said, the Commission must turn to seriously enforcing the ""remedies"" in the decision.

Queen's favourite brands hope to keep Royal Warrants,"In many cupboards, bathroom cabinets - or even on the side of a few lorries - the Queen's Royal Arms have, as a symbol, shown consumers that those same products grace palaces and castles. But all of that is about to change. When Queen Elizabeth II passed away at her Scottish estate in Balmoral, more than 600 Royal Warrants passed with her. These symbols on packaging or websites not only show that the companies meet exacting standards, but have also supplied the Royal Household on a regular basis. The Royal Warrant Association has said, however, that these businesses must now reapply for their warrants. They are reviewed after a change in reigning sovereign but companies can continue to use the Royal Arms in connection with the business for up to two years. Listen: Shop like the Queen At Crown Paints in Darwen, Lancashire, they are hoping they'll be able to keep that special relationship. ""It's a real badge of honour and we're really proud of it,"" explains marketing director Katie McLean, adding that it has become a key factor when it comes to recruiting and retaining staff. ""We have people who have worked here for generations, whose family worked here back in the 1960s when the Queen visited us."" The business was awarded the Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1949 and it was renewed by the Queen in 1955. Crown Paints was awarded the Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1949. A metal crest hangs high above the main doors of its head office and the firm has recently supplied paints to Sandringham estate and Frogmore Cottage. Although Katie admits it's good for business - and for exports - she says the Warrant runs far deeper than that: ""It's instilled a sense of pride but also responsibility in everyone here at Crown. It means we've always worked with community projects here and lead the way in sustainability,"" she said. ""We'll carry on doing that and hope that it's something we and the King are aligned on."" Sustainability - and the environment - are the words that keep coming up when speaking to businesses about the potential desires of King Charles III. The 180 warrants Charles issued as Prince of Wales will continue now that he is King because they go with the household, not the title. Many of the products affiliated with the Queen are very high-end; Fortnum & Mason goodies, champagnes and equine supplies. Others include household items such as Marmite, Twinings Tea, Tate & Lyle sugars, Cadbury's chocolates and Heinz sauces. Heinz has been supplying Royal Households since 1951, thanks to inheriting some close connections when it purchased Lea and Perrins. The latter even made a tiny miniature bottle for the children's doll's house in Windsor Castle in 1924. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the Heinz factory near Wigan in 2009. First stocked as luxuries in department stores, Heinz goods are now present in many kitchens across the country. In May 2009, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the Heinz factory in Kitt Green near Wigan, to mark the 50th anniversary of its official opening, a Heinz spokesperson said. And they're not the only American family favourite on the list. Kellogg's director Paul Wheeler says the company has such a strong history of serving up cereal to the Queen, they once had a little van, called Genevieve, to make deliveries to the palace. Paul Wheeler told the BBC the firm had held a Royal Warrant for the entirety of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. ""Nowadays, the Royals get their cereal from us through their normal grocery supplier,"" Paul added, but he said it has been a privilege to hold the Warrant for the Queen's entire reign, and part of that of her father King George VI too. As an American firm, the Warrant has been a boost for Kellogg's. Although the crest is a mark of quality for their products, it does not go on each box. The Manchester production site is Kellogg's largest in Europe, but boxes shipped to the Republic of Ireland, for example, do not include the crest. Change does also mark a moment of opportunity. Consumer behaviour expert Dr Amna Khan says such marks, much like Red Tractor or Fairtrade, are a shorthand for making purchasing decisions. ""They streamline purchasing decisions and these products will make consumers feel elevated, buying into status and nostalgia,"" said the senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University. Dr Aman Khan is a senior lecturer in consumer behaviour and retailing at Manchester Metropolitan University Dr Khan suspects that King Charles III's Warrants will continue the trend of modernisation: ""We'll see newer brands that connect with consumers better,"" she said. ""That's the best endorsement any product can get. All any logo wants to say is that [this company is] different and distinct - and it doesn't get much more distinct than the royal family."" Firms can, of course, also fall from favour. In 1999, the palace decided to end the royal endorsement of the tobacco company Gallaher - makers of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut cigarettes - ending a 122-year agreement with the firm. The palace said at the time it was due to lack of demand from the Royal Household, but commentators said that King Charles - a fervent anti-smoker - was reportedly instrumental in the withdrawal. It was welcomed by anti-smoking groups. The King and the Queen Consort now have the power to award a Warrant. There is also an expectation that the new King will grant his son and heir, Prince William, the ability to issue his own Warrants. But it remains to be seen which type of firms are bestowed with the honour. What will happen to stamps, coins, banknotes and passports?

Xi and Putin to discuss Ukraine war at meeting,"It's the first time Xi Jinping, seen here arriving in the Kazakh capital, has left China since early 2020 China's leader Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin will discuss the war in Ukraine and other ""international and regional topics"" at their meeting later this week, the Kremlin says. The two will meet in Uzbekistan at a summit that will show an ""alternative"" to the Western world, the Kremlin said. Mr Xi is making his first trip overseas since the start of the pandemic. He is seeking a historic third term whileMr Putin's relations with the West are at rock bottomover Ukraine. Mr Xi made his first stop in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, where he landed in the capital Nursultan for the first leg of his three-day trip. He then travelled to Uzbekistan to meet Mr Putin at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Samarkand, which will run from 15-16 September. Mr Putin will also meet other leaders including those of India, Pakistan, Turkey and Iran - but his meeting with China's leader ""is of particular importance"", said Kremlin foreign policy spokesman Yuri Ushakov. He said the summit was taking place ""against the background of large-scale political changes"". China and Russia have long sought to position the SCO, founded in 2001 with four ex-Soviet Central Asian nations, as an alternative to Western multilateral groups. Mr Putin (left) and Mr Xi last met in person in Beijing in February The SCO meeting comes amid fresh clashes on the border between two of its members, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Reports say at least one border guard was killed and two injured - their nationalities are not known. Sporadic clashes between the two countries, over a water dispute and other issues, broke out last year. Mr Xi's visit comes amid afresh set of lockdownsin China, where his zero Covid policy is still in place. While the rest of the world has opened up, Beijing continues to shut down entire cities and provinces every time there is a rise in cases. Mr Xilast left China in January 2020 to visit Myanmar- just days before the first lockdown came into effect in Wuhan. He has remained in China since then, leaving the mainland only once - in July this year to visit Hong Kong. India-China ties under spotlight at SCO summit Russian oil is turning to new Asian markets Zero Covid holds danger for China's Xi Mr Putinis also making a rare foray abroad. His meeting with Turkish and Iranian leaders in Tehran in July was only his second foreign trip since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. This is the two leaders' second meeting this year - they last met at the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. Following that meeting, the two leaders issued a joint statement saying the friendship between their countries had ""no limits"". Russia invaded Ukraine days later - an action China has neither condemned nor voiced support for. Beijing, in fact, has said both sides are to blame. China is not part of the international sanctions against Russia and trade between the two countries has continued to grow. Indian and Chinese imports of Russian oil have soared since the Ukraine invasion. China too has seen its relations with the West and especially the US sour in recent months following tensions over self-ruled Taiwan. China claims the island as part of its territory. Last month, Beijing staged a five-day military blockade around the island in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit. China watchers say Mr Xi's decision to leave China after more than two years, despite significant domestic challenges - crippling lockdowns and a faltering economy - show his confidence in his leadership. Analysts expect him to be re-elected for an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party Congress in October. China's leader significantly reduced the risk that he would catch the coronavirus by not travelling internationally for more than two years (assuming, of course, that he has not already been infected and we don't know about it). Keeping Xi Jinping at home also served a propaganda purpose - it got the message out to Chinese people that they too should not travel abroad during this time of crisis. Now that Mr Xi has decided to start travelling again, does it mean the Party considers it safer for him to do so? Another question: if it wasn't safe a year ago, why is it safe now? Also, will images of Mr Xi in other countries lead to expectations that travel restrictions should be eased further to smooth the path for Chinese people to go overseas again? In China, the government doesn't feel the need to spell out its reasoning when making such decisions, so we never know exactly what the thinking is behind them. However, this trip will be seen in China as a small indication that the country may soon see a reduction in its ""zero Covid"" measures. I say ""may"" because, if the government has a plan to eventually bring an end to its strict coronavirus strategies, it's certainly not sharing it with the public. The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic and security organisation that was founded by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in 2001. Iran is currently looking to join the group. Members will discuss trade at the summit, with China being a major investor in the region through its Belt and Road projects. Beijing has long looked to open up new rail routes for its trade to Europe, while Central Asian countries are eager for more connections to China. Earlier this year, Kyrgyzstan announced it would begin construction in 2023 on a new line connecting it to China and Uzbekistan.

Inflation rate eases but still near 40-year high,"The soaring price of milk, cheese and eggs has pushed food inflation to its highest level for 14 years. Food prices rose at their fastest pace since 2008 in the year to August as the war in Ukraine continued to help drive up prices at supermarket tills. Falling petrol and diesel prices meant the overall inflation rate eased slightly but it remains near a 40-year high, official figures show. Rising costs are eating into budgets,with prices rising further than wages. Overall UK inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, eased for the first time in almost a year in August, slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. The figure was not as high as economists had feared but some have warned the inflation rate is likely to continue to rise, noting that the cost of food, clothing and services - which include things such as shops and restaurant prices - were all continuing to rise sharply. The Bank of England has warned inflation could top 13% this year, and is expected to keep raising interest rates to try to control it. However,the government plan to try and prevent widespread hardshipby limiting rises in household energy bills, is likely to mean inflation will now not rise as high as previously expected. ""High inflation continues to drive Britain's cost-of-living crisis, but the outlook has brightening considerably over the past week,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""The Energy Price Guarantee should prevent a second winter surge in prices."" ""However, high inflation is set to be with us for some time, particularly for low-income who continue to be hit hardest by high prices."" Food prices have been going up around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. The war has disrupted supplies from the two countries, which are major exporters of goods such as sunflower oil, wheat, and fertiliser. The easing in the inflation rate reflects some respite at the petrol pumps over summer. The real question is whether we are now past the peak? That would have been a ridiculous suggestion a week ago before the Energy Price Guarantee. But that should take 4 to 6 percentage points off headline inflation in the coming months. The problem is that other sources of inflation are still surging. Food prices rose over the month of August, by the highest rate since 1995, driven by basics such as milk, cheese and eggs. Services inflation, which captures rising wages in large parts of the economy, is still going up too. And, of course, even at 9.9%, prices are rising much faster than wages, and much higher than the Bank of England's 2% target. The Bank is still likely to raise interest rates repeatedly in the coming months. So the expectation is that this is a dip, before further rises alongside the increase in energy bills next month. However, the peak, when it comes, should be much closer to where we are now, perhaps 11 or 12%, than anticipated before the Prime Minister's energy guarantee. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Central banks around the world, including the Bank of England, have been trying to get soaring inflation under control by hiking interest rates. Raising rates is a way of controlling inflation, as it increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to borrow and spend less. It also encourages people to save more. The Bank had been widely expected to increase rates again on Thursday, butit postponed that decision following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The Monetary Policy Committee's decision will now be announced on 22 September. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors said she still expected interest rates to go up when the Bank of England announced its latest decision. ""The fact that the falling headline rate is due to changes in the price of petrol and diesel, which is driven predominantly by the international price of oil rather than by domestic factors, means news is unlikely to alter expectations of a rise in interest rates,"" she said, noting the Bank would act to try to stem UK price rises, such as food and services. According to separate figures published by the ONS, house prices recorded their biggest annual increase in 19 years in the year to the end of July. The 15.5% rise compared with a 7.8% annual increase the previous month. The jump was mainly due to the effects of the stamp duty holiday last year. The stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland was reduced from July last year, before being phased out in October 2021. A similar property tax holiday in Wales ended at the end of June last year and the equivalent holiday in Scotland ended at the end of March. All were a response to concerns about the economic effect of Covid lockdowns. As a result, the jump recorded for this July was mainly because of the contrast with the falls in prices seen this time last year. The average UK house price was Â£292,000 in July, the ONS said. Food prices push inflation to new 40-year high UK inflation could hit 18% next year, experts warn Why are prices rising in the UK?

How one big cryptocurrency is going green,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says The Merge has been planned for years The second biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is about to switch over to a new operating model that uses 99.9% less energy. The change, called The Merge, is designed to win over critics who see cryptocurrencies as environmentally harmful. Ethereum currently uses as much energy as a medium-sized country. Other cryptocurrencies, including the biggest, Bitcoin, will remain as energy-intensive as before. Ethereum's co-founder Vitalik Buterin says The Merge has been part of the plan for Ethereum since it was launched in 2014 but has had to be postponed many times due to its technical complexity. The task has been compared with rebuilding the foundations of a skyscraper while it remains standing. The Ethereum blockchain supports not only the Ethereum currency but also hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of other coins and crypto products like NFTs. If something goes wrong it could jeopardise arguably the most important ecosystem in cryptocurrency, affecting large and small investors around the world. If all goes well, consumers should not notice any change. ""It's really exciting and a major achievement. Yes there are nerves in the sense that things will probably not go 100% smoothly, but that's expected,"" says Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake. ""We have infrastructure in place now that allows us to still move forward even if some parts of the network go down for some reason."" Computers are already working on carrying out the switchover. Anyone who searches for The Merge on Google sees a countdown tool, which predicts it will be completed in the early hours of Thursday GMT. The Ethereum blockchain is a giant, constantly updating database that logs every transaction that takes place. Up to now it has been updated, verified and maintained by a global network of volunteers with powerful computers, who are rewarded for this work with new coins - a process known as cryptomining. The Merge is forcing workers at Prima Technologies to replace their Ethereum equipment to start mining for Bitcoin This system is called Proof of Work and is used by many of the most popular blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Litecoin. The Merge will see the Ethereum Proof of Work blockchain merge with a carbon copy called the Beacon Chain which has been running on a new system called Proof of Stake since 2020. Proof of Stake vastly reduces the number of computers needed to maintain the blockchain, and cryptominers are replaced with a smaller number of ""validators"", who stake their own stash of Ethereum coins against their work. They lose it automatically if they make a mistake. As well as reducing the energy burden of Ethereum, Proof of Stake reduces the amount of coins given out as a reward and organisers say it will decrease the overall number of coins in existence. Not only does Proof of Stake reduce the number of computers needed, it also reduces the computing power needed. Everyday laptops and desktops can be used instead of expensive computers with powerful GPUs (graphics processing units). The decentralised nature of mining makes it hard to get an accurate picture of exactly how much energy is being used globally, but the Ethereum Foundation says that Ethereum wasusing as much electricity as The Netherlands,externalin June. Moving to Proof of Stake will reduce energy consumption to 0.01 Terrawatt hours per year, the foundation says. Latest estimates from Digiconomist, a group that studies the economics of digital trends, suggest the last few months has seen a reduction in the amount of power used in the network. It estimates that pre-Merge Ethereum usage is now at 82 Terrawatt hours per year, with a carbon footprint estimated to be similar to Finland's. The Merge leaves Ethereum's vast army of mining volunteers with a tough decision. Manchester-based Ethereum miner Josh Riddett hopes he'll still make money on less valuable coins Already the cryptocrash in the spring, when the value of coins plummeted, made cryptomining less profitable. Energy costs are also increasing in many parts of the world, reducing potential profits. Now miners of Ethereum will need to find a new way to make money with their equipment, or sell up. Somereports suggest a large-scale sell off of GPUs,externalhas already begun. At Dubai-based mining company Prima Technologies, the team is investing tens of thousands of dollars to replace their Ethereum GPU mining computers with even more expensive and energy-hungry machines able to mine for Bitcoin. This video can not be played How cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin work ""It's tough, as no other Proof of Work currencies are as profitable as Ethereum,"" spokesman Ammar Lashkari said. ""We're going to keep some of our Ethereum computers and start mining alternative coins but it will not be the same, so we're going to slowly diversify into Bitcoin mining."" In Staffordshire in the UK, Ash Andrews is hoping to still make profits mining for other coins with his existing equipment. ""I've got mixed feelings on The Merge. It's been an easy time for us miners just mining Ethereum, and now we'll have to switch to another coin. There's a lot of change."" he said. Some are more upbeat about the future of GPU mining. Josh Riddett, CEO of Easy Crypto Hunter, based in Manchester, thinks mining less popular coins will eventually be profitable. ""During the price peak of Ethereum every mining rig we had was making $150 a day, which is pretty crazy. Yes we're going through a bit of a numerical down period but who's to say what the value of other coins might be in three to five years time."" Update, 16 September 2022: The chart on this story originally showed energy consumption figures for YouTube, the gold mining industry and Paypal. The figures were taken from the Ethereum Foundation but we have since learned they are inaccurate and removed these bars from the chart. Inside Kazakhstan's giant crypto-mine.

Queen's coffin arrives at Buckingham Palace,"The Queen's coffin has arrived at Buckingham Palace and was greeted by members of the Royal Family It will move on Wednesday to Westminster Hall, where the Queen will lie in state for four days The Queen's daughter, the Princess Royal has issued a statement saying she was ""fortunate to share the last 24 hours of my dearest motherâs life"" Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to file past the coffin to pay their respects, with a huge policing operation expected King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort, who are now in London, earlier visited Northern Ireland as part of a tour of the UK They greeted crowds at Hillsborough Castle, met political leaders and attended a service at St Anne's Cathedral Edited by Marianna Brady We're closing our coverage here - but you can follow all the latest news onWednesday's live page here- including information about the Queen lying-in-state at Westminster Hall in London. Her coffin will move in a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Her son King Charles III will take part alongside her grandchildren, Princes William and Harry. The US House of Representatives has just observed a momentâs silence for the Queen. The lower chamber of Congress passed a bereavement resolution in honour of the late British sovereign, before adjourning for the day. Congressional leaders from both parties last week issued statements of tribute to the Queen. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the monarch âwas a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedomâ. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the Queen ârepresented what it means to lead with conviction, selflessness, and faith in God and in her peopleâ. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr
Rowan Williams, has been discussing the challenges facing the King and the UK as
the country enters a new phase in its history. Dr Williams told the BBCâs Newscast
podcast: âWeâre a society staring into a little bit of an abyss in the next few
months, where poverty and deprivation for quite a lot of people, are going to
be a major issue.â Talking about the role of King Charles
III, he said: âI think it is crucial that the new King give the message... that
he's committed to a society where nobody gets forgotten.â He went on to say: âLots of communities
are faced with really impossible choices about energy, about food, about their
general security. Itâs the biggest thing I know on the agenda of the new prime
minister and the new government. Itâs a watershed moment for them just as much
as for the monarchy.â Dr Williams said: âIf we can get through
this winter without collapse, we can manage with all those pressures, we will
have sent a very important message to the other end of Europe that we are
prepared to face some constraints for the sake of Ukraine.â Last Thursday, the government set
out its energy support plan which included limiting energy bill rises for all
households for two years, and six months for businesses. Newscastâs full interview with Dr Williams
is available on BBC Sounds. This video can not be played Energy, policing and Ukraine â news you may have missed. Kristian Johnsonreporting from London Truus Nayman is spending the night sat on a bench A small but extremely dedicated crowd are already waiting at the front
of the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state in London - and I have joined them. The group has grown to around 100 people and we will
be the first to enter Westminster Hall on Thursday evening. For now though, we
are waiting on the Albert Embankment Path near Lambeth Bridge, huddling
underneath umbrellas and wearing ponchos to shelter from the rain. Some have been here all day, including 85-year-old
Truus Nayman, who is spending the night sat on a bench. âItâs a very special atmosphere,â she said. Despite the rain, spirits remain high as people swap
stories about the Queen. There is a real sense of camaraderie as strangers
strike up close friendships to support one another as we wait - including
holding a spot in the line while neighbours go to the toilet or grab a coffee. âIâve got two friends and we will be doing a rota,"" said
Monica Farag. âThese will be my friends forever.â Westminster Hall is where King Charles III addressed members of parliament and peers on Monday - and where the Queen's coffin will lie in state from Wednesday. Built in 1097, the building has played a significant role in British history for centuries. It has hosted the trials of Charles I and Guy Fawkes, Henry VIII's coronation banquet, and speeches by well-known figures such as Nelson Mandela, French President Charles de Gaulle, Pope Benedict, and US President Barack Obama. The last member of the Royal Family to lie in state at Westminster was the Queen Mother in 2002, when more than 200,000 people queued to view her coffin. But it is not only royals who have lain in state in Westminster Hall. The same honour was extended to former Prime Minister Winston Churchill following his death in 1965 and to the victims of theR101 airship disaster of 1930. From Wednesday, the Queen's closed coffin will rest on a raised platform, known as a catafalque, beneath the 11th Century hall's medieval timber roof. Each corner of the platform will be guarded in a continuous vigil by soldiers that serve the Royal Household. The coffin will be draped in the Royal Standard and once in Westminster Hall it will be topped with the Imperial State Crown, orb and sceptre. Westminster Hall during Barack Obama's address in 2011 The Queen's coffin is now at rest at Buckingham Palace. The 775-room palace was her primary residence from the year of her coronation in 1953 until the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020. But the late monarch is said to have held mixed feelings towards the grand home. According to royal biographer Penny Junor in her book The Firm, the Queen had originally wanted to settle in Clarence House in London - where she had lived with her late husband Prince Philip after they were married in 1947. But following her coronation in 1953, Sir Winston Churchill, the prime minister at the time, pushed for the couple to move to Buckingham Palace, according to Junor. The Queen went onto live in Buckingham Palace's private quarters until 2020, when she made the move to Windsor Castle at the start of the pandemic. The Queen's coffin will travel from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on Wednesday afternoon, where she will lie in state for four days. The King, his two sons Princes William and Harry, and other senior royals will walk behind the coffin. Watch the route the procession will take below: This video can not be played The King will be joined by his sons Princes William and Harry in a procession accompanying the Queenâs coffin from Buckingham Palace to
Parliament on Wednesday. The procession will leave the palace just after lunchtime and will arrive at Westminster Hall, where the Queen will lie in state for four days. The King will also be joined by his siblings Prince Andrew, the Princess Royal, and the Earl of Wessex. Peter Phillips, vice admiral Sir
Tim Laurence, the Duke of Gloucester and the Earl of Snowdon will also walk behind the coffin. Camilla, the Queen Consort, the Princess of Wales, the Countess of
Wessex and the Duchess of Sussex will travel to the hall by car. A short service lasting around 20 minutes will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury accompanied by the Dean of Westminster. Toby LuckhurstReporting in London Barriers are being erected outside Parliament ahead of the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall Authorities in London are preparing for huge numbers of people to pay their respects to the Queen as she lies in state in Westminster Hall for four days from Wednesday. Dozens of people in hi-vis jackets lined the
queueing route, snaking along the South Bank past St Thomasâ Hospital and
across Lambeth Bridge to the Palace of Westminster. Poorna was one of those working on the
bridge. He arrived at 6am for a 13 hour shift. ""There's a
night shift too,"" he said. ""It's going to be a long one."" On the north side of the river, rope lines are staked out in the grass of Victoria Tower Gardens, south of the Palace of
Westminster. Forklifts drop off portable toilet blocks in the
garden while security stand guard. Police have arrived from across the country
to help with the operation - with vans from the Lancashire Constabulary sitting just off
Parliament Square. The route for people queuing to see the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall in Parliament has been released by the government. The line will start at Albert Embankment near Lambeth Bridge, and could stretch all the way to Southwark Park in south-east London. Those queuing are asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Once people reach the front of the queue, they will have to go through airport-style security before entering Parliament. Get more detailshere. The Queen with members of the Arsenal team in 2007 The Queen's coffin will rest in Buckingham Palace's Bow Room tonight, where it will be watched over by a rota of chaplains. The red-carpeted room in the west wing of the palace is named after the window that runs along its side. The late Queen hosted various distinguished guests in the Bow Room, including former US president George Bush, Premier League footballers, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team. George Bush being hosted at Buckingham Palace in 2003 Earlier today, the Queen's coffin was flown from Edinburgh to RAF Northolt in west London. From there, with thousands of people lining almost every part of the route, her hearse made its way to the palace in central London. Take a look: The bearer party from the Queen's Colour Squadron carried the Queen's coffin, cloaked in the Royal Standard, from the plane in RAF Northolt Thousands lined the streets to watch the Queen's hearse pass Cars stopped on the A40, with people watching the motorcade from the central reservation The crowd cheered as the Queen's hearse drew into Buckingham Palace King Charles III and Queen Consort have left Buckingham Palace after witnessing the arrival of the Queen's hearse a short time ago. Rajini VaidyanathanReporting from Buckingham Palace The sound of helicopters whirred above. The crowd held
their phones in the air, the rain continued to fall - and then she arrived. As
she made her final homecoming, some of the thousands who'd gathered outside Buckingham Palace wiped away tears, as Queen Elizabeth returned
to her official residence one last time. For the family, an evening of private mourning. For the
many gathered here, a poignant chapter as the nation says goodbye. This is the moment the Queen's coffin is greeted by huge crowds on its arrival at Buckingham Palace in central London. Take a look: This video can not be played George BowdenReporting from Buckingham Palace A huge cheer went up as the Queenâs hearse passed those waiting beside the palace. After a previously sombre atmosphere came a respectful celebration of the late Queen. Applause and shouts of ârest in peaceâ also met the cortÃ¨ge as it proceeded towards the Mall and round the Victoria Monument. Shouts of ""hip, hip, hooray!"" were also heard. The Queen's coffin has arrived at Buckingham Palace to cheers from the crowd. Alongside King Charles III, the hearse is being received by Princes William and Harry and other members of the Royal Family. Thousands of people lined the 14-mile route as the hearse travelled from RAF Northolt in west London. George BowdenReporting from Buckingham Palace The sound of a helicopter is providing the crowd outside the palace with a sign the Queenâs cortege is nearby. The atmosphere remains muted and sombre. George BowdenReporting from Buckingham Palace After a flurry of royal arrivals, thereâs just a smattering of chatter among the crowd assembled outside the palace. Some people are streaming live footage of the Queenâs coffin as it is conveyed through west London. Others speak about the Queen and members of her family theyâve seen arriving. Meanwhile, media from all over the world are broadcasting nearby. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
