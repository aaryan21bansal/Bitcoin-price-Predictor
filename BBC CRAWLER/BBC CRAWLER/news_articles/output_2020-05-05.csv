Here's a reminder of the main stories from Tuesday: Our live coverage was brought to you by: Yvette Tan, Saira Asher, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Alix Kroeger, Alex Kleiderman, Rebecca Seales, Joshua Cheetham, Steve Sutcliffe, Emlyn Begley,  Michael Emons, Doug Faulkner, Robin Levinson King, Max Matza, Vicky Bisset, Claudia Allen and Paulin Kola. Spain's Balearic and Canary Islands (pictured) are heavily reliant on tourism Well, some of those dreams we have referred to earlier may include people wondering what's going to happen to their summer holidays. Germany's federal tourism commissioner Thomas Bareiss is sounding optimistic. In a newspaper interview, Mr Bareiss said holidays abroad in Europe might be possible if the outbreak stays under control. While that probably means travel to neighbouring countries like France, Poland and Austria, ""I would not yet write off other regions in Europe, such as the Balearic Islands or the Greek islands"".

in several countries caused by the coronavirus pandemic seem to be having an
effect on people's dreams. Many of you say you're having unusually vivid ones - some of them mildly wacky, and some full-on nightmares. But why is this happening
and what can you do to make your sleep more peaceful? We asked an expert: This video can not be played Coronavirus dreams: Why are people having lockdown nightmares? The highest-ranking military general in the US has contradicted reports that the coronavirus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China. âDid it come out of the virology lab in Wuhan? Did it occur in a wet market there in Wuhan? Did it occur somewhere else?"" ""And the answer to that is: 'We donât know,'â Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told Pentagon reporters on Tuesday. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promoted the theory, saying there was âa significant amount of evidenceâ that the virus came out of Chinese labratory. Other countries have been less quick to blame China, as BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera writes. Coronavirus: US allies tread lightly around Trump lab claims With the White House coronavirus taskforce soon to be disbanded, reporters travelling with US President Trump on one of his first visits outside of Washington DC in over a month are asking if they will continue to be briefed by scientific experts. Mr Trump responds that the end of the taskforce is not a sign that the fight against the virus is over. ""No, not at all. The mission accomplished is when it's over,"" he says. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner has been leading a parallel coronavirus group, which is more business focused. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany has hit back at any suggestion that the scientific community is being sidelined by the US government. ""Reporting on the task force is being misconstrued to suggest the White House is no longer involving medical experts. This is totally false,"" she tweeted. ""President Donald Trump will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening."" Unusual celebrations are expected to take place for Cinco De Mayo today. It marks the anniversary of theMexican Army,external's victory over the French at theBattle of Puebla,externalon 5 May 1862. Although, these days it is mostly celebrated in the US, where it has moved away from its roots and is now seen as an excuse for tacos and a party. On Twitter, people have used the hashtag #CincoAtHome as they seek to make the best of the situation, sharing pictures of homemade margaritas and plans to order deliveries of Mexican food. Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria â who has Mexican heritage â was among those raising a glass to the occasion. She has co-organised an online Cinco De Mayo event - featuring major Latin stars, including Gloria Estefan, Luis Fonsi and Juanes â to raise money for thefarmworkersâ Covid-19 pandemic relief fund,external.

President Trump has said a ""different group"" will replace the White House coronavirus taskforce after it is expected to disband later this month. Speaking on a visit to the Honeywell facemask factory in Phoenix, Arizona, Mr Trump said the group - which includes health and disease experts - ""have done a great job, but weâre now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening"". ""And weâll have a different group probably set up for that."" According to US media, some members of the taskforce are just finding out through news reports that the group will be disbanded. Coronavirus: White House plans to disband virus task force Vienna Museum has received 1,800 photos since asking people to submit pictures to document the coronavirus pandemic for future generations. The museum of the history of the city has received photos of masks, signs and plenty more since the appeal on 25 March. It asked for ""photos of things that exemplify your new private or
professional life in the times of corona"" to be used in a collection in the museum. You can view some of the images they have received on theVienna Museum website.,external Austria has partly relaxed its lockdown measures A court in Argentina has suspended the release of prisoners during the pandemic after it emerged that violent offenders had been allowed to leave prison. The inmates who were released were considered to be at higher risk from Covid-19. The move had allowed hundreds of prisoners - including pregnant women - who had convicted of minor offences to return home in recent weeks. But there has been growing criticised after it emerged that people convicted of serious crimes - including one man who sexually abused a child - had been released. The court will decide whether to completely halt the releases in the coming days.   The French government has taken down a controversial web page that aimed to expose fake news about coronavirus. ""DÃ©sinfox Coronavirus"" was launched last week to promote ""trusted, verified sources of information"". It included fact-checking articles from five leading outlets. The page drew fire from politicians and many journalists, who accused the government of favouring sympathetic media.  The critics included editors from some of the newspapers singled out as ""trusted"". Announcing the removal of the page late on Tuesday, Culture minister Franck Riester said it had never been intended to denigrate any news source, but added that he understood the concerns raised. The UK and US have issued a joint warning thatcyber-spies are targeting the health sector. Hackers linked to foreign states have been hunting for information, including Covid-19 data and vaccine research, they say. UK sources say they have seen extensive activity but do not believe there has been any data theft so far. Those behind the activity are not named in the alert but are thought to include China, Russia and Iran. The three countries have all seen major outbreaks of the virus but have denied previous claims of involvement in such activity. Helen BriggsBBC Environment correspondent Mink have contracted coronavirus, adding to the list of animals known to be at risk of catching the virus. Mink at two fur farms in The Netherlands tested positive for Covid-19 a week ago. Last month, it was revealed that lions and tigers at a New York zoo had caught the disease from their keepers. Coronavirus could be ""catastrophic"" for endangered wildlife and we must act now to protect vulnerable species, Dr Peta Hitchens of the University of Melbourne said. Animal protection groups say the potential for disease spread is another reason for all fashion companies to go fur-free and for governments to shut down ""this dirty trade"".

But some are still offering haircuts illicitly, sometimes doubling the price. The BBC approached several barbers in south-east England to see how many are breaking the regulations. Here's what some had to say. This video can not be played The famous British conservationist and explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison has been through a few scrapes in his time and travels  - and at the age of 83 he's just returned home after a five-week hospital battle against Covid-19. 
""I was in a pretty bad way, in an induced coma - it's a nasty business,"" he says. 
""I very nearly dropped out a lot of times"". He partly credits his survival to the ""Secret Garden"" at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital.
""They wheeled me down into this wonderful new garden. It was extraordinary - the moment when I came through was when the sun was on my face.  Suddenly I came out of it."" The garden is full of donated flowers from the cancelled Chelsea Flower and is a haven for both intensive care staff and recovering patients. Intensive care nurse Kate Tantam has posted pictures of the garden and its role in rehabon Twitter,external. Robin and Louella Hanbury-Tenison Provincial police in Quebec are investigating a number of cellphone tower fires, which may be linked to conspiracy theories about 5G and coronavirus. Two separate fires in the neighbouring towns of Piedmont and PrÃ©vost were put out on Monday. A similar incident had occured on Friday in Laval. On Sunday, the town of PrÃ©vost had made a point of announcing on Facebook that there were no 5G towers in the area. Town spokesperson Mariepier Des Laurierstold Canadian media,externalthat a number of the town's residents have brought up those conspiracy theories, which suggest that 5G - which is the name for a type of technology used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is responsible for coronavirus. The unfounded conspiracy isone of the most widespread pieces of coronavirus misinformationon the internet. Dozens of phone masts across the UK have been attacked. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Professor Neil Ferguson, who hasquit his role as a UK government adviserafter breaking social distancing rules, is one of the worldâs most influential disease modellers. He is director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. The centreâs mathematical predictions advise governments and the World Health Organization on outbreaks from Ebola in West Africa to the current pandemic. It was that groupâs work, in early January, that alerted the world to the threat of coronavirus. It showedhundreds if not thousands of people were likely to have been infected in Wuhan,at a time when Chinese officials said there were only a few dozen cases. But he shot to public attention as âProfessor Lockdownâ. In mid-March, the maths showedthe UK needed to change courseor a quarter of a million people would die in a ""catastrophic epidemic"". Those calculations helped transform government policy and all lives. More than two thirds of people say they could run out of food and water if they had to stay at home for two weeks under coronavirus restrictions, a survey of people in 20 African countries has found. More than half said they would face financial difficulties. Many people on the continent work in the informal sector and have therefore been negatively impacted by lockdown measures. The research, which was conducted on behalf of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, aims to advise countries on how to deal with the pandemic in the future. The researchers urged policy makers to balance the pandemic and social and economic disruptions, or else risk unrest. On Tuesday, Nigeria followed Egypt, Rwanda, South Africa and Tunisia in beginning to relax its coronavirus restrictions. Food markets opened in Nigeria's financial capital Lagos for the first time in five weeks Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online US researchers report the first known case of placental infection
with pandemic coronavirus, also known as Sars-CoV-2.  The experts from
Yale School of Medicine say the 35-year-old woman was in the middle stage of
her pregnancy (the second trimester) when she developed complications and
needed hospital treatment. She had very high blood pressure and some bleeding
from her vagina -worrying signs in anyone expecting a baby. Ten days before
that she had had the classic coronavirus fever and cough that we are all being
told to look out for. An X-ray revealed signs of infection in her lungs. Her
blood pressure remained dangerously high - a condition that is called
pre-eclampsia in pregnant women and can be fatal for the mother and the baby.
The woman decided to opt for a termination of her pregnancy, which was at 22
weeksâ gestation, as her life was in danger. Her doctors then sent off the placenta for further
examination and found evidence of the virus. Experts say the pre-print publication,which is available online,external(but has not yet been peer-reviewed) is interesting but it is too soon to know what impact, if any, coronavirus has
on pregnancies. Prof Marian Knight, an expert in maternal health at the
University of Oxford in the UK, advises: âThe most important message for women
must be that they should continue to attend for their antenatal check-ups while
being vigilant about social distancing, particularly in the third trimester of
pregnancy"". Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent The mayor of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, says he wants the city's drastic reduction in traffic to become permanent. The number of cars has fallen dramatically because of emergency restrictions to tackle Covid-19. Shpend Ahmeti described Pristina as ""too beautiful to be destroyed by carsâ. He said the city authorities would implement measures including road pricing, more expensive parking and both permanent and temporary road closures. As mentioned, Professor Neil Ferguson has quit his role advising the government on coronavirus after admitting ""undermining"" the messages on social distancing rules. Prof Fergusonleads the team at Imperial College London,externaland their research claimed more than 500,000 Britons would die because of Covid-19 if no measures were taken, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson then introducing a lockdown in Britain on 23 March. Prof Ferguson's departure comes after the Daily Telegraph reported he had allowed a woman to visit him. He is not the first medical expert to have left their position after breaching the rules they were asking other Britons to observe.

Swann 'shocked' at images of packed flight,"This video can not be played ""There was no social distancing... no sanitiser,"" says passenger Sean Mallon Aer Lingus is boosting capacity on its Belfast-Heathrow route after images emerged showing a packed aircraft. Passenger Sean Mallon took the photos on the London-bound flight,which showed travellers sitting side-by-side. Health Minister Robin Swann has said he was shocked at the image and called for Aer Lingus to review its processes. The carrier said on Tuesday it was adding an extra flight on each day of operation to reduce passenger numbers on each aircraft. Aer Lingus also advised passengers to give themselves extra time at the airport as the check-in process would take longer to allow for the increased number of bags being put in the aircraft's hold. ""The safety and security of Aer Lingus' customers and crew is our number-one priority, and these process changes are being implemented as a matter of urgency."" Speaking shortly before the Aer Lingus statement was issued, Mr Swann said: ""I was shocked at the images of Aer Lingus. ""It is as if they were living in a time before Covid-19."" It was as if the airline was ""completely oblivious to any of the regulations, social distancing, or guidance that has been enunciated and published by our executive here and the government in Westminster"", said the health minister. Speaking at the daily Stormont press briefing on Tuesday, Mr Swann called on the carrier to revise its approach. Earlier, Belfast City Airport Chief Executive Brian Ambrose said there was no clear guidance on social distancing measures on an aircraft. Health Minister Robin Swann said he was shocked to see an image of people sitting side-by-side on an Aer Lingus flight The coronavirus crisis has seen NI flights suspended, apart fromtwo London services operating from Belfast City and City of Derry airports. Speaking on the BBC NI's Nolan Show on Tuesday, Mr Ambrose said social distancing measures were in place in the airport, but the issue arose after ""the first big influx of passengers"" on a flight since the pandemic. Mr Ambrose said it was not yet clear whether the issue was inadequate measures or if people were not adhering to the measures. Â£5.7m package to support remaining NI flights Aer Lingus review after packed flight complaint ""For the month of April the average loads on our flights were about 20% to 30%, so it hadn't become an issue with large volumes of people on a single flight,"" he said. ""Then on Monday there were 154 passengers on a 174-seater aircraft,"" he added. He said he had immediately been made aware of a number of ""pinch points"" by his operations director. ""We are putting more staff on the ground and making sure there is more compliance and customers adhere to it,"" he said Mr Ambrose said there was no clear guidance on social distancing measures on an aircraft. Thursday evening flights out of Belfast City are expected to become busier with the reopening of the construction industry ""It is not clear to anyone within the industry how you can ever achieve social distancing in an aircraft,"" he said. ""The reason the government has not been definitive is you cannot square this circle. ""You can't keep people two metres apart in an aeroplane. ""You are in a closed environment where there is a mixing of air."" He said even keeping the middle seat empty did not meet ""two-metre"" social distancing rule, which he said may be futile on an aircraft in which air is mixed. Mr Ambrose said Monday morning and Thursday evening flights out of Belfast City would now become busier with the reopening of the construction industry. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the body representing global airlines, said it was opposed to measures such as leaving the middle seat empty, saying this would not be financially viable for carriers. ""Nobody has demonstrated that having the middle seat empty reduces the chance of transmitting Covid-19 from one person to another,"" said IATA's medical advisor, David Powell. However, it is in favour of passengers wearing facemasks. Virologist at Queen's University, Conor Bamford, said that on a plane or in an airport ""close connections with people would make it very straightforward for the virus to spread"". ""The virus would be spread more from talking or breathing rather than recirculation of air in a plane,"" he told The Nolan Show. ""We might be lucky as there is not that much virus out there In the community but it is certainly not a risk you would want to be taking at this stage,"" he added. This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? In a statement on Monday, Aer Lingus said: ""In light of the unexpectedly high loads on the Belfast â London Heathrow service this morning and the level of demand for the route, Aer Lingus is reviewing its processes and procedures applicable to the operation of this service. ""The safety and security of Aer Lingusâ customers and crew is our top priority and any process changes that are identified as being required will be implemented as a matter of urgency."" North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley, who also flies to London for work in London, said it would be the ""height of lunacy"" to cut flights between Northern Ireland and Great Britain to help combat the spread of the virus. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) NI said the health and safety on board any flight does not fall within its remit. ""HSENI are looking at the other issues raised in relation to following the public health guidelines in the airport before boarding the flight,"" a spokesman told the BBC.

White House plans to disband virus task force,"This video can not be played Trump: 'Mike Pence and the taskforce have done a great job' US President Donald Trump has confirmed the White House coronavirus task force will be winding down, with Vice-President Mike Pence suggesting it could be disbanded within weeks. ""We are bringing our country back,"" Mr Trump said during a visit to a mask-manufacturing factory in Arizona.Â New confirmed infections per day in the US currently top 20,000, and daily deaths exceed 1,000. US health officials warn the virus may spread as businesses begin to reopen. The US currently has 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 70,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which is tracking the pandemic. During a visit to the plant in Phoenix after weeks holed up at the White House, Mr Trump told journalists: ""Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we'll have a different group probably set up for that."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: How long does it take to recover? The president - who wore safety goggles but no face mask during his tour of the facility - was asked if it was ""mission accomplished"", and he said: ""No, not at all. The mission accomplished is when it's over."" Critics have accused the president of sacrificing Americans' public health in his eagerness to reopen the US economy ahead of his re-election battle in November. In Arizona on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that Democrats were hoping his coronavirus policy would fail ""so they can win the election"". Acknowledging a human cost to the plans, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I'm not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon."" Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak Why is there a US backlash to masks? 'I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' However, it will be up to individual states to determine how they reopen. Some Democratic governors in badly hit states have been cautious, calling for more testing and other safeguards before easing lockdowns. Other states, many led by Republicans in the south and mid-west, have already begun lifting restrictions. The task force was set up on 29 January. Mr Pence became its chairman four weeks later and its members include more than 20 experts and leading administration officials. The White House said the task force's duty was to ""lead the administration's efforts to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus"" and provide the public with information. Mr Trump's once-daily task force briefings became increasingly scarce after he was widely condemned by the medical community for pondering at the podium last month whetherinjecting bleach into people might kill the virus. Dr Deborah Birx has been the task force's response co-ordinator. The president was asked on Tuesday whether she and another high-profile member, Dr Anthony Fauci, would still be involved in efforts to address the coronavirus. ""They will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field,"" the president said. Mr Pence earlier on Tuesday told reporters in a briefing that the task force could soon be disbanded. He said the Trump administration was ""starting to look at the Memorial Day [late May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage, begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner"". He said it was ""a reflection of the tremendous progress we've made as a country"". US allies tread lightly around Trump virus lab claims Coronavirus: Your pictures of lockdown at home Mr Pence has led the task force, which reports to the president and co-ordinates with medical institutes, political staff and state governors. The group also consulted medical experts to formulate national guidelines on social distancing. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later tweeted that the president ""will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: When might Hollywood reopen for business? The White House's shift in focus from the public health aspect of the coronavirus pandemic to its economic impact continues. For more than a month, the task force had been the public face of the administration's response to the crisis, even though President Trump sometimes veered far from the topic at hand during its press briefings. When the president wasn't talking, however, government public health officials led the conversation. Now, it appears, the officials setting the agenda will be ones more concerned with jobs, businesses and the fiscal health of the nation - even though the number of cases of the virus throughout the US continues to increase. There is growing frustration among the president's core supporters, however, with government shelter-in-place orders. Several states, encouraged by the president, have already begun to ease restrictions, even though they have not met White House guidelines for when to do so. Those recommendations were set by the current coronavirus task force, of course. And the ""different group"" in a ""different form"" that replaces it, as the president describes, may have other ideas. On, off, on again... are Trump daily briefings over? Not yet. Besides New York, which is still the US epicentre despite an ongoing drop in new cases, the level of infection continues to climb across much of the country. Many states that have allowed some business to resume - including Texas, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana -Â are seeing more new cases reported daily. While some cities such as New York, New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement, others like Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago are seeing the caseload rise every day. According to a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), more than 3,000 people may be killed by the virus each day by next month. The White House has dismissed the report as inaccurate, with Mr Trump saying it describes a scenario in which Americans make no effort to mitigate the spread of the infection. On Sunday, the president increased his forecast for the number of US pandemic deaths to 100,000, after saying two weeks earlier that it would be fewer than 60,000. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, a public forecast model that has been frequently cited by the White House, now estimates that Covid-19 will account for 135,000 American deaths by 4 August. This more than doubles its 17 April forecast. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Disney suffers $1.4bn hit due to coronavirusLockdowns have forced the company to close its theme parks and has hurt advertising.,"Disney's Florida theme park has been shut since mid-March Walt Disney Co suffered a $1.4bn (Â£1.1bn) hit to profits in the first three months of the year, as it closed its parks, cancelled movie releases and reduced advertising sales. Every part of its business was affected by coronavirus, nearly wiping out profits for the quarter. Disney chairman Bob Iger said the firm was facing ""unprecedented"" challenges but he was confident of recovery. The firm is already planning to open its Shanghai park on 11 May. Chief executive Bob Chapek said the company would take a ""phased approach"", requiring advance reservations to limit attendance. It said it would require health measures, such as masks and temperature checks. ""We are seeing encouraging signs of gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China,"" he said. ""While it's too early to predict when we'll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks."" The parks and cruise division has been a reliable profit driver for Disney in recent years, as the firm's giant media business tries to adapt to online competition and declines in paid-TV subscriptions and movie theatre attendance. But the parks business was hammered by the closings, accounting for $1bn of the $1.4bn hit to operating income, as the firm shut its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong in January, in Tokyo in February and in the US and France in March. Its cruise lines have also suspended operations. Mr Chapek said he thought there was enough pent-up demand that people would come once the firm does re-open in a limited way. But outside of Shanghai, executives warned that the timing of re-opening remains unclear. The firm's advertising business - which supports its television output - is also seeing significant declines, as companies slash marketing budgets and a lack of live sports reduces viewers on Disney's ESPN sports channel. Disney last year launched a new streaming service, Disney+, which had attracted 54.5 million subscribers as of 4 May - up from about 50 million on 8 April. But it remains loss-making. The direct-to-consumer and international unit, which includes Disney+, posted a loss of $812m in the quarter. ""It's difficult to think of a company which better illustrates the ups and downs of the coronavirus outbreak and its effect on companies,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""While we think the business ... has one of the best asset bases of any listed company ... the damage the current crisis will do remains unclear."" Disney said it was taking numerous steps to shore up its finances, including reducing capital investment plans by $900m and suspending a planned dividend payment. Last month, it stopped paying nearly half of its workforce, furloughing more than 100,000 employees, many of them park and hotel workers. Quarterly revenues were up 21% year-on-year at $18bn - beating analyst expectations. But profits fell to $460m from $5.4bn in the prior year, a 91% drop. ""I have no doubt that we will get through this but it will take some time,"" Disney chairman Bob Iger said.

closed due to Covid-19. Network Rail said one case,
near Neilston, Renfrewshire, involved two adults and a child. Another featured a group of

"Virgin Atlantic to cut 3,000 jobs and quit Gatwick","Virgin Atlantic has seen passenger numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans Virgin Atlantic has announced it is to cut more than 3,000 jobs in the UK and end its operation at Gatwick airport. The shock announcement comes after rival British Airways said it could not rule out closing its Gatwick operation. Pilots' union Balpa described it as ""devastating"". Many airlines have been struggling as the coronavirus pandemic has brought global travel to a virtual standstill. The airline currently employs a total of about 10,000 people. Virgin Atlantic, which is in the process of applying for emergency loans from the government, said that jobs will be lost across the board. ""We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many,"" said Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss. Balpa the union said: ""This is another terrible blow for the industry and is evidence of the dire situation facing UK aviation. Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Our members and all staff in Virgin Atlantic will be shocked by the scale of this bombshell. We will be challenging Virgin very hard to justify this."" Virgin Atlantic also said it will move its flying programme from Gatwick to Heathrow. It said it intended to keep its slots at Gatwick ""so it can return in line with customer demand"". However, Mr Weiss said there was no certainty when the air travel industry would recover from the coronavirus crisis. ""After 9/11 and the global financial crisis, we took similar painful measures but fortunately many members of our team were back flying with us within a couple of years. ""Depending on how long the pandemic lasts and the period of time our planes are grounded for, hopefully the same will happen this time."" Gatwick said the company was ""very saddened"" to hear of Virgin Atlantic's plans. The airline has flown from the airport since 1984, and Gatwick said: ""Virgin Atlantic will always be welcome at Gatwick and we will continue our efforts to explore ways to restart the airline's operations as soon as possible, in the knowledge that they intend to retain their slot portfolio at Gatwick for when demand returns."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of aviation industry group Airlines UK, said: ""The challenges facing UK aviation cannot be overstated. There is currently close to zero passenger demand and many airlines have ceased operations altogether. ""We do not know when countries will start to reopen their borders, or whether restrictions will remain in place for some time. ""Airlines are having to adapt to a sector that will be smaller and leaner in future, with no guarantees as to when we will return to pre-crisis levels."" It was 28% at British Airways. Now 30% of jobs will be lost at Virgin Atlantic. The UK's aviation sector is shrinking in size. No airline or airport is immune. Virgin Atlantic was Gatwick's ninth-largest airline, so it's a blow, but not a knock-out punch. However, British Airways, which is Gatwick's second-biggest customer, has indicated that it also might not restart its Gatwick operation. If BA does pull out, it would carry deeper ramifications. Just a few weeks ago, several UK airports had elaborate, expensive and very controversial expansion plans in the pipeline. The big ones were operating at or very near capacity. But the whole aviation sector is living a new reality. When lockdown restrictions ease and flight schedules are increased again, there will be fewer passengers, fewer and probably more expensive flights and sadly thousands of cabin crew, pilots and ground staff will have lost their jobs. And the consensus is that it will take years for the aviation sector to bounce back to where it was before the pandemic. Commenting on its own future, Gatwick said: ""We remain very optimistic about the long-term prospects of Gatwick Airport and our resilience as a business, and having remained open throughout this pandemic we are in a strong position to extend our current operations quickly to meet demand."" Other airlines have already announced that they intend to cut jobs because of the collapse in demand for travel due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, British Airways said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. It also told staff thatits Gatwick airport operation might not reopenafter the pandemic passes. Ryanair has also said it will cut 3,000 jobs- 15% of its workforce - with boss Michael O'Leary saying the move was ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"". Virgin Atlantic said it had begun a 45-day consultation period on the job losses with unions Balpa and Unite. Virgin Atlantic also plans to reduce the size of its fleet of aircraft from 45 to 35 by the summer of 2022. It hopes to restore about 60% of its pre-pandemic flying capacity by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, the airline industry has said it must be ready with a series of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus before air travel can resume. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it recommended mandatory face-coverings for passengers and masks for crew, as one of several actions to reduce what it called ""the already low risk of contracting Covid-19 on board aircraft"".

'Missing link' may not be found,"A number of early cases in the pandemic were linked to the Wuhan Seafood Market It was a matter of ""when not if"" an animal passed the coronavirus from wild bats to humans, scientists say. But it remains unclear whether that animal was sold in the now infamous Wuhan wildlife market in China. The World Health Organization says that all evidence points to the virus's natural origin, but some scientists now say it might never be known how the first person was infected. Trade in wild animals is under scrutiny as source of this ""spillover"". But when wildlife is bought and sold in almost every country in the world, controlling it - let alone banning it - is far from straightforward. Tackling it on a global scale could be the route to stopping a future pandemic before it starts. Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea? The race to find the source of coronavirus in wildlife Coronavirus: 'Pets no risk to owners' vets stress The virus originated in bats and was probably passed to humans via an 'intermediate host' Global health researchers have, for many years, understood how the trade in wild animals provides a source of species-to-species disease transmission. As life-changing as this particular outbreak has been for so much of the global population, it is actually one of many that the trade has been linked to. As the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, told the BBC: ""We were preparing for something like this as it's not a matter of if, it is a matter of when."" Infectious disease experts agree that, like most emerging human disease, this virus initially jumped undetected across the species barrier. Prof Andrew Cunningham, from the Zoological Society of London, explained: ""We've actually been expecting something like this to happen for a while. ""These diseases are emerging more frequently in recent years as a result of human encroachment into wild habitat and increased contact and use of wild animals by people."" Officials seize civet cats in Xinyuan wildlife market in Guangzhou to prevent the spread of Sars The virus that causes Covid-19 joins a murky list of household name viruses - including Ebola, rabies, Sars and Mers - that have originated in wild bat populations. Some of the now extensive body of evidence about bat viruses, and their ability to infect humans, comes from seeking the source of the 2003 outbreak of Sars, a very closely related coronavirus.It was only in 2017 though that scientists pinned down the ""rich gene pool of bat Sars-related coronaviruses"" in a single cave in China.,external- the possible source of the pandemic. These viruses have resided in the bodies of bats for millennia, but are pre-programmed with the ability to infect a humans; the key that unlocks some of our cells, where they can replicate. ""In the case of Sars-CoV-2 the key is a virus protein called Spike and the main lock to enter a cell is a receptor called ACE2,"" explained Prof David Robertson, a virologist from the University of Glasgow. ""The coronavirus is not only able to fit that ACE2 lock, ""it's actually doing this many times better than Sars-1 [the virus that caused the 2003 outbreak] does"", he said. Coronaviruses under the microscope That perfect fit could explain why the coronavirus is so easily transmitted from person to person; its contagiousness has outpaced our efforts to contain it. But bringing the bat virus to the door of a human cell is where the trade in wildlife plays an important role. Most of us have heard that this virus ""started"" in a wildlife market in Wuhan. But the source of the virus - an animal with this pathogen in its body - was not found in the market. ""The initial cluster of infections was associated with the market - that is circumstantial evidence,"" explained Prof James Wood from the University of Cambridge. ""The infection could have come from somewhere else and just, by chance, clustered around people there. But given that it is an animal virus, the market association is highly suggestive."" Prof Cunningham agreed; wildlife markets, he explained, are hotspots for animal diseases to find new hosts. ""Mixing large numbers of species under poor hygienic and welfare conditions, and species that wouldn't normally come close together gives opportunities for pathogens to jump species to species,"" he explained. Animals rescued from the exotic pet trade often have to be protected from human disease Many wildlife viruses in the past have come into humans via a second species - one that is farmed, or hunted and sold on a market. Prof Woods explained: ""The original Sars virus was transmitted into the human population via an epidemic in Palm civets, which were being traded around southern China to be eaten. ""That was very important to know because there was an epidemic in the Palm civets themselves, which had to be controlled to stop an ongoing spillover into humans."" In the search for the missing link in this particular transmission chain, scientists found clues pointing to mink, ferrets and even turtles as a host.Similar viruses were found in the bodies of rare and widely trafficked pangolins, but none of these suspect species has been shown to be involved in this outbreak. What we do know is that our contact with, and trading of, wild animals puts us in the path of new diseases that are silently seeking a host. Camels can harbour the novel coronavirus, Mers ""Trying to make sure that we are not bringing wildlife into direct contact with ourselves or with other domestic animals is a very important part of this equation,"" said Prof Wood. ""And there have been various campaigns to ban all trade in animals and all contact with wildlife,"" he added, ""but what you do then is penalise some of the poorest people in the world. In many cases, by introducing measures like that you drive trade underground, which makes it far harder to do anything about."" The WHO has already called for stricter hygiene and safety standards for so-called wet markets in China. But in many cases - such as the trade in bush meat in Sub-Saharan Africa, which was linked with the Ebola outbreak - markets are informal and therefore very difficult to regulate. ""You can't do it from an office in London or in Geneva; you have to do that locally on the ground in every country,"" added Prof Wood. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove agreed: ""It's very important we work with population and people who are working at the animal/human interface - people who work with wildlife."" What that will be is a truly global and highly complicated effort. But the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have shown us the cost of the alternative.

"Virgin Atlantic to cut 3,000 jobs and quit GatwickThe airline will axe a third of its workforce in response to the ""severe impact"" of coronavirus.","Virgin Atlantic has seen passenger numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans Virgin Atlantic has announced it is to cut more than 3,000 jobs in the UK and end its operation at Gatwick airport. The shock announcement comes after rival British Airways said it could not rule out closing its Gatwick operation. Pilots' union Balpa described it as ""devastating"". Many airlines have been struggling as the coronavirus pandemic has brought global travel to a virtual standstill. The airline currently employs a total of about 10,000 people. Virgin Atlantic, which is in the process of applying for emergency loans from the government, said that jobs will be lost across the board. ""We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many,"" said Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss. Balpa the union said: ""This is another terrible blow for the industry and is evidence of the dire situation facing UK aviation. Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Our members and all staff in Virgin Atlantic will be shocked by the scale of this bombshell. We will be challenging Virgin very hard to justify this."" Virgin Atlantic also said it will move its flying programme from Gatwick to Heathrow. It said it intended to keep its slots at Gatwick ""so it can return in line with customer demand"". However, Mr Weiss said there was no certainty when the air travel industry would recover from the coronavirus crisis. ""After 9/11 and the global financial crisis, we took similar painful measures but fortunately many members of our team were back flying with us within a couple of years. ""Depending on how long the pandemic lasts and the period of time our planes are grounded for, hopefully the same will happen this time."" Gatwick said the company was ""very saddened"" to hear of Virgin Atlantic's plans. The airline has flown from the airport since 1984, and Gatwick said: ""Virgin Atlantic will always be welcome at Gatwick and we will continue our efforts to explore ways to restart the airline's operations as soon as possible, in the knowledge that they intend to retain their slot portfolio at Gatwick for when demand returns."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of aviation industry group Airlines UK, said: ""The challenges facing UK aviation cannot be overstated. There is currently close to zero passenger demand and many airlines have ceased operations altogether. ""We do not know when countries will start to reopen their borders, or whether restrictions will remain in place for some time. ""Airlines are having to adapt to a sector that will be smaller and leaner in future, with no guarantees as to when we will return to pre-crisis levels."" It was 28% at British Airways. Now 30% of jobs will be lost at Virgin Atlantic. The UK's aviation sector is shrinking in size. No airline or airport is immune. Virgin Atlantic was Gatwick's ninth-largest airline, so it's a blow, but not a knock-out punch. However, British Airways, which is Gatwick's second-biggest customer, has indicated that it also might not restart its Gatwick operation. If BA does pull out, it would carry deeper ramifications. Just a few weeks ago, several UK airports had elaborate, expensive and very controversial expansion plans in the pipeline. The big ones were operating at or very near capacity. But the whole aviation sector is living a new reality. When lockdown restrictions ease and flight schedules are increased again, there will be fewer passengers, fewer and probably more expensive flights and sadly thousands of cabin crew, pilots and ground staff will have lost their jobs. And the consensus is that it will take years for the aviation sector to bounce back to where it was before the pandemic. Commenting on its own future, Gatwick said: ""We remain very optimistic about the long-term prospects of Gatwick Airport and our resilience as a business, and having remained open throughout this pandemic we are in a strong position to extend our current operations quickly to meet demand."" Other airlines have already announced that they intend to cut jobs because of the collapse in demand for travel due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, British Airways said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. It also told staff thatits Gatwick airport operation might not reopenafter the pandemic passes. Ryanair has also said it will cut 3,000 jobs- 15% of its workforce - with boss Michael O'Leary saying the move was ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"". Virgin Atlantic said it had begun a 45-day consultation period on the job losses with unions Balpa and Unite. Virgin Atlantic also plans to reduce the size of its fleet of aircraft from 45 to 35 by the summer of 2022. It hopes to restore about 60% of its pre-pandemic flying capacity by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, the airline industry has said it must be ready with a series of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus before air travel can resume. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it recommended mandatory face-coverings for passengers and masks for crew, as one of several actions to reduce what it called ""the already low risk of contracting Covid-19 on board aircraft"".

M&S launches 30-minute home delivery service,"Marks & Spencer has extended its home delivery service. Customers can order from a range of about 130 M&S food and household items through Deliveroo. M&S has kept its Simply Food stores and food halls open during the coronavirus pandemic, but the delivery service will make its products available more widely to those confined to their homes. Deliveroo has added 20 M&S stores in city and town locations - and is providing a more extensive range. The service, which costs Â£4.99, is available from 142 M&S outlets across the country. Rival Sainsbury's recently introduced a one-hour delivery service called Chop Chop, which allows customers to order a top-up shop of up to 20 items. It too charges a Â£4.99 delivery fee. Sainsbury's boss warns queues set to stay in place The weekly shop is back in fashion, says Tesco boss M&S is one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service. This has hampered the chain as it struggles with the decline of bricks-and-mortar High Street stores and the move to online shopping. It is planning to launch a new delivery service with Ocado in four months' time. The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated this trend.  Online sales now account for 10.2% of the grocery market, up from 7.4% before the pandemic, according to latest data from Kantar. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said M&S's arrangement with Deliveroo was a ""pragmatic move"" that felt more tactical than strategic. ""It sells niche products which have often been used as a top-up to the main food shop for treats,"" he told the BBC. ""In this constrained period, if people are going to have to queue to get into the shop, they may well jettison their top-up."" Mr Hyman said bigger M&S stores were likely to be ""right at the heart of the country's population centres, where everything else is shut, and that will have impacted footfall"". Dave Gill, national officer for the shopworkers' union, Usdaw, said the company needed to be mindful of its workforce: ""We understand that retailers are having to introduce new working practices and services to help keep our communities fed during the Coronavirus emergency. ""These innovations are welcome, as we all try adapt to the 'new normal', but they must be done safely and that is best achieved when working with a trade union."" He pointed out that Marks and Spencer have a tradition of not engaging with unions. M&S announced last year thatit would go into partnership with Ocadofrom September this year, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose. Under the deal, M&S is buying a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for Â£750m. Ocado will also continue to supply its own-label products and big-name branded goods.

US to borrow record $3tn in pandemic spending,"The US has said it wants to borrow a record $3tn (Â£2.4tn) in the second quarter, as coronavirus-related rescue packages blow up the budget. The sum is more than five times the previous quarterly record, set at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. In all of 2019, the country borrowed $1.28tn. The US has approved about $3tn in virus-related relief, including health funding and direct payouts. Total US government debt is now near $25tn. This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' The latest spending packages are estimated to be worth about 14% of the country's economy. The government has also extended the annual 15 April deadline for tax payments, adding to the cash crunch. The new borrowing estimate is more than $3tn above the government's previous estimate, a sign of the impact of the new programmes. The Fed's four radical moves to save the economy Does the US debt of $20tn matter? Discussions are under way over further assistance, though some Republicans have expressed concerns about the impact of more spending on the country's skyrocketing national debt. The US borrows by selling government bonds. It has historically enjoyed relatively low interest rates since its debt is viewed as relatively low-risk by investors around the world. But even before the coronavirus, the country's debt load had been climbing toward levels many economists consider risky for long-term growth, as the country spent more than it took in. This video can not be played Coronavirus: When might Hollywood reopen for business? The US Congressional Budget Office last month predicted the budget deficit would hit $3.7tn this year, while the national debt soared above 100% of GDP. Last week, the chair of America's central bank, Jerome Powell, said he would have liked to see the US government's books be in better shape before the pandemic. Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown The people spending lockdown up a 30ft tree However, he said spending now was essential to cushion the economic blow, as orders to shut businesses to slow the spread of the virus cost at least 30 million people their jobs.

This video can not be played Armel Omatoko has moved his dance classes online so people can stay involved during lockdown. As part of its own relief efforts, the Federal Reserve has bought more than $1tn in treasuries in recent weeks. Investors from foreign countries are also historically significant holders of US debt, with Japan, China and the UK at the top of the pack as of February. Increased tensions between the US and China in recent years have renewed scrutiny of America's debt position. According to the Washington Post last week, Trump administration officials had discussed cancelling debt obligations to China, but US President Donald Trump reportedly played down the idea, saying ""you start playing those games and it's tough"". For now, continued low rates suggest investor appetite for US debt remains, allowing for a borrowing increase, Alan Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, told the BBC last month. ""So far, the answer has been everything is fine, as to how much borrowing the United States government can do before investors start to feel satiated with US debt,"" he said.

'No clear guidance' on aircraft social distancing,"This video can not be played ""There was no social distancing... no sanitiser,"" says passenger Sean Mallon Aer Lingus is boosting capacity on its Belfast-Heathrow route after images emerged showing a packed aircraft. Passenger Sean Mallon took the photos on the London-bound flight,which showed travellers sitting side-by-side. Health Minister Robin Swann has said he was shocked at the image and called for Aer Lingus to review its processes. The carrier said on Tuesday it was adding an extra flight on each day of operation to reduce passenger numbers on each aircraft. Aer Lingus also advised passengers to give themselves extra time at the airport as the check-in process would take longer to allow for the increased number of bags being put in the aircraft's hold. ""The safety and security of Aer Lingus' customers and crew is our number-one priority, and these process changes are being implemented as a matter of urgency."" Speaking shortly before the Aer Lingus statement was issued, Mr Swann said: ""I was shocked at the images of Aer Lingus. ""It is as if they were living in a time before Covid-19."" It was as if the airline was ""completely oblivious to any of the regulations, social distancing, or guidance that has been enunciated and published by our executive here and the government in Westminster"", said the health minister. Speaking at the daily Stormont press briefing on Tuesday, Mr Swann called on the carrier to revise its approach. Earlier, Belfast City Airport Chief Executive Brian Ambrose said there was no clear guidance on social distancing measures on an aircraft. Health Minister Robin Swann said he was shocked to see an image of people sitting side-by-side on an Aer Lingus flight The coronavirus crisis has seen NI flights suspended, apart fromtwo London services operating from Belfast City and City of Derry airports. Speaking on the BBC NI's Nolan Show on Tuesday, Mr Ambrose said social distancing measures were in place in the airport, but the issue arose after ""the first big influx of passengers"" on a flight since the pandemic. Mr Ambrose said it was not yet clear whether the issue was inadequate measures or if people were not adhering to the measures. Â£5.7m package to support remaining NI flights Aer Lingus review after packed flight complaint ""For the month of April the average loads on our flights were about 20% to 30%, so it hadn't become an issue with large volumes of people on a single flight,"" he said. ""Then on Monday there were 154 passengers on a 174-seater aircraft,"" he added. He said he had immediately been made aware of a number of ""pinch points"" by his operations director. ""We are putting more staff on the ground and making sure there is more compliance and customers adhere to it,"" he said Mr Ambrose said there was no clear guidance on social distancing measures on an aircraft. Thursday evening flights out of Belfast City are expected to become busier with the reopening of the construction industry ""It is not clear to anyone within the industry how you can ever achieve social distancing in an aircraft,"" he said. ""The reason the government has not been definitive is you cannot square this circle. ""You can't keep people two metres apart in an aeroplane. ""You are in a closed environment where there is a mixing of air."" He said even keeping the middle seat empty did not meet ""two-metre"" social distancing rule, which he said may be futile on an aircraft in which air is mixed. Mr Ambrose said Monday morning and Thursday evening flights out of Belfast City would now become busier with the reopening of the construction industry. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the body representing global airlines, said it was opposed to measures such as leaving the middle seat empty, saying this would not be financially viable for carriers. ""Nobody has demonstrated that having the middle seat empty reduces the chance of transmitting Covid-19 from one person to another,"" said IATA's medical advisor, David Powell. However, it is in favour of passengers wearing facemasks. Virologist at Queen's University, Conor Bamford, said that on a plane or in an airport ""close connections with people would make it very straightforward for the virus to spread"". ""The virus would be spread more from talking or breathing rather than recirculation of air in a plane,"" he told The Nolan Show. ""We might be lucky as there is not that much virus out there In the community but it is certainly not a risk you would want to be taking at this stage,"" he added. This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? In a statement on Monday, Aer Lingus said: ""In light of the unexpectedly high loads on the Belfast â London Heathrow service this morning and the level of demand for the route, Aer Lingus is reviewing its processes and procedures applicable to the operation of this service. ""The safety and security of Aer Lingusâ customers and crew is our top priority and any process changes that are identified as being required will be implemented as a matter of urgency."" North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley, who also flies to London for work in London, said it would be the ""height of lunacy"" to cut flights between Northern Ireland and Great Britain to help combat the spread of the virus. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) NI said the health and safety on board any flight does not fall within its remit. ""HSENI are looking at the other issues raised in relation to following the public health guidelines in the airport before boarding the flight,"" a spokesman told the BBC.

US allies tread lightly around Trump virus lab claims,"A laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the centre of the allegations While the Trump administration has publicly pushed the line that the coronavirus outbreak originated in a laboratory accident in China, some of its close allies are more cautious. UK officials believe it is not possible to be absolutely sure about the origins but point to scientific opinion suggesting the most likely scenario is that it was from a live animal market. However, they add that it is impossible to rule out the theory of an accidental release from a lab without a full investigation. Their view echoes comments on Tuesday by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who said: ""We can't rule out any of these arrangements... but the most likely has been in a wildlife wet market."" In the US, the intelligence community has also been more cautious in its public position than its political leaders and, last week, it issued a carefully worded statement. Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea? Chinese media take aim at US 'virus lab' theory Can we trust China's claims of virus success? It said that it concurred with the ""wide scientific consensus"" that Covid-19 was not man-made or genetically modified. It then added it would ""continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan"". However, both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have since pointed strongly towards the lab accident theory without providing any specific evidence. Mr Pompeo said the evidence was ""enormous"". It is possible that there could be lines of intelligence which could be used to support that theory, but they may not be confirmed or reflect the overall balance of evidence. US intelligence, like other countries, has devoted extensive resources to try and understand what has been happening within China, and some of the information could be highly sensitive. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told National Geographic on Monday that he did not entertain the lab theory. The World Health Organization (WHO) also says it has not received any evidence from the US to back up the lab theory. Intelligence may well point to China having tried to play down or hide details of the initial outbreak, although this is different from hiding the exact origin of the virus. However, it may well add to the confusion and suspicion.China so far does not appear willing to allow an international, transparent investigationdespite growing calls for one. UK politicians and officials have been wary of speaking openly about their view of the virus origins, largely because of the risk of highlighting differences with Washington or getting into a diplomatic row with China - the latter is something the Trump administration is less concerned about, and may well positively welcome as an issue in an election year. On Monday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he would not comment on intelligence information but added that China did have to answer questions about how quickly it had reported the outbreak, and needed to be ""open and transparent"" about what it learned. UK officials also say they are unaware of a ""Five Eyes"" report that was referenced over the weekend in Australian media - Five Eyes is the intelligence alliance consisting of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The media report talked of a 15-page document detailing China's covering up of the early stages of the outbreak. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Teachers warn of early school return 'virus spike',"Teaching unions across the UK and Ireland are warning national leaders not to reopen schools too early. The British Irish Group of Teacher Unions has written to the education ministers of all five nations in which the million staff it represents work. Its letter warns the ministers of the ""very real risk of creating a spike in the transmission of the virus by a premature opening of schools"". Test and trace measures must be fully operational before reopening, it says. And there must be: ""significant operational changes... in place to ensure effective social distancing"" in schools strong hygiene routines linked to thorough cleaning practices appropriate protective personal equipment, where required The letter was signed by leaders of 10 teaching unions, including the National Education Union (NEU), the National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers, which between represents the bulk of teachers in England and Wales, and Scottish and Irish teaching unions. Scotland and Wales have already sketched out plans for a phased return of schools, with England's Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, saying he will take a phased approach too and head teachers will be given plenty of notice. 1 June earliest 'realistic' date for re-opening schools, say heads Schools will reopen in phases, says Williamson Return to school in children's interests - Ofsted Asked by the newly appointed shadow secretary of state for education, Rebecca Long Bailey, in the Commons, on Tuesday morning, when there would be clarity over schools reopening, Mr Williamson said:  ""In terms of the return of schools, obviously she, I'm sure, shares a desire with me to see children being given the opportunity of returning to school when it is the right time to do so - and this will be based on the scientific and medical advice that we receive. ""I can assure her that we will take a phased approach in terms of opening schools and we will always aim to give schools, parents and, of course critically important, children the maximum amount of notice in terms of when this is going to happen."" Mr Williamson also acknowledged there was ""no substitute for a child being in a classroom, learning directly from a teacher"". It is expected children in the last year of primary school and then those in the pre-GCSE year will be prioritised. Reports have suggested 1 June would be the earliest reopening date in England. Schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were closed in the last week of March, with Irish schools shutting a little earlier. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Virgin to cut 3,150 jobs and keep Gatwick closedThe airline is 'reshaping' and 'resizing' in response to the 'severe impact' of coronavirus.Business","Virgin Atlantic has seen passenger numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans Virgin Atlantic has announced it is to cut more than 3,000 jobs in the UK and end its operation at Gatwick airport. The shock announcement comes after rival British Airways said it could not rule out closing its Gatwick operation. Pilots' union Balpa described it as ""devastating"". Many airlines have been struggling as the coronavirus pandemic has brought global travel to a virtual standstill. The airline currently employs a total of about 10,000 people. Virgin Atlantic, which is in the process of applying for emergency loans from the government, said that jobs will be lost across the board. ""We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many,"" said Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss. Balpa the union said: ""This is another terrible blow for the industry and is evidence of the dire situation facing UK aviation. Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""Our members and all staff in Virgin Atlantic will be shocked by the scale of this bombshell. We will be challenging Virgin very hard to justify this."" Virgin Atlantic also said it will move its flying programme from Gatwick to Heathrow. It said it intended to keep its slots at Gatwick ""so it can return in line with customer demand"". However, Mr Weiss said there was no certainty when the air travel industry would recover from the coronavirus crisis. ""After 9/11 and the global financial crisis, we took similar painful measures but fortunately many members of our team were back flying with us within a couple of years. ""Depending on how long the pandemic lasts and the period of time our planes are grounded for, hopefully the same will happen this time."" Gatwick said the company was ""very saddened"" to hear of Virgin Atlantic's plans. The airline has flown from the airport since 1984, and Gatwick said: ""Virgin Atlantic will always be welcome at Gatwick and we will continue our efforts to explore ways to restart the airline's operations as soon as possible, in the knowledge that they intend to retain their slot portfolio at Gatwick for when demand returns."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of aviation industry group Airlines UK, said: ""The challenges facing UK aviation cannot be overstated. There is currently close to zero passenger demand and many airlines have ceased operations altogether. ""We do not know when countries will start to reopen their borders, or whether restrictions will remain in place for some time. ""Airlines are having to adapt to a sector that will be smaller and leaner in future, with no guarantees as to when we will return to pre-crisis levels."" It was 28% at British Airways. Now 30% of jobs will be lost at Virgin Atlantic. The UK's aviation sector is shrinking in size. No airline or airport is immune. Virgin Atlantic was Gatwick's ninth-largest airline, so it's a blow, but not a knock-out punch. However, British Airways, which is Gatwick's second-biggest customer, has indicated that it also might not restart its Gatwick operation. If BA does pull out, it would carry deeper ramifications. Just a few weeks ago, several UK airports had elaborate, expensive and very controversial expansion plans in the pipeline. The big ones were operating at or very near capacity. But the whole aviation sector is living a new reality. When lockdown restrictions ease and flight schedules are increased again, there will be fewer passengers, fewer and probably more expensive flights and sadly thousands of cabin crew, pilots and ground staff will have lost their jobs. And the consensus is that it will take years for the aviation sector to bounce back to where it was before the pandemic. Commenting on its own future, Gatwick said: ""We remain very optimistic about the long-term prospects of Gatwick Airport and our resilience as a business, and having remained open throughout this pandemic we are in a strong position to extend our current operations quickly to meet demand."" Other airlines have already announced that they intend to cut jobs because of the collapse in demand for travel due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, British Airways said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. It also told staff thatits Gatwick airport operation might not reopenafter the pandemic passes. Ryanair has also said it will cut 3,000 jobs- 15% of its workforce - with boss Michael O'Leary saying the move was ""the minimum that we need just to survive the next 12 months"". Virgin Atlantic said it had begun a 45-day consultation period on the job losses with unions Balpa and Unite. Virgin Atlantic also plans to reduce the size of its fleet of aircraft from 45 to 35 by the summer of 2022. It hopes to restore about 60% of its pre-pandemic flying capacity by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, the airline industry has said it must be ready with a series of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus before air travel can resume. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it recommended mandatory face-coverings for passengers and masks for crew, as one of several actions to reduce what it called ""the already low risk of contracting Covid-19 on board aircraft"".

"US to borrow record $3tn in pandemic spendingThe sum is more than five times the previous quarterly record, in the 2008 financial crisis.BusinessComments","The US has said it wants to borrow a record $3tn (Â£2.4tn) in the second quarter, as coronavirus-related rescue packages blow up the budget. The sum is more than five times the previous quarterly record, set at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. In all of 2019, the country borrowed $1.28tn. The US has approved about $3tn in virus-related relief, including health funding and direct payouts. Total US government debt is now near $25tn. This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' The latest spending packages are estimated to be worth about 14% of the country's economy. The government has also extended the annual 15 April deadline for tax payments, adding to the cash crunch. The new borrowing estimate is more than $3tn above the government's previous estimate, a sign of the impact of the new programmes. The Fed's four radical moves to save the economy Does the US debt of $20tn matter? Discussions are under way over further assistance, though some Republicans have expressed concerns about the impact of more spending on the country's skyrocketing national debt. The US borrows by selling government bonds. It has historically enjoyed relatively low interest rates since its debt is viewed as relatively low-risk by investors around the world. But even before the coronavirus, the country's debt load had been climbing toward levels many economists consider risky for long-term growth, as the country spent more than it took in. This video can not be played Coronavirus: When might Hollywood reopen for business? The US Congressional Budget Office last month predicted the budget deficit would hit $3.7tn this year, while the national debt soared above 100% of GDP.

This video can not be played Armel Omatoko has moved his dance classes online so people can stay involved during lockdown. As part of its own relief efforts, the Federal Reserve has bought more than $1tn in treasuries in recent weeks. Investors from foreign countries are also historically significant holders of US debt, with Japan, China and the UK at the top of the pack as of February. Increased tensions between the US and China in recent years have renewed scrutiny of America's debt position. According to the Washington Post last week, Trump administration officials had discussed cancelling debt obligations to China, but US President Donald Trump reportedly played down the idea, saying ""you start playing those games and it's tough"". For now, continued low rates suggest investor appetite for US debt remains, allowing for a borrowing increase, Alan Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, told the BBC last month. ""So far, the answer has been everything is fine, as to how much borrowing the United States government can do before investors start to feel satiated with US debt,"" he said.

âThe nursery I run may not surviveâ,"Zoe Rae says she may have to shut her nursery ""We might be able to last another two months, but without more help we won't last longer,"" says Zoe Rae, who owns Goldsmiths Community Nursery in south-east London. She typically caters to 30 children, but since the lockdown began that has fallen to just three after providers were told they should only stay open for families of key workers. Her income has slumped, so she has put 10 of her staff on paid leave, partly using the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). Ms Rae, 35, also continues to get some state funding for the free childcare she would normally deliver. But she still has two full-time salaries to pay, as well as overheads like rent and waste collection fees, and is running at a loss. ""I think the government should do more to help nurseries,"" she tells the BBC. ""They asked us to stay open for key workers, and we think it is the right thing to do morally. But the support they offer doesn't cover the costs."" 'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery' 'The future of our nursery is pretty bleak' According to a survey of more than 3,000 nurseries, pre-schools and childminders by the Early Years Alliance, one in four say they will have to close permanently within the next 12 months due to financial problems. Some 74% also think the government has not given them enough support to get through the crisis, the lobby group found. Nurseries have closed to everyone except vulnerable children and those with a parent identified as a key worker To protect themselves, some nurseries have been asking parents to pay retainer fees to hold their child's place. But it sparked a backlash and the Competition and Markets Authorityis now investigating. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for early years, said the survey ""is further evidence that the government's lack of support is forcing nurseries and other providers to close and sack staff"". ""Losing a quarter of our childcare providers in this crisis would have a devastating impact on working families."" There were 24,000 nurseries and pre-schools in England in 2019, according to schools regulator Ofsted. Together they provided 1,075,000 childcare places. There were also 35,500 childminders delivering 231,000 early years places. The Department for Education (DfE) says it is offering childcare providers - most of whom are private or voluntary - a range of support. This includes access to the CJRS, which pays 80% of a worker's salary, and continued state funding for free childcare - although these pots of funding must offset each other. Some will also be able to access emergency business rates relief and the government's Â£10,000 Small Business Grant. However, the Early Years Alliance says too many are falling through the cracks of this support. Zarah Hussain runs Zarah's Daycare in Manchester Zarah Hussain, 40, like many childminders is self employed. She is thinking of closing her business in Manchester after the number of families she caters to fell from eight to one. The issue is that she cannot get any wage support from the government because her accounts don't go back far enough, and so she has no personal income. ""I still have to pay for my public liability insurance, Ofsted registration fees and subscriptions to learning resources websites,"" she says. ""I'm using my savings to keep going but I have my own family to support."" She also thinks the government should do more to help, saying businesses like hers are ""crucial to key workers"" and stay open 12 hours a day. ""If people like us fall away people are going to have to rely on unregistered childminders and that raises safeguarding issues."" This video can not be played Some nurseries have been able to stay open in order to look after the children of key workers The Early Years Alliance points to other blind spots in the government's support. For example, providers are not entitled to a small business grant if they are based in premises that don't attract rates relief, such as community centres. There has also been widespread anger about a perceived U-turn by the DfE over how much support providers can get through the government's job retention scheme. The group claims that at the start of the lockdown, the DfE gave providers the impression they would get both their state-funded entitlements and CJRS support in full. However, almost a month later the department offered ""further clarity"" to explain that these two schemes would offset each other to avoid unfair duplication of public funding. The DfE denies it U-turned and says HM Revenue & Customs, which administers the CJRS, was always clear about the terms and conditions which apply ""universally across all sectors"". Nevertheless, almost 170,000 people havesigned a petition,external, arguing that it wrong-footed childcare providers who now have less cash support than they originally thought. In the group's survey, 47% said they may need to make staff redundant as a result. Amanda Philips, who runs the Little School House nursery in Liverpool, feels the DfE ""changed the goalposts"". She had temporarily shut her nursery and put 10 staff on paid leave back in March. But now she is not sure if she will ever open again. ""We thought with the government funding and the furlough we'd be fine and get through this, but now we're on the brink."" A DfE spokeswoman said: ""Nurseries, childminders and all other early years settings are playing a vital role in the response to coronavirus, by supporting critical workers and parents of vulnerable children with continued childcare. ""We have provided continuity in funding for the free childcare entitlements, and the government has put in place a significant package of financial support for providers. This includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which providers can access for employees whose salary is not covered by public funding."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

UK car sales plunge to lowest level since 1946,"New car registrations almost ground to a halt in April after coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced, the motor industry has said. Figures from industry body the SMMT show only 4,321 cars were registered, the lowest monthly level since 1946. April's figure marked a 97% plunge in sales from the same month last year. The closure of car dealerships as part of measures to try to combat the disease has hit consumer registrations. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that of the registrations made last month, 70% were by companies buying for their fleets. The cars would most likely have been on order before the lockdown, said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. ""If you are told to close all your car showrooms for the entirety of April it's no surprise sales are almost non-existent,"" he told the BBC. Many of the 4,000 cars sold last month were needed to support key workers and for those who had a pressing need for them, an SMMT spokesman said. Those cars would not have been bought from dealerships, but instead, for example, from wholesalers, or directly from manufacturers. The 4,000 figure for April compares to 161,064 new cars that were registered in same month last year. New UK car registrations plunge by more than 40% BMW, Honda and Toyota suspend UK car production Nissan extends Sunderland plant production pause The industry body said it now expects 1.68 million new car registrations in 2020 compared with 2.3 million in 2019. Staff at some UK car manufacturers began returning to work this week, although the start of full production is a long way off, Mr Hawes said. The supply chain is also starting to re-open. ""Manufacturers are trying to figure out how to start operations in a safe environment,"" he said. ""But it will be slow and production will be ramped up very slowly."" The coronavirus crisis has come at what was already a difficult time for the motor industry, which had been struggling with falling sales and a collapse in demand for diesel vehicles, while struggling to meet tough new emissions targets. The figures are certainly dramatic, expected to be the lowest sales since February 1946. But since virtually the entire motor industry ground to a halt when the lockdown was introduced, they are not entirely unexpected. What matters now is what happens when the restrictions are eased and customers are allowed back into the showrooms. You would expect there to be some pent-up demand - after all, dealerships began to close in mid-March, traditionally one of the strongest months of the year for new car sales. However, since then harsh economic realities have come into play. Huge swathes of the workforce have been furloughed, and the signs are the country is heading into a deep recession. Under those circumstances, with so much uncertainty and so many jobs at risk, how many people will really be willing to buy a new car? We can expect a wave of incentive programmes - and quite possibly a wave of new scrappage schemes - as car companies start fighting tooth and nail for every single sale. The coronavirus outbreak also halted car production. All of the UK's major car factories suspended work in March, and it is not yet clear when they will reopen. Ian Plummer, commercial director at online marketplace Auto Trader, said: ""With retailers forced to close the doors to their physical forecourts, it'll come as no surprise to anyone to see just how dramatic an impact it's had on the new car market. ""Some brands have been able to sell remotely, but uncertainty in the government's guidelines or a lack of the required infrastructure to operate home delivery in a safe way, has limited it to all but a handful of retailers."" However, he said Auto Trader data indicated that the market had been paused, rather than stopped. He added that there would be a chance ""for the industry to accelerate the adoption of low emission vehicles"" when restrictions lift. ""However, it'll be essential for manufacturers to push more electric vehicles into their UK networks along with greater financial incentives,"" such as scrappage schemes, he said.

France's first coronavirus case 'was in December'The case means Covid-19 may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought.Europe,"A doctor suggests the virus arrived in France almost a month earlier than previously thought A patient treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia actually had the coronavirus, his doctor has said. This means the virus may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought. Dr Yves Cohen said a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19. The patient, who has since recovered, said he had no idea where he caught the virus as he had not travelled abroad. Knowing who was the first case is key to understanding how the virus spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is possible more early cases will come to light, and spokesman Christian Lindmeier urged countries to check records for similar cases in order to gain a clearer picture of the outbreak. The French health ministry told the BBC that the government was obtaining confirmation on the case and that it would consider further investigations if they proved necessary. France is not the only country where subsequent testing points to earlier cases. Two weeks ago,a post-mortem examination carried out in Californiarevealed that the first coronavirus-related death in the US was almost a month earlier than previously thought. Dr Cohen, head of emergency medicine at Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals near Paris, said the patient was a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, north-east of Paris. He told the BBC's Newsday programme that the patient must have been infected between 14 and 22 December, as coronavirus symptoms take between five and 14 days to appear. Listen to the interview The patient, Amirouche Hammar was admitted to hospital on 27 December exhibiting a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing - symptoms which would later become known as main indications of coronavirus. This was four days before the WHO's China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause being detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Mr Hammartold French broadcaster BFMTV,externalthat he had not left France before falling sick. Dr Cohen said while two of the patient's children had also fallen ill, his wife had not shown any symptoms. But Dr Cohen pointed out that the patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China. The patient's wife said that ""often customers would come directly from the airport, still carrying their suitcases"". ""We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic,"" Dr Cohen said. Could coronavirus have been circulating in Europe in late 2019, many weeks before it was officially recognised and declared a threat there? That is the suggestion being made after a French doctor has revealed that he treated a patient in Paris with all of the symptoms of coronavirus just after Christmas. How does this change what we know about the pandemic? It might be that the test result is an error and so does not change a thing. But it if is correct, it could mean spread of the disease was going unchecked in Europe while all eyes were on the East in Wuhan. Certainly, any laboratories in Europe with samples from patients sick with similar symptoms around that time might want to run a test for coronavirus to see what it reveals so that we can learn more about this new disease. Until now, what were thought to have been the France's first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed on 24 January. Of those, two had been to Wuhan - where the outbreak was first detected - and the third was a close family member. Mr Hammar's positive test result suggests the virus was present in France much earlier. The first human-to-human transmission within Europe had until now thought to have been a German man who was infected by a Chinese colleague who visited Germany between 19 and 22 January. Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that if confirmed, Mr Hammar's case highlighted the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world could quickly seed infections elsewhere. ""It means that the lead time we have for assessment and decision-making can be very short,"" Prof Kao said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE BODY?Doctors on the front line explain HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Dr Cohen told  the BBC that he had the idea to look back at all patients who had been in intensive care units with suspected pneumonia between 2 December and 16 January. He found 14 patients who had tested negative for pneumonia. He defrosted their samples and tested them for traces of Covid-19. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? He said that out of the 14 samples, one tested positive for traces of Covid-19. A second test on that same sample also came back positive. He added that the patient's chest scan was also compatible with the symptoms of Covid-19. A full report was due later this week, and would be published by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Dr Cohen added.

Vue Cinemas hoping for mid-July reopening,"The boss of one of the UK's biggest cinema chains is hopeful the business can reopen in mid-July. Vue Cinemas' chief executive Tim Richards told the BBC he is still talking to the authorities about social distancing measures. But if all goes to plan, the chain could be back in business for the launch of director Christopher Nolan's action movie Tenet on 17 July, he said. ""We can control how many people come into our cinemas,"" he said. The coronavirus lockdown forced the closure of cinemas across the UK and elsewhere in the world. Any reopening of the UK's cinemas could only come as part of a government-sanctioned relaxation of lockdown measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to make a statement on Sunday about plans for easing the restrictions. ""We are seeing our markets in Europe opening before ours,"" Mr Richards said. ""We are trying to work with the government to demonstrate we are not like sporting fixtures and pop concerts. ""We can control how many people come into our cinemas at any one time - we have the ability to control the exit and entrance."" Trolls World Tour went straight to streaming in many countries Cinemas, he said, were a big part of the UK's social fabric and research pointed to film-going as one of the main activities people wanted to do after the lockdown is lifted. The closure of cinemas in many countries meant some movies were released simultaneously on streaming platforms and in those outlets still open. This dual release for Trolls World Tour causeda huge dispute between Odeon and film studio Universal. Odeon Cinemas said last week it was banning all Universal films as a result, accusing Universal of ""breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies"". Simultaneous releases of this kind are damaging to cinemas, as it will make it less likely people will visit a public screening. But Mr Richards did not see this way of releasing films becoming a trend. The ""big screen"" was still how people preferred to see big releases, he said. ""Can you imagine watching the new Bond film on a 27-inc Mac?,"" he asked. He said he had sympathy with Universal over the release of Trolls. ""They had already invested heavily in marketing and promotion, and suddenly they had no screens [to show it on],"" Mr Richards said. ""What [Universal] did does not mean there is a new direction of travel. We are not seeing any change,"" he said.

"EFL clubs face 'Â£200m hole' by SeptemberEnglish Football League chairman Rick Parry says the season needs to be concluded before 31 July and that clubs face a ""Â£200m hole"".BBC SportComments","Rick Parry gave evidence by video because of the coronavirus pandemic English Football League chairman Rick Parry has said the current season needs to be concluded before 31 July and that clubs face a ""Â£200m hole"" by September. The former Liverpool chief executive admitted the EFL needed a ""proper reset post-Covid"", with clubs currently ""stacking up creditors"". Parry said it was ""difficult to answer"" how many might go out of business. He was giving evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee about the impact of coronavirus. Parry covered a wide range of subjects, including: what should happen with promotion and relegation his view on wage deferrals the future of ""evil"" parachute payments Elite football has been suspended since 13 March and, while the Premier League and EFL has said it intends to complete the 2019-20 season, it remains uncertain how or when. ""Our end date realistically is 31 July because of the situation with contracts,"" said Parry. ""We can't go beyond July. ""Players and staff have been furloughed and to expect clubs to bring them back in now, to forgo the furlough, only to then find in a month they can't play would be a complete mess. ""We need within days to be taking decisions."" He added: ""We have a great deal of uncertainty around next season and the undetermined matter of when we'll be able to return with crowds, which for the EFL is absolutely critical. We're much more dependent upon the revenue and atmosphere generated by crowds than the Premier League."" Palios doubts season will be finished Cancelling autumn internationals would cost RFU Â£107m Coronavirus could cost ECB Â£380m, says chief exec UK Sport asks government for exceptional funding from April 2021 Parry, who was giving evidence alongside England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison and Rugby Football Union CEO Bill Sweeney, said he still expected three clubs to be promoted from the Championship to Premier League. He added that it could get ""very messy"" if the threat of relegation from the top flight was removed -as has been reported. ""The Premier League is aware of our position on that,"" he stated, going on to suggest ""lawyers are going to get wealthy"" if the Premier League opted not to relegate three teams. ""There would be a degree of outrage from a number of clubs in the Championship and it would be a breach of the tripartite agreement,"" Parry continued. This video can not be played We've got bills to pay like everybody else - Accrington captain Conneely on life as a furloughed League One player Finishing the season behind closed doors would primarily be about ""sporting integrity"" rather than generating revenue for clubs, said Parry. ""If we were starting behind closed doors it would be finely balanced economically,"" he explained. ""It's almost neutral but for many clubs it would actually cost them to play. ""We stand to lose an element of broadcast revenue if we're unable to complete the season, but given the broadcast contract is nowhere near that of the Premier League it's a relatively small contribution."" Blackburn Rovers last week became the latest Championship club to announce wage deferrals Parry said he supported the Professional Footballers' Association's appointment of financial services firm Deloitte to look at club accounts and assesses if there was a genuine need for wages to be deferred. ""Our approach really is to say we're all part of the problem and so we all need to be part of the solution; the clubs, the players and the owners,"" he said. ""We all need to share the pain. ""We're having an open-book policy. We're absolutely on board with the Deloitte process."" Explaining the situation around player contracts, Parry said the ""landscape going forwards has got to change"". ""We have 1,400 players coming out of contract at the end of June,"" he said. ""That is a train coming down the tunnel very quickly. ""They are going to be extremely concerned about their futures."" Parry said he ""completely agreed"" that a rescue package would now be needed to help support EFL clubs. ""The Premier League has said if they're allowed to play then they will be in a position to talk to us about support for the lower leagues,"" he added. ""We await that day - discussions to date, I think it's fair to say, have been limited."" Parry also said they could not just rely on going from ""one bailout to another bailout"", suggesting a ""complete reset"" was now needed in terms of the redistribution of revenue within the game. ""Parachute payments are an evil that needs to be eradicated,"" he said. ""We have six clubs in the Championship receiving parachute payments giving them an average of Â£40m per club. The other 18 clubs get Â£4.5m each, so they're then struggling to keep up. He added: ""We need to know where we're heading in two and three years. We need hope, we need a plan and we need some clarity on the longer-term future."" In a statement the Premier League defended parachute payments. ""Parachute payments are a vital mechanism to give relegated clubs financial support while adjusting to significantly lower revenues and having a higher cost base related to their playing squads,"" the statement said. ""We see no evidence that parachute payments distort performance at that level and are an essential part of this highly competitive environment.""

"âThe nursery I run may not surviveâThousands of nurseries and childminders may shut permanently, research suggests.Business","Zoe Rae says she may have to shut her nursery ""We might be able to last another two months, but without more help we won't last longer,"" says Zoe Rae, who owns Goldsmiths Community Nursery in south-east London. She typically caters to 30 children, but since the lockdown began that has fallen to just three after providers were told they should only stay open for families of key workers. Her income has slumped, so she has put 10 of her staff on paid leave, partly using the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). Ms Rae, 35, also continues to get some state funding for the free childcare she would normally deliver. But she still has two full-time salaries to pay, as well as overheads like rent and waste collection fees, and is running at a loss. ""I think the government should do more to help nurseries,"" she tells the BBC. ""They asked us to stay open for key workers, and we think it is the right thing to do morally. But the support they offer doesn't cover the costs."" 'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery' 'The future of our nursery is pretty bleak' According to a survey of more than 3,000 nurseries, pre-schools and childminders by the Early Years Alliance, one in four say they will have to close permanently within the next 12 months due to financial problems. Some 74% also think the government has not given them enough support to get through the crisis, the lobby group found. Nurseries have closed to everyone except vulnerable children and those with a parent identified as a key worker To protect themselves, some nurseries have been asking parents to pay retainer fees to hold their child's place. But it sparked a backlash and the Competition and Markets Authorityis now investigating. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for early years, said the survey ""is further evidence that the government's lack of support is forcing nurseries and other providers to close and sack staff"". ""Losing a quarter of our childcare providers in this crisis would have a devastating impact on working families."" There were 24,000 nurseries and pre-schools in England in 2019, according to schools regulator Ofsted. Together they provided 1,075,000 childcare places. There were also 35,500 childminders delivering 231,000 early years places. The Department for Education (DfE) says it is offering childcare providers - most of whom are private or voluntary - a range of support. This includes access to the CJRS, which pays 80% of a worker's salary, and continued state funding for free childcare - although these pots of funding must offset each other. Some will also be able to access emergency business rates relief and the government's Â£10,000 Small Business Grant. However, the Early Years Alliance says too many are falling through the cracks of this support. Zarah Hussain runs Zarah's Daycare in Manchester Zarah Hussain, 40, like many childminders is self employed. She is thinking of closing her business in Manchester after the number of families she caters to fell from eight to one. The issue is that she cannot get any wage support from the government because her accounts don't go back far enough, and so she has no personal income. ""I still have to pay for my public liability insurance, Ofsted registration fees and subscriptions to learning resources websites,"" she says. ""I'm using my savings to keep going but I have my own family to support."" She also thinks the government should do more to help, saying businesses like hers are ""crucial to key workers"" and stay open 12 hours a day. ""If people like us fall away people are going to have to rely on unregistered childminders and that raises safeguarding issues."" This video can not be played Some nurseries have been able to stay open in order to look after the children of key workers The Early Years Alliance points to other blind spots in the government's support. For example, providers are not entitled to a small business grant if they are based in premises that don't attract rates relief, such as community centres. There has also been widespread anger about a perceived U-turn by the DfE over how much support providers can get through the government's job retention scheme. The group claims that at the start of the lockdown, the DfE gave providers the impression they would get both their state-funded entitlements and CJRS support in full. However, almost a month later the department offered ""further clarity"" to explain that these two schemes would offset each other to avoid unfair duplication of public funding. The DfE denies it U-turned and says HM Revenue & Customs, which administers the CJRS, was always clear about the terms and conditions which apply ""universally across all sectors"". Nevertheless, almost 170,000 people havesigned a petition,external, arguing that it wrong-footed childcare providers who now have less cash support than they originally thought. In the group's survey, 47% said they may need to make staff redundant as a result. Amanda Philips, who runs the Little School House nursery in Liverpool, feels the DfE ""changed the goalposts"". She had temporarily shut her nursery and put 10 staff on paid leave back in March. But now she is not sure if she will ever open again. ""We thought with the government funding and the furlough we'd be fine and get through this, but now we're on the brink."" A DfE spokeswoman said: ""Nurseries, childminders and all other early years settings are playing a vital role in the response to coronavirus, by supporting critical workers and parents of vulnerable children with continued childcare. ""We have provided continuity in funding for the free childcare entitlements, and the government has put in place a significant package of financial support for providers. This includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which providers can access for employees whose salary is not covered by public funding."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

In a video ceremony featuring messages from celebrities Ant and Dec, Matt Hancock opened the 460-bed facility at Washington, near Sunderland. However, permanent hospitals in the region have so far coped with the capacity to treat patients. London's Nightingale Hospital has already been placed on standby, as demand for beds has not been required. ""Of course, we all hope that these extra beds will not all have to be used but I know you built this facility in a way that means you can adapt the hospital to changing clinical needs,"" Mr Hancock said in the video.

BBC Northampton About half the nursing and midwifery students at a university are now on placements, providing extra help during the coronavirus pandemic. Some 150 students from the University of Northampton have ""opted in"" to become NHS employees earlier than they would normally. Julie Martin, who arranges placements for the university, said: ""It's about making sure that everyone has clear expectations."" She said they have been talking to the relevant organisations to make sure they ""have a fair level of understanding on what our students can do"". Hannah Shaw (pictured above) has begun her placement at Milton Keynes University Hospital. ""Iâve been feeling a 50-50 mix of excitement and nervousness,"" she said. ""Itâs an unknown situation as there are healthcare staff who have come down with the virus and staff across the country that have died from it, so it is a little bit daunting. âBut, as a team, we are well protected."" Three members of the same familyhave died within weeksof each other after contracting coronavirus. Keith Dunnington, 54, a nurse for more than 30 years, died at his parents home in South Shields two weeks ago. His mother Lillian, 81, died on 1 May and her husband Maurice, 85, died days later at South Tyneside Hospital. Maurice Dunnington, son Keith and wife Lillian all died with coronavirus within weeks Keith's cousin Debbie Harvey said her family was heartbroken but praised the ""absolutely amazing"" NHS staff who ""could not do enough"" for the family. She said front-line hospital staff pushed Mr and Mrs Dunnington's beds together so they could hold hands.

Reality Check The number of people killed by coronavirus in London in the four weeks to 24 April was significantly higher than the number of civilians killed during the worst four-week period of aerial bombing of the city during the Blitz. Registered deaths in London attributed to Covid-19, in the four weeks to 24 April this year, reached 5,901 according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Figures held in the National Archives, and collated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, show that 4,677 people were killed during the Blitz in the 28 days to 4 October 1940. ""These are the best figures available for the civilian deaths in the Blitz,"" said Prof Richard Overy from the University of Exeter. ""This dramatic war on civilians has come to symbolise the horrors of total war, with the images of burning and ruined buildings and bodies dug out from the rubble. ""All the more poignant is the contrast with the current epidemic which has killed considerably more people in 28 days in London's hospitals and care homes.""

Author wins Pulitzer Prize for a second time,"Author Colson Whitehead has won his second Pulitzer Prize for fiction US author Colson Whitehead has become only the fourth writer ever to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction twice. The African-American author was honoured for The Nickel Boys, which chronicles the abuse of black boys at a juvenile reform school in Florida. Whitehead, a 50-year-old New Yorker, won the 2017 prize in the same category for his book The Underground Railroad. Before him, only Booth Tarkington, William Faulkner and John Updike had won the Pulitzer for fiction twice. The 2020 awards, postponed for several weeks due to the coronavirus, were announced remotely this year in the living room of Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy. She noted that the first Pulitzers were awarded in 1917, less than a year before the outbreak of the Spanish Flu. They are among the highest honours for US-based journalists and authors. Whitehead has previously said he grew up wanting to be the black version of horror writer Stephen King. His Nickel Boys was inspired by the real-life horror story of the Dozier School for Boys in the Florida panhandle, where children convicted of minor offences were subjected to violent abuse. The Harvard graduate's novel was praised by the Pulitzer committee for its ""spare and devastating exploration of abuse at a reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida that is ultimately a powerful tale of human perseverance, dignity and redemption"". The New York Times newspaper topped the list of publications for journalism honours with three awards, including the prestigious investigative reporting prize for Brian Rosenthal's expose of New York City's taxi industry, showing how predatory lenders exploited vulnerable drivers.

In collaboration with ProPublica, the Anchorage Daily News won what is widely regarded as the most coveted Pulitzer, for public service journalism, in recognition of its work on the lack of police coverage in many small towns in Alaska. The honour for breaking news photography went to staff at Reuters news agency for their images of last year's Hong Kong protests. And, for the first time in its history, the Pulitzer committee bestowed a prize in audio reporting, which was awarded to This American Life for its episode The Out Crowd, which examined US President Donald Trump's policy requiring thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. The episode was a collaboration with Molly O'Toole of the Los Angeles Times and Emily Green of Vice News, who will also share the prize. A posthumous special citation was awarded to African-American civil rights activist and early champion of investigative journalism Ida B Wells, who died in 1931, for her ""outstanding and courageous reporting"" on lynching. The citation comes with a donation of at least $50,000 (Â£40,100) in support of Ms Wells' mission, with recipients to be announced. ""It goes without saying that today we announce the Pulitzer winners in deeply challenging times,"" Ms Canedy said on Monday. She added that journalism was as valuable as ever, with the arts continuing to ""sustain, unite and inspire"".

"Key workers to trial NHS virus tracing appIf the Isle of Wight trial is successful, the app could be ready nationwide within weeks, ministers say.","Social distancing rules will still be in place during the trial, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said An NHS app that aims to track the spread of coronavirus is being rolled out for the first time, as part of a trial on the Isle of Wight. Council and healthcare workers will be the first to try the contact-tracing app, with the rest of the island able to download it from Thursday. If the trial is successful, it could be available nationwide within weeks. Concerns have been raised over privacy, though ministers say the app has been designed with this ""front of mind"". The app aims to quickly trace recent contacts of anyone who tests positive for the virus. It is part of the government's strategy for coming out of lockdown, which aims to have widespread testing and contact tracing in place to monitor and reduce any future outbreaks. If the trial is successful, the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas called for a ""national consensus"" on tackling the viruswhen the UK begins to move out of lockdown. It comes as the the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK reached 28,734, an increase of 288. The daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said. The new app - published on Apple and Google's app stores - works by using a Bluetooth connection. It records when two people who have the app are within a certain distance of each other for longer than a specified amount of time. If one of those people later reports having symptoms, all the other app users they came into significant contact with over recent days will be alerted and, if judged necessary, told to self-isolate. ""The exact advice on what you should do will depend on the evolving context and approach,"" the NHS has said. Read more here. Mr Hancock urged everyone on the Isle of Wight to download the app when it was available to them. Social distancing rules would still be in place during the trial, he said. ""By downloading the app, you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community,"" he said. ""Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows."" The island was chosen for the trial because it has a lower number of new infections, is covered by a single NHS trust and because travel to and from the island is quite restricted. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the app would be an ""incredibly important part"" of the fight against the virus and the more people who downloaded it, the more lockdown restrictions could be eased. This video can not be played Matt Hancock said Isle of Wight residents using the app ""will be saving lives"" Sir Keir said he hoped the app would be successful but questioned whether take-up would be high enough. ""I am a bit concerned that a similar app in Singapore only had, I think, something like a 20% take-up rate in the public,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Labour leader added that traditional methods of tracing, for example phoning people, would have to be used alongside the technology. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:What is the UK's track and trace strategy? The ""centralised"" model of the app -  meaning there is a central computer server which works out which phones have matched - has raised some privacy concerns. This is different to the ""decentralised"" model used by Apple and Google, where the matches take place on users' handsets. Some have argued a ""centralised"" approach gives the app advantages, for example by making it easier to spot hotspots where the disease is spreading. But others say a central system increases the risk from potential hackers. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown Law professor Orla Lynskey said the option on the app for users to opt in and share their location data ""poses a big risk"". But NHSX - the part of the health service that developed the app - said the app will be voluntary, and the only personal data stored by the app at the start would be the first part of the user's postcode. Additional location data will only be recorded if users agree to a further opt-in request, NHSX added. Mr Hancock said the software was ""designed with privacy and security front of mind"". He said the data was stored on the phone and only sent to the NHS when someone needs a test. Users will be asked to enter the first part of their postcode but not their name or other personal details The UK's""test, track and trace"" strategyhas seen testing be scaled up over the last month, following Mr Hancock's pledge to reach 100,000 tests by the end of April. The UK passed the target,providing more than 122,000 testson the last day of April.Latest figures show,externalthere were 85,186 tests on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which has been advising the government on the pandemic,has published some of the evidence which informed its guidance,external. The documents cover the group's meetings up to 14 April. Among the papers published by Sage is one from a meeting on 2 April, which suggests lockdown restrictions should be eased ""very gradually"" to avoid measures needing to be reintroduced, which could undermine public trust. In other developments: Trade unionshave warned draft government guidelines for getting people back to workcould compromise employees' safety Mr Hancock said the issue of maintaining social distancing on flights was a ""really difficult question"" and safety ""has got to come first"". His comments cameafter photos of an Aer Lingus flight showed passengers sitting close together, with most seats occupied A group of Tory MPsare calling for restrictions around funerals to be eased,to allow small-scale ceremonies in churches rather than just at the graveside or crematorium The governmentis now paying the wages for nearly a quarter of UK jobs,under the furlough scheme that helps people put on leave due to the pandemic Doctors working for Premier League football clubshave raised concerns over plansto resume the football season Thousands of nurseries and childminders could shut permanently due to the pandemic,research suggests.

Coronavirus: Calls to shut down 'dirty fur trade',"Tens of millions of animals are farmed for their fur around the world, including raccoon dogs Mink have contracted coronavirus, adding to the list of animals known to be at risk of catching the virus. Mink at two fur farms in the Netherlands tested positive for Covid-19 a week ago. And last month, it was revealed that lions and tigers at a New York zoo had caught the disease from their keepers. Coronavirus could be ""catastrophic"" for endangered wildlife and we must act now to protect them, said Dr Peta Hitchens of the University of Melbourne. This includes thorough regulation of wildlife trade and trafficking, as well as protection of ecosystems where human encroachment and destruction ""has resulted in increased interactions between us and wild animals"". Mink farmers are on alert for signs of the diseases It's not surprising that mink have been infected, she added. The list of mammal species infected during the 2003 Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak numbers at least 16, including mink, palm civets, fruit bats, several species of horseshoe bat, red fox, wild boar, raccoon dog, and domestic cats and dogs. Coronavirus: Calls to protect great apes from threat of infection Coronavirus: Great apes on lockdown over threat of disease. Officials in The Netherlands believe mink contracted the illness from farm workers and the farms have since been put into quarantine. The creation of new mink farms was banned there in 2013, while existing mink fur farms have until 2024 to close. Animal rights organisation Peta has written a letter to ministers calling for the farms to be shut down immediately: ""Allowing mink farms to maintain business as usual for nearly four more years - in the face of a global crisis stemming from animal exploitation - would be inexcusable from the perspective of both the risk posed to humans and the harm inflicted on the mink themselves."" Rabbit farming is big business in China Animal protection charity Humane Society International, which campaigns for a global end to the fur trade, has warned of the risk in other countries, where tens of millions of mink, fox, raccoon dogs, chinchillas and rabbits are farmed. Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International/UK, said in addition to animal suffering, the potential for disease spread is another reason for all fashion companies to go fur-free and for governments to shut down ""this dirty trade"". ""One of the lessons we must learn from Covid-19 is that we cannot carry on pushing animals to the limit of their endurance without serious consequences for both animal and human health,"" she said. ""We urge the Netherlands and other countries in the process of phasing out fur farming to speed up their industry closures, and countries yet to commit to bans, including China and Finland, to do so now."" A spokesperson for the British Fur Trade Association said: ""The case in the Netherlands demonstrates the efficiency of fur farming bio security measures in Europe and the rigorous controls that are in place. The Dutch authorities confirm that there is no further spread of the virus and that the risk of onward transmission is negligible. "" According to a 2016 report released by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, 75% of China's wildlife trade is dominated by fur production with animals farmed for their fur, such as raccoon dogs, foxes and mink, often ending up at wildlife wet market.

Labour calls for 'national consensus' virus plan,"Sir Keir Starmer has said much more needs to be done to reassure people they are safe to return to work when the UK begins to move out of lockdown. The Labour leader said government plans were ""full of gaps"" and a ""national consensus"" was needed between political parties, employers and unions. He is calling for new safety standards in the workplace to reassure people ""very anxious"" about returning to work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said any new measures had to be ""practical"". Boris Johnson is expected to reveal a ""road map"" out of lockdown on Sunday. Ministers are required by law to review the UK's lockdown restrictions every three weeks, with the next review due by Thursday. Mr Johnson has warned the UK must not lift restrictions too soon. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. 'Huge gaps' in draft coronavirus workplace rules How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown What is the UK's new contact tracing plan? Sir Keir, who took over as leader of the party last month, told the BBC that Labour supported the restrictions being extended and pledged to work ""constructively"" with the government. But he said it was ""not unreasonable"" to ask for more clarity on what was expected of businesses and their staff to minimise the risk of the infection rate going back up again. Sir Keir, who will hold talks with the PM and other opposition leaders later this week, set out out seven ""core principles"" which he believed should be considered by the government as part of its planning for an exit strategy. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay, wages and time off PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? These include bringing in a ""national safety standard"" for businesses and schools, in order toaddress the TUC's concernsabout the government's draft guidance on getting people back to work. ""The government put out a consultation document out at the weekend which was very vague, with lots of gaps in it,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""We need something stronger. ""Reassurance really matters here. I think the vast majority of people are really anxious about going back to work. ""I think people are more likely to be reassured and have confidence if they see political parties, trade unions and businesses lining up behind a standard they think is right and enforceable."" This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? And he said ministers should urgently make the existing furlough scheme ""more flexible"" to manage people's gradual return to work. Up to 6.3 million workers - 23% of the UK's employed workforce - have been placed on the scheme, in which the state pays up to 80% of their wages. Sir Keir said he agreed with Chancellor Rishi Sunak that this could not go on indefinitely and industries expected to return sooner needed more help so they can get their workers ""ready to go back to business"". Government pays nearly quarter of worker wages Sir Keir said it was ""inevitable"" people will ""probably"" have to wear face coverings in places where social distancing cannot be guaranteed after lockdown while it was likely more train services would have to be laid on. On vaccines, Sir Keir said the government should set out how it intends to ensure the manufacture and distribution of any vaccine, while ministers should also publish a national plan for the winter flu season. A plan to ensure supply chains for protective equipment for key workers were guaranteed and a ""structured approach to easing and tightening restrictions"" must also be formed, he said. Mr Hancock told the BBC that the government was consulting with unions and employers on the way forward. ""Clearly it is absolutely vital that people are as safe as possible when they're at work. We've got to do that in a way that's practical,"" he said. In a video messageposted on Twitter,externalon Monday, Mr Johnson said the the UK must not lift restrictions too soon. The prime minister said the UK would only be able to move on to ""the second phase of this conflict"" when the government'sfive testshad been met, including a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak which could overwhelm the health service.

Coronavirus: âThe nursery I run may not surviveâ,"Zoe Rae says she may have to shut her nursery ""We might be able to last another two months, but without more help we won't last longer,"" says Zoe Rae, who owns Goldsmiths Community Nursery in south-east London. She typically caters to 30 children, but since the lockdown began that has fallen to just three after providers were told they should only stay open for families of key workers. Her income has slumped, so she has put 10 of her staff on paid leave, partly using the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). Ms Rae, 35, also continues to get some state funding for the free childcare she would normally deliver. But she still has two full-time salaries to pay, as well as overheads like rent and waste collection fees, and is running at a loss. ""I think the government should do more to help nurseries,"" she tells the BBC. ""They asked us to stay open for key workers, and we think it is the right thing to do morally. But the support they offer doesn't cover the costs."" 'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery' 'The future of our nursery is pretty bleak' According to a survey of more than 3,000 nurseries, pre-schools and childminders by the Early Years Alliance, one in four say they will have to close permanently within the next 12 months due to financial problems. Some 74% also think the government has not given them enough support to get through the crisis, the lobby group found. Nurseries have closed to everyone except vulnerable children and those with a parent identified as a key worker To protect themselves, some nurseries have been asking parents to pay retainer fees to hold their child's place. But it sparked a backlash and the Competition and Markets Authorityis now investigating. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for early years, said the survey ""is further evidence that the government's lack of support is forcing nurseries and other providers to close and sack staff"". ""Losing a quarter of our childcare providers in this crisis would have a devastating impact on working families."" There were 24,000 nurseries and pre-schools in England in 2019, according to schools regulator Ofsted. Together they provided 1,075,000 childcare places. There were also 35,500 childminders delivering 231,000 early years places. The Department for Education (DfE) says it is offering childcare providers - most of whom are private or voluntary - a range of support. This includes access to the CJRS, which pays 80% of a worker's salary, and continued state funding for free childcare - although these pots of funding must offset each other. Some will also be able to access emergency business rates relief and the government's Â£10,000 Small Business Grant. However, the Early Years Alliance says too many are falling through the cracks of this support. Zarah Hussain runs Zarah's Daycare in Manchester Zarah Hussain, 40, like many childminders is self employed. She is thinking of closing her business in Manchester after the number of families she caters to fell from eight to one. The issue is that she cannot get any wage support from the government because her accounts don't go back far enough, and so she has no personal income. ""I still have to pay for my public liability insurance, Ofsted registration fees and subscriptions to learning resources websites,"" she says. ""I'm using my savings to keep going but I have my own family to support."" She also thinks the government should do more to help, saying businesses like hers are ""crucial to key workers"" and stay open 12 hours a day. ""If people like us fall away people are going to have to rely on unregistered childminders and that raises safeguarding issues."" This video can not be played Some nurseries have been able to stay open in order to look after the children of key workers The Early Years Alliance points to other blind spots in the government's support. For example, providers are not entitled to a small business grant if they are based in premises that don't attract rates relief, such as community centres. There has also been widespread anger about a perceived U-turn by the DfE over how much support providers can get through the government's job retention scheme. The group claims that at the start of the lockdown, the DfE gave providers the impression they would get both their state-funded entitlements and CJRS support in full. However, almost a month later the department offered ""further clarity"" to explain that these two schemes would offset each other to avoid unfair duplication of public funding. The DfE denies it U-turned and says HM Revenue & Customs, which administers the CJRS, was always clear about the terms and conditions which apply ""universally across all sectors"". Nevertheless, almost 170,000 people havesigned a petition,external, arguing that it wrong-footed childcare providers who now have less cash support than they originally thought. In the group's survey, 47% said they may need to make staff redundant as a result. Amanda Philips, who runs the Little School House nursery in Liverpool, feels the DfE ""changed the goalposts"". She had temporarily shut her nursery and put 10 staff on paid leave back in March. But now she is not sure if she will ever open again. ""We thought with the government funding and the furlough we'd be fine and get through this, but now we're on the brink."" A DfE spokeswoman said: ""Nurseries, childminders and all other early years settings are playing a vital role in the response to coronavirus, by supporting critical workers and parents of vulnerable children with continued childcare. ""We have provided continuity in funding for the free childcare entitlements, and the government has put in place a significant package of financial support for providers. This includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which providers can access for employees whose salary is not covered by public funding."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Black author makes Pulitzer Prize history,"Author Colson Whitehead has won his second Pulitzer Prize for fiction US author Colson Whitehead has become only the fourth writer ever to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction twice. The African-American author was honoured for The Nickel Boys, which chronicles the abuse of black boys at a juvenile reform school in Florida. Whitehead, a 50-year-old New Yorker, won the 2017 prize in the same category for his book The Underground Railroad. Before him, only Booth Tarkington, William Faulkner and John Updike had won the Pulitzer for fiction twice. The 2020 awards, postponed for several weeks due to the coronavirus, were announced remotely this year in the living room of Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy. She noted that the first Pulitzers were awarded in 1917, less than a year before the outbreak of the Spanish Flu. They are among the highest honours for US-based journalists and authors. Whitehead has previously said he grew up wanting to be the black version of horror writer Stephen King. His Nickel Boys was inspired by the real-life horror story of the Dozier School for Boys in the Florida panhandle, where children convicted of minor offences were subjected to violent abuse. The Harvard graduate's novel was praised by the Pulitzer committee for its ""spare and devastating exploration of abuse at a reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida that is ultimately a powerful tale of human perseverance, dignity and redemption"". The New York Times newspaper topped the list of publications for journalism honours with three awards, including the prestigious investigative reporting prize for Brian Rosenthal's expose of New York City's taxi industry, showing how predatory lenders exploited vulnerable drivers.

In collaboration with ProPublica, the Anchorage Daily News won what is widely regarded as the most coveted Pulitzer, for public service journalism, in recognition of its work on the lack of police coverage in many small towns in Alaska. The honour for breaking news photography went to staff at Reuters news agency for their images of last year's Hong Kong protests. And, for the first time in its history, the Pulitzer committee bestowed a prize in audio reporting, which was awarded to This American Life for its episode The Out Crowd, which examined US President Donald Trump's policy requiring thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. The episode was a collaboration with Molly O'Toole of the Los Angeles Times and Emily Green of Vice News, who will also share the prize. A posthumous special citation was awarded to African-American civil rights activist and early champion of investigative journalism Ida B Wells, who died in 1931, for her ""outstanding and courageous reporting"" on lynching. The citation comes with a donation of at least $50,000 (Â£40,100) in support of Ms Wells' mission, with recipients to be announced. ""It goes without saying that today we announce the Pulitzer winners in deeply challenging times,"" Ms Canedy said on Monday.

New UK car registrations fall drastically in April,"New car registrations almost ground to a halt in April after coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced, the motor industry has said. Figures from industry body the SMMT show only 4,321 cars were registered, the lowest monthly level since 1946. April's figure marked a 97% plunge in sales from the same month last year. The closure of car dealerships as part of measures to try to combat the disease has hit consumer registrations. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that of the registrations made last month, 70% were by companies buying for their fleets. The cars would most likely have been on order before the lockdown, said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. ""If you are told to close all your car showrooms for the entirety of April it's no surprise sales are almost non-existent,"" he told the BBC. Many of the 4,000 cars sold last month were needed to support key workers and for those who had a pressing need for them, an SMMT spokesman said. Those cars would not have been bought from dealerships, but instead, for example, from wholesalers, or directly from manufacturers. The 4,000 figure for April compares to 161,064 new cars that were registered in same month last year. New UK car registrations plunge by more than 40% BMW, Honda and Toyota suspend UK car production Nissan extends Sunderland plant production pause The industry body said it now expects 1.68 million new car registrations in 2020 compared with 2.3 million in 2019. Staff at some UK car manufacturers began returning to work this week, although the start of full production is a long way off, Mr Hawes said. The supply chain is also starting to re-open. ""Manufacturers are trying to figure out how to start operations in a safe environment,"" he said. ""But it will be slow and production will be ramped up very slowly."" The coronavirus crisis has come at what was already a difficult time for the motor industry, which had been struggling with falling sales and a collapse in demand for diesel vehicles, while struggling to meet tough new emissions targets. The figures are certainly dramatic, expected to be the lowest sales since February 1946. But since virtually the entire motor industry ground to a halt when the lockdown was introduced, they are not entirely unexpected. What matters now is what happens when the restrictions are eased and customers are allowed back into the showrooms. You would expect there to be some pent-up demand - after all, dealerships began to close in mid-March, traditionally one of the strongest months of the year for new car sales. However, since then harsh economic realities have come into play. Huge swathes of the workforce have been furloughed, and the signs are the country is heading into a deep recession. Under those circumstances, with so much uncertainty and so many jobs at risk, how many people will really be willing to buy a new car? We can expect a wave of incentive programmes - and quite possibly a wave of new scrappage schemes - as car companies start fighting tooth and nail for every single sale. The coronavirus outbreak also halted car production. All of the UK's major car factories suspended work in March, and it is not yet clear when they will reopen. Ian Plummer, commercial director at online marketplace Auto Trader, said: ""With retailers forced to close the doors to their physical forecourts, it'll come as no surprise to anyone to see just how dramatic an impact it's had on the new car market. ""Some brands have been able to sell remotely, but uncertainty in the government's guidelines or a lack of the required infrastructure to operate home delivery in a safe way, has limited it to all but a handful of retailers."" However, he said Auto Trader data indicated that the market had been paused, rather than stopped. He added that there would be a chance ""for the industry to accelerate the adoption of low emission vehicles"" when restrictions lift. ""However, it'll be essential for manufacturers to push more electric vehicles into their UK networks along with greater financial incentives,"" such as scrappage schemes, he said.

Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News More than 70 trespassing
incidents have been recorded on Scotlandâs railways since the countryâs schools
closed due to Covid-19. Network Rail said one case,
near Neilston, Renfrewshire, involved two adults and a child. Another featured a group of
teenagers trespassing on the line near Coatdyke, Coatbridge. And trains near Hamilton West
were delayed last week after three youths were spotted on the line. Network Rail, which has
launched anew awareness campaign,external, said the problem has increased across the
country since 20 March. Reporting Scotland The first minister highlighted that the reproduction rate of the coronavirus in Scotland was not at a low enough level to lift lockdown measures. She said she was not confident restrictions could be eased ""without the virus running amok again"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""We  know that it would not take much easing up for that progress to be halted."" On the subject of whether construction firms in Scotland would get back to work in line with others across the UK, the first minister said she was looking construction as well as retail. However she said that any changes that occur too swiftly could result in damage that would be ""deeper and even longer lasting"". The first minister has delivered a ""direct message"" to businesses that guidelines are in place and should be followed amid concerns over members of the public queuing outside drive through coffee shops. Nicola Sturgeon told Reporting Scotland she worried the message to the public to stay at home may become ""diluted"" but that people should continue to ""tighten up"" on their compliance. An increasing number of businesses are opening on a takeaway capacity and there is evidence that more people are using public transport. Meanwhile the Scottish government has yet to set a date for the lifting of lockdown measures. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I need people to abide by these decisions."" She added she thought it was better to treat the public like adults rather than forcing them to comply. Chris McLaughlinBBC Sport Scotland Scottish football clubs face a bigger financial threat from the Covid-19 lockdown than their counterparts in England, Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster warns. The heads of key governing bodies today met government ministers to discuss the resumption of sport across Scotland. The Scottish FA, SPFL, Scottish Rugby and others were invited to a virtual summit with sport minister Joe Fitzpatrick and national clinical director Jason Leitch. ""We gave the minister a frank summary of the existential crisis our game is facing,"" Doncaster says. ""Gate receipts make up a far higher proportion of our income than in England, which benefits from huge TV deals, so until we get back to playing in front of crowds, our game will remain in grave peril."" Scottish football will ""remain in grave peril"" until games resume in front of paying supporters, the SPFL warns. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Could ""herd immunity"" be back on the UK agenda as it moves out of lockdown? Some researchers fromEdinburgh University are suggesting that younger and more healthy parts of the population could be allowed to mix freelywhile the more vulnerable remain shielded. Prof Paul McKeigue told BBC Radio Scotland that, if the country could build up the level of immunity in the younger and healthier population to about 80%, it would be safe for the more vulnerable to come out because there ""would be very little risk of being infected"". He says his research group is trying to construct a ""risk classifier"" that ""could tell some people that they were at risk so low that it was perhaps less than being killed in a car accident in the next year Ohers, he suggests,  could be told they are at high risk and they should remain isolated and thoroughly shielded. Prof McKeigue says such a plan would require more information on the infection mortality rate of Covid-19 - with some saying it is 1% and others arguing that it is much less.  Allow Twitter content?

General secretary designate Rozanne Foyer also said any workplace regulations must be enforceable, for example by environmental health officers or trade union safety reps. While the unions ""absolutely support"" the cautious approach being taken by the government, she said: ""We would want to be sure that the proper capacity is in place for a full test, track and isolation policy to be up and running.""

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Skye care home which has seen 57 cases of Covid-19, including three deaths of residents, has struggled with recruitment problems, its operator says. Sir David Behan, of HC One, says competition from tourism and other industries meant it had often been forced to rely on agency staff at Home Farm in Portree. But he says he is ""immensely proud"" of the firm's staff in Scotland who are ""turning up and doing their job on a daily basis"". He tells Drivetime with John Beattie a big problem is that staff could be asymptomatic - and could have been  passing on the virus. The introduction of testing of both staff and residents is absolutely critical if we are to provide the appropriate management of residents and the appropriate protection of staff. Sir David Behan, Executive chairman, HC One Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Dr Poppy Lamberton, an expert in global public health, says ""limited testing"" in the UK is behind the high death toll. She also suggests the UK had a higher capacity for testing at the beginning which was not made use of due to tight guidelines. Dr Lamberton adds: ""We really should focus on moving forwards, getting people tested, isolating if you have any symptoms and making sure you tell people if you've had symptoms so anyone you've had contact with also isolates even if they don't have symptoms.""

Only four residents appear to be Covid-free. Sir David Behan, executive chairman of HC One, which runs the home,  admits inspectors had reported some problems with cleaning and staffing in January - but he insists an action plan had been implemented. As the outbreak gathered pace, the firm secured PPE and put restrictions on visiting in more than 300 homes across the UK, he says. The former Care Quality Commission chief executive told John Beattie: ""We're not looking to hide anything here, this is a matter of public interest."" The main factor in the high number of care home deaths is the vulnerability of older people, he insists.  This is a virus which disproportionately affects older people. I donât think the  situation that we're finding is due to any questions about the quality of the staff. Sir David Behan Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir David Behan tells Drivetime with John Beattie that another nine residents were self-isolating. Three had recovered. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab leads the UK government briefing A further 693 coronavirus deaths have been recorded across the UK, taking the total to 29,427, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says. Until today, Italy had been the European country with the highest number of deaths - and the second in the world (after the US). But with 29,315 people to have lost their lives to coronavirus - compared to the UK's 29,427 - it has slipped into third place. Follow live updates here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Labour's Monica Lennon has called for Covid-19 social care response plans to be published in light of the high number of cases in care homes. Ms Lennon also backed calls for an investigation into the Skye care home. She said: ""We can't leave care home providers and staff to fend for themselves. What we're seeing is an absolute tragedy. ""But my fear is that when we're going to look back and do the inquiries and do the investigations we're going to find that many of these deaths could have been prevented."" A Scottish government statement said employers have a responsibility to ensure protections are in place, while testing of care home staff remains a priority.

""We're all desperately
waiting for news about when things will be lifted and definitely today we found
out it will be no time soon,"" the professor of public health at Edinburgh University tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""We have been given signs of what things might change in the
future, but I think what the government was trying to communicate is that the
risks are still too high to see changes any time soon."" Prof Bauld thinks the first change will be permitting people to do more outdoors, such as exercising more than once a day or talking to people outside the household as long as not coming
into close contact with them. She thinks the next step will be the ability to visit other households and meet in small groups outdoors while also focusing on getting ""the NHS back up and running"" on treatments other than Covid-19.

Government pays nearly quarter of worker wagesProgramme to help people put on leave due to coronavrius is now being used by 6.3 million people.,"The government is now paying the wages for nearly a quarter of UK jobs under a programme aimed at helping people put on leave due to the virus pandemic. About 2.5 million people registered last week for the scheme, bringing the total claims to 6.3 million - 23% of the employed workforce. The job retention scheme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month. Separately, the Department of Work and Pensions reported another 1.8 million new Universal Credit claims. The spike in the numbers of people seeking assistance comes as the world braces for the most severe economic crisis since the 1930s. Forecasts suggest the UK economy will contract 6.5% or more this year. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than 140,000 firms claim wage bill help Salary subsidy scheme extended into June ""The 6.3 million jobs being furloughed shows in stark terms the scale of the economic shutdown that Britain is living through,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. ""If this kind of volume of workers stay on the scheme for several months the cost will run into the tens of billions of pounds And that is a cost very much worth paying."" The Government said about 800,000 employers have reported furloughing workers since 20 April, when the programme started. It said it had distributed Â£8bn so far, with an average payout of Â£1,269 - about half of the Â£2,500 maximum. The scheme is due to run through June, suggesting the total cost could exceed Â£30bn. Some business groups have urged the government to extend the scheme, in which the state covers up to 80% of pay for workers put on leave due to the virus. However, in a television interview, Chancellor Rishi Sunak sounded a cautionary note, saying that level of expenditure was ""not sustainable"". ""I am working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way,"" he said. ""But as some scenarios have suggested we are potentially spending as much on the furlough scheme as we do on the [National Health Service] for example. Now clearly that is not a sustainable solution.""

New UK car registrations drastically fall in April,"New car registrations almost ground to a halt in April after coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced, the motor industry has said. Figures from industry body the SMMT show only 4,321 cars were registered, the lowest monthly level since 1946. April's figure marked a 97% plunge in sales from the same month last year. The closure of car dealerships as part of measures to try to combat the disease has hit consumer registrations. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that of the registrations made last month, 70% were by companies buying for their fleets. The cars would most likely have been on order before the lockdown, said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. ""If you are told to close all your car showrooms for the entirety of April it's no surprise sales are almost non-existent,"" he told the BBC. Many of the 4,000 cars sold last month were needed to support key workers and for those who had a pressing need for them, an SMMT spokesman said. Those cars would not have been bought from dealerships, but instead, for example, from wholesalers, or directly from manufacturers. The 4,000 figure for April compares to 161,064 new cars that were registered in same month last year. New UK car registrations plunge by more than 40% BMW, Honda and Toyota suspend UK car production Nissan extends Sunderland plant production pause The industry body said it now expects 1.68 million new car registrations in 2020 compared with 2.3 million in 2019. Staff at some UK car manufacturers began returning to work this week, although the start of full production is a long way off, Mr Hawes said. The supply chain is also starting to re-open. ""Manufacturers are trying to figure out how to start operations in a safe environment,"" he said. ""But it will be slow and production will be ramped up very slowly."" The coronavirus crisis has come at what was already a difficult time for the motor industry, which had been struggling with falling sales and a collapse in demand for diesel vehicles, while struggling to meet tough new emissions targets. The figures are certainly dramatic, expected to be the lowest sales since February 1946. But since virtually the entire motor industry ground to a halt when the lockdown was introduced, they are not entirely unexpected. What matters now is what happens when the restrictions are eased and customers are allowed back into the showrooms. You would expect there to be some pent-up demand - after all, dealerships began to close in mid-March, traditionally one of the strongest months of the year for new car sales. However, since then harsh economic realities have come into play. Huge swathes of the workforce have been furloughed, and the signs are the country is heading into a deep recession. Under those circumstances, with so much uncertainty and so many jobs at risk, how many people will really be willing to buy a new car? We can expect a wave of incentive programmes - and quite possibly a wave of new scrappage schemes - as car companies start fighting tooth and nail for every single sale. The coronavirus outbreak also halted car production. All of the UK's major car factories suspended work in March, and it is not yet clear when they will reopen. Ian Plummer, commercial director at online marketplace Auto Trader, said: ""With retailers forced to close the doors to their physical forecourts, it'll come as no surprise to anyone to see just how dramatic an impact it's had on the new car market. ""Some brands have been able to sell remotely, but uncertainty in the government's guidelines or a lack of the required infrastructure to operate home delivery in a safe way, has limited it to all but a handful of retailers."" However, he said Auto Trader data indicated that the market had been paused, rather than stopped. He added that there would be a chance ""for the industry to accelerate the adoption of low emission vehicles"" when restrictions lift. ""However, it'll be essential for manufacturers to push more electric vehicles into their UK networks along with greater financial incentives,"" such as scrappage schemes, he said.

World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fightMore than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) are pledged to help develop a vaccine and fund research into treatments.,"Scientists in Beijing carrying out one of dozens of research projects into potential vaccines More than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) has been pledged to help develop a coronavirus vaccine and fund research into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Some 40 countries and donors took part in an online summit hosted by the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the money would help kickstart unprecedented global co-operation. She said it showed the true value of unity and humanity, but warned much more would be needed in the days ahead. In total, more than 30 countries, along with UN and philanthropic bodies and research institutes, made donations. Donors also included pop singer Madonna, who pledged â¬1m ($1.1m), said Ms von der Leyen, who set outthe Brussels-led initiative,externalon Friday. The European Commission pledged $1bn to fund research on a vaccine.  Norway matched the European Commission's contribution, and France has pledged â¬500m, as have Saudi Arabia and Germany.  Japan pledged more than $800m. The US and Russia did not take part.  China, where the virus originated in December, was represented by its ambassador to the European Union. Of the money raised, $4.4bn will go on vaccine development, some $2bn on the search for a treatment and $1.6bn for producing tests, the EU said. In her opening remarks at the summit, Ms von der Leyen said everyone must chip in to finance ""a truly global endeavour"". ""I believe 4 May will mark a turning point in our fight against coronavirus because today the world is coming together,"" she said. ""The partners are many, the goal is one: to defeat this virus."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another co-host of the conference, said the ""more we pull together"" in sharing expertise, ""the faster our scientists will succeed"" in developing a vaccine. Mr Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with Covid-19, was to confirm the UK's pledge of Â£388m for vaccine research, testing and treatment during the conference. Along with the European Commission, the conference is being co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, pictured last year, are among the world leaders who signed the letter Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are also among those who have signed up to the initiative. In the open letter published in weekend newspapers, the leaders said the funds raised would ""kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals"". ""If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st Century,"" they added. At the same time, the signatories gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism of its handling of the outbreak. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The UN says a return to normal life will only be possible with a vaccine. Dozens of research projects trying to find a vaccine are currently under way across the world. Even with more financial commitment, it will take time to know which ones might work and how well. Most experts think it could take until mid-2021, about 12-18 months after the new virus first emerged, for a vaccine to become available.

Black author makes Pulitzer Prize historyThe awards - postponed for the coronavirus - were first held just a year before the Spanish Flu.US & Canada,"Author Colson Whitehead has won his second Pulitzer Prize for fiction US author Colson Whitehead has become only the fourth writer ever to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction twice. The African-American author was honoured for The Nickel Boys, which chronicles the abuse of black boys at a juvenile reform school in Florida. Whitehead, a 50-year-old New Yorker, won the 2017 prize in the same category for his book The Underground Railroad. Before him, only Booth Tarkington, William Faulkner and John Updike had won the Pulitzer for fiction twice. The 2020 awards, postponed for several weeks due to the coronavirus, were announced remotely this year in the living room of Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy. She noted that the first Pulitzers were awarded in 1917, less than a year before the outbreak of the Spanish Flu. They are among the highest honours for US-based journalists and authors. Whitehead has previously said he grew up wanting to be the black version of horror writer Stephen King. His Nickel Boys was inspired by the real-life horror story of the Dozier School for Boys in the Florida panhandle, where children convicted of minor offences were subjected to violent abuse. The Harvard graduate's novel was praised by the Pulitzer committee for its ""spare and devastating exploration of abuse at a reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida that is ultimately a powerful tale of human perseverance, dignity and redemption"". The New York Times newspaper topped the list of publications for journalism honours with three awards, including the prestigious investigative reporting prize for Brian Rosenthal's expose of New York City's taxi industry, showing how predatory lenders exploited vulnerable drivers.

In collaboration with ProPublica, the Anchorage Daily News won what is widely regarded as the most coveted Pulitzer, for public service journalism, in recognition of its work on the lack of police coverage in many small towns in Alaska. The honour for breaking news photography went to staff at Reuters news agency for their images of last year's Hong Kong protests. And, for the first time in its history, the Pulitzer committee bestowed a prize in audio reporting, which was awarded to This American Life for its episode The Out Crowd, which examined US President Donald Trump's policy requiring thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. The episode was a collaboration with Molly O'Toole of the Los Angeles Times and Emily Green of Vice News, who will also share the prize. A posthumous special citation was awarded to African-American civil rights activist and early champion of investigative journalism Ida B Wells, who died in 1931, for her ""outstanding and courageous reporting"" on lynching. The citation comes with a donation of at least $50,000 (Â£40,100) in support of Ms Wells' mission, with recipients to be announced. ""It goes without saying that today we announce the Pulitzer winners in deeply challenging times,"" Ms Canedy said on Monday.

"Coronavirus: Calls to shut down 'dirty fur trade'Mink have caught Covid-19, adding to the list of infected animals, and prompting calls for trade bans.Science & Environment","Tens of millions of animals are farmed for their fur around the world, including raccoon dogs Mink have contracted coronavirus, adding to the list of animals known to be at risk of catching the virus. Mink at two fur farms in the Netherlands tested positive for Covid-19 a week ago. And last month, it was revealed that lions and tigers at a New York zoo had caught the disease from their keepers. Coronavirus could be ""catastrophic"" for endangered wildlife and we must act now to protect them, said Dr Peta Hitchens of the University of Melbourne. This includes thorough regulation of wildlife trade and trafficking, as well as protection of ecosystems where human encroachment and destruction ""has resulted in increased interactions between us and wild animals"". Mink farmers are on alert for signs of the diseases It's not surprising that mink have been infected, she added. The list of mammal species infected during the 2003 Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak numbers at least 16, including mink, palm civets, fruit bats, several species of horseshoe bat, red fox, wild boar, raccoon dog, and domestic cats and dogs. Coronavirus: Calls to protect great apes from threat of infection Coronavirus: Great apes on lockdown over threat of disease. Officials in The Netherlands believe mink contracted the illness from farm workers and the farms have since been put into quarantine. The creation of new mink farms was banned there in 2013, while existing mink fur farms have until 2024 to close. Animal rights organisation Peta has written a letter to ministers calling for the farms to be shut down immediately: ""Allowing mink farms to maintain business as usual for nearly four more years - in the face of a global crisis stemming from animal exploitation - would be inexcusable from the perspective of both the risk posed to humans and the harm inflicted on the mink themselves."" Rabbit farming is big business in China Animal protection charity Humane Society International, which campaigns for a global end to the fur trade, has warned of the risk in other countries, where tens of millions of mink, fox, raccoon dogs, chinchillas and rabbits are farmed. Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International/UK, said in addition to animal suffering, the potential for disease spread is another reason for all fashion companies to go fur-free and for governments to shut down ""this dirty trade"". ""One of the lessons we must learn from Covid-19 is that we cannot carry on pushing animals to the limit of their endurance without serious consequences for both animal and human health,"" she said. ""We urge the Netherlands and other countries in the process of phasing out fur farming to speed up their industry closures, and countries yet to commit to bans, including China and Finland, to do so now."" A spokesperson for the British Fur Trade Association said: ""The case in the Netherlands demonstrates the efficiency of fur farming bio security measures in Europe and the rigorous controls that are in place. The Dutch authorities confirm that there is no further spread of the virus and that the risk of onward transmission is negligible. "" According to a 2016 report released by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, 75% of China's wildlife trade is dominated by fur production with animals farmed for their fur, such as raccoon dogs, foxes and mink, often ending up at wildlife wet market.

"'Huge gaps' in draft coronavirus workplace rulesThe leader of the TUC says she cannot recommend the government's draft advice ""in its current form"".UKComments","Draft guidance for getting people back to work during the coronavirus pandemic could compromise worker safety, the head of the TUC has warned. Frances O'Grady, who leads the group representing UK unions, said it cannot back the advice in its ""current form"". She said there were ""huge gaps"" over protective kit and testing. Reduced hot-desking and alternatives to social distancing where it is not possible are among measures being considered by the government. The document, seen by the BBC, is one of seven draft plans to ease anti-virus restrictions. It also urges employers to minimise numbers using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working. The guidance covers the whole of the UK - but the devolved governments have the power to make their own decisions on how businesses can get back to work.

Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK stands at 28,734, an increase of 288, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at the Downing Street briefing. The health secretary outlined the coronavirus contact-tracing app at the Downing Street briefing The daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said. A total of 13,258 people are currently being treated in hospital, while 85,186 coronavirus tests took place on Sunday. However, hospital admissions have fallen, along with the number of critical care beds being used. A coronavirus contact-tracing app aimed at limiting a second wave of coronavirus willbe trialled on the Isle of Wight this week, before being rolled out more widely in the UK, as part of the government's test, track and trace effort.

Frances O'Grady is general secretary of the TUC which represents many UK trade unions She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""The problem is the government is asking us to trust to employer discretion, use words like 'consider social distancing', 'consider having hand sanitiser or soap available', and frankly that's just not good enough."" Asked whether the government's current advice will compromise worker safety, Ms O'Grady said No 10 has time to ""get this right"" and it should work with unions to ensure ""a proper job"" and ""not a botched job"". According to one of the seven draft documents seen by the BBC, firms are told to enact additional hygiene procedures, as well as physical screens, and protective equipment should be considered where maintaining distancing of 2m (6ft) between workers is impossible. However, the section marked personal protective equipment (PPE) contains only a promise that ""more detail"" will follow. During the Downing Street briefing, BBC health editor Hugh Pym asked where those businesses required to have PPE for their staff would source it, and whether they would be in competition with the NHS. Mr Hancock said the ""first call"" on PPE must be for NHS and social care staff, as well as those ""essential services who need it to keep the people delivering those services safe"". He reiterated PPE was one of the government's five tests for adjusting the lockdown. The BBC has also seen a second document with advice for the hospitality industry, which says bar areas, seated restaurants and cafe areas must be closed, with all food and drink outlets serving takeaway food only. It adds hotels should consider ""room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories"". It also says ""guidance to follow"" on the use of PPE and face masks. Some of the other guidance featured in the document includes: Allowing access to as few people as possible into kitchens Spacing workstations 2m apart as much as possible Minimising contact between kitchen and food preparation workers and delivery drivers or riders for example by having zones from which delivery drivers can collect packaged food items Using front of house staff to serve customers in walk-in takeaways, with tills 2m away from the kitchen and ideally separated by a wall or partition Creating a physical barrier, such as a screen, between front of house workers and customers where possible Asking customers to order online, on apps or over the telephone to reduce queues and stagger pick-up times Providing handwashing and hand sanitisers and encourage visitors to wash their hands regularly Considering room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories. Taking measures to avoid crowded reception areas, staggering check-in and check-out times Boris Johnson is to reveal a ""roadmap"" out of lockdown on Sunday, but in a video message on Monday he said the the UK must not lift restrictions too soon. In the video,posted on Twitter,external, Mr Johnson said: ""The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus."" Mr Johnson said the UK would only be able to move on to ""the second phase of this conflict"" when the government'sfive testshad been met, including a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak which could overwhelm the health service. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March, in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. Ministers are obliged to review those restrictions by Thursday. London's NHS Nightingale was built in just nine days Meanwhile, London's NHS Nightingale hospitalis expected not to admit any new patients and be placed on standby in the coming days. The ExCel Centre was turned into a 4,000-bed facility to increase the NHS's capacity for treating patients with Covid-19. In a briefing to staff, the hospital's chief executive said it was ""likely"" the hospital would not need to admit patients in the coming days while the virus remained under control in London. The BBC understands fewer than 20 people are currently being treated there.

First workers to trial NHS virus tracing app,"Social distancing rules will still be in place during the trial, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said An NHS app that aims to track the spread of coronavirus is being rolled out for the first time, as part of a trial on the Isle of Wight. Council and healthcare workers will be the first to try the contact-tracing app, with the rest of the island able to download it from Thursday. If the trial is successful, it could be available nationwide within weeks. Concerns have been raised over privacy, though ministers say the app has been designed with this ""front of mind"". The app aims to quickly trace recent contacts of anyone who tests positive for the virus. It is part of the government's strategy for coming out of lockdown, which aims to have widespread testing and contact tracing in place to monitor and reduce any future outbreaks. If the trial is successful, the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas called for a ""national consensus"" on tackling the viruswhen the UK begins to move out of lockdown. It comes as the the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK reached 28,734, an increase of 288. The daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said. The new app - published on Apple and Google's app stores - works by using a Bluetooth connection. It records when two people who have the app are within a certain distance of each other for longer than a specified amount of time. If one of those people later reports having symptoms, all the other app users they came into significant contact with over recent days will be alerted and, if judged necessary, told to self-isolate. ""The exact advice on what you should do will depend on the evolving context and approach,"" the NHS has said. Read more here. Mr Hancock urged everyone on the Isle of Wight to download the app when it was available to them. Social distancing rules would still be in place during the trial, he said. ""By downloading the app, you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community,"" he said. ""Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows."" The island was chosen for the trial because it has a lower number of new infections, is covered by a single NHS trust and because travel to and from the island is quite restricted. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the app would be an ""incredibly important part"" of the fight against the virus and the more people who downloaded it, the more lockdown restrictions could be eased. This video can not be played Matt Hancock said Isle of Wight residents using the app ""will be saving lives"" Sir Keir said he hoped the app would be successful but questioned whether take-up would be high enough. ""I am a bit concerned that a similar app in Singapore only had, I think, something like a 20% take-up rate in the public,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Labour leader added that traditional methods of tracing, for example phoning people, would have to be used alongside the technology. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:What is the UK's track and trace strategy? The ""centralised"" model of the app -  meaning there is a central computer server which works out which phones have matched - has raised some privacy concerns. This is different to the ""decentralised"" model used by Apple and Google, where the matches take place on users' handsets. Some have argued a ""centralised"" approach gives the app advantages, for example by making it easier to spot hotspots where the disease is spreading. But others say a central system increases the risk from potential hackers. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown Law professor Orla Lynskey said the option on the app for users to opt in and share their location data ""poses a big risk"". But NHSX - the part of the health service that developed the app - said the app will be voluntary, and the only personal data stored by the app at the start would be the first part of the user's postcode. Additional location data will only be recorded if users agree to a further opt-in request, NHSX added. Mr Hancock said the software was ""designed with privacy and security front of mind"". He said the data was stored on the phone and only sent to the NHS when someone needs a test. Users will be asked to enter the first part of their postcode but not their name or other personal details The UK's""test, track and trace"" strategyhas seen testing be scaled up over the last month, following Mr Hancock's pledge to reach 100,000 tests by the end of April. The UK passed the target,providing more than 122,000 testson the last day of April.Latest figures show,externalthere were 85,186 tests on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which has been advising the government on the pandemic,has published some of the evidence which informed its guidance,external. The documents cover the group's meetings up to 14 April. Among the papers published by Sage is one from a meeting on 2 April, which suggests lockdown restrictions should be eased ""very gradually"" to avoid measures needing to be reintroduced, which could undermine public trust. In other developments: Trade unionshave warned draft government guidelines for getting people back to workcould compromise employees' safety Mr Hancock said the issue of maintaining social distancing on flights was a ""really difficult question"" and safety ""has got to come first"".
