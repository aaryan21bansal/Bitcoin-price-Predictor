Investigation into fatal train derailment begins,"Family tributes have been paid to Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury The families of three men killed in a train derailment in Aberdeenshire have told of their devastation at their deaths. Train driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and a passenger now named as Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died in the incident near Stonehaven. A major investigation has begun into the derailment, believed to have been caused by a landslip after heavy rain. Mr Stuchbury, from Aberdeen, worked for a marine services firm in the city. In a statement his family said: ""Chris was a much adored husband, son, dad, stepdad, grandad, brother and uncle and was a treasured and loved friend to many."" What we know about the Stonehaven derailment Three dead after passenger train derails Mr Stuchbury worked for Targe Towing and volunteered at Roxburghe House hospice in Aberdeen in his spare time. Earlier, the family of Mr McCullough described how his death had left a ""huge void"" in their lives. His wife Stephanie said: ""Words cannot describe the utterly devastating effect of Brett's death on his family and friends. ""We have lost a wonderful husband, father and son in the most awful of circumstances. ""Brett was the most decent and loving human being we have ever known and his passing leaves a huge void in all our lives. ""We would like to thank the emergency services for their heroic efforts in helping everyone affected by this tragedy and for all the messages of support and condolence we have received."" Investigation work continues at the scene of the derailment The 45-year-old father-of-three was originally from Bromley in London. He worked out of the Aberdeen rail depot and lived near the scene of the derailment. The third victim was 58-year-old conductor Donald Dinnie, whose family said they were devastated by the loss of a ""loving and proud dad, son, partner, brother, uncle and friend"". ""No words could ever describe how much he will be missed by us all and there will always be a missing piece in our hearts,"" they said in a statement. ""It is so heart warming to see how many people have fond memories of Donald and I am sure they have plenty of happy and funny stories to tell. He was a kind, caring and genuine person who was never found without a smile on his face. We know he will be deeply missed by all."" Mr Dinnie had also worked as a driver and guard during his railway career. It is thought that the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street service was derailed by a landslide afterheavy rainin the area. The alarm was raised at about 09:40 on Wednesday morning. Six others who were on the train were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. NHS Grampian said four of them had been discharged, while the other two patients were in a stable condition. A section of the train fell down a steep embankment Emergency services remained at the scene of the accident on Thursday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ""hearts of a nation"" were with those affected. Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines all visited the site of the crash on Thursday. Mr Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September on the ""wider issues"" that may have led to the derailment. He said he wanted to see resilience checks carried out in ""the next few days, few hours"", given the concern about flash floods in the area. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Stonehaven derailment site is ""completely harrowing"" ""We absolutely need to make sure it doesn't happen again and that's why I've asked Network Rail to deliver that report to me so quickly,"" he said. He also said he spoke with PC Liam Mercer, the first officer on the scene, and commended him for his bravery. And he understood an off-duty conductor managed to get off a carriage and run to alert operators, while a member of the public raised the alarm having seen smoke billowing from the trees. Mr Matheson said he did not want to speculate about what had caused the incident. ""What I think we can assess, though, is that weather has had an impact,"" he said. Mr Matheson visited Aberdeenshire on Thursday morning ""We are seeing increasingly a higher level of what are localised intense weather events that are having an impact on the transport network, including the rail network. ""What we need to do as part of the investigation is identify to what extent it had an impact and also to see what lessons can be learned."" He said some parts of the country had seen a month's rainfall in just a couple of hours on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. He added that the derailment happened as the train driver was heading north, trying to return to Aberdeen, and that one crew member got out of the derailed train to prevent any other trains coming down the track. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Mr Haines said he did not want to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation. But he added: ""It is clear the weather was appalling and there were floods and landslips in the area. ""Our climate is changing and it is increasingly challenging the performance and reliability of the railway, but incidents like yesterday's devastating accident are incredibly rare, and our railway remains the safest major railway in Europe. ""Yesterday was a tragedy, a truly horrific event, and my thoughts remain with everyone affected. Understanding what happened is the key to making sure it never occurs again."" Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. It will be carried out under the direction of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and will run in parallel to the independent safety investigation being carried out by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.

A-level results to arrive in year with no exams,"This year's exams were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic There is anger among schools, colleges and students, after nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded on Thursday were lower than teachers' predictions. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades, in results after exams were cancelled by the pandemic. School and college leaders are calling for a review and say all fees for appeals should be waived. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"". The overall results, across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, show record highs for A* and A grades. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said he had heard from a number of colleges where more than half of their school-assessment grades have been adjusted downwards following moderation. Paul Whiteman leader of the heads' union  NAHT said: ""The government must make sure that there is no financial barrier to a school or college making an appeal."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""While there had been an overall increase in top grades, there was a ""great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level."" He said students felt grades had been pulled down ""in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable"". This video can not be played How does the class of 2020 feel about finishing college during a pandemic? He called on the government and exams watchdog Ofqual to review the moderation process in England ""as a matter of urgency"". ""We would warn them against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well. ""This results day must have been an absolute nightmare for many schools, colleges, and young people - it is a shambles."" For the top  A* and A grades, independent schools in England saw the greatest improvement on last year - up 4.7 percentage points. This compares with a 1.7, 2 and 0.3 percentage points improvement for top grades for England's academies, comprehensives and colleges respectively. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said pupils would be able to sit exams if they feel they could have done better. ""Where pupils are disappointed, where they feel that they could have done better, where they feel that there's an injustice been done to them, there is the possibility of appeal and they can re-sit, they can take a re-sit this autumn as well."" What's next in the arguments over exam results? A third of NI A-level grades lower than predicted 'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades lowered Will the exam 'triple lock' affect me? And other questions ""But looking at the big picture, I think overall we've got a very robust set of grades, plus you've got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the ""majority of young people will have received a calculated grade today that enables them to progress to the destination they deserve, with the added safety net of being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Something has obviously gone horribly wrong with this year's exam results. ""Nearly 40% of young people have had their grades marked down and that's thousands of young people whose opportunities could have been dashed."" Many students went back into school or college to receive their results The exam results show: for A-levels: 9% of entries were A* (up from 7.8% in 2019) 27.9% were A* and A (up from 25.5% in 2019) these are the highest ever levels of A* and As - up from a previous high of 27% in 2011 78.4% of entries were A*-C (up from 75.8% in 2019) Psychology now the second most popular subject, after maths girls outperform boys, except in A*s in England, the moderation means that 36% of results have been lowered by one grade, 3% by two grades, 2% have increased there will be 25,000 university courses available in clearing, including 4,500 in top Russell Group universities for vocational qualifications, the Department for Education says results ""broadly in line with previous years"" The proportion of entries getting an A* or A grade is at a record high this year - with the 27.9% above the previous highest of 27% in 2011. And there are increases in those getting A* to C - as the exam regulator had promised a more lenient approach. At Wilberforce Sixth Form College in Hull, while some students were celebrating, others were very disappointed. Abbi is one of those students who is not happy with her results, saying she had missed out on her place at Durham University to study engineering. She said she would now have to consider retakes or finding a clearing place at another university. ""It seems like some unfair grading. When I opened them I had a bit of a cry,"" she told the BBC. Abbi's grades mean she has missed out on a place to study engineering at Durham University ""My future has been set back completely,"" she said. ""I had my heart set on Durham and it's now not an option for clearing because there's no clearing for my course."" ""I would have happily sat the exams but it was up to the government,"" she said, adding that she was angry her results had been affected by something out of her control. BTec students 'hopeful for the future' Students warn that using mocks 'makes mockery' of exams Exam rituals put on hold this year In Wales students promised no A-levels lower than AS-level grades Scottish pupils to have exam results upgraded Principal Colin Peaks said he had never seen ""such a negative feeling"" on results day in all his years of teaching. Mr Peaks said there was ""something worrying across the board"", with many good students not getting the grades they would have expected. ""The anomalies within the system aren't right - I'm seeing anomalies across the piece that do not make sense to me."" He said basing results, in part, on last year's students' results was wrong because ""they're different"". ""We are going to see lots of appeals,"" he added. Students taking vocational exams have been getting estimated results over recent weeks - with more than 250,000 receiving their grades in BTec and Cambridge Technical qualifications which are equivalent to A-levels and strong GCSE passes. The Department for Education says vocational results are ""broadly in line with previous years"". Brenda Irabor from Ark Academy in Brixton, south London, achieved three A* grades Figures from the admissions service, Ucas, show that more students have been accepted onto UK degree courses this year. Among UK applicants, 358,860 have been accepted - a 2.9% rise compared with 2019. Of these, 316,730 have been accepted on to their first choice, up 2.7% on the same point last year. Clearing is an increasingly popular route for students to find a degree course, with leading universities among those offering last-minute places through the system, Ucas said. By Sean Coughlan, education correspondent This is a strange year for A-level results in every way, with grades arriving for exams that were never taken. In more usual times the headlines would have been about this being a record year for top grades - with almost 28% getting A*s or As. But instead this has been an exam results day full of uncertainty, with head teachers warning about volatility below the surface of rising grades. Almost two out of every five results were lower than the grades predicted by their teachers - and heads are warning of a confusing pattern of where results have gone down. But, at the same time, those trying to get to university might find that they're able to get in with lower grades than in previous years, with the promise of ""super-flexible"" admissions. The confusion extends to what happens next. Because for those getting bad news today, it could still be good news through the appeals process. Have you got your A-level or BTec results today?

Three dead after passenger train derails,"This video can not be played Aerial footage: passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Three people, including the driver and a conductor, have died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire. The third victim was a passenger, ScotRail has confirmed. It is thought the train hit a landslide after heavy rain and thunderstorms which causedflooding and travel disruptionacross Scotland. A major incident was declared and about 30 emergency service vehicles were called to the scene. It involved the 06:38 ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street. Six people have been taken to hospital but their injuries are not believed to be serious. Latest updates on the derailment British Transport Police said the families of the driver and the conductor had been informed and were being supported by specially-trained liaison officers. The derailment took place on the line west of Stonehaven Ch Supt Eddie Wylie said it was believed that all passengers had been accounted for. He added: ""Once the area has been made safe then a full and thorough search will be conducted, which is likely to take some time. ""I know many people will understandably have questions and we will be working closely alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and the Office of Rail and Road to establish the full circumstances of how the train came to derail."" The RMT union said that confirmation of the three deaths, including one of its conductor members, was ""the most dreadful news"". Senior assistant general secretary Mick Lynch added the union's thoughts ""were with the families, colleagues and friends of those who have lost their lives in this tragedy."" Early indications are that the heavy rain could have been the main factor in causing today's crash in Aberdeenshire. One rail industry source says the 06:38 service from Aberdeen to Glasgow was initially halted because of flooding on the line. The driver apparently contacted control to ask permission to switch tracks. It's believed the train reversed and switched to clearer tracks and then continued on its route to Glasgow. Then it is thought the train hit a landslide and derailed. However, this initial, unconfirmed version of events should now be closely examined by the UK's Rail Accident Investigation Branch. Its job is to establish all the facts. The train's computer systems should show key indicators like the speed it was travelling at when it left the track. In recent years incidents like this on the UK's railways have become incredibly rare. The last major derailment was in 2007 in Cumbria. The Queen issued a message of condolence following the crash, saying ""it was with great sadness that I heard of the train derailment"". Her Majesty said the entire Royal Family ""join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who have died and those who have been injured"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the loved ones of those who lost their lives in the ""tragic incident"". ""My thoughts remain with everyone affected,"" she said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC the crash was especially shocking because ""these accidents on the railways are thankfully so rare"". ""Our thoughts are very much with those who have lost their lives and their families and, of course, those that have been injured in the derailment,"" he added. ""Clearly the most important thing now is that the British Transport Police, who are in charge of the investigation, find out exactly what happened and we all work together to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."" The train which derailed was made up of two locomotives - at the front and back - and four carriages. Network Rail has reviewed CCTV footage from the stations at which the service stopped and it's believed there were nine people, including crew, on the train. British Transport Police said its officers had been called to the scene at about 09:43. A few minutes later, Network Rail tweeted that there had been reports of a landslip at Carmont and that services between Dundee and Aberdeen had been halted. The chief executive of Network Rail, Andrew Haines, is cutting short his family holiday in Italy to fly back to the UK. Emergency services at the scene of the derailment Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would visit the site on Thursday ""to try to understand the situation first hand and offer every possible assistance"". NHS Grampian confirmed it was on a ""major incident footing"", and ScotRail said it was assisting the emergency services. The RMT union's Mick Lynch said: ""The facts behind this âincident will need to be established in due course, but at this stage we are focussed on support and assistance and our thoughts are with all those impacted by this tragedy."" This video can not be played Several fire and ambulance crews were called to the scene near Stonehaven Kevin Lindsay, Scotland organiser for the Aslef train drivers union, said: ""Our thoughts tonight are with all those who died, and who were injured, in the tragic accident. ""While it is too early to speculate about the causes of the crash, it would seem that the appalling weather conditions in the area - the torrential rain - resulted in a landslip which, in turn, caused the train to derail."" He added that the train had caught fire after rolling down a steep embankment. Aberdeenshire Provost and Mearns councillor Bill Howatson said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. This is a harrowing time for all concerned."" Meanwhile four firefighters were injured while responding the derailment. BBC Scotland understands they suffered minor injuries after a vehicle collided with them. Two of the firefighters were admitted to hospital as a precautionary measure but were released shortly afterwards. It's long been recognised that landslips are one of the greatest risks to Britain's railways and that a changing climate will make them more likely. Heatwaves and droughts can dry out the steep embankments beside the tracks, and over the years will start to weaken them. Add to that the effects of heavy rain, of the kind seen just now in Scotland, saturating and eroding the soil, and undermining its strength. And with rising global temperatures set to bring extremes of weather never anticipated by the Victorian engineers who built the lines, Network Rail has been studying how best to keep the tracks safe. But it admits that ""we know we can't rebuild every mile of railway"". The most recent multiple fatalities on the UK's railways were in South Wales in 2019, when two railway workers died after being struck by a Great Western train near Port Talbot. They were working without a lookout. In November 2004, an intercity train travelling on the Reading and Taunton line hit a car on a level crossing, derailing a train and killing seven people and injuring more than 70 others. In May 2002, an east coast main line train derailed because of an undetected points failure. Coaches rolled and came to rest on platforms. Seven people were killed and 76 injured. In February 2001, 10 people were killed in the Great Heck Rail Crash near Selby when a train struck a Land Rover that had rolled onto the track because the driver had fallen asleep, and was derailed into the path of another train. In October 1999, at Ladbroke Grove in London, 31 people were killed in a head-on collision after a driver passed a signal. Are you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

European countries fight coronavirus surge,"Germany has recorded its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in more than three months Germany has recorded its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in more than three months as European countries struggle to curb a surge in infections. More than 1,200 cases were reported in Germany in the past 24 hours. Officials said the rise was due, in part, to people returning from holidays. It came as Germany warned against non-essential trips to parts of Spain. Meanwhile, France had 2,524 new cases in 24 hours, the highest daily rise since its lockdown was lifted in May. The German foreign ministry said it had added a partial travel warning to the Spanish capital Madrid and the Basque region on Tuesday amid rising infections there. Warnings were already in place for the regions of Aragon, Catalonia and Navarra. Germany has recorded more than 9,000 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began. Spain is facing the worst coronavirus infection rate in Western Europe.  It recorded 1,418 new infections in its latest daily count on Tuesday and said there were 675 ""active outbreaks"" in the country. Salvador Macip, an expert in health sciences at Catalonia's Open University, told AFP news agency the country was at a ""critical moment"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? What are the rules in France and other parts of Europe? ""We are right at a point where things can get better or worse. This means we have to pull out all the stops to curb outbreaks before they become more serious,"" he said. In total, Spain has recorded more than 326,000 cases - the highest number in Western Europe and the 11th highest in the world. Wearing a face mask became compulsory in all public areas in Brussels on Wednesday amid a rise in cases. The order applies to those aged 12 and above. People were previously only required to wear masks in crowded public spaces and enclosed areas of the Belgian capital, such as shopping centres. Authorities said the enhanced rules were introduced because of a rise in infections, with Brussels recording an average of 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per day over the past week. Police checks are being ramped up to ensure that people follow the new rules. The mask-wearing regulation is one of the strictest currently in place in Europe. Belgium has recorded more than 75,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 9,800 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. This year'sParis marathon has been cancelledas France battles a spike in coronavirus cases, organisers said on Wednesday. The marathon was originally due to take place on 5 April but was then postponed to 15 November because of the pandemic. Organisers said they had ""tried everything to maintain the event"" but felt ""obliged"" to call it off. ""There will be great disappointment among those who have sacrificed time training for what had become an autumn marathon,"" they said. Organisers are now working on the 2021 marathon. The announcement came afterParis became the latest French city to make face masks compulsoryin busy outdoor areas. Face masks were already compulsory nationwide in enclosed public spaces. A government spokesman on Wednesday said France would gradually ramp up police checks to ensure that people were respecting social distancing and wearing masks where required. ""We're at a tipping point... We're going to mobilise polices forces to make checks,"" Gabriel Attal told journalists. France has now recorded a total of 206,696 cases of the virus. On Wednesday Greece reported 262 new cases of coronavirus, its highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic. The country has now had 216 deaths and 6,177 cases in total. As a result of the increase in infections in recent weeks, authorities have introduced a curfew for restaurants and bars in some of the country's top tourist destinations - despite this being the peak of the tourism season. They have also enforced restrictions on arrivals from several EU countries and Balkans nations. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Second Belarus protester dies as UN sounds alarm,"Belarusian police have been accused of using violence against protesters A protester has died in Belarus in police custody, the second death since clashes with police erupted on Sunday over a disputed presidential election. Officials say the cause of death of the 25-year-old man in Gomel is unclear. His mother says he had heart problems and was kept for hours in a police van. In Brest, police said they used live bullets when they came under attack. The UN has condemned the use of violence by authorities, as protests continued for a fourth night. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said police officers were reported to have used excessive force, firing rubber bullets and water cannons, and also throwing stun grenades. ""Reports suggest that more [than] approximately 6,000 people have been detained in the last three days, including bystanders, as well as minors, suggesting a trend of massive arrests in clear violation of international human rights standards,""Ms Bachelet said in a statement,external. ""Even more disturbing are the reports of ill-treatment during and after detention"", she added, calling for the release of all those unlawfully detained. State TV has shown some bruised detainees lined up and being asked if they intend to continue ""making revolution"". This video can not be played A BBC team in Minsk encountered violent scenes on Monday night At least 200 protesters have been wounded, some seriously. A BBC crew was also attacked by police on Tuesday evening. A demonstrator died during a protest in the capital Minsk on Monday. The Belarusian interior ministry alleged an explosive device had gone off in his hand. On Wednesday evening, more clashes were reported as protesters rallied again in Minsk and other Belarusian cities. The numbers on the streets appeared to be smaller that during previous nights. Shocked by violence, Belarusians lose their fear How messenger app bypassed Belarus news blackout Five things you might not know about Belarus Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure The protests erupted hours after Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, was declared the winner of Sunday's vote, which has been condemned by the EU as ""neither free nor fair"". The main opposition contender, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was then briefly held before being forced to leave for neighbouring Lithuania. The 25-year-old man died on Wednesday in the south-eastern city, the Belarusian Investigative Committee was quoted as saying by Belta news agency. Women in Minsk rallied on Wednesday in support of detained protesters The committee said the man had been arrested on Sunday and later sentenced to 10 days in prison for taking part in an illegal protest. He was taken to hospital when he started feeling unwell - but later died, the committee said. The incident is being investigated. The protester's mother told Radio Free Europe that her son had not taken part in any protests and was arrested as he was going to see his girlfriend. Mr Lukashenko won 80% of Sunday's vote, according to election officials, but there were widespread allegations of vote rigging. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Belarusians had shown ""the desire for democratic change"" in the election campaign. How protests shook up the election Sweden's foreign minister said EU foreign ministers would meet on Friday to discuss imposing sanctions on Belarus. Lithuania, Poland and Latvia said they were prepared to mediate, provided Belarusian authorities stopped violence against protesters, release detained demonstrators and form a national council with members of civil society. They warned that the alternative was sanctions. Alexander Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agreed the vote ""was not free and fair"", adding that the people ""should be given the freedoms that they are demanding"". Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier congratulated Mr Lukashenko on his victory, despite friction over accusations of a Russian plot which Mr Lukashenko has tried to link to the opposition. The leaders of China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Azerbaijan have sent messages of support. When Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, went to the electoral committee on Monday evening to complain about the results that gave her just 10% of the vote, she was detained for seven hours. By Tuesday morning she had arrived in Lithuania. She was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. She was one of three women who pooled their resources to spearhead the opposition. Veronika Tsepkalo fled Belarus on the day of the vote and Maria Kolesnikova remains in Belarus. According to an associate, Ms Tikhanovskaya had been escorted from the country by the authorities as part of a deal to allow the release of her campaign manager. This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: ""Not one life is worth what is happening now"" A second video later emerged that appeared to have been made during her detention. The images show her, head lowered, reading nervously from a script as she urges her supporters to ""obey the law"" and stay away from street protests. Ahead of Sunday's election, crowds flocked to opposition rallies, with Belarusians angered in part by the Lukashenko government's response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease.

'Hundreds dead' because of Covid-19 misinformation,"Facebook, Twitter and chat apps like WhatsApp have proved fertile ground for unfounded rumours about Covid-19 At least 800 people may have died around the world because of coronavirus-related misinformation in the first three months of this year, researchers say. A study published in theAmerican Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,externalalso estimates that about 5,800 people were admitted to hospital as a result of false information on social media. Many died from drinking methanol or alcohol-based cleaning products. They wrongly believing the products to be a cure for the virus. However, the actual figure may never been known, as data from Iran - where many of the supposed methanol poisoning deaths occurred - is difficult to verify. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said that the ""infodemic"" surrounding Covid-19 spread just as quickly as the virus itself, with conspiracy theories, rumours and cultural stigma all contributing to deaths and injuries. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? Harmful Covid-19 lies spread 'due to lack of laws' Virus disinformation leads to assaults, arson and deaths Many of the victims had followed advice resembling credible medical information - such as eating large amounts of garlic or ingesting large quantities of vitamins - as a way of preventing infection, the study's authors say. Others drank substances such as cow urine. These actions all had ""potentially serious implications"" on their health, the researchers say. The paper concludes that it is the responsibility of international agencies, governments and social media platforms to fight back against this ""infodemic"", but tech companies have been criticised for their slow and patchy response. In the UK, laws to regulate online harmmight be several years away. The BBC's own investigations foundlinks to assaults, arson and deaths as a result of misinformationabout the virus, and spoke to doctors, experts and victims about their experiences. Online rumours led to mob attacks in India and mass poisonings in Iran. Telecommunications engineers have been threatened and attacked and phone masts have been set alight in the UK and other countries because of conspiracy theories that have been incubated and amplified online. Social media also helps scammers to take advantage of the pandemic, sellingineffective badges that claim to ward off the virus, and urging followers to part with money in exchange for a ""mineral miracle supplement"", which is - in reality - diluted bleach.

As vaccines emerge, there is the further threat that anti-vaccine campaigners will use the platform provided by social media to persuade people not to protect themselves. Despite social media companies removing or labelling misleading information about vaccines,recent polling in the United States showedthat 28% of Americans believe that Bill Gates wants to use vaccines to implant microchips in people.

"Recession is unprecedented, says chancellor","This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We're grappling with something unprecedented"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government is ""grappling with something that is unprecedented"" after figures showed the UK economy suffered its biggest slump on record. The economy shrank 20.4% between April and June compared with the first three months of the year. The two consecutive quarters of decline caused by the Covid-19 lockdown pushed the UK officially into recession. Mr Sunak told the BBC that it was ""a very difficult and uncertain time"". Responding to fears that the economic turmoil could trigger mass unemployment, the chancellor said the government should not pretend that ""absolutely everybody can and will be able to go back to the job they had"". However, he added there would be support for creating jobs in new areas. It is the first time the UK has been in recession since 2009. During the lockdown, household spending plunged as shops were ordered to close, while factory and construction output also fell. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds blamed Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the scale of the economic impact, saying: ""A downturn was inevitable after lockdown - but Johnson's jobs crisis wasn't."" Kate Treglown, 44, of Walthamstow in east London, is currently out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She was made redundant from her advertising job at the end of July after being on furlough. ""I worked for 16-and-a-half years for an advertising agency that promoted live events. The work totally dried up in May,"" she told the BBC. Kate says she feels ""stuck in limbo"" - keen to try something new, but unsure of when her children - who she has been home schooling - will return to school. ""There is work. There are jobs available. But when I look on LinkedIn, every single job has hundreds of applications, so competition is very stiff,"" she says. ""I feel women are really carrying the burden of this pandemic with regards to the childcare, whether working or not. It's made me feel quite depressed at times. ""My redundancy money is only going to last so long and I'm scared of what the future holds for us at the moment."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' How can I find a new job? The recession-pandemic double whammy The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy bounced back in June as government restrictions on movement started to ease. On a month-on-month basis, the economy grew by 8.7% in June, after growth of 1.8% in May. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: ""Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck."" The ONS said the collapse in output was driven by the closure of shops, hotels, restaurants, schools and car repair shops. The services sector, which powers four-fifths of the economy, suffered the biggest quarterly decline on record. This video can not be played What is a recession? Factory shutdowns also resulted in the slowest car production since 1954. How could a recession affect me? Is there such a thing as a 'good' or 'bad' recession? PM warns of 'long, long way to go' for UK economy The economic decline was concentrated in April, at the height of lockdown. Official jobs figures released on Tuesday showedthe number of people in workfell by 220,000 between April and June. But in a BBC interview on Wednesday, Mr Sunak did not waver on ending the government's furlough scheme of job subsidies, which is winding down and is due to end entirely after October. ""I think most people would agree that that's not something that is sustainable indefinitely,"" he told the BBC. The opposition has been critical of the government's handling of the economy during the pandemic. Ms Dodds said: ""We've already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we're on course for the worst recession too. That's a tragedy for the British people and it's happened on Boris Johnson's watch."" Referring to the tapering of the furlough scheme, she said the government had ""snatched away wage support for businesses that hadn't even reopened yet"". Laura Tenison, founder of clothing firm JoJo Maman Bebe, told the BBC that the trading performance of her 90 stores was showing huge variations, with those in urban locations suffering from a lack of office workers and tourists. ""Those like York, Windsor, central London, Reading, Norwich - those ones are absolutely dire, really really awful,"" she said. ""I mean, some days we take no money, put it that way. But some of the village stores, the community stores, they're actually doing better than we anticipated. ""I think we have six stores in the portfolio that actually are trading up on last year."" Ms Tenison founded her business in 1993, during a recession. ""This is my third recession in my relatively long life in retail,"" she said. ""We still have to be entrepreneurial,"" she added. ""We have had to close down some areas of business because of Covid. We've had to close our American business, which is just a massive sadness to me. ""Of course, everyone has to look at their overheads, but be creative. Look at those opportunities out there. Recessions bring opportunities."" Business groups urged the government to do more to support the economic recovery. Alpesh Paleja, an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said many companies were struggling to pay their bills on time. He said: ""A sustained recovery is by no means assured. The dual threats of a second wave and slow progress over Brexit negotiations are also particularly concerning."" This video can not be played Anneliese Dodds: The UK has not seen âa big enough bounce back and we really need oneâ While more recent data suggest the recovery is gaining traction, the Bank of England does not expect the economy to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the end of next year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, expects the recovery to take even longer. The UK's slump is one of the biggest among advanced economies, according to preliminary estimates. The economy is more than a fifth smaller than it was at the end of last year. This fall is not as bad as the 22.7% decline in Spain, but about twice the size of contractions in Germany and the US. The chancellor told the BBC that the UK economy had performed worse than its EU counterparts because it was focused on services, hospitality and consumer spending. ""Those kinds of activities comprise a much larger share of our economy than they do for most of our European cousins,"" he said.

UK 'must anticipate hostile states threat',"Russia is identified as a hostile state in the report The UK must work to stop China and Russia using the pandemic to their global advantage, MPs have warned. The Commons Defence Committee said an ongoing review of foreign and security policy must prioritise looking at the capabilities of ""hostile states"". It called for a ""robust assessment"" of the threat Moscow and Beijing pose to UK interests at home and abroad. Meanwhile, the government has brought in new powers for police to detain people they suspect of espionage. Home Secretary Priti Patel said this would send a ""clear message"" of ""zero tolerance"" to anyone attempting to disrupt UK interests, Russian ambassador rejects vaccine hacking claims UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat The 'new normal' as cyber-spies navigate pandemic Downing Street has promised its""integrated review""of foreign, defence, security and international development policy - the first for five years - will be the most far-reaching since the Cold War. But the cross-party committee, headed by Conservative ex-minister Tobias Ellwood, said it was ""concerned that the gap between this expectation and reality is widening"". Its report urged the government to welcome ""challenge"" from the armed forces, international allies, industry, Parliament and the public. Warning against a ""behind-closed-doors"" approach, the committee also called for clarity over which ministers would chair key meetings if Boris Johnson was not attending and what input special advisers, including the PM's chief aide Dominic Cummings, would have. The committee said it had been told by the UK's deputy national security adviser Alex Ellis that coronavirus was expected to lead to ""intensified geo-political competition"". ""Within this context, it is important to consider how hostile foreign states may utilise the pandemic to their advantage,"" it added. The UK, Russia and China are all at the forefront of global efforts to produce a vaccine, withRussia saying on Tuesday that it had given regulatory approval to oneafter less than two months of testing on humans. The UK has accused Russia of attempting tosteal UK scientists' vaccine research, a claim denied by Moscow. The committee said it had heard that both Russia and China - with which the UK is at loggerheads over cyber-espionage and Hong Kong - were ""employing disruption as a major tool"". It said the UK must assess the ""full range"" of economic and diplomatic activities in which the countries were involved. There has been speculation that the review could lead to a further cut in the size of the armed forces, but the committee said decisions should be driven by strategy rather than money. From Thursday, the Home Office is giving specially trained police the power to stop, question and detain individuals travelling through UK ports who are suspected of working for hostile states. Ms Patel said the threat was ""growing and ever-changing"", and promised new laws to ""stay ahead"".

US holds off on tariff hike in EU Airbus fight,"US imports of Scotch whisky dropped 33% after tariffs were imposed last year The US has said it will hold off an a threatened hike in tariffs on $7.5bn (Â£5.75bn) worth of European and UK goods that it imposed as punishment for subsidies for plane-maker Airbus. The move comes as the two sides wrestle to put to an end their 16-year trade battle over state aid for Airbus and American rival Boeing. The US last year raised border taxes on more than 100 items, including jumpers, single-malt whiskies and cheese. It has said the EU has not done enough. ""The EU and member states have not taken the actions necessary to come into compliance with WTO decisions,"" America's top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said on Wednesday.  ""The United States, however, is committed to obtaining a long-term resolution to this dispute. The European Union cautiously welcomed the US decision not to increase the amount of goods subject to tariffs. ""The commission acknowledges the decision of the US not to exacerbate the ongoing aircraft dispute by increasing tariffs on European products,"" an EU spokesperson said. Airbus last month said,externalit would alter some deals responsible for the dispute, saying the changes, including increasing its interest rates on loans with France and Spain, eliminated ""any justification"" for the US border taxes. The move prompted EU officials to call for an end to ""unjustified"" tariffs. Many American businesses have also protested the duties, which raise prices for American buyers. On Wednesday Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell said in a statement the company ""profoundly regrets that, despite Europe's recent actions to achieve full compliance, USTR [US Trade Representative] has decided to maintain tariffs on Airbus aircraft - especially at a time when aviation and other sectors are going through an unprecedented crisis."" The US announced tariffs on $7.5bn worth of goods last yearafter the World Trade Organization ruled that state aid provided to Airbus to launch its A380 and A350 jets was illegal and authorised American retaliation. In February, the US raised the ratesbeing charged on aircraft from 10% to 15%, leaving the 25% duty on other items unchanged. This summer, American officials again threatened to raise tariff rates or make new items subject to the import tax. The items threatened with new duties included salmon fillets, gin and olives. The US is required by law to review the tariffs periodically. On Wednesday it announced minor tweaks to the list, for example, removing sweet biscuits like shortbread made in the UK and adding jams from France and Germany. Trade lawyer Jamieson Greer, former chief of staff to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, told the BBC: ""The reality is that this can all be solved if Airbus took some action to provide restitution."" The European Union, which brought its own case challenging American subsidies for Boeing, has threatened to hit the US with tariffs of its own. It is waiting for the World Trade Organization to decide how big such a punishment might be. The US in May said it had eliminated the benefits in dispute. That WTO ruling is expected later this year. ""In the absence of a settlement, the EU will be ready to fully avail itself of its own sanction rights,"" Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said last month. The issue has also complicated trade talks between the US and the UK. UK Trade Secretary Liz Truss raised the matter in talks with Mr Lighthizer this month, as the two sides held a third round of negotiations. Ms Truss said that while she welcomed the US's decision not to lift levies: ""The announcement does not address tariffs that already exist on goods like single malt Scotch whisky."" She said: ""These tariffs damage industry and livelihoods on both sides of the Atlantic and are in nobody's interests. I am therefore stepping up talks with the US to remove them as soon as possible.""

Family's fears over double murderer's release,"Paul Bostock was described as ""a loner... with an obsession with weapons, with the occult and with black magic"" The family of a woman who was stabbed to death by an occult-obsessed ""sadist"" are to appeal against his release. Paul Bostock, 53, has been in prison since pleading guilty in 1986 to killing two women in Leicestershire. Despite once saying he should be ""prevented from walking the streets again"", Bostock has been deemed safe enough to be released on parole. The family of his second victim, Amanda Weedon, said it was still too soon for him to be released. Her brother Martin, 61, said: ""We believe he is still a dangerous person. I don't think you can fix a mind like his."" Bostock killed his first victim Caroline Osborne when he was just 16 In 1983 Bostock stabbed and killed 33-year-old pet beautician Caroline Osborne while she was walking dogs in Aylestone Meadows in Leicester. Two years later he killed Miss Weedon, a 21-year-old nurse, after he visited Ms Osborne's nearby grave. The Beaumont Leys resident was described as ""a loner... with an obsession with weapons, with the occult and with black magic"". Miss Weedon was killed near the hospital she worked at just weeks before her wedding day Leicester Crown Court heard both killings were ""ferocious"" and had an ""element of sexual sadism"". While awaiting trial he wrote: ""I'm an animal who should be prevented from walking the streets again. ""If I suffer 100 years I would still deserve more."" Court urged to quash Helen McCourt killer's parole Attempt to block release of rapist denied Latest news and stories from the East Midlands He was sentenced to life imprisonment at the age of 19. The BBC has seen Parole Board documents showing it had decided Bostock was now safe enough to leave prison, although he will have a tag and ""very strict limitations"" on who he can meet and where he can go. A spokeswoman confirmed it had directed his release and said its decisions were ""solely focused"" on the risk a prisoner poses to the public and whether that risk is manageable. She added: ""Protecting the public is our number one priority."" Miss Weedon's family said they were told on Monday and given 21 days to submit their appeal. Martin Weedon said he believed Paul Bostock should stay in prison until he was ""an OAP"", lacking the strength to reoffend Mr Weedon added: ""I believe most people deserve a second chance. But not him.

"Covid death recount reduces UK toll by 5,000","A review of how deaths from coronavirus are counted in England has reduced the UK death toll by more than 5,000, to 41,329, the government has announced. The recalculation is based on a new definition of who has died from Covid. Previously, people in England who died at any point following a positive test, regardless of cause, were counted in the figures. But there will now be a cut-off of 28 days, providing a more accurate picture of the epidemic. This brings England's measure in line with the other UK nations. The new methodology for counting deaths means the total number of people in the UK who have died from Covid-19 comes down from 46,706 to 41,329 - a reduction of 12%. And figures for deaths in England for the most recent week of data - 18 to 24 July - will drop by 75%, from 442 to 111. Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""The way we count deaths in people with Covid-19 in England was originally chosen to avoid underestimating deaths caused by the virus in the early stages of the pandemic."" But he said the new methods of calculating deaths from the virus would give ""crucial information about both recent trends and the overall mortality burden due to Covid-19"". Calculating the total number of deaths linked to coronavirus is far from straightforward. It seemed very odd when we learned last month that PHE's figures included everyone who had tested positive, even if they died months afterwards and their death may have had another cause. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland's 28-day limit between a positive test and death looked reasonable. But even so, that measure does not include those who might have been on a ventilator for more than 28 days. There is no yardstick endorsed by the World Health Organization and PHE argued there was no single ideal way of working out the total. In future, death numbers for England will be published using both 28-day and 60-day cut off points. The 28-day limit will, however, be the headline measure and will at least achieve consistency across the UK. Cutting around 5,400 from the death total will be a talking point among statisticians. But it won't make any difference to tens of thousands of families who have been bereaved because of the virus. The health secretary in England, Matt Hancock, called for a review into the way deaths from coronavirus were calculated in July. Hancock calls for urgent review on Covid death data It followed concerns raised by Oxford scientists that this was being carried out differently across the four nations of the UK. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the count only included people who died within four weeks of a positive test. Someone who stayed in intensive care with Covid-19 for five weeks and died would not be counted as a coronavirus death, for example. Matt Hancock called for a review into the way deaths were calculated in England In England, there was no time limit. Someone who recovered from Covid-19 in March and died in a car crash in July would have been counted as a coronavirus death. Now the UK's four chief medical officers have decided to use a single, consistent measure and publish the number of deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test confirmed in a lab, every day. Every week for England, a new set of figures will be published showing the number of deaths that occur within 60 days of a positive test. Deaths that occur after 60 days - such as those who have been in intensive care for many months - will also be added in if Covid-19 appears on the death certificate. Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, from the University of Nottingham, said the two new measures were ""sensible"". ""The 28 days is widely used in many countries and England is now the same as the rest of the UK,"" he said. ""The previous measure of always being a Covid death, even if recovered, was unscientific. ""As Covid deaths fall, the number of recovered patients, particularly the very old and those with severe underlying conditions, are now dying from these conditions and not Covid-19."" Prof Neal added: ""These non-Covid deaths in survivors would become an ever increasing percentage of the England Covid deaths being reported. It had become essentially useless for epidemiological monitoring."" BRITAIN'S CANCER CRISIS:How has cancer care been impacted by Covid-19? DIET AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEMHow important is a healthy diet?

Biden and Harris say Trump has left US 'in tatters',"This video can not be played Harris: 'America is crying out for leadership' Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris have attacked ""whining"" President Donald Trump as an incompetent leader who has left the US ""in tatters"". The pair held their first campaign event together, a day after Mr Biden unveiled Ms Harris as his number two. President Trump hit back, saying Ms Harris had ""dropped like a rock"" in her own presidential bid. Mr Biden will face Mr Trump, a Republican, in November's election. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Wednesday's event at a school in Wilmington, Delaware, was not open to the public, with Mr Biden, 77, citing coronavirus prevention needs. Both candidates walked on stage wearing masks to address a group of masked journalists. Mr Biden noted that Ms Harris, a US senator from California, was the first woman of colour to serve as a presidential running mate for a major US party. Mr Biden said: ""The choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time."" He continued: ""Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala, quote, nasty, whining about how she is, quote, mean to his appointees. ""It's not a surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history. This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick ""Is anybody surprised that Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman, or strong women across the board?"" He also attacked Mr Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, the unemployment rate and ""his politics of racist rhetoric that appeals to division"". Coming to the podium next, Ms Harris said: ""I am ready to get to work."" This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career The 55-year-old former prosecutor told reporters: ""Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it's all on the line."" Ms Harris -  the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica - continued: ""America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. ""He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."" Viewpoint: Harris pick 'symbolic and substantive' Countries pile in on Kamala Harris celebrations Much has been made of the differences between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris since he announced her as his running mate on Tuesday afternoon. Biden is more than 20 years her senior. He's a white man, son of working-class parents in Pennsylvania. She's a multiracial woman from California, daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. In their first joint appearance on Wednesday, however, they both spoke about what they had in common. ""Her story is America's story,"" Mr Biden said. ""Different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials."" Ms Harris echoed this, saying that the two candidates are ""cut from the same cloth"". It's the kind of message you'd imagine would come from a campaign that's calling for national healing and unity. Of course, that didn't stop either candidate from going on the attack against their general election opponents. It's the first salvo for this ticket in what is sure to be a bare-knuckle fight for the White House. How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden At a White House news conference, Mr Trump disparaged Ms Harris' failed bid for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, during which she fiercely attacked Mr Biden's record on race. Mr Trump said: ""I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing, and she left angry, she left mad. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman, where she, I guess, believed the woman. ""Now all of a sudden she's running to be vice-president saying how wonderful he is."" Last year Mr Biden was accused by a number of women of unwelcome contact, including touching and kissing. Mr Biden acknowledged at the time that he must respect personal space. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? A more serious allegation surfaced this year from a former aide who accused Mr Biden of sexually assaulting her in the halls of Congress in 1993. He denied the claim. Ms Harris, who had dropped out of the presidential race at that point, said Tara Reade ""has a right to tell her story"". Whatâs behind the Biden sexual harassment allegation The sexual allegations against Donald Trump California state records,externalalso show Mr Trump donated to Ms Harris when she was a candidate for the state's attorney general in 2011 and 2013, while he was still a private citizen. Shortly before the Biden-Harris event, Mr Trump goaded Mr Biden for remaining at home for much of the campaign so far amid the pandemic lockdown. During a White House meeting with teachers who said that children learnt better in class than remotely, the president asked a asked: ""So if you're a presidential candidate and you're sitting in a basement and you're looking at a computer, that's not a good thing?"" He also tweeted an attack on the Biden-Harris ticket, saying they would put Senator Cory Booker, who is black, in charge of low-income housing. Critics said the tweet was racist. Mr Biden will formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination at next week's convention, which will largely be a virtual event because of the pandemic. He became the party's presumptive nominee in April after Bernie Sanders, his only remaining competitor, ended his own campaign. Meanwhile Mr Trump will be nominated for a second four-year term in the White House by his fellow Republicans at their party convention a week later. A 10-week campaign will follow before voters deliver their verdict in the general election on 3 November. Mr Trump and Mr Biden will hold three debates in September and October. Ms Harris will debate Vice-President Mike Pence in October. The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Who is Kamala Harris? Video, 00:03:48Who is Kamala Harris? Trump calls Harris 'meanest' US senator.

Breast screening from age 40 'could save lives',"In the UK, women aged 50-70 are offered breast screening unless there is a high genetic risk Screening women for breast cancer from their 40s rather than their 50s could save lives without adding to the diagnosis of harmless cancers, a UK study has found. The research was based on 160,000 women from England, Scotland and Wales, followed up for around 23 years. Lowering the screening age could save one life per 1,000 women checked, the scientists say. But experts caution there are many other considerations, including cost. Cancer Research UK says it is still ""not clear if reducing the breast screening age would give any additional benefit compared to the UK's existing screening programme"". The charity says the priority should be getting cancer services ""back on track"" for women aged 50-70, after disruption caused by the pandemic. During lockdown, cancer screening programmes which detect early signs of bowel, breast and cervical cancer were paused in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, although not officially stopped in England. Experts have warned ofhuge backlogs for screening, treatment and tests. Currently in the UK, women between the ages of 50 and 70 are invited to be screened for breast cancer every three years. Women below 50 are not routinely offered this because their risk of breast cancer is generally very low and their breast tissue is more dense, making it difficult to read the results of mammography tests used to spot cancers. This can lead to over-diagnosis - detecting very early cell changes which may not turn into problematic cancers - and the potential for exposing women to unnecessary treatment. Writing in the Lancet Oncology,external, the scientists say they found a reduction in breast cancer deaths from screening women in their 40s every year over the first 10 years they were tracked. Cancer Research UK stressed the need for women of any age to tell their doctor if they noticed anything unusual about their breasts In the group of 53,883 women in their 40s who were screened, there were 83 deaths, compared to 219 deaths in the 106,953 women of the same age who were not checked. The reduction in deaths came from detection of grade 1 and 2 cancers, which can progress more quickly in younger women. After 10 years, any evidence of extra lives being saved tailed off, the researchers said. They also found a ""modest over-diagnosis in this age group"" which was similar to that found in the over-50s. In the study, 18% of women who went for screening in their 40s had at least one false positive result. Pandemic could cause thousands more cancer deaths 'More than two million in UK wait for cancer care' Prof Stephen Duffy, lead researcher, from Queen Mary University of London, said: ""This is a very long-term follow-up of a study which confirms that screening in women under 50 can save lives, ""In the fullness of time, it is worth thinking about lowering the age of screening."" However, he said the financial cost of this should be taken into account, and more research was needed into the impact of modern screening equipment on diagnoses. Sophia Lowes, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said the charity had concerns about the study results. ""Many women received false positive results and some women would have been over-diagnosed with cancers that would never have gone on to cause them harm,"" she said. ""While research into improving our screening programmes remains vital, screening programmes are already under huge strain due to the pandemic, and the priority right now should be getting services back on track for women aged 50-70."" The charity calculates that six times more women in their 40s, compared to those aged 50-70, would need to be screened to save one life. Ms Lowes said it was important that women - no matter how old they are - should still tell their doctor if they noticed anything unusual about their breasts.

Severe storms forecast after scorching temperatures,"A woman shields from rain on Oxford Street in London Thunderstorms are moving across parts of the UK, after some areas saw the longest stretch of high temperatures since the 1960s. The severe weather caused flash floods in parts of southern England on Thursday, bringing travel disruption. The Met Office has issued yellow thunderstorm warnings for the next five days in much of England and Wales, with flooding, lightning and hail expected. It comes after torrential rain and lightninglashed parts of Scotland. Part of the M25 motorway in Surrey was closed because of flash flooding, while in Kent 19 people have been evacuated from a train which became stuck after a landslide. A motorist recorded footage of some of the flooding on the M25 The motorway is closed completely between two junctions in Surrey The Met Office has warned that while some areas could stay dry, others could see as much as 40mm of rain falling in less than an hour amid severe thunderstorms. There were thundery showers across southern England on Thursday afternoon, including the counties between Devon and Kent. This video can not be played Why are we having so many thunderstorms? BBC Weather said about 12,000 lightning strikes were detected across parts of southern Britain in the hours leading up to 18:00 BST. A wooden pavilion caught fire after a suspected lightning strike in the village of Barton Stacey in Hampshire, with eyewitness Donna Stokes saying there was a ""horrendously loud bang of thunder"". ""The pavilion has been on the playing fields for somewhere in the region of 80 years,"" said Donna In Devon, homes were flooded following a collection of thunderstorms across south-west England on Thursday. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said on Twitter it had received numerous calls relating to properties in Devon, with some residents reporting up to 18 inches of water inside their homes. The Environment Agency hasissued flood alerts for certain areas in England and Scotland, which are separate from the weather warnings issued by the Met Office. Torrential rain and thunderstorms bring flooding South west England full to capacity, say police In pictures: Storms light up skies Thursday's heavy downpours also sparked travel disruption on rail and roads in southern England. There are closures in both directions on the M25 between junctions seven and eight near Reigate in Surrey due to flooding, according to Highways England. Motorists have been urged to allow additional time for journeys, as the disruption has caused delays of one hour and about seven miles of congestion. One motorist reported ""biblical"" rain and hail on the M25 near junction seven, as he shared a video of the flooding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Flooding had also shut the railway between Tattenham Corner in Surrey and Coulsdon Town in Croydon. Temperatures reached highs of 29C on Thursday, marking the first time the mercury remained below 30C in seven days Forecasters have warned severe thunderstorms could continue to bring flooding and disruption into next week. Met Office meteorologist Matthew Box said there was a risk of thunderstorms ""right through to the start of next week, and maybe even beyond that"". But he added that temperatures were cooler on Thursday, following days of scorching weather in parts of the UK. A high of 29.6C (85.3F) was recorded in the village of Frittenden in Kent, Mr Box said. It comes after temperatures surpassed 34C in central London for the sixth day in a row on Wednesday - the first time that has happened since at least 1961.

England's Covid app gets green light for trial,"The Isle of Wight has been picked as a test bed for England's contact-tracing app for a second time England's revamped coronavirus contact-tracing app is set to begin public trials on Thursday. The software will be based on Apple and Google's privacy-centric method of one smartphone detecting another. Engineers are still trying to reduce how often the Bluetooth-based tech wrongly flags people as being within 2m (6.6ft) of each other. Officials are concerned about people going into quarantine as a consequence. The Isle of Wight will be involved again, along with one other area and a volunteer group. The government intends to launch the experiment without much fanfare, because it is still not clear when a formal national rollout will occur. The idea behind the app is to use people's phones to log when they have been close to another person for so long, that there is a high risk of contagion. If one user is later diagnosed with the disease, the other person can be alerted to the fact before they begin exhibiting symptoms. In addition, users will also be asked to scan a QR barcode when they enter a property, to provide a means to later alert them to the fact that they visited a location linked to multiple infections. ""We need the app to helpÂ stopÂ transmission by tracing close-proximity contacts as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, capturing those contacts we don't know or don't remember meeting,"" Prof Christophe Fraser, a scientific advisor to the Department of Health from Oxford University, told the BBC. ""The app should enable us to return to more normal dailyÂ activities with the reassurance that our contacts can be rapidlyÂ and anonymously notified if we get infected."" â¨ Baroness Dido Harding - who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - cancelled an earlier trial on the Isle of Wight in June. This was because an app based on an alternative system spearheaded by NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - had to deal with restrictions Apple imposes on how Bluetooth is used by third-party apps. As a result, it only detected 4% of iPhones in cases where the app had gone to sleep because the two handsets involved had not been in recent active use. This prompted a switch to the Apple-Google solution, which does not have this problem. But at the time, Baroness Harding said the US tech giant's alternative had a different issue. Baroness Harding has concerns that people might be directed to stay at home based on unreliable data She said it could not measure distance well enough to be trusted to direct people to self-isolate for a fortnight. This has not prevented other places - including Northern Ireland - launching apps based on the technology. But ongoing tests indicate that England's new app is still worse at determining distance than the original NHS Covid-19 product. Confusingly, there have even been cases when the further two handsets are spaced apart, the more likely it is that the software still indicates they are within 2m of each other. Part of the problem with the Apple-Google framework is that the tech firms have decided that developers should not get access to raw attenuation data - a measure of changes in Bluetooth signal strength. Instead, it provides a more basic set ofreadings that an app can use to calculate its own risk scores,external- the idea being that this helps preserve users' anonymity. But one consequence of this, is that engineers have not been able to take advantage of a techniquedeveloped by researchers at the UK's Turing Institute and the University of Oxford,external. It filters the data to give a better indication of proximity. Several countries have asked the two tech firms to relax their restrictions, although they are cautious about discussing the matter in public. Many of those involved have signed non-disclosure agreements with Apple and Google. Switzerland and Germany have said they have no way of measuring how many false positives are being recorded by their apps A possible compromise would be for Apple and Google to incorporate the filter into their own tool.

Teenager guilty of murdering teaching assistant,"Lindsay Birbeck was reported missing after failing to return home A 17-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering a teaching assistant whose body was found in a shallow grave. Lindsay Birbeck, 47, went missing on 12 August 2019 while walking in a wooded area and was later found buried in Accrington Cemetery, Lancashire. Preston Crown Court heard her attacker had been prowling the woods for lone females. The boy admitted moving her body in a wheelie bin and claimed he buried her for a stranger who promised him money. The verdict came a year to the day since Mrs Birbeck went missing. Mrs Birbeck's 17-year-old daughter Sarah raised the alarm when her mother did not return from her afternoon walk to have tea at 18:00 BST. The mother-of-two had left her home in Burnley Road, Accrington, to stroll in a nearby wooded area known as the Coppice. Her attacker, who was 16 at the time, is thought to have killed Mrs Birbeck shortly after she entered the Coppice. He attended a police station several days after her naked body was discovered wrapped in two plastic bags following a police CCTV appeal. The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, denied murder and manslaughter. But he admitted dragging a bin, with Mrs Birbeck inside, from the Coppice across Burnley Road to the cemetery where he buried her. In court:Mike Stevens, BBC News Police trawled through around 3,000 hours of CCTV footage and found a young man who was seen repeatedly pulling a blue wheelie bin in and around Huncoat. A similar-looking bin was found in Accrington Cemetery some days earlier. After sharing the footage in a public appeal, the 16-year-old boy arrived at a police station in Blackburn with his family. Home Office pathologist Dr Naomi Carter said the injuries Mrs Birbeck sustained were the most severe of their kind which she had seen in her 25-year career. He claimed a man had approached him with the promise of a large cash reward if he disposed of the body. He stated: ""I have not met this man before. I have not met him since, nor have I had any contact with him. ""He has not paid me any money. He told me that he would leave the money for me near where the body had been at first once everything was clear."" The prosecution said the defendant's account was ""implausible fiction"". The court heard another woman said a lone male wearing a grey tracksuit with his hood up had followed her on her walk shortly before Mrs Birbeck entered the Coppice. She said she feared for her safety and he was getting closer when she startled him by glancing back. A post-mortem examination concluded the cause of Mrs Birbeck's death was neck injuries. No evidence of a sexual assault could be found. An attempt had also been made to cut off a leg, possibly with a saw. Outside court, Mrs Birbeck's daughter said: ""Our lives have been utterly destroyed by the evil, cowardly behaviour of the defendant and the horrific manner in which she was murdered. ""My mum went for a walk on a sunny afternoon in August and never came home, it's unthinkable that something as brutal as this could happen in our close community to someone that was loved so very dearly.""

Golden eagles breeding success at Highlands estate,"A female golden eagle flying in to an eyrie in the Cairngorms National Park Golden eagles have bred at a ""rewilding"" estate in the Scottish Highlands for the first time in 40 years. An eagle pair successfully reared the chick at an artificial eyrie on the 10,000-acre Trees for Life Dundreggan estate. This positive news came as it emerged that a young tagged gold eagle known as Tom has gone missing in Perthshire. Tom was being satellite-tracked by Raptor Persecution UK. Springwatch presenter Chris Packham has also been working on the tagging project. The Tayside and Central Scotland Moorland Group said members of the community in Strathbraan had been out looking for Tom. On the Dundreggan estate an artificial nest was built five years ago high on a rocky crag, on the remains of an old nest site. Its purpose was to encourage a pair of golden eagles to mate. It was made using branches from the native pines and birch trees that cover the mountain slopes. Doug Gilbert is the manager of the estate. He has been checking the eyrie every spring for the last five years. He described it as a ""rewilding successes story beyond our wildest dreams"". The 10,000-acre Dundreggan estate is owned by Trees for Life, which aims to revive the ancient Caledonian forest He told the BBC: ""I feel elated. Absolutely amazing. To have done a little bit of management, and to have a wild bird decide it's a good place to be, and produce a chick, then it's wonderful."" Mr Gilbert said the ""rewilding"" approach adopted at Dundreggan had helped. The estate used to be managed for deer stalking, and the animals tend to graze on tender saplings before they can become mature. Now the deer population has been reduced to a level where trees can grow again. ""Golden eagle-friendly"" mountaintop forests have been replanted, containing tough, waist-high ""wee trees"", such as dwarf birch and downy willow. There has been a recorded increase in black grouse, which is an important food source for golden eagles. However Mr Gilbert said: ""I do worry for the safety of the chick. They are renowned for wandering quite far distances. There are several black spots where eagles regularly disappear. Some of them are well within range of a young golden eagle - just 50 km away, and chicks can travel for 100-150km."" ""What we are doing here won't change the course of history,"" said Mr Gilbert. ""But if we can produce one chick, rather than one being killed somewhere else, then it's a good thing."" Around 120 miles south, in the Strathbraan area of the Perthshire uplands, the young tagged golden eagle known as Tom has been reported missing. Tom was hatched in Argyll in May 2019. Tom the eagle hatched in Argyll in May 2019. His last known location transmitted by his tag before it stopped working was on May 18 in Perthshire. Four of the eagles that were tagged by Raptor Persecution UK (RPUK) in 2017 have since disappeared. Golden Eagles ""disappear"" from grouse moor Police Scotland confirmed they have carried out enquiries regarding the missing golden eagle. They said no criminality had so far been established, but are appealing for information. It's unclear what has happened to Tom. While some claim that its tag could simply have stopped working, golden eagles do face persecution. A number of grouse shooting estates are located in the Strathbraan region. According to the RSPB, Tom is now the sixth golden eagle to have disappeared in this area since 2014. Alice Bugden, co-ordinator of Tayside and Central Scotland Moorland Group, which has members in the Stathbraan area where Tom's tag stopped signalling, said: ""We have read all the speculation about Tom. Members of the community, gamekeepers, shepherds and families all went out looking for the bird. ""People in this area are rightly concerned when any such news arises and they wanted to do something tangible to help but they are also fed up of allegation and smear by campaigners whose sole intent is to force governments north and south of the border to licence or ban grouse shooting."" A video published by Chris Packham on Twitter highlighting Tom's case has so far had almost 300,000 views. He said: ""We have no proof as to what happened, apart from that the tag, which had a full battery, and was transmitting consistently, failed catastrophically. Golden eagles prey on a variety of species, but their diet sometimes includes bird species that have been specifically managed to be killed for sport, like grouse or pheasant. Farmers, gamekeepers, shepherds and local people have been looking out to see if they can find any trace of Tom Areport,externalby Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) in 2017 concluded that a third of satellite-tagged golden eagles had disappeared suspiciously. It found that 41 of 131 tracked birds disappeared between 2004 and 2016. Scientists say they have ruled out malfunctioning tags and wind farms as possible causes for the eagles vanishing. The study also found that the majority of cases - although not all - were in areas which are managed for grouse shooting. Alice Budgen commented: ""The only way through this intractable game of trial by media is to have independent parties involved who can monitor exactly what these tags are showing, what their strengths and limitations are and can also factor in the very many other reasons which tags can fail which are nothing to do with persecution. That is the story which the public is not hearing. ""Only neutral bodies, free of agenda, can end the insinuations and base this around evidence. If it means perpetrators being caught, good, if it means the ability to shine a light on the truth, good. ""It will be a huge step forward from where we are now, which is whole communities of people being guilty until proven innocent."" But the principal adviser on science for Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Professor Des Thompson, told the BBC it was ""shocking"" that disappearances continued to occur. ""Our scientific report to Scottish Government on the fates of satellite-tagged golden eagles found there was a pattern of suspicious activity surrounding the 'disappearance' of many of these birds. This work gave rise to Professor [Alan] Werritty's Grouse Moor ManagementReport,externalwhich ministers are considering."" Review calls for ultimatum over raptor persecution Tagged eagle 12th to 'disappear' Golden eagle disappearance 'suspicious' Ian Thomson, head of investigations at RSPB Scotland said: ""We have had 50 or so golden eagles go missing in identical circumstances on grouse moors since 2004. It's in the nature of a young eagle to be nomadic. They go all over Scotland, right up to the Inner Hebrides, then when they travel to the grouse moors in the East, they disappear mysteriously."" ""There have been no prosecutions for the killing of a golden eagle in Scotland,"" said Mr Thomson. ""It is a real stain on the reputation of a country that likes to portray itself as one of wild natural beauty."" According to the last national survey, in 2015, there were 508 pairs of golden eagles in Scotland. Conservationists say that their range could be much greater; two-thirds of traditional territories are still unoccupied. Ruth Tingay, from RPUK, told BBC News: ""The Scottish government has known about the persecution of golden eagles on grouse moors for decades. It has kicked it into the long grass. The case has been made; there is huge public support, and there has been every opportunity to legislate. It's clear the industry can't self-regulate."" However, Tim Baynes, who is moorland director for Scottish Land & Estates, said: ""Local estates have been actively involved in efforts to find the golden eagle... We realise that when a tag stops transmitting there will be speculation as to whether it has died or has been killed. However, as searches have found nothing and eagles were recorded flying in the area shortly after the tag stopped transmitting and thereafter, this bird could well be still flying around with a malfunctioning tag."" A spokesperson for the Scottish Government said it condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" any crime carried out against  wildlife, and that it was taking decisive action in a range of ways. ""The Animals and Wildlife Act which has just become law increases the maximum penalties for the most serious wildlife crime - including the illegal killing of birds of prey -  to five years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine, and extends the time available to Police Scotland to investigate. ""We also commissioned the Werritty report on grouse moor management and will publish our response in the autumn."" There are various satellite tagging projects going on in Scotland. According to the RSPB, they are regulated by the British Trust for Ornithology. Those who carry out the tagging have to be rigorously trained; there are only ""a handful"" who have permission. The projects pass their data to the police force, who then decide whether to lead any investigation. The organisation said they are 98% reliable. The Scottish Government is currently considering its response to most recent independent report into the management of grouse moors: The Werrity Review was published December 2019.

Firefighter fosters dog he saved from flames,"Millie the Jack Russell is now staying with leading firefighter Jamie Trew, who found her A dog that nearly died in a fire is being fostered by the firefighter who saved her. Fire crews were called to a flat fire in Newham on 28 July and found a woman being treated outside by paramedics but learned her Jack Russell was missing. Lead firefighter Jamie Trew found Millie lying apparently ""lifeless"" under a bed. She was given oxygen and water and came to after 10 minutes. Her owner has agreed Mr Trew will look after Millie while the owner recovers. Firefighters from Ilford Fire Station cooled Millie with water to bring down her core temperature Firefighters from Ilford Station were called at about 21:50 BST to a ground floor flat in Forest View Road. Wearing breathing apparatus they searched for Millie in the bedroom and discovered her apparently lifeless body when they lifted up the bed. Station officer Dean Ivil, who was at the scene, said: ""After 10 minutes she showed signs of life and she eventually regained consciousness enough to start walking and was taken to the local emergency vet. ""After a short stay there, her owner has agreed she can be fostered and she is now happily staying with leading firefighter Jamie Trew who found her."" ""It's a lovely ending for what could have been a tragic story. If her owner decides it's best, Millie has a forever home with Jamie and his family,"" he added. Part of the bedroom was damaged in the fire, which was under control within 40 minutes. The cause of the fire is still being investigated.

"European countries fight coronavirus surgeGermany and Greece record their highest daily cases, while Spain and France reach a ""tipping point"".","Germany has recorded its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in more than three months Germany has recorded its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in more than three months as European countries struggle to curb a surge in infections. More than 1,200 cases were reported in Germany in the past 24 hours. Officials said the rise was due, in part, to people returning from holidays. It came as Germany warned against non-essential trips to parts of Spain. Meanwhile, France had 2,524 new cases in 24 hours, the highest daily rise since its lockdown was lifted in May. The German foreign ministry said it had added a partial travel warning to the Spanish capital Madrid and the Basque region on Tuesday amid rising infections there. Warnings were already in place for the regions of Aragon, Catalonia and Navarra. Germany has recorded more than 9,000 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began. Spain is facing the worst coronavirus infection rate in Western Europe.  It recorded 1,418 new infections in its latest daily count on Tuesday and said there were 675 ""active outbreaks"" in the country. Salvador Macip, an expert in health sciences at Catalonia's Open University, told AFP news agency the country was at a ""critical moment"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? What are the rules in France and other parts of Europe? ""We are right at a point where things can get better or worse. This means we have to pull out all the stops to curb outbreaks before they become more serious,"" he said. In total, Spain has recorded more than 326,000 cases - the highest number in Western Europe and the 11th highest in the world. Wearing a face mask became compulsory in all public areas in Brussels on Wednesday amid a rise in cases. The order applies to those aged 12 and above. People were previously only required to wear masks in crowded public spaces and enclosed areas of the Belgian capital, such as shopping centres. Authorities said the enhanced rules were introduced because of a rise in infections, with Brussels recording an average of 50 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per day over the past week. Police checks are being ramped up to ensure that people follow the new rules. The mask-wearing regulation is one of the strictest currently in place in Europe. Belgium has recorded more than 75,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 9,800 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. This year'sParis marathon has been cancelledas France battles a spike in coronavirus cases, organisers said on Wednesday. The marathon was originally due to take place on 5 April but was then postponed to 15 November because of the pandemic. Organisers said they had ""tried everything to maintain the event"" but felt ""obliged"" to call it off. ""There will be great disappointment among those who have sacrificed time training for what had become an autumn marathon,"" they said. Organisers are now working on the 2021 marathon. The announcement came afterParis became the latest French city to make face masks compulsoryin busy outdoor areas. Face masks were already compulsory nationwide in enclosed public spaces. A government spokesman on Wednesday said France would gradually ramp up police checks to ensure that people were respecting social distancing and wearing masks where required. ""We're at a tipping point... We're going to mobilise polices forces to make checks,"" Gabriel Attal told journalists. France has now recorded a total of 206,696 cases of the virus. On Wednesday Greece reported 262 new cases of coronavirus, its highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic. The country has now had 216 deaths and 6,177 cases in total. As a result of the increase in infections in recent weeks, authorities have introduced a curfew for restaurants and bars in some of the country's top tourist destinations - despite this being the peak of the tourism season. They have also enforced restrictions on arrivals from several EU countries and Balkans nations. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Williamson 'sorry' for school and exam disruption,"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson : ""We're creating routes for young people to have their concerns properly addressed"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has apologised to every child for ""the disruption that they've had to suffer"" due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Williamson said the ""best thing"" was for every child in England to be back in school in September. In an interview with the BBC ahead of A-level results on Thursday, he said the exams system was fair and robust. A-level and GCSE students will this year have their results based on estimates after exams were cancelled. On Tuesday, the Department for Education announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. In an exclusive interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Mr Williamson said: ""I apologise to every single child right across the country for the disruption that they've had to suffer."" He said he would never have expected to be in a situation where he had to close schools or ""where we wouldn't have an exam period"". How will exam results day be different this year? Students warn mock grades 'make mockery' of exams Changes considered to A-levels in Wales Scottish school pupils have results upgraded And he insisted that the exams system was strong. ""The system, for the overwhelming majority of young people, is going to deliver, you know, credible, strong results for every single one of them. ""It's a robust system, it's a fair system, it's making sure that young people get the grades that they've worked so hard towards."" He also defended the last-minute ""triple lock"", saying: ""I'm not going to hesitate in terms of actually making changes if I can get the system as fair as possible for every single child."" A-level and BTec results are out on Thursday The education secretary said he wanted to make an ""assurance"" that if students felt they hadn't got the grades they deserved, they could appeal and, if necessary, sit a public exam in the autumn. ""What is key is giving young people the opportunity to move on to the next stage of their lives, making sure that they have the opportunity to go on to college, go to university, take an apprenticeship, go into the world of work."" He said universities had been ""brilliant"" in terms of keeping offers open and urged them ""to show the maximum amount of flexibility"" if students went through the appeals process. He added: ""We've got a system that is, I believe, is the fairest that we can do; but let's not forget that we've been in a global pandemic, we've been in a situation, none of us would have expected to be in."" Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the decision to change the process hours before results day was ""shambolic"" and ""smacks of incompetence"". He also said individual students in England should be allowed to appeal against grades, rather than just through the school or college - as stipulated under the new rule. Sir Keir also said the government should order universities to be flexible. ""All of that needs to be put in place and it needs to be put in place before tomorrow is out,"" he said. England and Northern Ireland: The key information for A-levels and GCSEs will be how pupils are ranked by their school and results in their schools and colleges in previous years. Plus a ""triple lock"" with the highest grade out of the estimated grade, an autumn written exam or a mock exam, dependent on a successful appeal through a school. Vocational qualifications will have estimated results for some courses, but not the same ""triple lock"" Scotlandhas switched to using teachers' predicted grades Waleshas promised students that A-level results will not be lower than their AS-level results. Mr Williamson told the BBC that A-level and GCSE exams next year would go ahead, saying ""we have to put that in place"". ""But we do equally understand we've been through quite exceptional circumstances and that's why we've taken moves to make sure that we can accommodate that."" Mr Williamson say he wants all children back in school in September Mr Williamson said he was determined to see all children in England back in school next month. In the event of local lockdowns, he would ""expect schools to be very much the last thing to be closing as part of that, but if this were necessary, he wants to see ""a continuity of education"". Asked if he could ""look parents in the eye and say that you have done a good job as education secretary of ensuring that children's education has been looked after during this pandemic,"" he said there were ""things that we would take a different approach on"". ""And, you know, where we haven't got everything great, of course, I'm incredibly sorry for that."" He went on: ""But the best thing we can do is make sure that every child is back into school in September. ""Is there anything more that I can do in order to make that happen? Well, if there is, tell me about this, and I will go out there and I will do it. ""We need to see every child back into school - as someone who has a wife and a brother who works in schools, and someone who has children who have, you know, like every child, suffered... I know that the best thing to do is to get everyone back there."" Are you expecting to receive your exam results on Thursday? How would the government's plan affect you?

"Recession is unprecedented, says chancellorRishi Sunak says it is a ""difficult and uncertain time"" as the UK suffers its biggest slump on record.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We're grappling with something unprecedented"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government is ""grappling with something that is unprecedented"" after figures showed the UK economy suffered its biggest slump on record. The economy shrank 20.4% between April and June compared with the first three months of the year. The two consecutive quarters of decline caused by the Covid-19 lockdown pushed the UK officially into recession. Mr Sunak told the BBC that it was ""a very difficult and uncertain time"". Responding to fears that the economic turmoil could trigger mass unemployment, the chancellor said the government should not pretend that ""absolutely everybody can and will be able to go back to the job they had"". However, he added there would be support for creating jobs in new areas. It is the first time the UK has been in recession since 2009. During the lockdown, household spending plunged as shops were ordered to close, while factory and construction output also fell. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds blamed Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the scale of the economic impact, saying: ""A downturn was inevitable after lockdown - but Johnson's jobs crisis wasn't."" Kate Treglown, 44, of Walthamstow in east London, is currently out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She was made redundant from her advertising job at the end of July after being on furlough. ""I worked for 16-and-a-half years for an advertising agency that promoted live events. The work totally dried up in May,"" she told the BBC. Kate says she feels ""stuck in limbo"" - keen to try something new, but unsure of when her children - who she has been home schooling - will return to school. ""There is work. There are jobs available. But when I look on LinkedIn, every single job has hundreds of applications, so competition is very stiff,"" she says. ""I feel women are really carrying the burden of this pandemic with regards to the childcare, whether working or not. It's made me feel quite depressed at times. ""My redundancy money is only going to last so long and I'm scared of what the future holds for us at the moment."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' How can I find a new job? The recession-pandemic double whammy The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy bounced back in June as government restrictions on movement started to ease. On a month-on-month basis, the economy grew by 8.7% in June, after growth of 1.8% in May. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: ""Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck."" The ONS said the collapse in output was driven by the closure of shops, hotels, restaurants, schools and car repair shops. The services sector, which powers four-fifths of the economy, suffered the biggest quarterly decline on record. This video can not be played What is a recession? Factory shutdowns also resulted in the slowest car production since 1954. How could a recession affect me? Is there such a thing as a 'good' or 'bad' recession? PM warns of 'long, long way to go' for UK economy The economic decline was concentrated in April, at the height of lockdown. Official jobs figures released on Tuesday showedthe number of people in workfell by 220,000 between April and June. But in a BBC interview on Wednesday, Mr Sunak did not waver on ending the government's furlough scheme of job subsidies, which is winding down and is due to end entirely after October. ""I think most people would agree that that's not something that is sustainable indefinitely,"" he told the BBC. The opposition has been critical of the government's handling of the economy during the pandemic. Ms Dodds said: ""We've already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we're on course for the worst recession too. That's a tragedy for the British people and it's happened on Boris Johnson's watch."" Referring to the tapering of the furlough scheme, she said the government had ""snatched away wage support for businesses that hadn't even reopened yet"". Laura Tenison, founder of clothing firm JoJo Maman Bebe, told the BBC that the trading performance of her 90 stores was showing huge variations, with those in urban locations suffering from a lack of office workers and tourists. ""Those like York, Windsor, central London, Reading, Norwich - those ones are absolutely dire, really really awful,"" she said. ""I mean, some days we take no money, put it that way. But some of the village stores, the community stores, they're actually doing better than we anticipated. ""I think we have six stores in the portfolio that actually are trading up on last year."" Ms Tenison founded her business in 1993, during a recession. ""This is my third recession in my relatively long life in retail,"" she said. ""We still have to be entrepreneurial,"" she added. ""We have had to close down some areas of business because of Covid. We've had to close our American business, which is just a massive sadness to me. ""Of course, everyone has to look at their overheads, but be creative. Look at those opportunities out there. Recessions bring opportunities."" Business groups urged the government to do more to support the economic recovery. Alpesh Paleja, an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said many companies were struggling to pay their bills on time. He said: ""A sustained recovery is by no means assured. The dual threats of a second wave and slow progress over Brexit negotiations are also particularly concerning."" This video can not be played Anneliese Dodds: The UK has not seen âa big enough bounce back and we really need oneâ While more recent data suggest the recovery is gaining traction, the Bank of England does not expect the economy to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the end of next year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, expects the recovery to take even longer. The UK's slump is one of the biggest among advanced economies, according to preliminary estimates. The economy is more than a fifth smaller than it was at the end of last year. This fall is not as bad as the 22.7% decline in Spain, but about twice the size of contractions in Germany and the US. The chancellor told the BBC that the UK economy had performed worse than its EU counterparts because it was focused on services, hospitality and consumer spending. ""Those kinds of activities comprise a much larger share of our economy than they do for most of our European cousins,"" he said.

Minister makes pledge on A-level grades in Wales,"This video can not be played Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said students wonât get grades lower than their AS-levels A-level grades in Wales this year will be no lower than those the pupils achieved at AS-level the previous year, the education minister has promised. Kirsty Williams made the announcement after England and Scotland changed their grading systems. If a student gets a grade on Thursday below their AS grade a revised one will be issued automatically, she said. Pupils in England are being told theirfinal results will be no lower than their mock exams. The Scottish government announced on Tuesday that all pupils would get the grades predicted by teachers. Exam board says grades will be 'balanced and fair' Sixth-formers reflect on cancelled exams This year's exams were cancelled across the UK because of coronavirus, with governments having to find alternative ways to assess pupils' performance. In Scotland76,000 pupils had their results upgradedafter being lowered by a moderating system which critics claimed was a ""postcode lottery"" as it linked students' results with their schools' past performances. Earlier on Wednesday, the Department for Education in England announced a ""triple lock"" - so results will be the highest out of their estimated grades, their mocks and an optional written exam in the autumn. Other ways had to be found to assess pupils after exams were cancelled In her statement, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government had to make sure such changes ""do not disadvantage Welsh students"". ""Students in Wales, and prospective employers and universities across the UK, can be assured that their A-level grades reflect their work and externally assessed exams,"" she said. ""Almost half the final grade comes from AS-level exams - this is not the situation elsewhere. ""Therefore, in building on that completed work, I am giving a guarantee that a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade. ""If a student receives a final grade tomorrow that is below that of their previous AS grade, then a revised grade will be issued automatically by WJEC."" Ms Williams said she had received assurances that ""students can speak with confidence to their prospective universities regarding their A-level grades"". She said she had asked exams regulator Qualifications Wales and the examinations board the WJEC to ""work closely with the qualifications bodies of the other UK nations as they develop their plans"". ` Coronavirus closed schools and saw summer exams abandoned in Wales The minister said she would ask Qualifications Wales to ""move forward quickly on relevant adjustments to a Welsh appeals process as soon as these plans are clearer, in order to ensure Welsh students are not disadvantaged"". ""All appeals will be free for Welsh students, to ensure there is no financial barrier to ensure learners feel their exam grades are fair,"" she added. National Union of Students president in Wales Becky Ricketts said pupils who did not achieve grades they were satisfied with at AS-level would still be concerned about how their scores were calculated. ""It remains to be seen whether this measure will prevent a results postcode lottery as was seen in Scotland, and we will closely monitor the situation,"" she said. Speaking later, on BBC Wales Today, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government would ""continue to monitor"" developments in England ""to ensure that results are not only fair and robust tomorrow but also the same next week"", when GCSE grades are announced. Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said her intervention on A-levels had been ""inevitable"". ""The promise of a free and extended appeals process is very welcome, and will go some way to alleviating the concerns of many pupils who might not receive the grades they had anticipated,"" he said. ""The fact that Scotland and England had diverged from agreed moderation practices made it extremely difficult for Wales to continue as planned."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said it was ""vital to see a safety net being implemented in Wales to make sure pupils achieved the grade they had worked towards"". ""So tomorrow, I am pleased that pupils' final grades are guaranteed to be not be lower than their previous grade at AS-level,"" she said. Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the Welsh Government ""will be marked down severely for leaving teachers and pupils in limbo - and their hard work, initially, unrewarded"". But she said it was ""welcome that the minister has listened to Plaid Cymru calls for a free and independent appeals process"". Before the education minister's statement, Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless expressed concerns students had lacked sufficient opportunity to prove their academic progress because of Covid-19. ""We believe that the best option would be for the Welsh Government to offer A-level students the chance to sit an exam in the autumn so that we can give students a chance to get a more accurate grade and to maintain the integrity of the exam system,"" he said. David Evans, Wales secretary of National Education Union Cymru, said: ""Whilst it is disappointing that amendments to some grades have come late in the day, we hope that the Welsh Government proposals outlined by the minister will ensure fairness for young people about to receive their grades. ""To many young people, exam grades are a ticket to their futures, and should not reflect where you live, but what you are capable of. ""It has been an unprecedented year for these young people, and grades must reflect their true ability for there to be confidence in the system."" Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of UCAC, added: ""Our members will welcome any steps to ensure that their students receive fair grades and that they will not compare unfavourably with their peers elsewhere in the UK.

Exam board says grades will be 'balanced and fair',"Coronavirus closed schools and saw summer exams abandoned in Wales Every effort is being made to ensure this year's A-level and GCSE results are decided in a ""balanced and fair way"" say exam bosses. The system adopted is the best solution in the circumstances, said the head of Wales' largest exam board, the WJEC. Predicted grades for students will be used along with other information to award results. This year's exams were abandoned when the coronavirus pandemic struck. Results will be announced in August. Candidates will not be able to appeal directly to the WJEC this year, though schools and colleges will be able to challenge the process. Teachers have already sent in grades to the WJEC for all GCSE, AS, A-level and Welsh Bacc candidates, as well as ranking their pupils in order within grades. The information is then processed by the exam board, to make sure it is consistent with how the pupil and school has performed in previous years. Bitesize guide to Covid exam results Could results be affected by bias? Exam limbo - sixth-formers' views The WJEC's chief executive Ian Morgan said it was a ""fairly complex process"". ""There's a huge amount of data being used from a range of different sources,"" he said. He said they were looking for ""broadly similar"" results to previous years. ""What you don't want is too much of a spike either way, either upwards or downwards,"" he added. ""It's about maintaining that stability of the outcomes over a period of time, because we will revert back to the normal processes potentially from next year and the year after, and we need to make sure that we can maintain those standards across the piece."" He said schools, the exam board and other parts of the education system were working together to come up with a fair system for those pupils who have not been able to sit exams. ""We are collectively in extremely difficult times and I think the solution that we've come up with is probably the best solution we could come up with in the circumstances. It is only the second year students at Bro Edern in Cardiff would have sat A-levels But it does pose some challenges. Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Edern became Cardiff's third Welsh medium secondary school when it was founded in 2012. But it means 2020 was only the second year its sixth-formers would have been sitting their A-levels. A formula taking prior school performance into account is more difficult for a school like this, argues head teacher Iwan Pritchard. While he accepted it was important teachers were not over-generous with their predictions for students, he said the schools' view should count. ""We've also got to remember that the pupils haven't had the opportunity to sit the exams, they haven't had the opportunity to show the WJEC and the examiners what they're capable of, and because the predicted grades are based on evidence, it's only fair for the pupils to be awarded the grades that the school felt that they deserved."" A-level students should find out what they have got on 13 August, with GCSE results on 20 August Bro Edern sixth-formers Tomos Evans and Mared Williams summed up their feelings about having no exams. ""I still don't quite understand how they are going to mark my grades,"" said 18-year-old Tomos, ""Whether it's through predicted grades or coursework or work I've done in the classroom."" Mared said it was difficult to judge how she had done without the experience of sitting an exam. ""I'm actually more nervous at this point. I don't know what I'm expecting."" Manon Hammond, a year 12 pupil at Ysgol Plasmawr in Cardiff, said she was ""scared"" about her results. ""What if I get grades I don't want, I may need to rethink my plans in terms of applying for university,"" she said. ""Some people are also going to be helped by this because there's always difficult exams or daysâ¦ but for the most part people are just relatively frustrated because it's so difficult to know when it's taken out of your hands, and also the amount of communication you can have with your teachers makes it really difficult because we're all flying blind."" Charlotte Hawkins from Wrexham is in her final year at Coleg Cambria awaiting her A-Level results and said the process was ""the fairest way possible"". But she added: ""I just feel like it's been taken out of my hands so I'm a bit worried because there's time in the year I found certain parts of the course difficult. And when you're revising at the end of the year you go over things again."" No exams - but there will be results for GCSE and A-level students in August Schools and colleges have sent the exam board ""centre assessed grades"". That is the grade the school or college thinks the pupil would have got had they sat the exams. They also ranked the pupils within grades too. The WJEC then processes it, adding other information, including evidence of how the pupil has performed previously and overall results from the school or college in previous years. So the final grade may not be the same as the grade submitted by the teacher. Exam bosses say they expect the results to look ""broadly similar"" to previous years' grades. The examiners are keen to ensure there is not ""too much of a spike"" either up or down in the grades students are given. It is important for exams in the future, so similar standards are maintained in the coming years. Individual pupils will not be able to appeal, but their school or college can - if it feels processes have not been followed correctly. But it is about the process - not individual grades. Students will have to approach their school or college first. The guidelines also stress those exam centres must explain to students why they may not be pursuing an appeal, and they must also have processes in place for students to appeal that decision. The exam board is looking at every course, subject by subject. The WJEC says it is not necessarily looking at cutting content from course, as some parts may have already been taught. But it is looking at cutting coursework or adding more options within next year's exam papers. Member of the Senedd (MS) Suzy Davies, who is the Welsh Conservative's spokeswoman for Education said she was ""not unimpressed"" with the process. She told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""I'm a little worried about what happens next year. ""There's been talk about changing the content or putting equivalent content in courses next year. I think that still needs to be worked through for people to have confidence for next year's GCSE and A-level students. ""This year all those students would have done five terms out of six, so relying on that information to put towards their grades is reasonable."" ""But next year, as students would have missed a crucial term, they would be right to ask questions about how they're going to be assessed."" Concerns have also been raised on whether a predicted grade system could introduce bias, especially for candidates from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. ""During the lockdown, when we started getting feelers about the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on BAME people, we started these very wide consultations,"" said Patience Bentu, from Race Council Cymru. ""It was through these consultations that we were getting feedback about these anxieties."" The issue has been raised with the Education Minister Kirsty Williams, and they have since received reassurance, Ms Bentu said. ""We're very confident that it will be a fair process,"" she said. ""But that's not to say that we're going to be complacent about it. ""We will keep an eye and watch what happens and just provide the necessary support that we need to.""

"Three dead after passenger train derailsThe driver, a conductor and a passenger were killed in the incident in Aberdeenshire.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","This video can not be played Aerial footage: passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Three people, including the driver and a conductor, have died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire. The third victim was a passenger, ScotRail has confirmed. It is thought the train hit a landslide after heavy rain and thunderstorms which causedflooding and travel disruptionacross Scotland. A major incident was declared and about 30 emergency service vehicles were called to the scene. It involved the 06:38 ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street. Six people have been taken to hospital but their injuries are not believed to be serious. Latest updates on the derailment British Transport Police said the families of the driver and the conductor had been informed and were being supported by specially-trained liaison officers. The derailment took place on the line west of Stonehaven Ch Supt Eddie Wylie said it was believed that all passengers had been accounted for. He added: ""Once the area has been made safe then a full and thorough search will be conducted, which is likely to take some time. ""I know many people will understandably have questions and we will be working closely alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and the Office of Rail and Road to establish the full circumstances of how the train came to derail."" The RMT union said that confirmation of the three deaths, including one of its conductor members, was ""the most dreadful news"". Senior assistant general secretary Mick Lynch added the union's thoughts ""were with the families, colleagues and friends of those who have lost their lives in this tragedy."" Early indications are that the heavy rain could have been the main factor in causing today's crash in Aberdeenshire. One rail industry source says the 06:38 service from Aberdeen to Glasgow was initially halted because of flooding on the line. The driver apparently contacted control to ask permission to switch tracks. It's believed the train reversed and switched to clearer tracks and then continued on its route to Glasgow. Then it is thought the train hit a landslide and derailed. However, this initial, unconfirmed version of events should now be closely examined by the UK's Rail Accident Investigation Branch. Its job is to establish all the facts. The train's computer systems should show key indicators like the speed it was travelling at when it left the track. In recent years incidents like this on the UK's railways have become incredibly rare. The last major derailment was in 2007 in Cumbria. The Queen issued a message of condolence following the crash, saying ""it was with great sadness that I heard of the train derailment"". Her Majesty said the entire Royal Family ""join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who have died and those who have been injured"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the loved ones of those who lost their lives in the ""tragic incident"". ""My thoughts remain with everyone affected,"" she said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC the crash was especially shocking because ""these accidents on the railways are thankfully so rare"". ""Our thoughts are very much with those who have lost their lives and their families and, of course, those that have been injured in the derailment,"" he added. ""Clearly the most important thing now is that the British Transport Police, who are in charge of the investigation, find out exactly what happened and we all work together to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."" The train which derailed was made up of two locomotives - at the front and back - and four carriages. Network Rail has reviewed CCTV footage from the stations at which the service stopped and it's believed there were nine people, including crew, on the train. British Transport Police said its officers had been called to the scene at about 09:43. A few minutes later, Network Rail tweeted that there had been reports of a landslip at Carmont and that services between Dundee and Aberdeen had been halted. The chief executive of Network Rail, Andrew Haines, is cutting short his family holiday in Italy to fly back to the UK. Emergency services at the scene of the derailment Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would visit the site on Thursday ""to try to understand the situation first hand and offer every possible assistance"". NHS Grampian confirmed it was on a ""major incident footing"", and ScotRail said it was assisting the emergency services. The RMT union's Mick Lynch said: ""The facts behind this âincident will need to be established in due course, but at this stage we are focussed on support and assistance and our thoughts are with all those impacted by this tragedy."" This video can not be played Several fire and ambulance crews were called to the scene near Stonehaven Kevin Lindsay, Scotland organiser for the Aslef train drivers union, said: ""Our thoughts tonight are with all those who died, and who were injured, in the tragic accident. ""While it is too early to speculate about the causes of the crash, it would seem that the appalling weather conditions in the area - the torrential rain - resulted in a landslip which, in turn, caused the train to derail."" He added that the train had caught fire after rolling down a steep embankment. Aberdeenshire Provost and Mearns councillor Bill Howatson said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. This is a harrowing time for all concerned."" Meanwhile four firefighters were injured while responding the derailment. BBC Scotland understands they suffered minor injuries after a vehicle collided with them. Two of the firefighters were admitted to hospital as a precautionary measure but were released shortly afterwards. It's long been recognised that landslips are one of the greatest risks to Britain's railways and that a changing climate will make them more likely. Heatwaves and droughts can dry out the steep embankments beside the tracks, and over the years will start to weaken them. Add to that the effects of heavy rain, of the kind seen just now in Scotland, saturating and eroding the soil, and undermining its strength. And with rising global temperatures set to bring extremes of weather never anticipated by the Victorian engineers who built the lines, Network Rail has been studying how best to keep the tracks safe. But it admits that ""we know we can't rebuild every mile of railway"". The most recent multiple fatalities on the UK's railways were in South Wales in 2019, when two railway workers died after being struck by a Great Western train near Port Talbot. They were working without a lookout. In November 2004, an intercity train travelling on the Reading and Taunton line hit a car on a level crossing, derailing a train and killing seven people and injuring more than 70 others. In May 2002, an east coast main line train derailed because of an undetected points failure. Coaches rolled and came to rest on platforms. Seven people were killed and 76 injured. In February 2001, 10 people were killed in the Great Heck Rail Crash near Selby when a train struck a Land Rover that had rolled onto the track because the driver had fallen asleep, and was derailed into the path of another train. In October 1999, at Ladbroke Grove in London, 31 people were killed in a head-on collision after a driver passed a signal. Are you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

Teen pulled from river after falling near bridge,"This video can not be played Blackweir river rescue was 'a bit scary', says eyewitness A teenage boy was rescued from the River Taff after falling into the water near Cardiff's Blackweir Bridge, the ambulance service has said. Witnesses said firefighters performed CPR on the 17-year-old and that he was injured while swimming. He was taken to the University Hospital of Wales after emergency services attended the scene at 14:30 BST. Witnesses said PCSOs arrived at 16:35 BST and asked teenagers to stop jumping in the water. The bridge was boarded up earlier this year, but the teenagers climbed round the panels. About 100 youngsters, some with inflatables, were in or around the weir. Witness Iolo Wyn James said he saw the emergency services at the scene and watched firefighters carry out CPR. ""It was a bit scary really,"" he said. A spokesman for South Wales Police said the teen was ""conscious and breathing"" when taken to hospital. A PCSO looks on as a boy leaps into the water He added: ""A number of young people who were in the river this afternoon received advice from officers regarding the dangers of swimming at Blackweir. ""Please could we remind parents to speak to their children about how dangerous this is due to the water temperature, underwater hazards and undercurrents.""

Kamala Harris joins Biden in first campaign event,"This video can not be played Harris: 'America is crying out for leadership' Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris have attacked ""whining"" President Donald Trump as an incompetent leader who has left the US ""in tatters"". The pair held their first campaign event together, a day after Mr Biden unveiled Ms Harris as his number two. President Trump hit back, saying Ms Harris had ""dropped like a rock"" in her own presidential bid. Mr Biden will face Mr Trump, a Republican, in November's election. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Wednesday's event at a school in Wilmington, Delaware, was not open to the public, with Mr Biden, 77, citing coronavirus prevention needs. Both candidates walked on stage wearing masks to address a group of masked journalists. Mr Biden noted that Ms Harris, a US senator from California, was the first woman of colour to serve as a presidential running mate for a major US party. Mr Biden said: ""The choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time."" He continued: ""Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala, quote, nasty, whining about how she is, quote, mean to his appointees. ""It's not a surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history. This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick ""Is anybody surprised that Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman, or strong women across the board?"" He also attacked Mr Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, the unemployment rate and ""his politics of racist rhetoric that appeals to division"". Coming to the podium next, Ms Harris said: ""I am ready to get to work."" This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career The 55-year-old former prosecutor told reporters: ""Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it's all on the line."" Ms Harris -  the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica - continued: ""America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. ""He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."" Viewpoint: Harris pick 'symbolic and substantive' Countries pile in on Kamala Harris celebrations Much has been made of the differences between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris since he announced her as his running mate on Tuesday afternoon. Biden is more than 20 years her senior. He's a white man, son of working-class parents in Pennsylvania. She's a multiracial woman from California, daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. In their first joint appearance on Wednesday, however, they both spoke about what they had in common. ""Her story is America's story,"" Mr Biden said. ""Different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials."" Ms Harris echoed this, saying that the two candidates are ""cut from the same cloth"". It's the kind of message you'd imagine would come from a campaign that's calling for national healing and unity. Of course, that didn't stop either candidate from going on the attack against their general election opponents. It's the first salvo for this ticket in what is sure to be a bare-knuckle fight for the White House. How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden At a White House news conference, Mr Trump disparaged Ms Harris' failed bid for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, during which she fiercely attacked Mr Biden's record on race. Mr Trump said: ""I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing, and she left angry, she left mad. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman, where she, I guess, believed the woman. ""Now all of a sudden she's running to be vice-president saying how wonderful he is."" Last year Mr Biden was accused by a number of women of unwelcome contact, including touching and kissing. Mr Biden acknowledged at the time that he must respect personal space. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? A more serious allegation surfaced this year from a former aide who accused Mr Biden of sexually assaulting her in the halls of Congress in 1993. He denied the claim. Ms Harris, who had dropped out of the presidential race at that point, said Tara Reade ""has a right to tell her story"". Whatâs behind the Biden sexual harassment allegation The sexual allegations against Donald Trump California state records,externalalso show Mr Trump donated to Ms Harris when she was a candidate for the state's attorney general in 2011 and 2013, while he was still a private citizen. Shortly before the Biden-Harris event, Mr Trump goaded Mr Biden for remaining at home for much of the campaign so far amid the pandemic lockdown. During a White House meeting with teachers who said that children learnt better in class than remotely, the president asked a asked: ""So if you're a presidential candidate and you're sitting in a basement and you're looking at a computer, that's not a good thing?"" He also tweeted an attack on the Biden-Harris ticket, saying they would put Senator Cory Booker, who is black, in charge of low-income housing. Critics said the tweet was racist. Mr Biden will formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination at next week's convention, which will largely be a virtual event because of the pandemic. He became the party's presumptive nominee in April after Bernie Sanders, his only remaining competitor, ended his own campaign. Meanwhile Mr Trump will be nominated for a second four-year term in the White House by his fellow Republicans at their party convention a week later. A 10-week campaign will follow before voters deliver their verdict in the general election on 3 November. Mr Trump and Mr Biden will hold three debates in September and October. Ms Harris will debate Vice-President Mike Pence in October. The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Who is Kamala Harris? Video, 00:03:48Who is Kamala Harris? Trump calls Harris 'meanest' US senator.

London sees hottest stretch since 1960sTemperatures pass 34C in the capital for sixth day in a row as storms are forecast across the UK.UK,"Central London has seen the longest stretch of high temperatures in almost six decades, as more thunderstorms are forecast across the UK. The Met Office said temperatures surpassed 34C in the city for the sixth day in a row - the first time that has happened since at least 1961. An amber storm warning is in place for much of England and Wales, including Liverpool, Bristol, Oxford and Cardiff. Flooding, damage to buildings, travel disruption and power cuts are expected. A yellow storm warning - meaning there is a small chance of flooding and travel disruption - has been issued elsewhere in England and Wales, as well as in parts of Scotland, for Wednesday night. Major incident after thunderstorms bring flooding South west England full to capacity, say police More homes without water as heatwave continues The yellow warning applies to parts of England and Wales until Monday night next week. The Met Office also warned of potential damage to buildings from lightning strikes or strong winds, and 30 to 40mm of rain falling in less than an hour in some places. It comes aftertorrential rain and lightning lashed large parts of Scotland on Tuesday night. Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire saw flooding overnight Three people have died after a passenger train derailednear Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire. It is thought the train hit a landslide after heavy rain and thunderstorms. A major incident was also declared in Fife. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it received more than 1,000 emergency calls overnight due to the severe weather. Ten properties in Lancashire were also affected by flooding following overnight storms, according to the Environment Agency. However, hot weather has persisted elsewhere in the UK. Sunbathers took to Southsea beach on Tuesday Devon and Cornwall Policewarned the south west of England is ""full to capacity"", leading to ""unprecedented demand"" for 999 services. The force said it saw an increase in anti-social behaviour and public order offences on Saturday and Sunday. Assistant Chief Constable Jim Colwell said the weekend's events, spurred on by the hot weather, had forced officers to attend a ""plethora of different incidents"". In Sussex,more homeowners had water supplies cut off or restricted on Wednesday. At least 300 householders had already been without tap water since Friday. Steve Andrews, head of central operations for South East Water, said more than 150 million litres of extra water were being pumped into the network as the UK heatwave continues.

Teenager guilty of murdering teaching assistantThe 17-year-old boy killed Lindsay Birbeck before moving her body in a bin and burying her.Lancashire,"Lindsay Birbeck was reported missing after failing to return home A 17-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering a teaching assistant whose body was found in a shallow grave. Lindsay Birbeck, 47, went missing on 12 August 2019 while walking in a wooded area and was later found buried in Accrington Cemetery, Lancashire. Preston Crown Court heard her attacker had been prowling the woods for lone females. The boy admitted moving her body in a wheelie bin and claimed he buried her for a stranger who promised him money. The verdict came a year to the day since Mrs Birbeck went missing. Mrs Birbeck's 17-year-old daughter Sarah raised the alarm when her mother did not return from her afternoon walk to have tea at 18:00 BST. The mother-of-two had left her home in Burnley Road, Accrington, to stroll in a nearby wooded area known as the Coppice. Her attacker, who was 16 at the time, is thought to have killed Mrs Birbeck shortly after she entered the Coppice. He attended a police station several days after her naked body was discovered wrapped in two plastic bags following a police CCTV appeal. The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, denied murder and manslaughter. But he admitted dragging a bin, with Mrs Birbeck inside, from the Coppice across Burnley Road to the cemetery where he buried her. In court:Mike Stevens, BBC News Police trawled through around 3,000 hours of CCTV footage and found a young man who was seen repeatedly pulling a blue wheelie bin in and around Huncoat. A similar-looking bin was found in Accrington Cemetery some days earlier. After sharing the footage in a public appeal, the 16-year-old boy arrived at a police station in Blackburn with his family. Home Office pathologist Dr Naomi Carter said the injuries Mrs Birbeck sustained were the most severe of their kind which she had seen in her 25-year career. He claimed a man had approached him with the promise of a large cash reward if he disposed of the body. He stated: ""I have not met this man before. I have not met him since, nor have I had any contact with him. ""He has not paid me any money. He told me that he would leave the money for me near where the body had been at first once everything was clear."" The prosecution said the defendant's account was ""implausible fiction"". The court heard another woman said a lone male wearing a grey tracksuit with his hood up had followed her on her walk shortly before Mrs Birbeck entered the Coppice. She said she feared for her safety and he was getting closer when she startled him by glancing back. A post-mortem examination concluded the cause of Mrs Birbeck's death was neck injuries. No evidence of a sexual assault could be found. An attempt had also been made to cut off a leg, possibly with a saw. Outside court, Mrs Birbeck's daughter said: ""Our lives have been utterly destroyed by the evil, cowardly behaviour of the defendant and the horrific manner in which she was murdered. ""My mum went for a walk on a sunny afternoon in August and never came home, it's unthinkable that something as brutal as this could happen in our close community to someone that was loved so very dearly.""

"Covid death recount reduces UK toll by 5,000Deaths recorded in England had included people who tested positive months before they died.","A review of how deaths from coronavirus are counted in England has reduced the UK death toll by more than 5,000, to 41,329, the government has announced. The recalculation is based on a new definition of who has died from Covid. Previously, people in England who died at any point following a positive test, regardless of cause, were counted in the figures. But there will now be a cut-off of 28 days, providing a more accurate picture of the epidemic. This brings England's measure in line with the other UK nations. The new methodology for counting deaths means the total number of people in the UK who have died from Covid-19 comes down from 46,706 to 41,329 - a reduction of 12%. And figures for deaths in England for the most recent week of data - 18 to 24 July - will drop by 75%, from 442 to 111. Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""The way we count deaths in people with Covid-19 in England was originally chosen to avoid underestimating deaths caused by the virus in the early stages of the pandemic."" But he said the new methods of calculating deaths from the virus would give ""crucial information about both recent trends and the overall mortality burden due to Covid-19"". Calculating the total number of deaths linked to coronavirus is far from straightforward. It seemed very odd when we learned last month that PHE's figures included everyone who had tested positive, even if they died months afterwards and their death may have had another cause. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland's 28-day limit between a positive test and death looked reasonable. But even so, that measure does not include those who might have been on a ventilator for more than 28 days. There is no yardstick endorsed by the World Health Organization and PHE argued there was no single ideal way of working out the total. In future, death numbers for England will be published using both 28-day and 60-day cut off points. The 28-day limit will, however, be the headline measure and will at least achieve consistency across the UK. Cutting around 5,400 from the death total will be a talking point among statisticians. But it won't make any difference to tens of thousands of families who have been bereaved because of the virus. The health secretary in England, Matt Hancock, called for a review into the way deaths from coronavirus were calculated in July. Hancock calls for urgent review on Covid death data It followed concerns raised by Oxford scientists that this was being carried out differently across the four nations of the UK. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the count only included people who died within four weeks of a positive test. Someone who stayed in intensive care with Covid-19 for five weeks and died would not be counted as a coronavirus death, for example. Matt Hancock called for a review into the way deaths were calculated in England In England, there was no time limit. Someone who recovered from Covid-19 in March and died in a car crash in July would have been counted as a coronavirus death. Now the UK's four chief medical officers have decided to use a single, consistent measure and publish the number of deaths that occurred within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test confirmed in a lab, every day. Every week for England, a new set of figures will be published showing the number of deaths that occur within 60 days of a positive test. Deaths that occur after 60 days - such as those who have been in intensive care for many months - will also be added in if Covid-19 appears on the death certificate. Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, from the University of Nottingham, said the two new measures were ""sensible"". ""The 28 days is widely used in many countries and England is now the same as the rest of the UK,"" he said. ""The previous measure of always being a Covid death, even if recovered, was unscientific. ""As Covid deaths fall, the number of recovered patients, particularly the very old and those with severe underlying conditions, are now dying from these conditions and not Covid-19."" Prof Neal added: ""These non-Covid deaths in survivors would become an ever increasing percentage of the England Covid deaths being reported. It had become essentially useless for epidemiological monitoring."" BRITAIN'S CANCER CRISIS:How has cancer care been impacted by Covid-19? DIET AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEMHow important is a healthy diet?

More homes without water as heatwave continues,"Bottled water collection points have been set up by South East Water More homeowners in Sussex have had water supplies cut off or restricted, after 300 householders were left without tap water for five days. South East Water said supplies were restored overnight to the areas of West Sussex which had been without water since Friday. But the company said other customers in East Sussex woke up on Wednesday to ""low pressure or no water"". The water supplier said it was setting up bottled water stations. The latest problems are hitting customers in Rotherfield, Crowborough, Mayfield, Hadlow Down and Five Ashes,as well as some in Heathfield,external. Gary Walker, from Warninglid, said he had been forced to ""manually remove waste from the toilet and bury it in the garden"". Di Holwood, from Bolnore near Haywards Heath, said it had been ""horrendous"" living without water since Friday, but her supply had returned at about 02:00 BST. ""I have no confidence this water is going to stay on for more than a few hours."" Klara Verrell's nursery in Haywards Heath had to close due to the lack of water Klara Verrell said Perfect Start Nursery, where she works, had to close down due to the water shortage. She said: ""It's not just about having bottled water, because it needs to be hot water that children wash their hands with. Some of the older children might wash their hands 20 times a day. ""Without running water we just can't manage it."" MP for Mid Sussex Mims Davies said the issue was ""embarrassing"" for South East Water Mims Davies, MP for Mid Sussex, described the water shortage and lack of communication from South East Water as ""shambolic"". She said: ""We all recognise water companies will have difficult times but this feels like very poor communication. ""It's been shambolic and diabolical. People have arrived at water stations to find no water there, no details what time they're open or closed. This could've been much better. It's been absolutely abominable and it's been embarrassing for South East Water."" Customers are being urged to avoid the use of hoses and to keep water for drinking, cooking and hygeine Customers in Haywards Heath, Cuckfield, Warninglid, Slaugham and Bolney in West Sussex saw water supplies return overnight. Steve Andrews, head of central operations for South East Water, apologised and said: ""Supplies have been restored overnight and we are more hopeful we will be able to maintain those supplies throughout the day. ""We are continuing to ask customers to only use water for essential use."" He said more than 150 million litres of extra water were being pumped into the network as the UK heatwave continues.

Met condemns 'social media trial' over MP car stop,"Dawn Butler said she was pulled over by police while travelling through Hackney A senior Met Police official has condemned the ""trial by social media"" faced by officers who stopped a car carrying a Labour MP. Former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler accused the force ofracial profiling after the stop on Sunday. She shared footage of the incident on her Twitter account, which has spread widely on social media. Deputy Commissioner Sir Steve House defended the officers, who he said ""acted professionally and politely"". He said while officers ""expect to be scrutinised"", there are ""existing, appropriate and proportionate processes"" for complaints. Sir Steve said: ""The increasingly routine trial by social media is unfair and damaging to individual officers and has the potential to undermine the role our communities need us to do to protect them, and keep them safe from violence."" Dawn Butler filmed her discussions with the police officers who pulled her over The Met said the stop was a mistake caused by an officer incorrectly entering the car's registration number. Ms Butler said the BMW police stopped on Sunday was being driven by a black male friend. Officers said the car was registered in North Yorkshire and took the keys while checking the registration, she said. They then admitted there had been a mistake, that it was registered to the driver and apologised, she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Steve said: ""The officers were not initially aware of this problem and as a result felt, with good reason, that they should do further checks on the car by stopping it and engaging with the occupants. ""I expect officers to have professional curiosity and I would have done the same."" Earlier this week Ms Butler said she had agreed to meet local police commandersto discuss ""taking the bias out of the system"". What is stop and search and what are my rights? Do police racism inquiries change anything? Sir Steve said he had discussed with Ms Butler her concerns over why the stop was made, adding she had no complaint about how it was conducted. He said the officers were from the Violent Crime Task Force and were in the area ""as part of our proactive work to protect communities from violence"". Sir Steve went on to condemn ""the abuse that some on social media have directed"" at Ms Butler. Police are ""working to support"" her over the online abuse, he added.

Harris to join Biden in first event as running mates,"This video can not be played Harris: 'America is crying out for leadership' Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris have attacked ""whining"" President Donald Trump as an incompetent leader who has left the US ""in tatters"". The pair held their first campaign event together, a day after Mr Biden unveiled Ms Harris as his number two. President Trump hit back, saying Ms Harris had ""dropped like a rock"" in her own presidential bid. Mr Biden will face Mr Trump, a Republican, in November's election. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Wednesday's event at a school in Wilmington, Delaware, was not open to the public, with Mr Biden, 77, citing coronavirus prevention needs. Both candidates walked on stage wearing masks to address a group of masked journalists. Mr Biden noted that Ms Harris, a US senator from California, was the first woman of colour to serve as a presidential running mate for a major US party. Mr Biden said: ""The choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time."" He continued: ""Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala, quote, nasty, whining about how she is, quote, mean to his appointees. ""It's not a surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history. This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick ""Is anybody surprised that Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman, or strong women across the board?"" He also attacked Mr Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, the unemployment rate and ""his politics of racist rhetoric that appeals to division"". Coming to the podium next, Ms Harris said: ""I am ready to get to work."" This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career The 55-year-old former prosecutor told reporters: ""Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it's all on the line."" Ms Harris -  the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica - continued: ""America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. ""He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."" Viewpoint: Harris pick 'symbolic and substantive' Countries pile in on Kamala Harris celebrations Much has been made of the differences between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris since he announced her as his running mate on Tuesday afternoon. Biden is more than 20 years her senior. He's a white man, son of working-class parents in Pennsylvania. She's a multiracial woman from California, daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. In their first joint appearance on Wednesday, however, they both spoke about what they had in common. ""Her story is America's story,"" Mr Biden said. ""Different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials."" Ms Harris echoed this, saying that the two candidates are ""cut from the same cloth"". It's the kind of message you'd imagine would come from a campaign that's calling for national healing and unity. Of course, that didn't stop either candidate from going on the attack against their general election opponents. It's the first salvo for this ticket in what is sure to be a bare-knuckle fight for the White House. How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden At a White House news conference, Mr Trump disparaged Ms Harris' failed bid for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, during which she fiercely attacked Mr Biden's record on race. Mr Trump said: ""I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing, and she left angry, she left mad. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman, where she, I guess, believed the woman. ""Now all of a sudden she's running to be vice-president saying how wonderful he is."" Last year Mr Biden was accused by a number of women of unwelcome contact, including touching and kissing. Mr Biden acknowledged at the time that he must respect personal space. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? A more serious allegation surfaced this year from a former aide who accused Mr Biden of sexually assaulting her in the halls of Congress in 1993. He denied the claim. Ms Harris, who had dropped out of the presidential race at that point, said Tara Reade ""has a right to tell her story"". Whatâs behind the Biden sexual harassment allegation The sexual allegations against Donald Trump California state records,externalalso show Mr Trump donated to Ms Harris when she was a candidate for the state's attorney general in 2011 and 2013, while he was still a private citizen. Shortly before the Biden-Harris event, Mr Trump goaded Mr Biden for remaining at home for much of the campaign so far amid the pandemic lockdown. During a White House meeting with teachers who said that children learnt better in class than remotely, the president asked a asked: ""So if you're a presidential candidate and you're sitting in a basement and you're looking at a computer, that's not a good thing?"" He also tweeted an attack on the Biden-Harris ticket, saying they would put Senator Cory Booker, who is black, in charge of low-income housing. Critics said the tweet was racist. Mr Biden will formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination at next week's convention, which will largely be a virtual event because of the pandemic. He became the party's presumptive nominee in April after Bernie Sanders, his only remaining competitor, ended his own campaign. Meanwhile Mr Trump will be nominated for a second four-year term in the White House by his fellow Republicans at their party convention a week later. A 10-week campaign will follow before voters deliver their verdict in the general election on 3 November. Mr Trump and Mr Biden will hold three debates in September and October. Ms Harris will debate Vice-President Mike Pence in October. The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Who is Kamala Harris? Video, 00:03:48Who is Kamala Harris? Trump calls Harris 'meanest' US senator.

Met condemn 'social media trial' over MP car stop,"Dawn Butler said she was pulled over by police while travelling through Hackney A senior Met Police official has condemned the ""trial by social media"" faced by officers who stopped a car carrying a Labour MP. Former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler accused the force ofracial profiling after the stop on Sunday. She shared footage of the incident on her Twitter account, which has spread widely on social media. Deputy Commissioner Sir Steve House defended the officers, who he said ""acted professionally and politely"". He said while officers ""expect to be scrutinised"", there are ""existing, appropriate and proportionate processes"" for complaints. Sir Steve said: ""The increasingly routine trial by social media is unfair and damaging to individual officers and has the potential to undermine the role our communities need us to do to protect them, and keep them safe from violence."" Dawn Butler filmed her discussions with the police officers who pulled her over The Met said the stop was a mistake caused by an officer incorrectly entering the car's registration number. Ms Butler said the BMW police stopped on Sunday was being driven by a black male friend. Officers said the car was registered in North Yorkshire and took the keys while checking the registration, she said. They then admitted there had been a mistake, that it was registered to the driver and apologised, she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Steve said: ""The officers were not initially aware of this problem and as a result felt, with good reason, that they should do further checks on the car by stopping it and engaging with the occupants. ""I expect officers to have professional curiosity and I would have done the same."" Earlier this week Ms Butler said she had agreed to meet local police commandersto discuss ""taking the bias out of the system"". What is stop and search and what are my rights? Do police racism inquiries change anything? Sir Steve said he had discussed with Ms Butler her concerns over why the stop was made, adding she had no complaint about how it was conducted. He said the officers were from the Violent Crime Task Force and were in the area ""as part of our proactive work to protect communities from violence"". Sir Steve went on to condemn ""the abuse that some on social media have directed"" at Ms Butler. Police are ""working to support"" her over the online abuse, he added.

Covid A-level party warning issued by police chief,"Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey urged A-level students to ""be mindful of the regulations"" Students celebrating their A-level results have been reminded by a police chief not to spoil ""a joyful occasion"" by ignoring coronavirus lockdown rules. Greater Manchester's Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey warned against organising or attending parties, saying fixed penalty notices could be issued. The conurbation saw 1,106 reported breaches of lockdown rules last weekend - 25% more than the previous weekend. Enhanced Covid-19 restrictions werereintroduced in the area on 31 July. New legislation came into effect five days later for Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and West Yorkshire. The rules ban those from separate households mixing with each other in their homes or gardens. People are allowed to visit pubs, bars and restaurants with members of their own household, however. Of the 1,106 reports received by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) between 7 and 9 August, 540 related to house parties, while 48 pubs were accused of breaching lockdown regulations. Officers attended 40 incidents, arrested 10 people and issued 11 fixed penalty notices. Mr Bailey said: ""I understand that A-level results are coming out this week and people will rightly want to celebrate. ""However, please be mindful of the Covid-19 regulations in your celebrations as we do not want to spoil what should be a joyous occasion by issuing fixed penalty notices at any house parties or illegal gatherings. ""It is worth noting that recent spikes in Greater Manchester which led to the additional restrictions were centred around house parties with 17 to 18-year-olds."" Stricter restrictions were reintroduced in Manchester on 31 July Mr Bailey added that ""where people continually flout the rules, we will act"". A force spokesman said following the reintroduction of restrictions, officers were told only to enforce ""blatant breaches"". Officers stopped an ""illegal car meet"" in Wigan and two large gatherings in Salford and Rochdale, he added. Urging people to follow the rules, Mr Bailey said Greater Manchester was ""very much still in the middle of a pandemic"" and while he understood the desire to ""return to normality as soon as possible"", the regulations must be followed.

Russia rejects mounting Covid-19 vaccine concerns,"Russia's health minister (l) has rejected widespread scepticism over the vaccine programme Russia has dismissed mounting international concern over the safety of its locally developed Covid-19 vaccine as ""absolutely groundless"". On Tuesday, it said a vaccine had been given regulatory approval after less than two months of testing on humans. But experts were quick to raise concerns about the speed of Russia's work, and a growing list of countries have expressed scepticism. Scientists in Germany, France, Spain and the US have all urged caution. ""It seems our foreign colleagues are sensing the specific competitive advantages of the Russian drug and are trying to express opinions that... are absolutely groundless,"" Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday. He added that the vaccine would be available soon. ""The first packages of the medical vaccine... will be received within the next two weeks, primarily for doctors,"" Mr Murashko said. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? Encouraging results in vaccine trials Russian spies target Covid-19 vaccine research Russian officials have said they plan to start mass vaccination in October. The announcement on Tuesday was made by President Vladimir Putin, who said the vaccine had passed all the required checks and his daughter had already been given it. But the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was in talks with Russian authorities about undertaking a review of the vaccine, which has been named Sputnik-V. It is not among the organisation's list of six vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials, which involve more widespread testing in humans. The progress Russia says it has made on a coronavirus vaccine has been met with scepticism by health officials and media outlets in the US and Europe. On Wednesday, Germany's health minister expressed concern that it had not been properly tested. ""It can be dangerous to start vaccinating millions... of people too early because it could pretty much kill the acceptance of vaccination if it goes wrong,"" Jens Spahn told local media. ""Based on everything we know... this has not been sufficiently tested,"" he added. ""It's not about being first somehow - it's about having a safe vaccine."" This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Elsewhere in Europe, Isabelle Imbert, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Marseille, said promising a cure too early could be ""very dangerous"". ""We do not know the methodology or the results of their clinical trials,"" she told Le Parisien. And in the US, the country's top virus expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said he doubted Russia's claims. ""I hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective,"" he told National Geographic. ""I seriously doubt that they've done that."" The vaccine is yet to complete a larger study involving thousands of people Meanwhile the Moscow-based Association of Clinical Trials Organizations (Acto), which represents the world's top drug companies in Russia, urged the health ministry to postpone approval until after phase-three trials. Acto executive director Svetlana Zavidova told the Russian MedPortal site that a decision on mass vaccination had been carried out after combined first- and second-phase tests on 76 people, and that it was impossible to confirm the efficacy of a drug on this basis. But some countries have reacted more positively to Moscow's announcement. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte offered to test the vaccine himself. ""I believe the vaccine that you have produced is really good for humanity,"" he said. ""I will be the first one to be experimented on."" And Israel said it would enter negotiations to buy it if it is found to be a ""serious product"". Russian scientists said early-stage trials of the vaccine had been completedand the results were a success. The Russian vaccine uses adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that usually causes the common cold, to trigger an immune response. In July Russian scientists announced that early-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute had been completed But the vaccine's approval by Russian regulators comes before the completion of a larger study involving thousands of people, known as a phase-three trial. Experts consider these trials an essential part of the testing process. Despite this, Mr Murashko said on Tuesday the vaccine had ""proven to be highly effective and safe"", hailing it as a big step towards ""humankind's victory"" over Covid-19. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? WITHOUT SYMPTOMS:The mystery of 'silent spreaders' Russia has likened the search for a vaccine to the space race contested by the Soviet Union and the US during the Cold War. Russia has previously been accused by the UK, US and Canada of seeking to steal research related to Covid-19. More than 100 vaccines around the world are in early development, with some of those being tested on people in clinical trials. Despite rapid progress, most experts think any vaccine would not become widely available until mid-2021.

'We've been waiting months for a flight refund',"The couple have still not recovered their Â£1,742 David Hanson had to cancel a dream trip to New Zealand because of Covid-19 - but five months on he's still waiting for a refund. The Manchester man was due to fly in March with girlfriend Jemima Rodwell, but the flight with Emirates was cancelled with three days' notice when the Foreign Office advised against travel. ""I'm extremely frustrated, really angry just how they can get away with it in terms of being so long,"" he said. The airline, agency he used to book the flight, and his insurer have been little help, he said. And he's not alone in struggling to get money back months after cancelled plans. A new report by consumer group Which? says airlines are still taking too long to refund passengers. It comes after the airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said last month that it was ""not satisfied"" that Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair or Tui were processing refunds quickly enough. Which? says that despite the intervention from the CAA, refunds are still too slow and airlines are ""falling short"" of promises made to the regulator. David and Jemima had booked their trip because she was maid of honour at her best friend's wedding. ""We had a full trip planned with the campervan, and then we were going to end up in Queensland for the wedding,"" he told the BBC. ""We had spent months planning, it was going to be a real dream trip. ""However, nearly five months later we are still yet to receive a refund on our flights totalling Â£1,742, which is a lot of money for us."" He said the couple had spent ""months and months"" chasing the booking agency, airline and their insurer but they ""seem to have got nowhere. ""You end up just feel really powerless."" The BBC has approached Emirates for comment. 'My once-in-lifetime holiday hasn't been refunded' 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' The CAA's report last month said Ryanair was taking 10 weeks or even longer to process refunds and asked the airline to reduce that time. But Which? says that, despite promises, the airline is still taking months to process some refunds. Pupil support worker Kirsty Ness from Edinburgh was due to fly to Gdansk in Poland with her boyfriend in early April, just after schools broke up for Easter in Scotland. But Ryanair cancelled their flight because of the pandemic. Despite asking for a cash refund, Ms Ness says she was initially sent a voucher to rebook. After five phone calls and dozens of emails, Ms Ness says she finally received her money this week. ""As a low-paid key worker Â£126 is a lot of money not to have for five months,"" she told the BBC. Ryanair said it had issued more than Â£670m in refunds and had cleared over 90% of its claims backlog. Virgin Atlantic, meanwhile, made customers wait up to 120 days for a refund, the CAA said in its July report. It was the only airline threatened with action by the regulator, which reviewed the refund waiting times of 18 major airlines. But Which? said it had heard from two passengers who had been waiting for 130 days for a refund for flights cancelled in March. It said it had also heard from a Tui customer who had still not received a refund for travel cancelled in April. Tui said it now issued refunds automatically and normally processed cash refunds within two weeks. Virgin said it was ""very sorry"" that a ""small number"" of customers had to wait more than 120 days for a refund. Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? ""Time after time, Which? has exposed airlines breaking the law on refunds for cancelled flights due to the pandemic and treating their passengers unfairly, and we're concerned that they now feel empowered to do as they please without fear of punishment,"" said Rory Boland, Editor of Which? Travel. ""Passengers must be able to rely on a regulator that has effective powers to protect their rights - especially at a time of unprecedented turmoil,"" he said. Which? has called for the CAA to be given new powers to take action against airlines that are slow to refund passengers. ""The government needs to step up and ensure the CAA has the tools it needs to hold airlines to account, or risk consumer trust in the travel industry being damaged beyond repair,"" Mr Boland said. In a statement, a CAA spokesman said: ""While our initial review has concluded, we have been clear that we will continue to monitor performance closely and should any airline fall short of the commitments they have made to us, we will take further action as required."" The report from Which? comes as rail companies have called on the government to tax some flights more heavily. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators, says train companies should pay less tax on the electricity they use to power trains to encourage greener travel. The cost, they say, could be covered by airlines paying more tax on flights, possibly on routes which could be made by rail instead. But the demand has not gone down well with airlines, which say that the railways are heavily subsidised by the government.

Students warn mock grades 'make mockery' of exams,"Schools in England can appeal for an upgrade if their students' A-level and GCSE results are lower than mock exams. The Department for Education has announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. But the Ofqual exams watchdog says it cannot say how appeals over mocks might be verified until next week. Ofqual said in a statement it was ""working urgently"" to ""determine what standards of evidence will be required for the appeal"". The National Union of Students said using mock results risked ""making a mockery"" of the exam system. And head teachers attacked the change, the day before A-level results are published, as ""panicked and chaotic"". England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was a ""safety net"" for those getting estimated grades this summer. In Wales, in another ""guarantee"" over grades, Education Minister Kirsty Williams has promised that ""a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade"". The change means that if pupils get an estimated grade lower than their mock exam they can appeal - but this will have to be through their school, with the terms for approving appeals still to be decided by the exam watchdog, Ofqual.

Students warn mock grades 'make mockery' of examsLast-minute changes have been made to the way A-level and GCSE results in England are to be decided.Family & EducationComments,"Schools in England can appeal for an upgrade if their students' A-level and GCSE results are lower than mock exams. The Department for Education has announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. But the Ofqual exams watchdog says it cannot say how appeals over mocks might be verified until next week. Ofqual said in a statement it was ""working urgently"" to ""determine what standards of evidence will be required for the appeal"". The National Union of Students said using mock results risked ""making a mockery"" of the exam system. And head teachers attacked the change, the day before A-level results are published, as ""panicked and chaotic"". England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was a ""safety net"" for those getting estimated grades this summer. In Wales, in another ""guarantee"" over grades, Education Minister Kirsty Williams has promised that ""a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade"".

"'We've been waiting months for a flight refund'David Hanson's dream holiday was cancelled, but like many Brits he's been waiting months for a refund.BusinessComments","The couple have still not recovered their Â£1,742 David Hanson had to cancel a dream trip to New Zealand because of Covid-19 - but five months on he's still waiting for a refund. The Manchester man was due to fly in March with girlfriend Jemima Rodwell, but the flight with Emirates was cancelled with three days' notice when the Foreign Office advised against travel. ""I'm extremely frustrated, really angry just how they can get away with it in terms of being so long,"" he said. The airline, agency he used to book the flight, and his insurer have been little help, he said. And he's not alone in struggling to get money back months after cancelled plans. A new report by consumer group Which? says airlines are still taking too long to refund passengers. It comes after the airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said last month that it was ""not satisfied"" that Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair or Tui were processing refunds quickly enough. Which? says that despite the intervention from the CAA, refunds are still too slow and airlines are ""falling short"" of promises made to the regulator. David and Jemima had booked their trip because she was maid of honour at her best friend's wedding. ""We had a full trip planned with the campervan, and then we were going to end up in Queensland for the wedding,"" he told the BBC. ""We had spent months planning, it was going to be a real dream trip. ""However, nearly five months later we are still yet to receive a refund on our flights totalling Â£1,742, which is a lot of money for us."" He said the couple had spent ""months and months"" chasing the booking agency, airline and their insurer but they ""seem to have got nowhere. ""You end up just feel really powerless."" The BBC has approached Emirates for comment. 'My once-in-lifetime holiday hasn't been refunded' 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' The CAA's report last month said Ryanair was taking 10 weeks or even longer to process refunds and asked the airline to reduce that time. But Which? says that, despite promises, the airline is still taking months to process some refunds. Pupil support worker Kirsty Ness from Edinburgh was due to fly to Gdansk in Poland with her boyfriend in early April, just after schools broke up for Easter in Scotland. But Ryanair cancelled their flight because of the pandemic. Despite asking for a cash refund, Ms Ness says she was initially sent a voucher to rebook. After five phone calls and dozens of emails, Ms Ness says she finally received her money this week. ""As a low-paid key worker Â£126 is a lot of money not to have for five months,"" she told the BBC. Ryanair said it had issued more than Â£670m in refunds and had cleared over 90% of its claims backlog. Virgin Atlantic, meanwhile, made customers wait up to 120 days for a refund, the CAA said in its July report. It was the only airline threatened with action by the regulator, which reviewed the refund waiting times of 18 major airlines. But Which? said it had heard from two passengers who had been waiting for 130 days for a refund for flights cancelled in March. It said it had also heard from a Tui customer who had still not received a refund for travel cancelled in April. Tui said it now issued refunds automatically and normally processed cash refunds within two weeks. Virgin said it was ""very sorry"" that a ""small number"" of customers had to wait more than 120 days for a refund. Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? ""Time after time, Which? has exposed airlines breaking the law on refunds for cancelled flights due to the pandemic and treating their passengers unfairly, and we're concerned that they now feel empowered to do as they please without fear of punishment,"" said Rory Boland, Editor of Which? Travel. ""Passengers must be able to rely on a regulator that has effective powers to protect their rights - especially at a time of unprecedented turmoil,"" he said. Which? has called for the CAA to be given new powers to take action against airlines that are slow to refund passengers. ""The government needs to step up and ensure the CAA has the tools it needs to hold airlines to account, or risk consumer trust in the travel industry being damaged beyond repair,"" Mr Boland said. In a statement, a CAA spokesman said: ""While our initial review has concluded, we have been clear that we will continue to monitor performance closely and should any airline fall short of the commitments they have made to us, we will take further action as required."" The report from Which? comes as rail companies have called on the government to tax some flights more heavily. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators, says train companies should pay less tax on the electricity they use to power trains to encourage greener travel. The cost, they say, could be covered by airlines paying more tax on flights, possibly on routes which could be made by rail instead. But the demand has not gone down well with airlines, which say that the railways are heavily subsidised by the government.

How Kamala Harris could help as Joe Biden's running mate,"Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason. Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe Biden's running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be on his ticket. She was a safe pick and a practical one. She's also now in the position to be the heir apparent for the Democratic Party - whether it's in four years because Biden loses in November or doesn't run for re-election or eight years if Biden serves two full terms. That could be why it seemed that there were so many attempts to knock Harris down a peg, or advance alternative candidates over the past month. This was, in effect, the first fight of the next presidential nomination contest, and Harris - whose ambitions are clear - now has a step on the competition. But determining future Democratic nominees is a battle for another day. The pressing concern for the party at the moment is how Harris might help Biden win the White House. Here are some strengths she brings to the ticket and, perhaps, some concerns Democrats may have. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots To put it bluntly, today's Democratic Party doesn't look like Joe Biden. It's young and it's ethnically diverse. It was increasingly obvious that the presumptive nominee needed to find someone younger and, well, less white to have a ticket that reflects the people who will vote for it. Harris, whose father was Jamaican and mother came from India, fills this particular need. She becomes both the first black woman and the first Asian to run on a major party presidential ticket. And although at 55 years old she's not exactly young, when compared to 77-year-old Joe Biden, she's downright spry. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? On Tuesday afternoon, before she was announced as Biden's pick, Harris tweeted about the need for diversity in the leadership of the party. ""Black women and women of color have long been underrepresented in elected office and in November we have an opportunity to change that,"" she wrote. It turns out Harris could be directly responsible for some of that change. One of the traditional roles of a vice-presidential running mate is to get down and dirty with the opposition. While the person at the top of the ticket takes the rhetorical high road, the number-two cracks out the brass knuckles for the opposition. In 2008, Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, more than lived up to her nickname, Sarah the Barracuda, for instance. If this is a duty that falls on Harris, history suggests she will be up to the task. Biden certainly recalls that it was Harris who went after him with gusto during the first Democratic primary debate in July 2019, criticisinghis opposition to bussing to end segregation in public schools. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Harris has also proven to be a very determined and aggressive interrogator during her time in the US Senate. Donald Trump clearly remembers this, as he remarked on Tuesday evening that he thought Harris was ""extraordinarily nasty"" to his second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Trump may not like it, but nasty may be exactly what Biden is looking for this autumn. One thing politicians who have run for national office have said time and time again is that it's impossible to understand the intense pressure such campaigns create until one has actually been in one. Although Harris's 2020 presidential bid was unsuccessful, and she dropped out before most of her competitors, she still knows what it's like to be under such scrutiny. When she launched her campaign before tens of thousands of supporters in January 2019, she was treated like a top-tier presidential contender. For a time in July, after her strong first debate performance, she rose towards the top of some primary polls. Harris has been through the fire, at least for a time, and knows what it feels like. If there were serious, dinosaur-sized skeletons in her closet, they would have come out by now. Given that she's already sought the presidency, its not impossible for many Americans to imagine her as president someday. The California senator may not have been the most dynamic candidate on the campaign trail in 2019, and she was certainly not nearly the most successful one, but at this point she's a known quantity. And for Biden,who is currently up in the polls, the fewer surprises the rest of the campaign the better. More than almost any of the other contenders for the vice-presidential spot, Harris comes from a law-enforcement background. Given the recent demonstrations over police brutality and allegations of institutional racism in law enforcement, Harris's resume may give some progressives within the Democratic Party pause. It certainly did during Harris's presidential campaign, when ""Harris is a cop"" was a derisive accusation thrown at the California senator on more than one occasion. This video can not be played President Trump calls Kamala Harris ""meanest"" US senator Both as San Francisco district attorney and as California's attorney general, Harris has sided with police over suspects - even in cases where those suspects may have been wrongfully convicted. Although she's expressed personal opposition to the death penalty, she's supported its use while she's been in office. Being a hard-nosed crime-fighter may be an attractive attribute among independent and conservative-leaning voters in the general election, but if that support comes at the cost of enthusiasm for the Biden-Harris ticket on the left, then it may not be a net positive. Since the death of George Floyd, Harris has been outspoken in advocating law-enforcement reform, winning praise from some progressives. But it's safe to say they still harbour some doubts. Above, Harris having run a presidential campaign was noted as a mark in her favour. There's a flip side to that, however. Her campaign, while it started with a bang and had its moments, also had some serious flaws - and some of those flaws related to the candidate herself. Although Harris has a pretty moderate record as a senator and state attorney general, she tried to tack to the left during her presidential campaign. She came out in favour of free college education, the Green New Deal environmental programme and universal healthcare, for instance, but never sounded all that convincing about it. Mr Biden tells Ms Harris she will be his running mate on Tuesday She particularly got tripped up on the question of whether private insurance should be banned - which, while fine with progressives, gives many moderate heartburn. ""Let's eliminate all of that,"" she said rather glibly during one interview. ""Let's move on."" In this day and age, the death knell for politicians is to seem too political - to be perceived as willing to shift values and beliefs based on what the voters want. Sincerity, or at least the appearance of it, is a virtue voters prize  - and part of the reason why Donald Trump became president. While his supporters didn't always agree with him, they felt like he speaks his mind. Harris's move from moderate, then to the left and now back, perhaps, to the Biden middle could leave some voters wondering where her core values lie - or if she has any core values at all.

UK in recession for first time in 11 years,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We're grappling with something unprecedented"" The UK economy suffered its biggest slump on record between April and June as coronavirus lockdown measures pushed the country officially into recession. The economy shrank 20.4% compared with the first three months of the year. Household spending plunged as shops were ordered to close, while factory and construction output also fell. This pushed the UK into its first technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline - since 2009. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that the government was ""grappling with something that is unprecedented"" and that it was ""a very difficult and uncertain time"". But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds blamed Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the scale of the economic decline, saying: ""A downturn was inevitable after lockdown - but Johnson's jobs crisis wasn't."" Kate Treglown, 44, of Walthamstow in east London, is currently out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She was made redundant from her advertising job at the end of July after being on furlough. ""I worked for 16-and-a-half years for an advertising agency that promoted live events. The work totally dried up in May,"" she told the BBC. Kate says she feels ""stuck in limbo"" - keen to try something new, but unsure of when her children- who she has been home schooling - will return to school. ""There is work. There are jobs available. But when I look on LinkedIn, every single job has hundreds of applications, so competition is very stiff,"" she says. ""I feel women are really carrying the burden of this pandemic with regards to the childcare, whether working or not. It's made me feel quite depressed at times. ""My redundancy money is only going to last so long and I'm scared of what the future holds for us at the moment."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' How can I find a new job? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy bounced back in June as government restrictions on movement started to ease. On a month-on-month basis, the economy grew by 8.7% in June, after growth of 1.8% in May. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: ""Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck."" The ONS said the collapse in output was driven by the closure of shops, hotels, restaurants, schools and car repair shops. The services sector, which powers four-fifths of the economy, suffered the biggest quarterly decline on record. This video can not be played What is a recession? Factory shutdowns also resulted in the slowest car production since 1954. How could a recession affect me? Is there such a thing as a 'good' or 'bad' recession? PM warns of 'long, long way to go' for UK economy The economic decline was concentrated in April, at the height of lockdown. Official jobs figures released on Tuesday showedthe number of people in workfell by 220,000 between April and June. But in a BBC interview on Wednesday, Mr Sunak did not waver on ending the government's furlough scheme of job subsidies, which is winding down and is due to end entirely after October. ""I think most people would agree that that's not something that is sustainable indefinitely,"" he told the BBC. The chancellor said the government should not pretend that ""absolutely everybody can and will be able to go back to the job they had"" and said there would be support for creating jobs in new areas. The opposition has been critical of the government's handling of the economy during the pandemic. Ms Dodds said: ""We've already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we're on course for the worst recession too. That's a tragedy for the British people and it's happened on Boris Johnson's watch."" Referring to the tapering of the furlough scheme, she said the government had ""snatched away wage support for businesses that hadn't even reopened yet"". Laura Tenison, founder of clothing firm JoJo Maman Bebe, told the BBC that the trading performance of her 90 stores was showing huge variations, with those in urban locations suffering from a lack of office workers and tourists. ""Those like York, Windsor, central London, Reading, Norwich - those ones are absolutely dire, really really awful,"" she said. ""I mean, some days we take no money, put it that way. But some of the village stores, the community stores, they're actually doing better than we anticipated. ""I think we have six stores in the portfolio that actually are trading up on last year."" Ms Tenison founded her business in 1993, during a recession. ""This is my third recession in my relatively long life in retail,"" she said. ""We still have to be entrepreneurial,"" she added. ""We have had to close down some areas of business because of Covid. We've had to close our American business, which is just a massive sadness to me. ""Of course, everyone has to look at their overheads, but be creative. Look at those opportunities out there. Recessions bring opportunities."" Business groups urged the government to do more to support the economic recovery. Alpesh Paleja, an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said many companies were struggling to pay their bills on time. He said: ""A sustained recovery is by no means assured. The dual threats of a second wave and slow progress over Brexit negotiations are also particularly concerning."" This video can not be played Anneliese Dodds: The UK has not seen âa big enough bounce back and we really need oneâ While more recent data suggest the recovery is gaining traction, the Bank of England does not expect the economy to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the end of next year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, expects the recovery to take even longer. The UK's slump is one of the biggest among advanced economies, according to preliminary estimates. The economy is more than a fifth smaller than it was at the end of last year. This fall is not as bad as the 22.7% decline in Spain, but about twice the size of contractions in Germany and the US. The chancellor told the BBC that the UK economy had performed worse than its EU counterparts because it was focused on services, hospitality and consumer spending. ""Those kinds of activities comprise a much larger share of our economy than they do for most of our European cousins,"" he said.

NI man guilty of murdering Irish police officer,"Aaron Brady pictured at an earlier court appearance A man from Northern Ireland has been found guilty of the capital murder of a garda (Irish police officer) who was shot dead in a robbery seven years ago. Det GardaAdrian Donohoe died after he was shot during a raid on Lordship Credit Unionin County Louth on 25 January, 2013. Aaron Brady, from New Road in Crossmaglen, County Armagh, was tried at Dublin's Central Criminal Court. The jury found him guilty by a majority verdict of 11 to one. The crime of capital murder in the Republic of Ireland carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 40 years. In order to be convicted of the offence, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Brady knew he was shooting a garda on active duty, or was reckless as to whether or not he was a garda. An armed robbery that ended in a policeman's death The murdered officer, who was 41 years old, was married with two young children. Det Garda Adrian Donohoe was shot dead during a robbery in 2013 He was one of two detectives on late-night duty who were escorting a cash collection at the rural credit union when the robbery took place. His murder trial was told that staff were preparing to leave the building with the day's takings, when they were approached by a gang of men who robbed them. Det Garda Donohoe was shot in the head and died at the scene. The victim's widow, Caroline Deloughrey, was also a garda at the time, but she left the force after his murder. Speaking briefly outside court, she said: ""I would like to most sincerely thank the jury for sticking with this trial for so long and for my garda colleagues and for the prosecution team, on behalf of Amy, Niall and myself."" Det Garda Donohoe's widow Caroline thanked the jury after the guilty verdict Brady, who is 29, is the only suspect to have been brought to trial so far. The victim's brother Colm Donohoe, who is also a serving garda, read a statement outside court on behalf of the Donohoe family. He welcomed the guilty verdict but added that Brady was ""not alone"" during the robbery. ""The quest for justice for Adrian will continue and we appeal to anyone, near or far, who has any information that may assist in this investigation to come forward and do the right thing,"" he said. ""While justice has been done today, nothing will bring back Adrian to his wife; his two kids; his parents; his family; his colleagues and his friends."" Forensic investigators searched the area around Lordship credit union hours after the murder Brady moved to the United States shortly after the murder, but was extradited to the Republic of Ireland in 2017 after overstaying his US visa. Witnesses who gave evidence by video-link from New York told the Dublin court that Brady had claimed to them on several occasions that he had killed a garda. Det Garda Donohoe's brother thanked international law enforcement agencies for the ""extraordinary help"" they gave to the investigation which secured Brady's conviction. ""A special word of thanks has to go to the US authorities, and especially to Homeland Security, who took on the investigation like Adrian was one of their own,"" he said. Garda Colm Donohoe (centre) read a family statement outside court In a press conference after the verdict, Garda Deputy Commissioner John Twomey said the team who investigated the murder are continuing to work on the case as other suspects have not yet been brought to justice. He issued a warning to all the people involved in the fatal robbery. ""We will be knocking on your door and we will make sure that you pay for this horrendous act,"" Mr Twomey said. Det Garda Donohoe joined An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (the Irish police force) in 1994 and had served for 19 years at the time of his death. Originally from Kilnaleck in County Cavan, he lived a short distance from where the robbery took place and both his children attended the school across the road from the murder scene. He was the 87th member of the force to be killed in the line of duty since its formation almost a century ago. He receiveda state funeralin Dundalk, attended by thousands of his Garda colleagues and political leaders from both sides of the Irish border. Throughout his trial, Brady had denied murder and any involvement in the robbery. He claimed he had lied to gardaÃ­ about his movements on the night the detective was killed because he had been laundering diesel in County Armagh at the time of the robbery. The getaway car was found burnt out at Fews forest outside Newtownhamilton, County Armagh On Monday 10 August, the jury of seven women and five men unanimously convicted Brady of a separate charge of robbery. They had found him guilty of stealing approximately â¬7,000 (Â£6,300) in cash and cheques from Lordship credit union on the night Det Garda Donohoe was killed. The jury deliberated for about 20 hours in total, over the course of six days. The judge is due to hear victim impact statements before deciding how long Brady will spend in jail. A sentence hearing has been scheduled for 14 October. The last time anyone was jailed for capital murder in the Republic of Ireland was 35 years ago. That case also involved the murder of a serving garda from County Cavan, who was shot dead by a man from Crossmaglen following a robbery in County Louth. Garda Sgt Patrick Morrissey was shot at Rathbrist, Tallanstown, in June 1985 and the gunman and his accomplice were convicted of capital murder in December that year.

'Serious injuries' after train derails during storms,"This video can not be played Aerial footage: passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Three people, including the driver and a conductor, have died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire. The third victim was a passenger, ScotRail has confirmed. It is thought the train hit a landslide after heavy rain and thunderstorms which causedflooding and travel disruptionacross Scotland. A major incident was declared and about 30 emergency service vehicles were called to the scene. It involved the 06:38 ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street. Six people have been taken to hospital but their injuries are not believed to be serious. Latest updates on the derailment British Transport Police said the families of the driver and the conductor had been informed and were being supported by specially-trained liaison officers. The derailment took place on the line west of Stonehaven Ch Supt Eddie Wylie said it was believed that all passengers had been accounted for. He added: ""Once the area has been made safe then a full and thorough search will be conducted, which is likely to take some time. ""I know many people will understandably have questions and we will be working closely alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and the Office of Rail and Road to establish the full circumstances of how the train came to derail."" The RMT union said that confirmation of the three deaths, including one of its conductor members, was ""the most dreadful news"". Senior assistant general secretary Mick Lynch added the union's thoughts ""were with the families, colleagues and friends of those who have lost their lives in this tragedy."" Early indications are that the heavy rain could have been the main factor in causing today's crash in Aberdeenshire. One rail industry source says the 06:38 service from Aberdeen to Glasgow was initially halted because of flooding on the line. The driver apparently contacted control to ask permission to switch tracks. It's believed the train reversed and switched to clearer tracks and then continued on its route to Glasgow. Then it is thought the train hit a landslide and derailed. However, this initial, unconfirmed version of events should now be closely examined by the UK's Rail Accident Investigation Branch. Its job is to establish all the facts. The train's computer systems should show key indicators like the speed it was travelling at when it left the track. In recent years incidents like this on the UK's railways have become incredibly rare. The last major derailment was in 2007 in Cumbria. The Queen issued a message of condolence following the crash, saying ""it was with great sadness that I heard of the train derailment"". Her Majesty said the entire Royal Family ""join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who have died and those who have been injured"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the loved ones of those who lost their lives in the ""tragic incident"". ""My thoughts remain with everyone affected,"" she said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC the crash was especially shocking because ""these accidents on the railways are thankfully so rare"". ""Our thoughts are very much with those who have lost their lives and their families and, of course, those that have been injured in the derailment,"" he added. ""Clearly the most important thing now is that the British Transport Police, who are in charge of the investigation, find out exactly what happened and we all work together to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."" The train which derailed was made up of two locomotives - at the front and back - and four carriages. Network Rail has reviewed CCTV footage from the stations at which the service stopped and it's believed there were nine people, including crew, on the train. British Transport Police said its officers had been called to the scene at about 09:43. A few minutes later, Network Rail tweeted that there had been reports of a landslip at Carmont and that services between Dundee and Aberdeen had been halted. The chief executive of Network Rail, Andrew Haines, is cutting short his family holiday in Italy to fly back to the UK. Emergency services at the scene of the derailment Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would visit the site on Thursday ""to try to understand the situation first hand and offer every possible assistance"". NHS Grampian confirmed it was on a ""major incident footing"", and ScotRail said it was assisting the emergency services. The RMT union's Mick Lynch said: ""The facts behind this âincident will need to be established in due course, but at this stage we are focussed on support and assistance and our thoughts are with all those impacted by this tragedy."" This video can not be played Several fire and ambulance crews were called to the scene near Stonehaven Kevin Lindsay, Scotland organiser for the Aslef train drivers union, said: ""Our thoughts tonight are with all those who died, and who were injured, in the tragic accident. ""While it is too early to speculate about the causes of the crash, it would seem that the appalling weather conditions in the area - the torrential rain - resulted in a landslip which, in turn, caused the train to derail."" He added that the train had caught fire after rolling down a steep embankment. Aberdeenshire Provost and Mearns councillor Bill Howatson said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. This is a harrowing time for all concerned."" Meanwhile four firefighters were injured while responding the derailment. BBC Scotland understands they suffered minor injuries after a vehicle collided with them. Two of the firefighters were admitted to hospital as a precautionary measure but were released shortly afterwards. It's long been recognised that landslips are one of the greatest risks to Britain's railways and that a changing climate will make them more likely. Heatwaves and droughts can dry out the steep embankments beside the tracks, and over the years will start to weaken them. Add to that the effects of heavy rain, of the kind seen just now in Scotland, saturating and eroding the soil, and undermining its strength. And with rising global temperatures set to bring extremes of weather never anticipated by the Victorian engineers who built the lines, Network Rail has been studying how best to keep the tracks safe. But it admits that ""we know we can't rebuild every mile of railway"". The most recent multiple fatalities on the UK's railways were in South Wales in 2019, when two railway workers died after being struck by a Great Western train near Port Talbot. They were working without a lookout. In November 2004, an intercity train travelling on the Reading and Taunton line hit a car on a level crossing, derailing a train and killing seven people and injuring more than 70 others. In May 2002, an east coast main line train derailed because of an undetected points failure. Coaches rolled and came to rest on platforms. Seven people were killed and 76 injured. In February 2001, 10 people were killed in the Great Heck Rail Crash near Selby when a train struck a Land Rover that had rolled onto the track because the driver had fallen asleep, and was derailed into the path of another train. In October 1999, at Ladbroke Grove in London, 31 people were killed in a head-on collision after a driver passed a signal. Are you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

Changes considered to A-levels in Wales,"This video can not be played Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said students wonât get grades lower than their AS-levels A-level grades in Wales this year will be no lower than those the pupils achieved at AS-level the previous year, the education minister has promised. Kirsty Williams made the announcement after England and Scotland changed their grading systems. If a student gets a grade on Thursday below their AS grade a revised one will be issued automatically, she said. Pupils in England are being told theirfinal results will be no lower than their mock exams. The Scottish government announced on Tuesday that all pupils would get the grades predicted by teachers. Exam board says grades will be 'balanced and fair' Sixth-formers reflect on cancelled exams This year's exams were cancelled across the UK because of coronavirus, with governments having to find alternative ways to assess pupils' performance. In Scotland76,000 pupils had their results upgradedafter being lowered by a moderating system which critics claimed was a ""postcode lottery"" as it linked students' results with their schools' past performances. Earlier on Wednesday, the Department for Education in England announced a ""triple lock"" - so results will be the highest out of their estimated grades, their mocks and an optional written exam in the autumn. Other ways had to be found to assess pupils after exams were cancelled In her statement, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government had to make sure such changes ""do not disadvantage Welsh students"". ""Students in Wales, and prospective employers and universities across the UK, can be assured that their A-level grades reflect their work and externally assessed exams,"" she said. ""Almost half the final grade comes from AS-level exams - this is not the situation elsewhere. ""Therefore, in building on that completed work, I am giving a guarantee that a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade. ""If a student receives a final grade tomorrow that is below that of their previous AS grade, then a revised grade will be issued automatically by WJEC."" Ms Williams said she had received assurances that ""students can speak with confidence to their prospective universities regarding their A-level grades"". She said she had asked exams regulator Qualifications Wales and the examinations board the WJEC to ""work closely with the qualifications bodies of the other UK nations as they develop their plans"". ` Coronavirus closed schools and saw summer exams abandoned in Wales The minister said she would ask Qualifications Wales to ""move forward quickly on relevant adjustments to a Welsh appeals process as soon as these plans are clearer, in order to ensure Welsh students are not disadvantaged"". ""All appeals will be free for Welsh students, to ensure there is no financial barrier to ensure learners feel their exam grades are fair,"" she added. National Union of Students president in Wales Becky Ricketts said pupils who did not achieve grades they were satisfied with at AS-level would still be concerned about how their scores were calculated. ""It remains to be seen whether this measure will prevent a results postcode lottery as was seen in Scotland, and we will closely monitor the situation,"" she said. Speaking later, on BBC Wales Today, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government would ""continue to monitor"" developments in England ""to ensure that results are not only fair and robust tomorrow but also the same next week"", when GCSE grades are announced. Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said her intervention on A-levels had been ""inevitable"". ""The promise of a free and extended appeals process is very welcome, and will go some way to alleviating the concerns of many pupils who might not receive the grades they had anticipated,"" he said. ""The fact that Scotland and England had diverged from agreed moderation practices made it extremely difficult for Wales to continue as planned."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said it was ""vital to see a safety net being implemented in Wales to make sure pupils achieved the grade they had worked towards"". ""So tomorrow, I am pleased that pupils' final grades are guaranteed to be not be lower than their previous grade at AS-level,"" she said. Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the Welsh Government ""will be marked down severely for leaving teachers and pupils in limbo - and their hard work, initially, unrewarded"". But she said it was ""welcome that the minister has listened to Plaid Cymru calls for a free and independent appeals process"". Before the education minister's statement, Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless expressed concerns students had lacked sufficient opportunity to prove their academic progress because of Covid-19. ""We believe that the best option would be for the Welsh Government to offer A-level students the chance to sit an exam in the autumn so that we can give students a chance to get a more accurate grade and to maintain the integrity of the exam system,"" he said. David Evans, Wales secretary of National Education Union Cymru, said: ""Whilst it is disappointing that amendments to some grades have come late in the day, we hope that the Welsh Government proposals outlined by the minister will ensure fairness for young people about to receive their grades. ""To many young people, exam grades are a ticket to their futures, and should not reflect where you live, but what you are capable of. ""It has been an unprecedented year for these young people, and grades must reflect their true ability for there to be confidence in the system."" Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of UCAC, added: ""Our members will welcome any steps to ensure that their students receive fair grades and that they will not compare unfavourably with their peers elsewhere in the UK. ""However, the fact that these changes are needed is a matter of considerable concern. These 11th-hour changes are bound to cause stress and confusion.""

Free A-level appeal must be option for all - Plaid,"Coronavirus closed schools and saw summer exams abandoned in Wales A free and independent appeals process should be available to all A-level students in Wales getting their results on Thursday, Plaid Cymru has said. This year's exams were cancelled across the UK because of coronavirus. Many Scottish exam results are to be raised after a moderation system lowered an estimated 125,000 of them. On Tuesday, Welsh Government minister Julie James told a news conference: ""We're not expecting what happened in Scotland to happen here."" Tens of thousands of Scottish pupils are to have their exam results upgraded after the Scottish government agreed to accept teacher estimates of scores, following an outcry. There had been claims that the moderation system unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed as well. Exam board says grades will be 'balanced and fair' Sixth-formers reflect on cancelled exams On Wednesday, Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said a ""robust, national and independent system of appeal"" would be needed in Wales as there were concerns that some students would experience similar downgrades of the results teachers had predicted for them. She urged Welsh ministers to ""step in with a package of support"" for pupils. ""This needs to include careers advice, counselling and - crucially - a robust, national and independent system of appeal,"" she said. ""All of this must be free for our learners."" Sian Gwenllian: ""Schools must ensure rigorous oversight of this"" Ms Gwenllian added: ""It shouldn't be merely up to pupils to refer themselves to the appeals process. ""Schools must ensure rigorous oversight of this so that everyone who should have their grades appealed is able to do so."" The National Union of Students (NUS) has called for Wales to ""follow Scotland by scrapping moderated grades if students face an A-level results postcode lottery on Thursday"". NUS Wales president Becky Ricketts warned: ""It would be deeply unfair that thousands of students face being marked down because of where they live."" Some pupils held protests against the exam results in Scotland Welsh Housing and Local Government Minister Ms James insisted that Wales used different modelling to Scotland and that nearly half of pupils' final mark was based on AS-levels completed last year. Speaking during the weekly Welsh Government coronavirus briefing on Tuesday, Ms James said she was confident pupils' grades would be ""robust"" due to the system used by the examination board WJEC and exam regulator Qualifications Wales. ""I'm really happy to reassure every learner in Wales that the modelling in Wales is very different,"" she said. ""It takes into account work that has been completed by the students. For example, here in Wales we've never let go of AS-levels. ""If you took A-levels this year then you would have had your AS-level results last year and they contribute 40% to A-level grades. ""So, the model for standardising those grades are developed by the WJEC and approved by Qualifications Wales to ensure that learners are treated fairly and will be able to progress with confidence.""

"'Serious injuries' after train derails during stormsSmoke can be seen as about 30 emergency vehicles are called to the scene, near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","This video can not be played Aerial footage: passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Three people, including the driver and a conductor, have died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire. The third victim was a passenger, ScotRail has confirmed. It is thought the train hit a landslide after heavy rain and thunderstorms which causedflooding and travel disruptionacross Scotland. A major incident was declared and about 30 emergency service vehicles were called to the scene. It involved the 06:38 ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street. Six people have been taken to hospital but their injuries are not believed to be serious. Latest updates on the derailment British Transport Police said the families of the driver and the conductor had been informed and were being supported by specially-trained liaison officers. The derailment took place on the line west of Stonehaven Ch Supt Eddie Wylie said it was believed that all passengers had been accounted for. He added: ""Once the area has been made safe then a full and thorough search will be conducted, which is likely to take some time. ""I know many people will understandably have questions and we will be working closely alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and the Office of Rail and Road to establish the full circumstances of how the train came to derail."" The RMT union said that confirmation of the three deaths, including one of its conductor members, was ""the most dreadful news"". Senior assistant general secretary Mick Lynch added the union's thoughts ""were with the families, colleagues and friends of those who have lost their lives in this tragedy."" Early indications are that the heavy rain could have been the main factor in causing today's crash in Aberdeenshire. One rail industry source says the 06:38 service from Aberdeen to Glasgow was initially halted because of flooding on the line. The driver apparently contacted control to ask permission to switch tracks. It's believed the train reversed and switched to clearer tracks and then continued on its route to Glasgow. Then it is thought the train hit a landslide and derailed. However, this initial, unconfirmed version of events should now be closely examined by the UK's Rail Accident Investigation Branch. Its job is to establish all the facts. The train's computer systems should show key indicators like the speed it was travelling at when it left the track. In recent years incidents like this on the UK's railways have become incredibly rare. The last major derailment was in 2007 in Cumbria. The Queen issued a message of condolence following the crash, saying ""it was with great sadness that I heard of the train derailment"". Her Majesty said the entire Royal Family ""join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who have died and those who have been injured"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the loved ones of those who lost their lives in the ""tragic incident"". ""My thoughts remain with everyone affected,"" she said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC the crash was especially shocking because ""these accidents on the railways are thankfully so rare"". ""Our thoughts are very much with those who have lost their lives and their families and, of course, those that have been injured in the derailment,"" he added. ""Clearly the most important thing now is that the British Transport Police, who are in charge of the investigation, find out exactly what happened and we all work together to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."" The train which derailed was made up of two locomotives - at the front and back - and four carriages. Network Rail has reviewed CCTV footage from the stations at which the service stopped and it's believed there were nine people, including crew, on the train. British Transport Police said its officers had been called to the scene at about 09:43. A few minutes later, Network Rail tweeted that there had been reports of a landslip at Carmont and that services between Dundee and Aberdeen had been halted. The chief executive of Network Rail, Andrew Haines, is cutting short his family holiday in Italy to fly back to the UK. Emergency services at the scene of the derailment Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would visit the site on Thursday ""to try to understand the situation first hand and offer every possible assistance"". NHS Grampian confirmed it was on a ""major incident footing"", and ScotRail said it was assisting the emergency services. The RMT union's Mick Lynch said: ""The facts behind this âincident will need to be established in due course, but at this stage we are focussed on support and assistance and our thoughts are with all those impacted by this tragedy."" This video can not be played Several fire and ambulance crews were called to the scene near Stonehaven Kevin Lindsay, Scotland organiser for the Aslef train drivers union, said: ""Our thoughts tonight are with all those who died, and who were injured, in the tragic accident. ""While it is too early to speculate about the causes of the crash, it would seem that the appalling weather conditions in the area - the torrential rain - resulted in a landslip which, in turn, caused the train to derail."" He added that the train had caught fire after rolling down a steep embankment. Aberdeenshire Provost and Mearns councillor Bill Howatson said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. This is a harrowing time for all concerned."" Meanwhile four firefighters were injured while responding the derailment. BBC Scotland understands they suffered minor injuries after a vehicle collided with them. Two of the firefighters were admitted to hospital as a precautionary measure but were released shortly afterwards. It's long been recognised that landslips are one of the greatest risks to Britain's railways and that a changing climate will make them more likely. Heatwaves and droughts can dry out the steep embankments beside the tracks, and over the years will start to weaken them. Add to that the effects of heavy rain, of the kind seen just now in Scotland, saturating and eroding the soil, and undermining its strength. And with rising global temperatures set to bring extremes of weather never anticipated by the Victorian engineers who built the lines, Network Rail has been studying how best to keep the tracks safe. But it admits that ""we know we can't rebuild every mile of railway"". The most recent multiple fatalities on the UK's railways were in South Wales in 2019, when two railway workers died after being struck by a Great Western train near Port Talbot. They were working without a lookout. In November 2004, an intercity train travelling on the Reading and Taunton line hit a car on a level crossing, derailing a train and killing seven people and injuring more than 70 others. In May 2002, an east coast main line train derailed because of an undetected points failure. Coaches rolled and came to rest on platforms. Seven people were killed and 76 injured. In February 2001, 10 people were killed in the Great Heck Rail Crash near Selby when a train struck a Land Rover that had rolled onto the track because the driver had fallen asleep, and was derailed into the path of another train. In October 1999, at Ladbroke Grove in London, 31 people were killed in a head-on collision after a driver passed a signal. Are you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

Facebook adds 'blackface' photos to banned posts,"Facebook has updated its rules to tackle posts containing depictions of ""blackface"" and common anti-Semitic stereotypes. Its Community Standards now explicitly state such content should be removed if used to target or mock people. The company said it had consulted more than 60 outside experts before making the move. But one campaigner said she still had concerns about its wider anti-racism efforts. ""Blackface is an issue that's been around for decade, which is why it's surprising that it's only being dealt with now,"" said Zubaida Haque, interim director of the Runnymede Trust race-equality think tank. ""It's deeply damaging to black people's lives in terms of the hatred that's targeted towards them and the spread of myths, lies and racial stereotypes. ""We welcome Facebook's decision. ""But I'm not entirely convinced these steps are part of a robust strategy to proactively deal with this hatred as opposed to it being a crisis-led sort of thing."" Facebook's rules have long included a ban on hate speech related to race, ethnicity and religious affiliation, among other characteristics. But they have now been revised to specify: caricatures of black people in the form of blackface references to Jewish people running the world or controlling major institutions such as media networks, the economy or the government The rules also apply to Instagram. ""This type of content has always gone against the spirit of our hate-speech policies,"" said Monika Bickert, Facebook's content policy chief. ""But it can be really difficult to take concepts... and define them in a way that allows our content reviewers based around the world to consistently and fairly identify violations."" Facebook said the ban would apply to photos of people portraying Black Pete - a helper to St Nicholas, who traditionally appears in blackface at winter festival events in the Netherlands. And it might also remove some photos of English morris folk dancers who have painted their faces black. However, Ms Bickert suggested other examples - including critical posts drawing attention to the fact a politician once wore blackface - might still be allowed once the policy comes into effect. The announcement coincided with Facebook's latest figures on dealing with problematic posts. The tech firm said it had deleted 22.5 million items of hate speech in the months of April to June, compared with 9.6 million the previous quarter. It said the rise was ""largely driven"" by improvements to its auto-detection technologies across several languages including Spanish, Arabic, Indonesian and Burmese. This implied that much content had been missed in the past. Facebook acknowledged that it was still unable to give a measurement of the ""prevalence of hate speech"" on its platform - in other words whether the problem is in fact worsening. It already gives such a metric for other topics, including violent and graphic content. But a spokesman said the company was hoping to start providing a figure later in the year. He also said the social network intended to start using a third-party auditor to check its numbers some time in 2021. One campaign group said it suspected hate speech was indeed a growing problem. ""We have been warning for some time that a major pandemic event has the potential to inflame xenophobia and racism,"" said the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)'s chief executive Imran Ahmed. Facebook's report also revealed that staffing issues caused by the pandemic had meant it took action on fewer suicide and self-harm posts - on both Instagram and Facebook. And on Instagram, the same problem meant it took action on fewer posts in the category it calls ""child nudity and sexual exploitation"". Actions fell by more than half, from one million posts to 479,400. ""Facebook's inability to act against harmful content on their platforms is inexcusable, especially when they were repeatedly warned how lockdown conditions were creating a perfect storm for online child abuse at the start of this pandemic,"" said Martha Kirby from the NSPCC. 'I was a Facebook moderator' Facebook dominates cases of social media grooming Child protectors urge Facebook encryption rethink ""The crisis has exposed how tech firms are unwilling to prioritise the safety of children and instead respond to harm after it's happened rather than design basic safety features into their sites to prevent it in the first place,"" she said. However, on Facebook itself, the number of removals of such posts increased.

Coronavirus cases surge as France goes 'wrong way'The prime minister warned the French public it must take serious action to control a surge in cases.Europe,"French Prime Minister Jean Castex (left) made the dire warning in Montpellier on Tuesday New coronavirus infections have nearly doubled in France in recent weeks as Prime Minister Jean Castex warned that the country had been going ""the wrong way"" for two weeks. The health ministry reported 1,397 new infections of Covid-19 since Monday. Fourteen people have died. A ban on meetings of more than 5,000 people has been extended to 30 October. Mr Castex also asked local authorities to further extend the requirement to wear face masks in public. ""The epidemiological situation, which we are following very closely, is deteriorating: 2,000 new cases per day compared to 1,000 three weeks ago,"" Mr Castex said at a press conference in Montpellier. ""About 25 new clusters are identified every day compared to five three weeks ago,"" he added. It is already compulsory to wear face coverings nationwide on public transport and in indoor spaces including shops and government offices. Local authorities have the ability to impose mask-wearing and some have introduced it in outdoor spaces, including Paris tourist hot spots and the banks of the river Seine. More than 30,000 people have already died from the disease in France, which experienced a significant wave of cases in March and April. An additional 14 people have died since Monday, according to the health ministry. Its death toll remains the seventh highest in the world, although it is far below the US and Brazil where more than 100,000 have died in each country, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins university. Following a national lockdown, restrictions in France were eased in May and June and tourism permitted as the summer holiday season began and foreign visitors allowed. Is the world winning the coronavirus fight? New Zealand records first virus cases in 102 days Russia's Putin says vaccine approved for use Public gatherings of more than 5,000 people, including concerts or sports events, were due to resume  at the end of August, but Mr Castex has extended the ban until 30 October. At the weekend, more than 10,000 people attended an illegal rave in remote and sparsely populated mountain area Lozere in southern France.

Changes considered to A-levels in WalesIt follows major announcements about exam grading systems in other parts of the UK.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams said students wonât get grades lower than their AS-levels A-level grades in Wales this year will be no lower than those the pupils achieved at AS-level the previous year, the education minister has promised. Kirsty Williams made the announcement after England and Scotland changed their grading systems. If a student gets a grade on Thursday below their AS grade a revised one will be issued automatically, she said. Pupils in England are being told theirfinal results will be no lower than their mock exams. The Scottish government announced on Tuesday that all pupils would get the grades predicted by teachers. Exam board says grades will be 'balanced and fair' Sixth-formers reflect on cancelled exams This year's exams were cancelled across the UK because of coronavirus, with governments having to find alternative ways to assess pupils' performance. In Scotland76,000 pupils had their results upgradedafter being lowered by a moderating system which critics claimed was a ""postcode lottery"" as it linked students' results with their schools' past performances. Earlier on Wednesday, the Department for Education in England announced a ""triple lock"" - so results will be the highest out of their estimated grades, their mocks and an optional written exam in the autumn. Other ways had to be found to assess pupils after exams were cancelled In her statement, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government had to make sure such changes ""do not disadvantage Welsh students"". ""Students in Wales, and prospective employers and universities across the UK, can be assured that their A-level grades reflect their work and externally assessed exams,"" she said. ""Almost half the final grade comes from AS-level exams - this is not the situation elsewhere. ""Therefore, in building on that completed work, I am giving a guarantee that a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade. ""If a student receives a final grade tomorrow that is below that of their previous AS grade, then a revised grade will be issued automatically by WJEC."" Ms Williams said she had received assurances that ""students can speak with confidence to their prospective universities regarding their A-level grades"". She said she had asked exams regulator Qualifications Wales and the examinations board the WJEC to ""work closely with the qualifications bodies of the other UK nations as they develop their plans"". ` Coronavirus closed schools and saw summer exams abandoned in Wales The minister said she would ask Qualifications Wales to ""move forward quickly on relevant adjustments to a Welsh appeals process as soon as these plans are clearer, in order to ensure Welsh students are not disadvantaged"". ""All appeals will be free for Welsh students, to ensure there is no financial barrier to ensure learners feel their exam grades are fair,"" she added. National Union of Students president in Wales Becky Ricketts said pupils who did not achieve grades they were satisfied with at AS-level would still be concerned about how their scores were calculated. ""It remains to be seen whether this measure will prevent a results postcode lottery as was seen in Scotland, and we will closely monitor the situation,"" she said. Speaking later, on BBC Wales Today, Ms Williams said the Welsh Government would ""continue to monitor"" developments in England ""to ensure that results are not only fair and robust tomorrow but also the same next week"", when GCSE grades are announced. Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said her intervention on A-levels had been ""inevitable"". ""The promise of a free and extended appeals process is very welcome, and will go some way to alleviating the concerns of many pupils who might not receive the grades they had anticipated,"" he said. ""The fact that Scotland and England had diverged from agreed moderation practices made it extremely difficult for Wales to continue as planned."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said it was ""vital to see a safety net being implemented in Wales to make sure pupils achieved the grade they had worked towards"". ""So tomorrow, I am pleased that pupils' final grades are guaranteed to be not be lower than their previous grade at AS-level,"" she said. Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the Welsh Government ""will be marked down severely for leaving teachers and pupils in limbo - and their hard work, initially, unrewarded"". But she said it was ""welcome that the minister has listened to Plaid Cymru calls for a free and independent appeals process"". Before the education minister's statement, Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless expressed concerns students had lacked sufficient opportunity to prove their academic progress because of Covid-19. ""We believe that the best option would be for the Welsh Government to offer A-level students the chance to sit an exam in the autumn so that we can give students a chance to get a more accurate grade and to maintain the integrity of the exam system,"" he said. David Evans, Wales secretary of National Education Union Cymru, said: ""Whilst it is disappointing that amendments to some grades have come late in the day, we hope that the Welsh Government proposals outlined by the minister will ensure fairness for young people about to receive their grades. ""To many young people, exam grades are a ticket to their futures, and should not reflect where you live, but what you are capable of. ""It has been an unprecedented year for these young people, and grades must reflect their true ability for there to be confidence in the system."" Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of UCAC, added: ""Our members will welcome any steps to ensure that their students receive fair grades and that they will not compare unfavourably with their peers elsewhere in the UK. ""However, the fact that these changes are needed is a matter of considerable concern. These 11th-hour changes are bound to cause stress and confusion.""

"PM warns of 'long, long way to go' for UK economy","Boris Johnson has warned the UK has a ""long, long way to go"" before the economy improves, after official figures showed the largest drop in employment in over a decade. ""Clearly there are going to be bumpy months ahead and a long, long way to go,"" the Prime Minister said. However, he said parts of the economy were ""showing great resilience"". Between April and June, the number of people in work fell by 220,000, the Office for National Statistics said. The drop in the number of people employed was the largest quarterly decrease since May to July 2009, the depths of the financial crisis. Mr Johnson said he had ""absolutely no doubt"" that government schemes would ""help this country get through it"", adding: ""it will get through it stronger than ever before"". The youngest workers, oldest workers and those in manual occupations were the worst hit during the pandemic, the ONS added. The figures do not include the millions of people who are furloughed, those on zero-hours contracts but not getting shifts, or people on temporary unpaid leave from a job, as they still count as employed. As such, they do not capture the full impact of the pandemic. Similarly, the UK unemployment rate was estimated at 3.9%, largely unchanged on the year and the previous quarter. What is redundancy and what are my rights? How many people are looking for work? What jobs are available post-lockdown? Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: ""The groups of people most affected are younger workers, 24 and under, or older workers and those in more routine or less skilled jobs. ""This is concerning, as it's harder for these groups to find a new job or get into a job as easily as other workers."" The UK economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic, but unemployment has not surged as much as feared because large numbers of firms have furloughed staff. However, analysts said unemployment was set to worsen in coming months as the scheme wound down, warning of a looming ""cliff-edge"" and a ""lull before the storm"". From restaurants to retailers, many UK businesses are already planning job cutswith 140,000 redundancies announced in June alone. According to the ONS, the number of average hours worked continued to fall in April-June, reaching record lows both on the year and on the quarter. The number of people claiming universal credit - a benefit for those on low pay as well as unemployed people - rose to 2.7 million in July, up by 117% since March. Theatre technician Charlotte Baker, 29, is out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She started a new job at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon in September last year and was furloughed in March. In June, she was made redundant, even though she could have been kept on furlough. Now management at the Fairfield Halls has said the venue will not reopen until April next year, forcing her to contemplate a possible career change. ""It's definitely an uphill struggle and it's proving harder than previous ones,"" she told the BBC. ""It's hard to have a positive outlook."" Charlotte has been looking into doing a carpentry course, but to obtain the necessary City and Guilds qualification would require her to spend Â£5,000 on training. ""It's a mountain to climb. I wouldn't mind climbing that mountain if it's something that I'm passionate about, but I'm not sure,"" she says. ""I'm hoping to make a decision by the end of August."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' This video can not be played Julie Morris explains what it is like to be job hunting in your late 50s during coronavirus Between April and June there were falls in pay for those still working, with regular pay levels down 0.2% compared with a year earlier - the first negative pay growth since records began in 2001. The number of people on zero-hours contracts also increased to more than one million. ""Early indicators for July 2020 suggest that the number of employees in the UK on payrolls is down around 730,000 compared with March 2020,"" said the ONS. It believes the main reason this is more extreme than the fall in employment is because of workers who have a job but are not doing any paid work at the moment. Redundancy: 'Itâs been stressful and upsetting' Which sectors are hiring and which are cutting back? It added that a large number of people were estimated to be temporarily away from work, including furloughed workers - approximately 7.5 million in June 2020, with more than three million of these being away for three months or more. The number of workers covered by the furlough scheme has since risen to 9.6 million by 9 August, and has yet to record a fall in any week since it began,separate statistics published on Tuesday by HM Revenue and Customs show.,external The ONS said there had also been a sharp fall in the number of self-employed people between April and June. It said there were 4.76 million self-employed people, 14.5% of all people in employment, a record 238,000 fewer than the previous quarter. If you're a glass-half-full sort of person, there is some less than awful news in the latest labour market figures. The number of vacancies, for example, rose from its record low by 10% in May to July as lockdown restrictions were eased. The number of hours worked saw a record drop in the second quarter from April to June, but in July it was down by only 3%, less than half the fall in May and June. However, there are some less jolly signs. The number on employer payrolls had only dropped marginally in the previous two months, but saw a much bigger drop in July, down 114,000, in spite of the reopening of many shops, restaurants and pubs. And employers are increasingly making employees bear the risk that there isn't enough work for them to do, with the number of zero-hours contracts rising above one million for the first time. And then there's the record drop in self-employment. And all this in spite of the government spending more than Â£40bn trying to protect employment through furlough and self-employed income support. Unemployment tends to peak well after economic shocks have been and gone: this time will be no different. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest employment figures were ""the lull before the storm"". She added: ""The cracks evident in the latest batch of labour market data are likely to soon turn into a chasm, with the unemployment rate rising from 3.9% to around 7% by mid-2021."" She said further rises in unemployment in the coming months were ""all but inevitable as the furlough scheme unwinds"". Capital Economics forecasts that the unemployment rate will peak at 7% in mid-2021 and remain above its pre-pandemic level of 4% until the end of 2022. Ms Gregory said this suggested that the economic recovery would be ""slow going"". UK employment falls by biggest amount in a decade Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at Equals Money, said the figures showed the true level of those out of work had been ""very effectively lowered by the government's furlough scheme"" and that the worst lay ahead. ""Unfortunately, the end of the furlough scheme will present a cliff-edge, statistically and economically, for those currently relying on government support to make up their wages."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed that the government's ""unprecedented support measures"" were working to ""safeguard millions of jobs and livelihoods that could otherwise have been lost"". Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was ""extremely worrying"" that older workers, the self-employed and part-time workers had been hit hardest. ""Labour has repeatedly warned the government their one-size-fits-all approach will lead to job losses. These figures confirm what we feared - Britain is in the midst of a jobs crisis.""

"UK in recession for first time in 11 yearsThe UK suffers its biggest slump on record, while Rishi Sunak says conditions are ""unprecedented"".BusinessComments","This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We're grappling with something unprecedented"" The UK economy suffered its biggest slump on record between April and June as coronavirus lockdown measures pushed the country officially into recession. The economy shrank 20.4% compared with the first three months of the year. Household spending plunged as shops were ordered to close, while factory and construction output also fell. This pushed the UK into its first technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline - since 2009. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that the government was ""grappling with something that is unprecedented"" and that it was ""a very difficult and uncertain time"". But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds blamed Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the scale of the economic decline, saying: ""A downturn was inevitable after lockdown - but Johnson's jobs crisis wasn't."" Kate Treglown, 44, of Walthamstow in east London, is currently out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She was made redundant from her advertising job at the end of July after being on furlough. ""I worked for 16-and-a-half years for an advertising agency that promoted live events. The work totally dried up in May,"" she told the BBC. Kate says she feels ""stuck in limbo"" - keen to try something new, but unsure of when her children- who she has been home schooling - will return to school. ""There is work. There are jobs available. But when I look on LinkedIn, every single job has hundreds of applications, so competition is very stiff,"" she says. ""I feel women are really carrying the burden of this pandemic with regards to the childcare, whether working or not. It's made me feel quite depressed at times. ""My redundancy money is only going to last so long and I'm scared of what the future holds for us at the moment."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' How can I find a new job? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy bounced back in June as government restrictions on movement started to ease. On a month-on-month basis, the economy grew by 8.7% in June, after growth of 1.8% in May. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: ""Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck."" The ONS said the collapse in output was driven by the closure of shops, hotels, restaurants, schools and car repair shops. The services sector, which powers four-fifths of the economy, suffered the biggest quarterly decline on record. This video can not be played What is a recession? Factory shutdowns also resulted in the slowest car production since 1954. How could a recession affect me? Is there such a thing as a 'good' or 'bad' recession? PM warns of 'long, long way to go' for UK economy The economic decline was concentrated in April, at the height of lockdown. Official jobs figures released on Tuesday showedthe number of people in workfell by 220,000 between April and June. But in a BBC interview on Wednesday, Mr Sunak did not waver on ending the government's furlough scheme of job subsidies, which is winding down and is due to end entirely after October. ""I think most people would agree that that's not something that is sustainable indefinitely,"" he told the BBC. The chancellor said the government should not pretend that ""absolutely everybody can and will be able to go back to the job they had"" and said there would be support for creating jobs in new areas. The opposition has been critical of the government's handling of the economy during the pandemic. Ms Dodds said: ""We've already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we're on course for the worst recession too. That's a tragedy for the British people and it's happened on Boris Johnson's watch."" Referring to the tapering of the furlough scheme, she said the government had ""snatched away wage support for businesses that hadn't even reopened yet"". Laura Tenison, founder of clothing firm JoJo Maman Bebe, told the BBC that the trading performance of her 90 stores was showing huge variations, with those in urban locations suffering from a lack of office workers and tourists. ""Those like York, Windsor, central London, Reading, Norwich - those ones are absolutely dire, really really awful,"" she said. ""I mean, some days we take no money, put it that way. But some of the village stores, the community stores, they're actually doing better than we anticipated. ""I think we have six stores in the portfolio that actually are trading up on last year."" Ms Tenison founded her business in 1993, during a recession. ""This is my third recession in my relatively long life in retail,"" she said. ""We still have to be entrepreneurial,"" she added. ""We have had to close down some areas of business because of Covid. We've had to close our American business, which is just a massive sadness to me. ""Of course, everyone has to look at their overheads, but be creative. Look at those opportunities out there. Recessions bring opportunities."" Business groups urged the government to do more to support the economic recovery. Alpesh Paleja, an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said many companies were struggling to pay their bills on time. He said: ""A sustained recovery is by no means assured. The dual threats of a second wave and slow progress over Brexit negotiations are also particularly concerning."" This video can not be played Anneliese Dodds: The UK has not seen âa big enough bounce back and we really need oneâ While more recent data suggest the recovery is gaining traction, the Bank of England does not expect the economy to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the end of next year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, expects the recovery to take even longer. The UK's slump is one of the biggest among advanced economies, according to preliminary estimates. The economy is more than a fifth smaller than it was at the end of last year. This fall is not as bad as the 22.7% decline in Spain, but about twice the size of contractions in Germany and the US. The chancellor told the BBC that the UK economy had performed worse than its EU counterparts because it was focused on services, hospitality and consumer spending. ""Those kinds of activities comprise a much larger share of our economy than they do for most of our European cousins,"" he said.

How could a recession affect me?,"The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was ""returning to full health"", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a ""victory lap"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces. When GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result. But sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets. What is GDP and how does it affect me? The UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters. The economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December. This meantthe economy went into recession at the end of 2023. But the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession. Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises? Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth.

How could Kamala Harris help as Joe Biden's running mate,"Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason. Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe Biden's running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be on his ticket. She was a safe pick and a practical one. She's also now in the position to be the heir apparent for the Democratic Party - whether it's in four years because Biden loses in November or doesn't run for re-election or eight years if Biden serves two full terms. That could be why it seemed that there were so many attempts to knock Harris down a peg, or advance alternative candidates over the past month. This was, in effect, the first fight of the next presidential nomination contest, and Harris - whose ambitions are clear - now has a step on the competition. But determining future Democratic nominees is a battle for another day. The pressing concern for the party at the moment is how Harris might help Biden win the White House. Here are some strengths she brings to the ticket and, perhaps, some concerns Democrats may have. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots To put it bluntly, today's Democratic Party doesn't look like Joe Biden. It's young and it's ethnically diverse. It was increasingly obvious that the presumptive nominee needed to find someone younger and, well, less white to have a ticket that reflects the people who will vote for it. Harris, whose father was Jamaican and mother came from India, fills this particular need. She becomes both the first black woman and the first Asian to run on a major party presidential ticket. And although at 55 years old she's not exactly young, when compared to 77-year-old Joe Biden, she's downright spry. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? On Tuesday afternoon, before she was announced as Biden's pick, Harris tweeted about the need for diversity in the leadership of the party. ""Black women and women of color have long been underrepresented in elected office and in November we have an opportunity to change that,"" she wrote. It turns out Harris could be directly responsible for some of that change. One of the traditional roles of a vice-presidential running mate is to get down and dirty with the opposition. While the person at the top of the ticket takes the rhetorical high road, the number-two cracks out the brass knuckles for the opposition. In 2008, Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, more than lived up to her nickname, Sarah the Barracuda, for instance. If this is a duty that falls on Harris, history suggests she will be up to the task. Biden certainly recalls that it was Harris who went after him with gusto during the first Democratic primary debate in July 2019, criticisinghis opposition to bussing to end segregation in public schools. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Harris has also proven to be a very determined and aggressive interrogator during her time in the US Senate. Donald Trump clearly remembers this, as he remarked on Tuesday evening that he thought Harris was ""extraordinarily nasty"" to his second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Trump may not like it, but nasty may be exactly what Biden is looking for this autumn. One thing politicians who have run for national office have said time and time again is that it's impossible to understand the intense pressure such campaigns create until one has actually been in one. Although Harris's 2020 presidential bid was unsuccessful, and she dropped out before most of her competitors, she still knows what it's like to be under such scrutiny. When she launched her campaign before tens of thousands of supporters in January 2019, she was treated like a top-tier presidential contender. For a time in July, after her strong first debate performance, she rose towards the top of some primary polls. Harris has been through the fire, at least for a time, and knows what it feels like. If there were serious, dinosaur-sized skeletons in her closet, they would have come out by now. Given that she's already sought the presidency, its not impossible for many Americans to imagine her as president someday. The California senator may not have been the most dynamic candidate on the campaign trail in 2019, and she was certainly not nearly the most successful one, but at this point she's a known quantity. And for Biden,who is currently up in the polls, the fewer surprises the rest of the campaign the better. More than almost any of the other contenders for the vice-presidential spot, Harris comes from a law-enforcement background. Given the recent demonstrations over police brutality and allegations of institutional racism in law enforcement, Harris's resume may give some progressives within the Democratic Party pause. It certainly did during Harris's presidential campaign, when ""Harris is a cop"" was a derisive accusation thrown at the California senator on more than one occasion. This video can not be played President Trump calls Kamala Harris ""meanest"" US senator Both as San Francisco district attorney and as California's attorney general, Harris has sided with police over suspects - even in cases where those suspects may have been wrongfully convicted. Although she's expressed personal opposition to the death penalty, she's supported its use while she's been in office. Being a hard-nosed crime-fighter may be an attractive attribute among independent and conservative-leaning voters in the general election, but if that support comes at the cost of enthusiasm for the Biden-Harris ticket on the left, then it may not be a net positive. Since the death of George Floyd, Harris has been outspoken in advocating law-enforcement reform, winning praise from some progressives. But it's safe to say they still harbour some doubts. Above, Harris having run a presidential campaign was noted as a mark in her favour. There's a flip side to that, however. Her campaign, while it started with a bang and had its moments, also had some serious flaws - and some of those flaws related to the candidate herself. Although Harris has a pretty moderate record as a senator and state attorney general, she tried to tack to the left during her presidential campaign. She came out in favour of free college education, the Green New Deal environmental programme and universal healthcare, for instance, but never sounded all that convincing about it. Mr Biden tells Ms Harris she will be his running mate on Tuesday She particularly got tripped up on the question of whether private insurance should be banned - which, while fine with progressives, gives many moderate heartburn. ""Let's eliminate all of that,"" she said rather glibly during one interview. ""Let's move on."" In this day and age, the death knell for politicians is to seem too political - to be perceived as willing to shift values and beliefs based on what the voters want. Sincerity, or at least the appearance of it, is a virtue voters prize  - and part of the reason why Donald Trump became president. While his supporters didn't always agree with him, they felt like he speaks his mind. Harris's move from moderate, then to the left and now back, perhaps, to the Biden middle could leave some voters wondering where her core values lie - or if she has any core values at all.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it received more than 1,000 emergency calls overnight due to the severe weather. Among them were multiple reports of flooding in Perthshire and North Lanarkshire. ScotRail said lightning strikes had also caused power outages and disruption across the network. It also led to major disruption on the transport network and to broadband connection issues. In Fife, the Local Resilience Partnership (LRP) was activated following a number of incidents across the region. Flooding at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy saw cars piled on top of each other The water was at its deepest at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy overnight As well as the incident at Pettycur Bay Holiday Park, police, fire and council services dealt with flooding issues in Freuchie, Cairneyhill, Cardenden, Kinglassie, Culross and Lochgelly.

QAnon supporter wins nomination for Congress seat,"Marjorie Taylor Greene is poised to be elected in November A US businesswoman who has expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory has won the Republican nomination for a seat in the House of Representatives. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now expected to be elected in November to represent Georgia's heavily conservative 14th congressional district, and become QAnon's first devotee in Congress. It comes amid a social media crackdown on the conspiracy theory. QAnon says ""deep-state"" traitors are plotting against Donald Trump. Ms Greene is part of a growing list of Republican candidates to express support for the conspiracy theory. In another major result on Tuesday, Ilhan Omar defeated a well-funded challenger to put her on track for re-election, along with other members of the ""squad"" of Democratic congresswomen. Ms Greene, a businesswoman who owns a construction company with her husband, beat neurosurgeon John Cowan for the Republican nomination on Tuesday. She will face Democrat Kevin Van Ausdal in November but is widely expected to win in the conservative district. The controversial candidate has previously expressed support for QAnon - a wide-ranging, unfounded conspiracy theory that says that Donald Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media. In a YouTube video, she praised ""Q"" - the pseudonymous figure who started the conspiracy theory - as a ""patriot"". In recent weeks, several social media sites have taken action against QAnon, with Twitter banning thousands of accounts linked to the conspiracy theory and TikTok blocking hashtags related to it from appearing in search results, among other measures. The FBI has designated QAnon a potential domestic extremist threat. While other candidates have also expressed support for QAnon, most stand little chance of being elected. Aside from QAnon, Ms Greene has positioned herself as a strong supporter of Mr Trump and is pro-gun, pro-border wall and anti-abortion. Several Republican officials spoke out against her campaign earlier this year when videos were unearthed showing her making offensive remarks about black people, Muslims and Jews. What is QAnon? TikTok blocks QAnon conspiracy theory hashtags Facebook removes 200,000-strong QAnon group Ms Greene celebrated the result on social media. ""The GOP [Republican Party] establishment, the media, & the radical left, spent months & millions of dollars attacking me. Tonight the people of Georgia stood up & said that we will not be intimidated or believe those lies,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""I'm excited to be the next Congresswoman of GA 14. God bless America."" Mr Trump on Wednesday congratulated Ms Greene,  calling her a ""future Republican star"". ""Marjorie is strong on everything and never gives up - a real WINNER!"" Voter Pamela Reardon told the Associated Press news agency that she supported Ms Greene ""because of her honesty"". ""She's not going to be bought by anybody. I could tell that her heart was pure."" This video can not be played QAnon is a bizarre conspiracy cult that has surged in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. Democrat Ilhan Omar easily survived a challenge from a well-funded opponent on Tuesday, putting her on track for re-election as representative of Minnesota's fifth congressional district. Ms Omar - one of the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress in 2018 - beat attorney Antone Melton-Meaux, whose campaign raised millions of dollars. Ilhan Omar won more than 57% of the vote Mr Melton-Meaux accused the Somali-born politician of prioritising her celebrity over her constituents. But Ms Omar won more than 57% of the vote, compared with about 39% for Mr Melton-Meaux. Taking to social media following the result on Tuesday, Ms Omar said she was looking forward to returning to Congress. ""In Minnesota, we know that organized people will always beat organized money.  Tonight, our movement didn't just win. We earned a mandate for change. Despite outside efforts to defeat us, we once again broke turnout records,"" she wrote on Twitter. Who are the congresswomen known as 'the squad'? Ms Omar's family came to the US as refugees, settling in Minneapolis in 1997. She became a citizen in 2000. She is known as a member of the ""squad"" of four progressive non-white Democratic congresswomen, who were elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. All four are expected to be re-elected in November. What is QAnon?

Carer who went untested fears she spread Covid-19,"This video can not be played Alison Taylor has tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, despite never experiencing any symptoms A carer who was unable to be tested for coronavirus until July said she feared she may have spread the disease into care homes despite showing no symptoms. Alison Taylor, from Sheffield, recently tested positive for antibodies indicating she once had coronavirus. She now fears she may have worked while contagious and even visited her mother, who later died with suspected Covid-19. The Department of Health and Social Care said protecting staff and residents at homes was a top priority. Miss Taylor, 51, said: ""I find it really hard to think that I might have passed it to care homes, to residents, to my family. ""I could be responsible for other people's deaths without knowing."" As a healthcare assistant, she has looked after vulnerable people throughout the pandemic. Miss Taylor, who is employed by an agency, worked at four different homes before regular testing was introduced for care workers and residents without symptoms. She said she was first tested for coronavirus about a month ago and has since had two tests in the past two weeks. Last week, Miss Taylor had an antibody test that returned a positive result which, according to NHS England,meant she has had the virus. She said if she had any idea she had been infected then she would have stayed at home rather than going to work. Miss Taylor said: ""I've continued working throughout with no symptoms so I don't know if I've passed it on or not. ""I'm really uncomfortable that I could have gone into care homes, worked with however many residents and staff without knowing that I've got Covid."" The government has announced that plans to test all care home residents and staff have been delayed During the period when she might have been self-isolating, Miss Taylor went to the supermarket and visited her vulnerable parents. She said she last saw her 82-year-old mother, who had Alzheimer's disease, just before mother's day, in March. Miss Taylor said her mother was ""really good"" at the time but died less than a month later on 16 April. She was never tested so there was no way of knowing whether she had coronavirus. Miss Taylor said she was told coronavirus started in the home after a resident was treated in hospital for a fall. She added: ""Now I know that I've had it and I saw my mum, I've got some sort of guilt maybe, because I just don't know. ""I've got a fear that I've passed it on to my mum maybe, to people that I've been caring for in my work place, with no idea whatsoever that I've been positive.""

Routine testing for care home workers and residentswas announced on 3 July. However, the government has admitted regular testing would only reach all homes for over-65s and those with dementia by 7 September. Miss Taylor said: ""We need to know that staff are safe and that residents are as safe as they can be. ""If we're not tested and we don't know who's got it, who's had it, it's just going to continue, it's just going to roll on."" Symptomless cases 'carry same amount of virus' More could have Covid immunity than tests suggest More news and stories from Yorkshire Last week, the Department of Health and Social Care said a ""combination of issues"" had limited the number of testing kits available for care homes and as a result it had been unable ""do as much asymptomatic testing as we want"". A spokesperson has now added: ""Protecting care home residents and staff has been one of our top priorities throughout this unprecedented pandemic. ""We are doing all we can to ensure tests are available to everyone who needs one. We are issuing at least 50,000 tests every day to care homes across the country, while working around the clock to minimise any disruption to routine retesting.""

Severe mental health problems rise amid pandemic,"Doctors are seeing a rise in people reporting severe mental health difficulties, a group of NHS leaders says. It follows a more than 30% drop in referrals to mental health services during the peak of the pandemic. But there are predictions that the recent rise will mean demand actually outstrips pre-coronavirus levels - perhaps by as much as 20%. The NHS Confederation said those who needed help should come forward. But the group, which represents health and care leaders, said in a report that mental services required ""intensive support and investment"" in order to continue to be able to help those who needed it. The NHS Confederation's mental health lead, Sean Duggan, said that when coronavirus cases were at their highest, people stayed away from services, as they did from other parts of the NHS. ""A&E numbers were down, GP numbers were down. The same occurred in some of our mental health services,"" he said, as people tried to ease the burden on the health service and sought to avoid catching the virus. ""The concern is, if you leave problems they can get worse."" This may explain some of the rise in more severe cases coming forward. As well as people whose conditions deteriorated during lockdown, NHS services also expect an increase in demand for mental health services as a direct result of the pandemic itself, the report said. Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health 'Make or break' moment to prevent PTSD It flagged isolation, substance use, domestic violence and economic uncertainty as factors that might contribute to the need for extra support. There are also ""particular concerns that the stark inequalities in accessing services and recovery rates that black and minority ethnic communities face will be exacerbated"", the report said. Mental health providers report that as well as seeing patients with ""more significant needs"", a higher proportion of their referrals are patients who are accessing services for the first time. Meanwhile, providers predict infection control and social-distancing measures will mean they have an estimated 10-30% less capacity than normal. Mr Duggan said he did not want to ""medicalise everything... It's perfectly normal to feel uneasy and anxious"" at such an uncertain time. But nevertheless, there was a ""real"" increase in people needing mental health services, he added. NHS England last week published the next phase of its response to Covid-19, acknowledging that ""mental health needs may increase significantly"". Its plan includes expanding Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services - the route for treating the most common, mild to moderate conditions, into which people can refer themselves. It also said people being looked after by community mental health teams - generally those with greater needs - should have their care reviewed. People with severe mental illness should receive more therapy and support, it said. NHS England also pointed to its mental health and wellbeing service launched for all health staff.

Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has named Kamala Harris as his running mate - the first black woman and South Asian American in the role. Once a rival for the top job, the California senator of Indian-Jamaican heritage had long been considered the front-runner for the number two slot. The former California attorney general has been urging police reform amid nationwide anti-racism protests. Mr Biden will face President Donald Trump in the election on 3 November. After Tuesday's announcement, Ms Harris tweeted that Mr Biden ""can unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals. ""I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief."" Mr Biden and Ms Harris will deliver remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday afternoon on ""working together to restore the soul of the nation and fight for working families to move the country forward"", the Biden campaign said. After the announcement, the Biden-Harris campaign released this photo of the two together At a White House news conference on Tuesday, Mr Trump, a Republican, said he was pleased with Mr Biden's choice, adding that Ms Harris did ""very, very poorly"" in her effort to become the Democratic nominee. Ms Harris will take part in a debate with Mr Trump's running mate, Vice-President Mike Pence, on 7 October in Salt Lake City, Utah. In last year's race to be the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris showed herself to be a forceful speaker, launching blistering attacks on Donald Trump. The role of a vice-presidential running mate isn't always clearly defined. One of the traditional roles is to go on the offensive in exposing the opposition's weaknesses, while the presidential nominee focuses on communicating the party's message, says the BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher. Constitutionally, the vice-president steps in to the top job should the president die or leave office during his or her term. Mr Biden will turn 78 in November, meaning should he be elected he will be the oldest US president in history (Ronald Reagan was 77 when he left office). His age means Mr Biden's vice-presidential choice may come under extra scrutiny. Only two other women have been nominated as vice-presidential candidates for a major party - Sarah Palin by the Republican party in 2008 and Geraldine Ferraro by the Democrats in 1984. Neither were on the winning ticket. A woman of colour has never been appointed to a presidential ticket by either of the two main American political parties. No woman has won the US presidency either. Mr Biden tweeted that he had ""the great honour"" to name Ms Harris as his number two. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Kamala Harris: Voters weigh in on historic pick He described her as ""a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country's finest public servants"". He noted how she had worked closely with his late son, Beau, when she was California's attorney general. ""I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse,"" he tweeted. ""I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in thisÂ campaign."" Mr Biden tells Ms Harris she will be his running mate on Tuesday Mr Biden pledged in March to name a woman on the ticket. He had faced mounting calls to pick a black woman in recent months as the nation has been convulsed by social unrest over police brutality against African Americans, a key voting bloc for the Democratic Party. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Ms Harris, 55, dropped out of the presidential race in December after failing to make headway in her bid to win the Democratic nomination. She repeatedly clashed with Mr Biden during the primary election debates, most notably criticisinghis praise for the ""civil"" working relationshiphe had with former senators who favoured racial segregation. Ms Harris was born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents: an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father. She went on to attend Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities. She has described her time there as among the most formative experiences of her life. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as ""an American"". In 2019,she told the Washington Post,externalthat politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Americast: Kamala Harris makes history Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason. Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe Biden's running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be his ticket. She's relatively young and telegenic, and as the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants reflects the growing diversity of the Democratic Party. What's more, she's been in the spotlight of the national media, having campaigned for president in 2019 and, for a while last summer, risen to near the top of some polls. Many of her rivals for the number-two spot had never faced such scrutiny, so there was no proof that they could hold up under fire. Another underrated advantage for Ms Harris was her friendship with Mr Biden's late son, Beau, formed when they were both attorneys general. Mr Biden places a high value on family - and that connection may have made choosing her easier. Now Ms Harris will have a chance to hit the campaign trail again and prove that she deserves this historic pick. If she succeeds, she'll be in prime position to seek the presidency again, perhaps as early as 2024. Today has made her a force in the Democratic Party for years to come. How could Kamala help - or hurt - Joe Biden After four years at Howard, Ms Harris went on to earn her law degree at the University of California, Hastings, and began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. She became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first African American to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. This video can not be played President Trump calls Kamala Harris ""meanest"" US senator In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Ms Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. She was only the second black woman ever elected to the US senate. She launched her candidacy for president to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland at the beginning of last year. But Ms Harris failed to articulate a clear rationale for her campaign, and gave muddled answers to questions in key policy areas like healthcare. She was also unable to capitalise on the clear high point of her candidacy: debate performances that showed off her prosecutorial skills, often placing Mr Biden in the line of attack. When Harris could draw a crowd of 20,000 Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris? The self-described ""progressive prosecutor"" tried to emphasise more left-leaning parts of her legacy - requiring body cameras for some special agents at the California Department of Justice, the first state agency to adopt them, and launching a database that provided public access to crime statistics, though she failed to gain traction. ""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail, spoiling her attempts to win over the more liberal Democratic base during the primaries. Those same law enforcement credentials could, however, prove beneficial in the general election when Democrats need to win over more moderate voters and independents. President Trump told reporters: ""She's a person that's told many, many stories that weren't true."" He added Ms Harris was ""very, very nasty"" and ""horrible"" to Mr Biden during the Democratic primary debates. ""She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden and it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful,"" he said. The Trump campaign said the choice of running mate was proof that Mr Biden is ""an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left"". The unsuccessful Democratic candidate in 2016, Hillary Clinton, said she was ""thrilled to welcome [Ms Harris] to a historic Democratic ticket"". ""She's already proven herself to be an incredible public servant and leader,"" she added. Former US President Barack Obama - whom Mr Biden served as vice-president for eight years - tweeted: ""She is more than prepared for the job. She's spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. ""This is a good day for our country. Now let's go win this thing.""

Aberdeen local lockdown to be reviewed,"The local lockdown imposed in Aberdeen a week ago after a spike in coronavirus cases is to remain in place. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the number of new cases in the city had fallen in recent days - but was still ""much higher"" than in other areas. She said it was therefore too early to lift any of the restrictions. It means pubs and restaurants will remain closed, with restrictions on travel and visiting other households still in place. The first minister said the restrictions would be reviewed again next Wednesday, and pledged: ""As soon as we can relax any of them, we will do so"". Ms Sturgeon said a total of 177 cases had now been linked to the outbreak - 12 more than yesterday - with 900 contacts having been identified. She added: ""In the last few days we have seen a slight fall in the number of new cases in Grampian and in those directly associated with the cluster. ""But despite this slight reduction, cases are still far higher than in any other part of the country - and considerably higher than they were in Grampian before the outbreak started"". The first minister said the Scottish government's conclusion, based on the advice it had received, was that ""it is not yet possible to lift any of the restrictions that were put in place last week for Aberdeen."" The first cases in the Aberdeen cluster were linked to The Hawthorn bar Ms Sturgeon said she knew people in Aberdeen would be disappointed by the decision, and thanked them for ""complying so well with the rules"". She added: ""We continue to watch closely for any signs that the outbreak has spread to Aberdeenshire in any significant way, but at present we are not placing any additional restrictions on people living in the shire"". She said the city council had been fully involved in the discussions, with the police reporting ""good compliance"" with the restrictions in the city since they were imposed last Wednesday. The restrictions in Aberdeen mean: bars, cafes, restaurants and pubs are closed no travel more than five miles for leisure or holidays no travel to the city for leisure or to visit friends and family, even if you live in Aberdeenshire no indoor visits with other households visiting suspended for most hospitals It emerged last week that eight Aberdeen FC players had visited the city's Soul Bar the previous Saturday, with two later testing positive for Covid-19. Eight Aberdeen players are self-isolating after visiting a bar in the city before the local lockdown was imposed The revelation angered the first minister, and has led tothe cancellation of the club's next two matches. One person who was among a cluster of five cases in north east Angus had been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak. Health officials in Aberdeenshire have also been investigating a potential cluster in the Stonehaven/Portlethen area, but no connection to Aberdeen had yet been established.

Latest on the passenger train derailment The derailment took place on the line west of Stonehaven Across Scotland, homes were flooded and many schools were closed on the day they were due to reopen after lockdown. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it received more than 1,000 emergency calls overnight due to the severe weather. Among them were multiple reports of flooding in Perthshire and North Lanarkshire. ScotRail said lightning strikes had also caused power outages and disruption across the network. It also led to major disruption on the transport network and to broadband connection issues. In Fife, the Local Resilience Partnership (LRP) was activated following a number of incidents across the region. Flooding at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy saw cars piled on top of each other The water was at its deepest at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy overnight As well as the incident at Pettycur Bay Holiday Park, police, fire and council services dealt with flooding issues in Freuchie, Cairneyhill, Cardenden, Kinglassie, Culross and Lochgelly. A number of people were evacuated from their homes and staff at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy discovered their cars under water when the site car park flooded. Roads in Fife, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire were closed, while rail services were also disrupted. Streets were flooded in Perth as heavy rain swept across the area Lightning lit up the skies over Edinburgh Stonehaven town centre was cut off by the flood water In Stonehaven town centre, streets were under more than a foot of water, with the owners of a local fish and chip ship saying they were ""devastated"" at being flooded for the fourth time in nine years.

A-level student hopes assessed grades are 'fair',"Begw Rowlands: ""I hope that the way they've gone about it is as fair as it could possibly be"" ""I'm quite relaxed about it, I've never been one to worry about exams,"" says 17-year-old Begw Rowlands, one of thousands of young people waiting for A-level results. But after exams were cancelled, this year is different because ""obviously we haven't been able to do an exam and feel that went well or that didn't go as well"". Begw, from the Vale of Glamorgan, always intended taking a year out before applying for drama school next year. A Careers Wales survey found that 38% of A-level pupils said the pandemic had affected their future plans. Begw, who studied A-level drama and Welsh, BTEC music and the Welsh baccalaureate, says she was pleased at first when exams were cancelled. ""I was quite chuffed to begin with actually, because no one wants to do exams,"" she says. ""But, obviously, Year 13 is the pinnacle of your school experience and you kind of want to prove yourself."" This year's grades have been calculated using grades assessed by schools and colleges which have then gone through a standardisation process to make sure they are consistent. A mass upgrading of A-Level results should not be needed in Wales despite some predicted grades being lowered, the Welsh Government has insisted. Mass exam result upgrade 'not expected' in Wales Exam results lowered after 'generous grading' Results in Wales will be 'balanced and fair' ""I hope that the way they've gone about it is as fair as it could possibly be,"" Begw says. She's currently working as an assistant in a hospital and hopes to travel when that's possible, as well as keeping up with her drama. Students want exam results upgraded across UK Universities told to hold places open until appeal The Careers Wales survey also found that three quarters of pupils in exam years were worried about their grades. ""It's natural for young people to be worried about their exam results,"" says Stephen Williams from Careers Wales. ""If they're not what they were expecting, just take a step back. ""Try not to get too emotional and try to think about things logically, talk things through with people that are important to them and make contact with us. ""We will help them put things into perspective and start looking at how we get to where you wanted to get to."" Brother and sister Imogen and Scott Gilmour from Powys, are pupils in Caereinion High School. Before the pandemic, both were preparing to sit exams, Imogen, 16, doing GCSE and Scott A Levels. Scott, 18, says he was apprehensive after hearing there would be no exams and was initially concerned the results would be ""less credible"". Imogen and Scott Gilmour Exam results lowered after 'generous grading' Exam board says grades will be 'balanced and fair' He's hoping to study law and both he and Imogen, from Meifod, will receive their results via email rather than visiting the school. ""Obviously I hope I do well, but I don't feel it's the end of the world if I don't get exactly what I need. ""I'm not worried I'm going to do terribly but I have thought about the possibility of me not doing as well as I need to - to get to university because both of my university choices are quite high requirements,"" he said. Imogen intends to stay on for sixth form to study biology, chemistry, physics and maths. She says: ""I'm feeling okay about the whole thing and I'm quite excited that it's getting emailed to us at a specific time. ""It will just be nice to be able to sit there with your family and wait for it."" She says she was also a ""little apprehensive because when you do exams you have some idea of how you might have done"". ""But with this, it's a little bit more tricky because you don't know at all how the teachers are going to grade you."" A-level results in Wales, England and Northern Ireland are due out on Thursday Similar grading systems were adopted in other parts of the UK and in Scotland the government was forced to make aU-turnafter tens of thousands of teacher assessed grades were lowered. Education researcher Jane Nicholas said the system in Wales is different in some ways. ""Most of the candidates for A-level this year will have already sat the AS exam under normal conditions last year, which means that 40% of their mark is taken from the mark they achieved in the AS level,"" she says. What will happen on A-level results day? 'Exam results don't define you - you do' ""That gives, I think, some reassurance that they'll be more weight given to actual data about what those individual pupils were able to achieve. ""But, certainly, there is a lot of concern and rightfully so from the candidates themselves. ""It's a really stressful time for them and their parents, it always is at exam time. ""This week is always very stressful for everybody, but it's been uniquely so this year."" Mass A-level result upgrade 'not expected' in Wales As the GCSE pass rate falls, how to appeal or resit?

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Contributors were: Sarah Collerton, Kevin Ponniah, Joseph Lee, Georgina Rannard, Dulcie Lee, and Joshua Nevett. And here's a recap of the main UK stories related to the pandemic: We'll soon be pausing our live coverage following a day when Europe upped its efforts to control new outbreaks of coronavirus and Russia hit back against scepticism about its vaccine. Here are the main world stories on Wednesday: The Big Ten includes teams like Rutgers Scarlet Knights (pictured in white and red) and Penn State Nittany Lions The Big Ten and Pac-12 sports conferences - two of the biggest in the world of American college football - have voted to postpone their autumn season over Covid-19. Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren said there was ""too much uncertainty"" over the risks to allow the student athletes to compete. The move has sparked disappointment across the country, as well as concerns over how college towns and local economies that rely on the sports season for revenue will cope. But other major conferences - including the Big 12 and the ACC - are reportedly considering moving forward with games. USA Today sports columnist Dan Wolkenwrote in an opinion piece,external: ""It is incredibly absurd, and yet perfectly appropriate for the way the Covid-19 pandemic has played out in America, that the fate of the entire college football season could really come down to believing one set of medical experts over another. "" Public Health England said its approach was intended to ensure deaths were not underestimated early in the pandemic As we reported earlier, the UK coronavirus death tollhas been reduced by more than 5,000. This has happened because a review was ordered after it emerged England may have been including deaths which occurred months after a positive test for coronavirus, whereas the other UK nations had a 28-day cut-off. By using the same methodology in all four nations, the overall death toll has now been reduced by 12% - from 46,706 to 41,239. In the most recent week of data analysed, 18 to 24 July, deaths dropped by 75%, from 442 to 111. Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, said the original method of counting was chosen ""to avoid underestimating deaths caused by the virus in the early stages of the pandemic"". ""Our analysis of the long-term impact of the infection now allows us to move to new methods, which will give us crucial information about both recent trends and overall mortality burden due to Covid-19,"" he said. The Department for Health and Social Care said the UK's chief medical officers had recommended the ""single consistent"" measure across all four nations. It said that the review, carried out by Public Health England, had considered epidemiological data on how likely it was that Covid-19 had contributed to someone's death at different points of time after a positive test. In July Doreen Lugaliki, 39, was reportedly the first Kenyan doctor to die from coronavirus A top health official in Kenya has died from coronavirus as the country deals with rising infections. Kamau Mugenda was second in charge at the Kenya Medical Research Institute which oversees Covid-19 testing and vaccine trials programme. More than 450 workers in the health ministry have been infected, and at least three frontline health workers have died, the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza reports from Nairobi. Despite imposing strict measures to deal with the virus, cases have more than doubled over the past days. Meanwhile, authorities in Kenya are investigating the disappearance of equipment and monies donated to help stop the spread of Covid-19, our correspondent adds. Leo KelionTechnology desk editor A similar app has already launched in Northern Ireland, but it is not yet clear how well it is working England's revamped coronavirus contact-tracing app isset to begin public trials tomorrow. The software will be based on Apple and Google's privacy-centric method of one smartphone detecting another - which matches contacts on the phones themselves rather than sending potentially sensitive information to a centralised computer. Engineers are still trying to reduce how often the Bluetooth-based tech wrongly flags people as being within 2m (6.6ft) of each other. Officials are concerned about people going into quarantine as a consequence. The Isle of Wight will be involved again, along with one other area and a volunteer group. The government intends to launch the experiment without much fanfare, because it is still not clear when a formal national rollout will occur. The idea behind the app is to use people's phones to log when they have been close to another person for so long that there is a high risk of contagion. If one user is later diagnosed with the disease, the other person can be alerted to the fact before they begin exhibiting symptoms. In addition, users will also be asked to scan a QR barcode when they enter a property, to provide a means to later alert them to the fact that they visited a location linked to multiple infections.

In Wales, where a fifth of all Covid-19 deaths were of people with dementia,families said the impact was ""staggering""and called for a task force to be established in case of a second wave. Ceri Higgins, whose 82-year-old father David Williams died in April, said she felt ""our lives were out of control"" because they could not have any contact with him in his last days. She said she has grown increasingly concerned that not enough has been done to investigate why dementia patients were so badly affected. The Welsh government said it was prioritising the implementation of itsdementia action plan,externalin light of the Covid-19 pandemic. But her concerns are echoed elsewhere in the UK: in Liverpool, Anne Byrne said her 90-year-old mother, Annie Cartwright, hassuffered a ""shocking decline"" as a result of restrictions on visits. ""People living in the home don't understand the pandemic - they think their families have abandoned them,"" she said. Charles Musselwhite, associate professor in gerontology at Swansea University, said dementia patients had been forgotten in the pandemic. ""This is one group that we knew were vulnerable and they haven't been protected in any serious sense."" The Department for Health and Social Care said its priority was to protect residents and staff from the virus. This video can not be played Exam results: 'Routes for young people to address concerns' Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has apologised to ""every single child"" for the disruption they have faced because of the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview with the BBC, he said the ""best thing"" was for every child in England to be back in school in September. A-levels results will be revealed on Thursday morning, with results based on estimates after exams were cancelled. On Tuesday, the Department for Education announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. ""It's a robust system, it's a fair system, it's making sure that young people get the grades that they've worked so hard towards,"" Williamson said. Williamson defended the last-minute change ahead of Thursday's results, saying: ""I'm not going to hesitate in terms of actually making changes if I can get the system as fair as possible for every single child."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer earlier accused the government of causing ""widespread chaos"" following the 11th-hour changes, adding the situation was ""shambolic"". Read more here  A review of how UK deaths from coronavirus are counted hascut the death toll by more than 5,000 to 41,329, the government has announced. Previously, people in England who died at any point following a positive test - regardless of cause of death - were counted in the daily published statistics. But there will now be a cut-off of 28 days, providing what the government believes is a more accurate picture of the epidemic. This brings England's data in line with the other UK nations. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Growers and producers are at loggerheads over how to respond to the pandemic It's been an exceptional year in Champagne. The weather has been near perfect, with plenty of sunshine and rain falling at just the right time to give the vines their necessary oomph. The grapes in this famed French region are bursting with expectation for an early harvest. But never in living memory have market conditions been so poor. ""Covid has left everything reeling,"" said Bernard Beaulieu, a champagne producer. ""The fall in sales is staring us in the face. It's hastened a crisis that, if you ask me, has been a long time coming."" Read the full story from Hugh. ""We do not want to spoil what should be a joyous occasion,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey Greater Manchester Police haswarned students getting their A-level results tomorrow not to hold any parties, saying fines could be issued for breaching coronavirus restrictions. ""We do not want to spoil what should be a joyous occasion by issuing fixed penalty notices at any house parties or illegal gatherings,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey. Manchester is part of a swathe of northern England that was placed under enhanced coronavirus restrictions on 31 July after a spike in cases. Police said that house parties, some of which involved 17- and 18-year-olds, had played a part in the rise. And last weekend, there were 1,106 reports of lockdown breaches, 540 of which were house parties, they said. The UK falling into recession is ""terrible news"" for the many people's mental health, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Adrian James, has said. It comes asdoctors are seeing a rise in people reporting severe mental health difficulties, according to a group of NHS leaders. James said the ""looming economic crisis will widen existing health and social inequalities and worsen the mental health problems they bring"". ""Those already unemployed, those living
in poverty, young people, single-parent families and people from Black, Asian
and minority ethnic communities are likely to be hit the hardest."" The government should invest further in mental health and social welfare services, James said, if it is to avoid the most ""devastating"" consequences of the economic crisis. The US state of Texas reported over 8,900 new virus cases on Tuesday, pushing the state's total over 500,000 since the start of the pandemic. The state's average number of new daily cases is now higher than it was last week, which saw about 6,900 new cases each day. The positive case rate - the proportion of those tested for coronavirus that are actually positive - is another indicator of the spread. It is currently at 24% in Texas. For context, the World Health Organization advised governments to avoid reopening societies until positivity rates were at 5% or lower for at least 14 days. Critics said Texan leaders allowed the state to reopen too soon, which led to the spike earlier this summer. Officials say the numbers are now better than what they were but they are urging residents to practise social distancing and mask-wearing. Many of the US's county-level hotspots remain in hard-hit Texas and Florida, though Florida is overall seeing a decline in its new cases. California, the most populous state, continues to grapple with rising Covid-19 cases - with 12,500 reported on Tuesday. As you've probably heard, Russia has approved a coronavirus vaccine which its leader, Vladimir Putin, says is safe for use. But internationally, experts have expressed scepticism. The World Health Organization said it had not seen enough information and was in talks with Russia about assessing it. The US's top virus expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, meanwhile told National Geographic: ""I hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that."" Now Russia has dismissed these concerns as ""absolutely groundless"". It plans to produce five million doses a month by 2021,according to the Russian news agency Tass.,external ""It seems our foreign colleagues are sensing the specific competitive advantages of the Russian drug and are trying to express opinions that... are absolutely groundless,"" Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday. Meanwhile in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte offered himself as a human test subject for the Russian vaccine. Read more about theinternational reaction to the drug. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Montreaux Jazz Festival, cancelled this year, normally attracts 200,000 people Switzerland has delayed its planned resumption of big sporting and entertainment events of 1,000 or more people. Instead of being allowed to go ahead on 1st September, the date has been delayed by one month. Large events were first banned at the end of February. On Wednesday health minister Alain Berset described the situation in Switzerland as ""fragile"", amid rising cases (274 in the latest 24-hour period). He said that a further month to monitor the situation would be helpful. The Swiss approach to the virus is clearly control rather than eradicate. Berset said people would have to ""learn to live with it"", adding that for now the situation, despite rising case numbers, was under control. When big events are permitted again, organisers will have to apply for special permission from authorities, and submit a health and safety plan. Cantons (districts of the country) must also guarantee their test, trace and isolate systems have the capacity to deal with possible outbreaks around big events.  Another 77 people have died in the UK following a positive coronavirus test, bringing the total confirmed Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals, care homes and in the community to 46,706. There were also another 1,009 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, the third time in a week that cases in the UK have risen by the more than 1,000. UK-wide death figures may not match the totals for the four nations, as they cover a different time scale and cover deaths in all settings. The statistics are also under review after Health Secretary Matt Hancock raised concerns that the figures for England may include people who died months after testing positive for the virus. The bank said the pandemic has accelerated the trend towards online banking On the day that the UK officially slumped into recession due to the pandemic, NatWest has become the latest company to announce job losses. The bank says the 550 job cuts, to be made through voluntary redundancies, are part of a cost-cutting drive as more people bank online. It says the trend has been accelerated by the lockdown although the cuts had been planned before the pandemic. No branches are closing as a result of the changes, however. ""We have to respond to changing customer behaviour and the rising customer demand for digital banking services,"" a spokesperson said. Eleanor LawrieBBC News It's a tough time in the jobs market.

"Lawrence murder: 'Met might give up, I never will'Baroness Doreen Lawrence ""truly disappointed"" her son's 1993 racist murder case was declared ""inactive"".London","Racist murder victim Stephen Lawrence's mother has vowed she will never give up on her son despite the Met Police declaring investigations ""inactive"". Detectives have said all ""identified lines of inquiry have been completed"" into the 1993 killing. But Baroness Doreen Lawrence said: ""Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will. ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible... may not be brought to justice."" Stephen, 18, was killed in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of his murder in 2012. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said Mr Lawrence's family had been told about the latest operational developments. Duwayne Brooks, who was with Mr Lawrence on the night he was murdered, has also been told about the Met's decision, the force said. Ms Dick said she was sad that the Met had been ""unable to secure any further convictions for Stephen, his family and friends"". She added: ""The investigation has now moved to an 'inactive' phase, but I have given Stephen's family the assurance that we will continue to deal with any new information that comes to light."" Reacting to the announcement, Stephen's father, Neville, said he was disappointed but not surprised that it had been shelved by police. He said that he ""will always live with the hope that someone might come forward with evidence which will allow us to achieve full justice for Stephen"". Stephen's mother, Doreen, entered the House of Lords in 2013 after being made a peer by Labour Baroness Lawrence said: ""I am truly disappointed that those others who were equally responsible for my son's racist killing may not be brought to justice. ""It is never too late to give a mother justice for the murder of her son. Whilst the Metropolitan Police have given up, I never will."" She thanked senior investigating officer Clive Driscoll, who secured the convictions of Dobson and Norris after she had campaigned for nearly 20 years. ""Having Clive Driscoll on Stephen's case made all the difference to me and had he had the opportunity of continuing to investigate the murder there may have been more convictions,"" she said. The latest phase of the investigation into Stephen's murder began in January 2014, with Det Ch Insp Chris Le Pere taking over as the lead officer. Since then more than 240 new witness statements have been taken. Gary Dobson (left) and David Norris were convicted of murder in 2012 Another development in the case came from a woman's DNA profile obtained from a bag strap discarded at the scene of the murder. Despite a significant appeal for information and other investigations, that woman has not been identified. Officers also sought to identify a man who had been near the murder scene wearing a jacket with a distinctive V-shaped emblem. Police appealed for a man in a distinctive jacket, seen in an off-licence near to the murder scene, to come forward A third line of inquiry had been to track down a man who had called the BBC's Crimewatch in 2013 to say he had information about the attack. ""The appeal generated more than 40 lines of enquiry for the investigation team to work through,"" the Met said. ""Despite exhaustive efforts, officers were unable to trace the individuals."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Knife crime plans 'criminalise' children Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Initial attempts to catch Mr Lawrence's killers were found to have been hampered by incompetence and institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police. No arrests were made for two weeks after his death, despite five suspects being named by anonymous informants. A bag strap was left on the road near to where Stephen Lawrence was attacked Dobson and Norris were among a group of up to six men accused of attacking Mr Lawrence and Mr Brooks. Critics of the case say others evaded justice. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Mr Lawrence's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police.

"New dinosaur related to T. rex discoveredFour bones found on the Isle of Wight belonged to a new species of theropod dinosaur, a study finds.Hampshire & Isle of Wight","A CGI image has been created of an impression of the final moments of the Vectaerovenator inopinatus A new species of dinosaur has been discovered on the Isle of Wight. Palaeontologists at the University of Southampton believe four bones found at Shanklin last year belong to a new species of theropod dinosaur. It lived in the Cretaceous period, 115 million years ago, and is estimated to have been up to 4m (13ft) long. It has been named Vectaerovenator inopinatus and belongs to the group of dinosaurs that includes Tyrannosaurus rex and modern-day birds. The name refers to the large air spaces found in some of the bones - from the neck, back and tail of the creature - which is one of the traits that helped the scientists identify its theropod origins. These air sacs, also seen in modern birds, were extensions of the lung, and it is likely they ""helped fuel an efficient breathing system while also making the skeleton lighter"", the University of Southampton said. The dinosaur fossils were discovered on the beach at Shanklin The fossils were found in three separate discoveries in 2019 and handed in to the nearby Dinosaur Isle Museum at Sandown, where they are being displayed. Robin Ward, a regular fossil hunter from Stratford-upon-Avon, was visiting the Isle of Wight with his family when they made their discovery. ""The joy of finding the bones we discovered was absolutely fantastic,"" he said. James Lockyer, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, was also visiting the island when he found another of the bones. The four bones were found in three separate discoveries in 2019 ""It looked different from marine reptile vertebrae I have come across in the past,"" he said. ""I was searching a spot at Shanklin and had been told, and read, that I wouldn't find much there. ""However, I always make sure I search the areas others do not, and on this occasion it paid off."" Paul Farrell, from Ryde, added: ""I was walking along the beach, kicking stones and came across what looked like a bone from a dinosaur. ""I was really shocked to find out it could be a new species."" Chris Barker, who led the University of Southampton study, said: ""We were struck by just how hollow this animal was - it's riddled with air spaces. ""Parts of its skeleton must have been rather delicate. ""The record of theropod dinosaurs from the 'mid' Cretaceous period in Europe isn't that great, so it's been really exciting to be able to increase our understanding of the diversity of dinosaur species from this time. ""You don't usually find dinosaurs in the deposits at Shanklin as they were laid down in a marine habitat. You're much more likely to find fossil oysters or drift wood, so this is a rare find indeed."" It is likely that the Vectaerovenator lived in an area just north of where its remains were found, with the carcass having washed out into the shallow sea nearby. The university findings are due to be published in the journal Papers in Palaeontology and co-authored by those who discovered the fossils.

Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mateThe California senator is the first black woman and Asian American to be a vice-presidential candidate.,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has named Kamala Harris as his running mate - the first black woman and South Asian American in the role. Once a rival for the top job, the California senator of Indian-Jamaican heritage had long been considered the front-runner for the number two slot. The former California attorney general has been urging police reform amid nationwide anti-racism protests. Mr Biden will face President Donald Trump in the election on 3 November. After Tuesday's announcement, Ms Harris tweeted that Mr Biden ""can unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals. ""I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief."" Mr Biden and Ms Harris will deliver remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday afternoon on ""working together to restore the soul of the nation and fight for working families to move the country forward"", the Biden campaign said. After the announcement, the Biden-Harris campaign released this photo of the two together At a White House news conference on Tuesday, Mr Trump, a Republican, said he was pleased with Mr Biden's choice, adding that Ms Harris did ""very, very poorly"" in her effort to become the Democratic nominee. Ms Harris will take part in a debate with Mr Trump's running mate, Vice-President Mike Pence, on 7 October in Salt Lake City, Utah. In last year's race to be the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris showed herself to be a forceful speaker, launching blistering attacks on Donald Trump. The role of a vice-presidential running mate isn't always clearly defined. One of the traditional roles is to go on the offensive in exposing the opposition's weaknesses, while the presidential nominee focuses on communicating the party's message, says the BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher. Constitutionally, the vice-president steps in to the top job should the president die or leave office during his or her term. Mr Biden will turn 78 in November, meaning should he be elected he will be the oldest US president in history (Ronald Reagan was 77 when he left office). His age means Mr Biden's vice-presidential choice may come under extra scrutiny. Only two other women have been nominated as vice-presidential candidates for a major party - Sarah Palin by the Republican party in 2008 and Geraldine Ferraro by the Democrats in 1984. Neither were on the winning ticket. A woman of colour has never been appointed to a presidential ticket by either of the two main American political parties. No woman has won the US presidency either. Mr Biden tweeted that he had ""the great honour"" to name Ms Harris as his number two. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Kamala Harris: Voters weigh in on historic pick He described her as ""a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country's finest public servants"". He noted how she had worked closely with his late son, Beau, when she was California's attorney general. ""I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse,"" he tweeted. ""I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in thisÂ campaign."" Mr Biden tells Ms Harris she will be his running mate on Tuesday Mr Biden pledged in March to name a woman on the ticket. He had faced mounting calls to pick a black woman in recent months as the nation has been convulsed by social unrest over police brutality against African Americans, a key voting bloc for the Democratic Party. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Ms Harris, 55, dropped out of the presidential race in December after failing to make headway in her bid to win the Democratic nomination. She repeatedly clashed with Mr Biden during the primary election debates, most notably criticisinghis praise for the ""civil"" working relationshiphe had with former senators who favoured racial segregation. Ms Harris was born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents: an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father. She went on to attend Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities. She has described her time there as among the most formative experiences of her life. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as ""an American"". In 2019,she told the Washington Post,externalthat politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Americast: Kamala Harris makes history Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason. Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe Biden's running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be his ticket. She's relatively young and telegenic, and as the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants reflects the growing diversity of the Democratic Party. What's more, she's been in the spotlight of the national media, having campaigned for president in 2019 and, for a while last summer, risen to near the top of some polls. Many of her rivals for the number-two spot had never faced such scrutiny, so there was no proof that they could hold up under fire. Another underrated advantage for Ms Harris was her friendship with Mr Biden's late son, Beau, formed when they were both attorneys general. Mr Biden places a high value on family - and that connection may have made choosing her easier. Now Ms Harris will have a chance to hit the campaign trail again and prove that she deserves this historic pick. If she succeeds, she'll be in prime position to seek the presidency again, perhaps as early as 2024. Today has made her a force in the Democratic Party for years to come. How could Kamala help - or hurt - Joe Biden After four years at Howard, Ms Harris went on to earn her law degree at the University of California, Hastings, and began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. She became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first African American to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. This video can not be played President Trump calls Kamala Harris ""meanest"" US senator In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Ms Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. She was only the second black woman ever elected to the US senate. She launched her candidacy for president to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland at the beginning of last year. But Ms Harris failed to articulate a clear rationale for her campaign, and gave muddled answers to questions in key policy areas like healthcare. She was also unable to capitalise on the clear high point of her candidacy: debate performances that showed off her prosecutorial skills, often placing Mr Biden in the line of attack. When Harris could draw a crowd of 20,000 Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris? The self-described ""progressive prosecutor"" tried to emphasise more left-leaning parts of her legacy - requiring body cameras for some special agents at the California Department of Justice, the first state agency to adopt them, and launching a database that provided public access to crime statistics, though she failed to gain traction. ""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail, spoiling her attempts to win over the more liberal Democratic base during the primaries. Those same law enforcement credentials could, however, prove beneficial in the general election when Democrats need to win over more moderate voters and independents. President Trump told reporters: ""She's a person that's told many, many stories that weren't true."" He added Ms Harris was ""very, very nasty"" and ""horrible"" to Mr Biden during the Democratic primary debates. ""She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden and it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful,"" he said. The Trump campaign said the choice of running mate was proof that Mr Biden is ""an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left"". The unsuccessful Democratic candidate in 2016, Hillary Clinton, said she was ""thrilled to welcome [Ms Harris] to a historic Democratic ticket"". ""She's already proven herself to be an incredible public servant and leader,"" she added. Former US President Barack Obama - whom Mr Biden served as vice-president for eight years - tweeted: ""She is more than prepared for the job. She's spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. ""This is a good day for our country. Now let's go win this thing.""

Online campaigning 'to be more transparent',"The government is promising voters ""the same transparency"" in online election and referendum campaigns as they get in leaflets and on posters. Social media ads and videos will have to carry a ""digital imprint"" showing who has created them so voters can judge their credibility. Electoral reform campaigners said the plan ""must be just the start"" of ""cleaning up"" UK democracy. Thegovernment's proposals,externalwill now go out to public consultation. Election leaflets and newspapers have to include who made and paid for the material, although there is no rule on how prominent this branding should be - and all three major UK-wide parties werecriticised at last year's general electionfor mimicking local newspapers or official letters. Five lessons from the 'social media' election Who will regulate digital political ads? Election ads: 'Indecent, dishonest and untruthful' But there has been a huge shift away from leaflets and newspapers towards online advertising, going up from 3% of total spend in 2011 to 42.8% in 2017, according the most recent Electoral Commission figures. Online political advertising is largely unregulated in the UK and campaign material is not required by law to be truthful or factually accurate, or to say who is paying for it. Last year the Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for changes to the voting system, described it as being like the ""Wild West"" and subject torules stuck in the ""analogue age"".,external The Conservative Party has itselfbeen accused of misleading voterswhen it rebranded its press office Twitter account as Fact Check UK during a TV debate at the 2019 general election. The then party chairman James Cleverly said the Twitter feed had been clearly labelled ""CCHQ press"". Chloe Smith said clear rules were needed to improve transparency Unveiling the government proposals, promised in last year's Queen's Speech, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chloe Smith said: ""Voters value transparency. ""So we must ensure that there are clear rules to help them see who is behind campaign content online."" She claimed these would help create ""one of the most comprehensive sets of regulations operating in the world today"". Under the government's plans, a ""digital imprint"" would have to be displayed as part of online content - such as a video or a graphic. But the government says that ""where this is not possible"" it should be located in an ""accessible alternative location linked to the material"". Ministers want registered political parties, registered third parties, political candidates, elected office holders and registered referendum campaigners to put an imprint on their digital campaign material whether it is paid-for advertising or ""organic"" content - where no professional advertiser is paid to promote and distribute it. For unregistered campaigners, this would apply only to paid-for content. But the rules will cover all campaign-related content, whichever country it was produced in - and would apply all the time, not just during elections and referendums. The government argues this would allow the Electoral Commission to ""better monitor who is promoting election material and enforce the spending rules,"" which prevent foreign donations. The Electoral Commission says it does not have the power or resources to monitor the truthfulness of political advertising but changing the law to add imprints will help voters assess the credibility of online campaign messages. A spokesman said: ""This is a welcome opportunity to deliver real change for voters and provide them with a better understanding of who is trying to reach them online."" Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ""For too long, our democracy has been wide open to anonymous 'dark ads', dodgy donors, and foreign interference online. ""This won't solve all that, but it will help to plug one of the many leaks in HMS Democracy."" He added that ""strong sanctions"" were needed for those who broke the rules and that ministers ""must not be able to pass the buck to Silicon Valley giants"". Alex Tait, co-founder of the Coalition for Reform in Political Advertising, said: ""The consultation on imprints is certainly welcome but this is the bare minimum that the government could be doing to modernise electoral regulation."" The government said the digital imprint plan would ""sit alongside"" its efforts to crack down on foreign interference in UK elections and referendums through a newly-established Counter Disinformation Unit. Last month Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was""almost certain""that Russians had sought to influence the 2019 general election. And a report by the Intelligence and Security Committee said the government hadmade no effort to investigate Russian interferencein the 2016 Brexit referendum.

The WHO has warned of an infodemic of misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic At least 800 people died worldwide as a result of coronavirus-related misinformation in the first three months of this year, a study has found. A further 5,800 people were admitted to hospital after being exposed to false information on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and chat apps,the study said,external. The studyâs authors echoed statements from the World Health Organization (WHO), which warned the Covid-19 âinfodemicâ spread just as quickly as the virus itself. Most of the deaths and hospital admissions were the result of people drinking methanol and alcohol-based cleaning products, wrongly believing them to be a cure for coronavirus. But following advice that resembles credible medical information - such as ingesting large quantities of vitamins - can also have âpotentially serious implicationsâ, the authors say. The paper concludes that itâs down to international agencies, governments and social media platforms to fight back against this âinfodemicâ. A BBC investigation,which can be read here, found links between virus misinformation and assaults, arson and deaths. So the cluster of eight covid19 cases in the north east of Glasgow includes a number of pupils at Bannerman High School in Baillieston. Health and local environmental health staff are
working closely with the school and a number of other local businesses to
contact trace any close contacts of the cases and appropriate advice is being
advice given to these individuals. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde director of public health Dr Linda de Caestecker said:  âWe want to reassure local
people and businesses that this cluster of cases of COVID-19 is being
thoroughly investigated and managed by the NHSGGC Public Health Protection
Team. âAnyone affected will be contacted through the
Test and Protect service.  We want to reassure the wider community and
especially pupils and teachers returning to school that there is no added risk
due to this cluster. âWe also want to remind people to stay off

cluster of eight positive cases there, a number of whom are
pupils at Bannerman High School in Baillieston. None of the cases are experiencing anything but mild
symptoms. The school re-opened today but none of the pupils with the virus have actually
attended as they are self-isolating at home. Test and protect staff are contacting anyone
who may be affected and there is no current added risk to the wider community

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the number of new cases in the city had fallen in recent days - but was still ""much higher"" than in other areas. She said it was therefore too early to lift any of the restrictions.

It means pubs and restaurants will remain closed, with restrictions on travel and visiting other households still in place. Stuart McPhee, the Director of the Siberia Bar & Hotel in Aberdeen says the news of the train derailment near Stonehaven has made today a sombre day. Mr McPhee says the news of the three deaths meant the lockdown extension news had been ""dwarfed somewhat"". He says it's encouraging to hear the number of Covid cases are coming down and he hopes the city can come back better. It's a tough time in the jobs market.

Dwayne Johnson is highest-paid male actorThis is the second year in a row that the wrestler-turned-actor has been declared the top earner.,"Dwayne Johnson - commonly known by his wrestling name ""the Rock"" - earned $87.5m in a year Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson has been named the highest-paid male actor for a second year in a row, according to wealth magazine Forbes. The former wrestler reportedly earned $87.5m (Â£67m) between 1 June 2019 and 1 June 2020, including $23.5m for the Netflix thriller Red Notice. He also made money from his fitness clothing line, Project Rock. The 10 top earners combined made $545.5m this year - more than a quarter of that from Netflix, Forbes said. Johnson's Red Notice co-star Ryan Reynolds was the second-highest paid actor, with earnings of $71.5m. Among his movie deals were $20m, also for Red Notice, and $20m for Six Underground, another Netflix film. Third on the list was actor and producer Mark Wahlberg, who earned $58m, while Ben Affleck came in fourth and Vin Diesel fifth. Akshay Kumar was the only Bollywood actor in the top ten Indian actor Akshay Kumar was the only Bollywood star in the top 10. He came in sixth place with earnings of $48.5m, which Forbes said mostly came from product endorsement deals.

Results day rituals put on hold,"Results day razzmatazz is likely to be muted this year By any measure, this summer's results days are some of the weirdest ever. So how will the need for social distancing and extra hygiene impact some of the most emotionally charged days of the school calendar? ""You laugh, you cry, you celebrate with your friends,"" one teenager told the BBC. But this year much of that is probably out. How will I get my exam results this year? A-level and GCSE results to be higher this summer It's the big moment. You queue, you're handed your envelope. You open it... This year the big decision for schools has been whether to invite students in to pick up their results at all. Many students are being asked to look out for an email or log in to the school portal at 08:00 - and to avoid their school or college. But, equally, many schools are inviting students in. ""It will be more important than ever this year to be able to congratulate students on their achievements, to console those who haven't achieved their results they were hoping for and advise them on the next steps,"" says the Association of School and College Leaders. If schools and colleges do invite pupils in, they're advised to minimise contact and mixing, keep them in small groups  and observe social distancing. And that is likely to mean.... Under social distancing hugging is out, unless you are living with the person you plan to hug. Elbow or foot bumps might be better, if less satisfying in the moment. Hugging will probably have to be restricted to people in the same household Jumping in the air and waving your results sheet is only really acceptable if you go to one of those schools with acres of pitches on which to socially distance your celebrations. Bear in mind that if you jump too much you are likely to exert yourself and risk breathing any germs you might be carrying over anyone standing too close - so keep your distance. And if you're receiving results by email at home, jumping would inevitably be less spontaneous. You'd have to print out your own results sheet and then hunt down some classmates also willing to jump in a socially distanced manner. Look before you leap - jumping could be bad manners Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone. This year some schools are only inviting in students who need to discuss their grades, so any crying will perhaps happen more privately than normal. Many students who have missed their grades will appreciate the extra privacy, but others will miss being buoyed up by hugs and sympathy from friends. At any rate, if you do cry, it's pretty important not to dribble on anyone from outside your household. Regular results day selfies of you and your friends standing in a row, expressing joy and amazement, are probably out this year. Maybe this is the day to dust off the selfie stick for some high angled, socially distanced shots of you and your mates with your results sheets. Alternatively you could just scrap the selfie idea and just ask someone else to take the photo, but maybe you should also think about antimicrobial wipes for your phone and a plentiful supply of hand sanitiser. Some parents like to gather at the school gates on results day, waiting for their offspring to reveal their grades. But this year the government is asking schools that do decide to open to ""continue to make it clear to parents that they cannot gather at entrance gates or doors or enter the site unless they have a pre-arranged appointment"". Results parties will have to be socially distanced this year ""After GCSEs, we were in the school, laughing and crying and then we all went out as friends together, we all had a party at someone's house. It was nice I liked that experience."" But two years on, for this student, now 18, the virus means parties will have to be a bit more circumspect, particularly in areas where local lockdowns are in force.

A-level students get 'triple lock' on their grades,"Schools in England can appeal for an upgrade if their students' A-level and GCSE results are lower than mock exams. The Department for Education has announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. But the Ofqual exams watchdog says it cannot say how appeals over mocks might be verified until next week. Ofqual said in a statement it was ""working urgently"" to ""determine what standards of evidence will be required for the appeal"". The National Union of Students said using mock results risked ""making a mockery"" of the exam system. And head teachers attacked the change, the day before A-level results are published, as ""panicked and chaotic"". England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was a ""safety net"" for those getting estimated grades this summer. In Wales, in another ""guarantee"" over grades, Education Minister Kirsty Williams has promised that ""a learner's final A-level grade cannot be lower than their AS-grade"". The change means that if pupils get an estimated grade lower than their mock exam they can appeal - but this will have to be through their school, with the terms for approving appeals still to be decided by the exam watchdog, Ofqual. But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the move ""beggars belief"" because mock exams are carried out in many different ways and are not consistent enough to be used for A-level and GCSE results. ""The government doesn't appear to understand how mock exams work. They aren't a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name 'mock',"" said Mr Barton. Changes being considered for A-levels in Wales Students want exams to be upgraded across the UK Scottish pupils have results upgraded Universities told to hold places while pupils appeal over grades How will exam results day work this year? West Sussex head teacher Jules White described the decision as a ""shambles"" - and a ""total botch job"". He said in some schools pupils might know in advance the specific topics on which they are going to be tested - and in other schools they might not have taken mocks before the lockdown. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the governmentâs handling of Thursday's A-level exam results âsmacks of incompetenceâ Other schools might be tough on marking mocks as a way of getting pupils to revise. To use such different circumstances for results ""defies logic and credibility,"" said Mr White. ""The use of mock exams results risks making a mockery of the whole system,"" said Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students. She warned there was a ""lack of a standard approach to mock exams"" and ""they are not taken by all candidates"". England: the key information for A-levels and GCSEs will be how pupils are ranked by their school and results in their schools and colleges in previous years. Plus a ""triple lock"" with the highest grade out of the allocated grade, an autumn written exam or a mock exam, dependent on a successful appeal through a school Vocational qualifications will have estimated results for some courses, but not the same ""triple lock"" Northern Irelandwill allow appeals based on mocks and includes AS-levels in deciding results Scotlandhas switched to using teachers' predicted grades Waleshas promised students that A-level results will not be lower than their AS-level results The move in England comes after 76,000 pupils in Scotland had their results upgraded after being lowered by a moderating system which critics claimed was a ""postcode lottery"" as it linked pupils' results with their schools' past performances. It drew accusations that high-achieving pupils in low-performing schools would lose out - and that this would particularly discriminate against young people in deprived areas. The Scottish government has apologised and results will now be based on teachers' predicted grades. Protests have changed exam grades in Scotland - now students want the same for the rest of the UK England's schools minister Nick Gibb told BBC Breakfast being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results was ""an extra safety net for a small group of pupils"". He rejected concerns about confusion and said he would ""apologise to nobody for finding solutions - even at the eleventh hour ""to stop students being disadvantaged. It will mean that mock exams will now have an impact on A-level and GCSE results in England and Northern Ireland, alongside how pupils are ranked on ability and the share of grades that their schools and colleges have achieved in recent years. England's exam regulator Ofqual said relying on teachers' predictions would have unfairly inflated results. Using teachers' predictions would have meant about 38% of entries would have been A* or A grades this year - considerably higher than the previous record of 27%. Vocational qualifications will have some estimated grades issued - but not the ""triple lock"" appeal system For vocational qualifications, such as BTECs,estimated grades are also being issued- but not for subjects which depend on tests for practical skills, which need to be carried out in person. The ""triple lock"" approach, linked to mocks and exams in the autumn, will not apply in the same way to vocational qualifications. The Welsh government has given A-level students a guarantee that their final results will not be lower than their AS-level grades - and they are initially lower a revised grade will be issued. Mary Bousted of the National Education Union warned students in different parts of the UK were now applying for the same university places with results based on ""completely different criteria and wildly different pass rates"". With A-level results only a day away, Universities UK wants ""urgent clarification"" about what these changes will mean for deciding on places. A-level results are going to be estimated this year after exams were cancelled Universities have been told if students miss out on grades, but their schools are appealing, places have to be kept open until that appeal has been decided. But the universities organisation says it is far from clear how this will work for appeals over mock exams - and is asking whether results based on mocks can be considered as having ""equal status"" in deciding who gets accepted or rejected. They also warn about the practical complications, such as trying to allocate accommodation. ""Never in recent memory have we been faced with such uncertainty and challenge on the eve of A-level and BTec results day,"" said Anja Hazebroek from the University of Hull. But it is still expected to be a good year for students looking for university places - with an anticipated fall in overseas students leaving many places to be filled. ""Those near-miss candidates, if they've dropped one or two grades, universities are being super-flexible about that,"" said Clare Marchant of the Ucas admissions service..

'I'm over the moon... about U-turn',"Lauren, Luke and Kelly are among thousands of students whose estimated grades were lowered Lauren Steele, 16, from East Kilbride was sitting at home nervously watching the television when she heard the education secretary read her name out in parliament. ""I didn't expect to hear that at all,"" she said. ""It was kind of funny to be honest. My phone started going straight away"". Lauren was one of the pupils who wrote to John Swinney criticising the Scottish Qualifications Authority's (SQA) moderation of this year's results. Like many across Scotland, she had been downgraded by the national exam body and received lower grades that she had been predicted to achieve by teachers. However, in his statement to Holyrood Mr Swinney mentioned her and several other young people who had influenced his decision to accept teacher estimates of scores. The move affects about 75,000 Scottish pupils who will now have their marks upgraded following the government U-turn. As for Lauren, she said her family were proud of her no matter what exam results she received, but said she was ""really glad and grateful"" about the decision. She had been predicted to get a B in Higher French by her teachers but was instead awarded a C by the SQA. She said she wrote the letter to John Swinney because ""the hard work of some pupils was being ignored"". Lauren said she was shocked to hear Education Secretary John Swinney say her name in parliament She joked that her family were shocked by her decision to contact the education secretary, saying it was out of character for her to get involved. Lauren said it was the right decision to intervene, however. ""Everyone is just so relieved. I think a lot of people thought 'There's no point making a stand, the government won't do anything'. ""I was one of the few people who did think we need to do something. I just felt that something needed to be done. ""If it wasn't for the online petitions, the letters, the emails then this wouldn't have happened. I'm feeling so much better now"". In Motherwell, Alex Robertson was worried that his 16-year-old son Luke had been disadvantaged because he couldn't sit his exams during the pandemic. Mr Robertson said he felt like Luke's grades had suffered unfairly and that he was worried about the appeals process going forward. Luke had been predicted to achieve mostly As but received a mixed bag of As, Bs and Cs on results day. But after Mr Swinney's announcement, Mr Robertson said he was delighted that the role of the teacher would be recognised in deciding his son's grades. Luke Robertson said he planned to go onto study pharmacy or pharmacology ""Luke was sitting watching the TV and the smile just spread across his face,"" Mr Robertson said. ""That was the kind of reaction I was hoping for when he opened his envelope last week. The right thing has been done. ""It's a mixed bag of emotions. I'm happy but we shouldn't have been here in the first place. It's taken a week but we got there,"" he added. Why we think our exam results were unfair Scottish school pupils have results upgraded Medical dream student 'over the moon' with grades U-turn As for Luke, he welcomed the news that his grades would be based on his teacher's original estimates. ""I'm over the moon,"" he said. ""My pals are all really happy too. I can look at the courses I want to do now. Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils had shown ""tremendous resilience"" and apologised for the failed grading system ""It gives me more options and it means this year there is not as much pressure. ""I'm just so happy with the changes,"" Luke added. And for Kelly Wan, 17 from Eyemouth, the announcement made her first day back at school even more exciting. She had hoped to study medicine at university and said she needed all A grades to get there. She had been predicted by her teachers to achieve those grades and did so in her prelim exams. On results day however, she was disappointed to see that her estimated five As had turned into just two and three Bs.  Although ""amazing"" results, she said it wasn't enough to get into her chosen field. But now her original teacher estimates will be accepted and she said she was ""delighted"" about the decision. Kelly Wan said she was ""really gutted"" when she opened the text from the SQA ""When the announcement was made, everyone was screaming with delight,"" Kelly said. ""I feel really good. I'm delighted. The week prior had really lowered my motivation with school. She said that the announcement meant she was more determined than ever to get to university and study medicine. ""I know I can do it now. It has boosted my self-esteem. It's given me something to look forward to,"" she said.

Breaking|Breaking newsUK in recession for first time in 11 years,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We're grappling with something unprecedented"" The UK economy suffered its biggest slump on record between April and June as coronavirus lockdown measures pushed the country officially into recession. The economy shrank 20.4% compared with the first three months of the year. Household spending plunged as shops were ordered to close, while factory and construction output also fell. This pushed the UK into its first technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline - since 2009. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that the government was ""grappling with something that is unprecedented"" and that it was ""a very difficult and uncertain time"". But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds blamed Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the scale of the economic decline, saying: ""A downturn was inevitable after lockdown - but Johnson's jobs crisis wasn't."" Kate Treglown, 44, of Walthamstow in east London, is currently out of work as a result of the coronavirus crisis. She was made redundant from her advertising job at the end of July after being on furlough. ""I worked for 16-and-a-half years for an advertising agency that promoted live events. The work totally dried up in May,"" she told the BBC. Kate says she feels ""stuck in limbo"" - keen to try something new, but unsure of when her children- who she has been home schooling - will return to school. ""There is work. There are jobs available. But when I look on LinkedIn, every single job has hundreds of applications, so competition is very stiff,"" she says. ""I feel women are really carrying the burden of this pandemic with regards to the childcare, whether working or not. It's made me feel quite depressed at times. ""My redundancy money is only going to last so long and I'm scared of what the future holds for us at the moment."" Jobless in the pandemic: 'It's hard to stay positive' How can I find a new job? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy bounced back in June as government restrictions on movement started to ease. On a month-on-month basis, the economy grew by 8.7% in June, after growth of 1.8% in May. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: ""Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck."" The ONS said the collapse in output was driven by the closure of shops, hotels, restaurants, schools and car repair shops. The services sector, which powers four-fifths of the economy, suffered the biggest quarterly decline on record. This video can not be played What is a recession? Factory shutdowns also resulted in the slowest car production since 1954. How could a recession affect me? Is there such a thing as a 'good' or 'bad' recession? PM warns of 'long, long way to go' for UK economy The economic decline was concentrated in April, at the height of lockdown. Official jobs figures released on Tuesday showedthe number of people in workfell by 220,000 between April and June. But in a BBC interview on Wednesday, Mr Sunak did not waver on ending the government's furlough scheme of job subsidies, which is winding down and is due to end entirely after October. ""I think most people would agree that that's not something that is sustainable indefinitely,"" he told the BBC. The chancellor said the government should not pretend that ""absolutely everybody can and will be able to go back to the job they had"" and said there would be support for creating jobs in new areas. The opposition has been critical of the government's handling of the economy during the pandemic. Ms Dodds said: ""We've already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we're on course for the worst recession too. That's a tragedy for the British people and it's happened on Boris Johnson's watch."" Referring to the tapering of the furlough scheme, she said the government had ""snatched away wage support for businesses that hadn't even reopened yet"". Laura Tenison, founder of clothing firm JoJo Maman Bebe, told the BBC that the trading performance of her 90 stores was showing huge variations, with those in urban locations suffering from a lack of office workers and tourists. ""Those like York, Windsor, central London, Reading, Norwich - those ones are absolutely dire, really really awful,"" she said. ""I mean, some days we take no money, put it that way. But some of the village stores, the community stores, they're actually doing better than we anticipated. ""I think we have six stores in the portfolio that actually are trading up on last year."" Ms Tenison founded her business in 1993, during a recession. ""This is my third recession in my relatively long life in retail,"" she said. ""We still have to be entrepreneurial,"" she added. ""We have had to close down some areas of business because of Covid. We've had to close our American business, which is just a massive sadness to me. ""Of course, everyone has to look at their overheads, but be creative. Look at those opportunities out there. Recessions bring opportunities."" Business groups urged the government to do more to support the economic recovery. Alpesh Paleja, an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said many companies were struggling to pay their bills on time. He said: ""A sustained recovery is by no means assured. The dual threats of a second wave and slow progress over Brexit negotiations are also particularly concerning."" This video can not be played Anneliese Dodds: The UK has not seen âa big enough bounce back and we really need oneâ While more recent data suggest the recovery is gaining traction, the Bank of England does not expect the economy to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the end of next year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official forecaster, expects the recovery to take even longer. The UK's slump is one of the biggest among advanced economies, according to preliminary estimates. The economy is more than a fifth smaller than it was at the end of last year. This fall is not as bad as the 22.7% decline in Spain, but about twice the size of contractions in Germany and the US. The chancellor told the BBC that the UK economy had performed worse than its EU counterparts because it was focused on services, hospitality and consumer spending. ""Those kinds of activities comprise a much larger share of our economy than they do for most of our European cousins,"" he said.

PM understands grades 'anxiety',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says schools are the âlast thingâ the government wants to close as part of any local lockdown restrictions It is understandable that there is ""anxiety"" over exam grades, the prime minister has said, as pupils prepare to receive estimated results this week for tests cancelled during lockdown. Visiting a school in London, Boris Johnson said he was also ""very keen that exams should go ahead as normal"". A-level results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due on Thursday. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasapologised for the handling of its exam results. She acknowledged ""we did not get it right"" after results estimated by teachers for cancelled exams were downgraded. The Scottish Qualifications Authority lowered grades using an algorithm - with pass rates for pupils in deprived areas downgraded further than those in more affluent parts. Ms Sturgeon said her priority was to resolve the concernsabout how some results had been downgraded, following protests by pupils. With pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland awaiting A-level results this week, Mr Johnson said on a visit to a school in east London that he wanted their hard work ""properly reflected"". ""Clearly, because of what has happened this year, there is some anxiety about what grades pupils are going to get, and everybody understands the system - that the teachers are setting the grades, then there's a standardisation system,"" he said. ""We will do our best to ensure that the hard work of pupils is properly reflected."" Could reopening schools spread coronavirus? How will schools reopen fully? How will exam results day work this year? Ofqual, England's exam regulator, said that following the row in Scotlandit wanted to reassure students,externalthat grades have been calculated in the ""fairest possible"" way. It said it would publish data on grades by socio-economic status on results day, adding that early analysis showed poorer students and ethnic minorities ""have not been disadvantaged by this year's awarding process"". The head of the university admissions service said this summer was likely to be the ""busiest"" ever period for the clearing system, which matches students with places after results are published - including those who have missed the grades for their initial offer. Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said she believed up to 80,000 students could find a place through clearing, beating last year's record of 73,325. Some students were likely to abandon plans for a gap year as the pandemic restricted travel, and could apply through clearing instead, she suggested. The fall in overseas students meant it was a ""good year"" for UK applicants seeking a place, Ms Marchant added. A recent analysis by the PA news agency showed that the select Russell Group universities still had 4,500 undergraduate courses with vacant places. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? One 18-year-old said she felt students in her school year had been treated like ""guinea pigs"". ""I'm expecting the worst scenario possible at this point,"" said Cheyenne Williams from Barnhill Community High School in north-west London. ""I have doubts that grades will be allocated on a fair basis."" Meanwhile, some parents criticised suggestions that students could sit exams in the autumn if they were unhappy with their estimated grade. Helen Milne, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, whose son will collect his results this week, said: ""How on earth are children meant to take resits in October when they haven't been in school for six months and there are no teachers to teach them?"" But others defended the approach. ""It's not great but I can't think of a better system,"" said Helen Jones from Abingdon in Oxfordshire. ""Nobody wanted to have a pandemic and you can't put the lives of a whole cohort on hold for a year."" Elsewhere, Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid there was little evidence of coronavirus being transmitted in schoolsand the plan to fully reopen England's schools in September was guided by the best science. It is usually pupils who are nervous about exam results and going back to school. But this year it's ministers who are feeling the heat. And those in England will be looking with extreme nervousness at the car crash over Scotland's replacement exam grades - because the problems that outraged Scottish students are going to reappear in England's A-level results on Thursday. ""Everybody understands the system that the teachers are setting the grades, then there's a standardisation system,"" Boris Johnson said on a school visit. But in reality teachers' predicted grades have mostly been sidelined - and instead the two key factors for grades will be how pupils are ranked and schools' previous results. As the row in Scotland has shown, pegging estimated grades to how schools usually perform will be seen as locking in disadvantage. It means bright pupils in low-achieving schools can lose out. And many more will be confused at the gap between their teachers' predictions and their results. But so far there are no signs of the emergency brakes from ministers in England. Instead they are relying on schools being able to appeal against harsh results and that disappointed pupils can take back-up exams in the autumn. As if the exam pressure wasn't enough, there are high political stakes about the fast-approaching new school year and the promise that all pupils will be going back full time. Government advisers have warned the nation may have reached the limit of what can be reopened in society safely. But asked whether parents should brace for local closures to combat flare-ups of the virus, Mr Johnson said education was a priority. ""The last thing we want to do is close schools. Education is a priority for the country - that is simple social justice,"" he said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours?

"Little Mix star to front racism documentaryThe singer wants to use her fame as a ""platform to bring this conversation to a wider audience"".","Little Mix star Leigh-Anne Pinnock is to make a one-off documentary for BBC Three about her personal experiences of racism and colourism. The programme, titled Leigh-Anne: Colourism & Race, will also examine the wider issue of race in the UK. The singer said she wanted to use her fame as a ""platform to bring this conversation to a wider audience"". Last year, her bandmateJesy Nelson won praise for an ""inspiring"" documentary about online bullying. Pinnock said she wanted to make her documentary ""because I have always been passionate about rights for black people"", adding that she wanted to ""stand up for my black and brown community"". The documentary will also see Pinnock talk to her Little Mix bandmates The singer explained: ""Conversations surrounding racism and colourism are something I constantly have with my boyfriend and family. ""Systemic racism is complex; through making this documentary I want to learn how I can best lend my voice to the debate so that the young people who look up to me won't have to face what me and my generation have had to."" Following the Black Lives Matter protests earlier this year, Pinnock opened up on Instagram in a video in which she talked about the racism she had faced. 'I don't care if Little Mix lose racist fans' In the new film, Pinnock will further explore her own experiences, and talk about how having lighter skin and being a celebrity means she is sometimes said to be in a more privileged position than others. BBC Three controller Fiona Campbell said: ""By working with high profile talent like Leigh-Anne, and other important individuals she will meet through this process, we hope the honest conversations this film will feature will have the power to change attitudes, offer insight and help to prevent racism in our society.""

Who is Kamala Harris?,"Kamala Harris savoured the moment she became the first woman, and the first black and Asian American, to be vice-president-elect, with a very hearty laugh. In a video posted to her social media she shares the news with President-elect Joe Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" Her words are about him but the history of the moment is hers. Just over a year ago, as the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency, she launched a potent attack on Joe Biden over race during a debate. Many thought it inflicted a serious blow on his ambitions. But by the end of the year her campaign was dead and it was Mr Biden who returned the 56-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. What happens now? What Biden's victory means for rest of world US election results in maps and charts Election results in full ""It is a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris,"" says Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 and who has critiqued her run for the presidential nomination. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent."" What she has demonstrated from the moment she took the national stage with her pitch for the presidency - is grit. Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. Kamala as child with her mother and younger sister Maya She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Americast: Kamala Harris makes history Profile: Kamala Harris (audio) Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation."" They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa"" and the Martin Luther King  holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson says. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explains - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. She returned to address students at Howard in 2017 and  took them on a journey from the Ferguson race protests of 2014 to the halls of Capitol Hill in just one sentence: ""You students have joined the fight for justice - you protested. From the streets of Ferguson to the halls of the United States Congress, you have lived the words of James Baldwin, 'There is never a time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment, the time is always now.'"" But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". Shetold the Washington Post,externalin 2019, that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. In 2014, Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff - now a fixture at her campaign stops - and became stepmother to his two children. Last year shewrote an article for Elle magazine,externalabout the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. On becoming vice-president-elect, she is unlikely to lose this nickname but many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible."" But from the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness."" Wit and humour is part of that armoury. The laugh she greeted the president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate -  to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  She wasn't afraid of confrontation as in this Twitter exchange with Donald Trump Jr last October. ""Why is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes... always way to long and way too hard?"" Mr Trump's son asked. ""You wouldn't know a joke if one raised you,"" she wrote back. A simple burn on social media, but a popular shorthand for the kind of skills that meant a career in law and politics was a natural fit. Although her career as a prosecutor is what made her a politician, it brought with it political benefits and risks. She began work in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her election as California's junior US senator in 2017. Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in Oakland, California. But straddling the line between pleasing left-leaning California Democrats and being a politician for a nation where the left does not decide who gets to be president has been hard. She gained favour among progressives for her acerbic questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but as a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris? When Harris could draw a crowd of 20,000 Walking the fine line between the progressive and moderate wings of her party, she ended up appealing to neither. Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not really being progressive enough. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail. But those same law enforcement credentials proved beneficial on the national stage when Democrats needed to win over more moderate voters and independents. She was ""someone with a law enforcement background, and perceived in her own state as being insufficiently progressive... and trying to project an inauthentic self"", Mr Duran says, but adds ""that looks very different in a vice-presidential slot"". As the US grapples with an ongoing racial reckoning and there is scrutiny over police brutality, Ms Harris has taken a front row seat, using her sizable microphone. Kamala Harris endorsed Joe Biden two months after quitting the race Majority of Americans don't support 'defunding' the police On talk shows she calls for changes to police practices across the US, on Twitter she calls for the arrests of the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman from Kentucky, and she speaks frequently about the need to dismantle systemic racism. She has the law enforcement background but she has often said that her identity makes her uniquely suited to represent those on the margins.

Harris 'embraces' black and Indian roots',"US Senator Kamala Harris - chosen by Joe Biden as his Democratic vice-presidential candidate - is known as a prominent black politician. But she has also embraced her Indian roots. ""My name is pronounced ""comma-la"", like the punctuation mark,"" Kamala Harris writes in her 2018 autobiography, The Truths We Hold. The California senator, daughter of an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father, then explains the meaning of her Indian name. ""It means 'lotus flower', which is a symbol of significance in Indian culture. A lotus grows underwater, its flowers rising above the surface while the roots are planted firmly in the river bottom."" Early in life, young Kamala and her sister Maya grew up in a house filled with music by black American artists. Her mother would sing along to Aretha Franklin's early gospel, and her jazz-loving father, who taught economics at Stanford University, would play Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane on the turntable. Shyamala Gopalan and Donald Harris separated when Ms Harris was five. Raised primarily by her Hindu single mother, a cancer researcher and a civil rights activist, Kamala, Maya and Shyamala were known as ""Shyamala and the girls"". Her mother made sure her two daughters were aware of their background. Senator Kamala Harris and her sister, Maya Lakshmi Harris, are close ""My mother understood very well she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident black women,"" she wrote. ""Harris grew up embracing her Indian culture,but living a proudly African-American life,"" wrote the Washington Post last year.,external When she ran for a senate seat in 2015,the Economist magazine described her as the ""daughter of an Indian cancer researcher and a Jamaican economics professor,external, she is the first woman, first African-American and first Asian attorney general of California"". The 55-year-old senator says she has not grappled with her identity and describes herself simply as ""an American"". Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Who will Biden pick as his running mate? Diplomat and lightning rod - Biden's Susan Rice dilemma In many ways, say people who know her, Ms Harris straddles both communities effortlessly. Ina video with Indian-American comedian and actress Mindy Kaling, posted to the senator's Youtube page,externalduring Ms Harris's presidential run, the two cook Indian food together and chat about their shared south Indian background. Kaling says that while not everyone knows about that half of Ms Harris's heritage, other Indian-Americans she meets often bring up the fact. ""It's like our thing we're so excited about, to have you running for president,"" says Kaling. Kaling asks Ms Harris whether she was raised eating south Indian food. Ms Harris reels off names of Indian dishes made at home: ""Lots of rice and yogurt, potato curry, dal, lots of dal, idli"". She also says when she visited her mother's home in India, her grandfather would cheekily ask for French toast - made with eggs -  when her vegetarian grandmother was out (in India, eggs are considered non-vegetarian). In her book, she writes about making Indian biryani - and spaghetti Bolognese - at home. (On Tuesday, Kaling called Ms Harris's vice-presidential candidacy an ""exciting day...especially for my Black and Indian sisters""). When Ms Harris got married to Douglas Emhoff, a lawyer, in 2014, ""in keeping with [our] respective Indian and Jewish heritage"", she put a flower garland around her new husband's neck and he stomped on a glass. Ms Harris's public image has been more tied to her identity as an African-American politician, especially recently during the current conversation around race and the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. But Indian-Americans also view her as one of their own, her candidacy suggesting a potential wider recognition of the Indian and South Asian communities in the country. It is clear that her late mother was a big inspiration for Ms Harris. Gopalan was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai, the oldest of four children. She graduated from the University of Delhi at the age of 19, and applied to a graduate programme at Berkeley, ""a university she'd never seen, in a country she'd never visited"". She left India in 1958 to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology, and later became a breast cancer researcher. ""It's hard to me to imagine how difficult it must have been for her parents to let her go. Commercial jet travel was only just starting to spread globally. It wouldn't be a simple matter to stay in touch. Yet, when my mother asked permission to move to California, my grandparents didn't stay in the way,"" Ms Harris said. Ms Harris writes that her mother was expected to return home after completing her education, and to agree to an arranged marriage. ""But fate had other plans."" She met Kamala Harris's father and fell in love at Berkeley while participating in the civil rights movement. ""Her marriage - and her decision to stay in the US - were the ultimate acts of self-determination and love,"" Ms Harris writes. Gopalan picked up her doctorate degree at age 25 in 1964, the same year Ms Harris was born. Ms Harris writes her mother kept working right up to the moment of delivery of both her daughters  - ""in the first case her water broke when she was at the lab; and the other while she was making apple strudel"". Back in India, Gopalan had been raised in a household of ""political activism and civic leadership"". Her grandmother never attended high school, but was a community organiser taking in victims of domestic violence and educating women about contraception. Her grandfather, PV Gopalan, was a senior diplomat in the Indian government who lived in Zambia after it gained independence, and he helped settle refugees. In her book, she doesn't say too much about her trips to India. But she writes she is close to her mother's brother and two sisters, with whom she kept in touch through long distance calls and letters and periodic trips. Ms Harris's mother died in 2009, at age 70. US Democratic Party activists like Shekar Narasimhan say her candidacy would be ""seismic"" for the Indian-American community. ""She's a woman, she biracial, she will help win the election for Biden, she appeals to various communities and she's really smart."" ""Why should Indian-Americans not be proud of her? It's a signal that we are coming of age."" 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

How could Kamala Harris help - or hurt - Joe Biden,"Sometimes the obvious pick is obvious for a reason. Kamala Harris was the front-runner to be Joe Biden's running mate pretty much since the moment the presumptive Democratic nominee announced in March that he would pick a woman to be on his ticket. She was a safe pick and a practical one. She's also now in the position to be the heir apparent for the Democratic Party - whether it's in four years because Biden loses in November or doesn't run for re-election or eight years if Biden serves two full terms. That could be why it seemed that there were so many attempts to knock Harris down a peg, or advance alternative candidates over the past month. This was, in effect, the first fight of the next presidential nomination contest, and Harris - whose ambitions are clear - now has a step on the competition. But determining future Democratic nominees is a battle for another day. The pressing concern for the party at the moment is how Harris might help Biden win the White House. Here are some strengths she brings to the ticket and, perhaps, some concerns Democrats may have. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots To put it bluntly, today's Democratic Party doesn't look like Joe Biden. It's young and it's ethnically diverse. It was increasingly obvious that the presumptive nominee needed to find someone younger and, well, less white to have a ticket that reflects the people who will vote for it. Harris, whose father was Jamaican and mother came from India, fills this particular need. She becomes both the first black woman and the first Asian to run on a major party presidential ticket. And although at 55 years old she's not exactly young, when compared to 77-year-old Joe Biden, she's downright spry. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? On Tuesday afternoon, before she was announced as Biden's pick, Harris tweeted about the need for diversity in the leadership of the party. ""Black women and women of color have long been underrepresented in elected office and in November we have an opportunity to change that,"" she wrote. It turns out Harris could be directly responsible for some of that change. One of the traditional roles of a vice-presidential running mate is to get down and dirty with the opposition. While the person at the top of the ticket takes the rhetorical high road, the number-two cracks out the brass knuckles for the opposition. In 2008, Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, more than lived up to her nickname, Sarah the Barracuda, for instance. If this is a duty that falls on Harris, history suggests she will be up to the task. Biden certainly recalls that it was Harris who went after him with gusto during the first Democratic primary debate in July 2019, criticisinghis opposition to bussing to end segregation in public schools. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Harris has also proven to be a very determined and aggressive interrogator during her time in the US Senate. Donald Trump clearly remembers this, as he remarked on Tuesday evening that he thought Harris was ""extraordinarily nasty"" to his second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Trump may not like it, but nasty may be exactly what Biden is looking for this autumn. One thing politicians who have run for national office have said time and time again is that it's impossible to understand the intense pressure such campaigns create until one has actually been in one. Although Harris's 2020 presidential bid was unsuccessful, and she dropped out before most of her competitors, she still knows what it's like to be under such scrutiny. When she launched her campaign before tens of thousands of supporters in January 2019, she was treated like a top-tier presidential contender. For a time in July, after her strong first debate performance, she rose towards the top of some primary polls. Harris has been through the fire, at least for a time, and knows what it feels like. If there were serious, dinosaur-sized skeletons in her closet, they would have come out by now. Given that she's already sought the presidency, its not impossible for many Americans to imagine her as president someday. The California senator may not have been the most dynamic candidate on the campaign trail in 2019, and she was certainly not nearly the most successful one, but at this point she's a known quantity. And for Biden,who is currently up in the polls, the fewer surprises the rest of the campaign the better. More than almost any of the other contenders for the vice-presidential spot, Harris comes from a law-enforcement background. Given the recent demonstrations over police brutality and allegations of institutional racism in law enforcement, Harris's resume may give some progressives within the Democratic Party pause. It certainly did during Harris's presidential campaign, when ""Harris is a cop"" was a derisive accusation thrown at the California senator on more than one occasion. This video can not be played President Trump calls Kamala Harris ""meanest"" US senator Both as San Francisco district attorney and as California's attorney general, Harris has sided with police over suspects - even in cases where those suspects may have been wrongfully convicted. Although she's expressed personal opposition to the death penalty, she's supported its use while she's been in office. Being a hard-nosed crime-fighter may be an attractive attribute among independent and conservative-leaning voters in the general election, but if that support comes at the cost of enthusiasm for the Biden-Harris ticket on the left, then it may not be a net positive. Since the death of George Floyd, Harris has been outspoken in advocating law-enforcement reform, winning praise from some progressives. But it's safe to say they still harbour some doubts. Above, Harris having run a presidential campaign was noted as a mark in her favour. There's a flip side to that, however. Her campaign, while it started with a bang and had its moments, also had some serious flaws - and some of those flaws related to the candidate herself. Although Harris has a pretty moderate record as a senator and state attorney general, she tried to tack to the left during her presidential campaign. She came out in favour of free college education, the Green New Deal environmental programme and universal healthcare, for instance, but never sounded all that convincing about it. Mr Biden tells Ms Harris she will be his running mate on Tuesday She particularly got tripped up on the question of whether private insurance should be banned - which, while fine with progressives, gives many moderate heartburn. ""Let's eliminate all of that,"" she said rather glibly during one interview. ""Let's move on."" In this day and age, the death knell for politicians is to seem too political - to be perceived as willing to shift values and beliefs based on what the voters want. Sincerity, or at least the appearance of it, is a virtue voters prize  - and part of the reason why Donald Trump became president. While his supporters didn't always agree with him, they felt like he speaks his mind. Harris's move from moderate, then to the left and now back, perhaps, to the Biden middle could leave some voters wondering where her core values lie - or if she has any core values at all.

"Aberdeen local lockdown to be reviewedNicola Sturgeon has not ruled out extending the restrictions as 165 linked cases have been identified.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","The local lockdown imposed in Aberdeen a week ago after a spike in coronavirus cases is to remain in place. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the number of new cases in the city had fallen in recent days - but was still ""much higher"" than in other areas. She said it was therefore too early to lift any of the restrictions. It means pubs and restaurants will remain closed, with restrictions on travel and visiting other households still in place. The first minister said the restrictions would be reviewed again next Wednesday, and pledged: ""As soon as we can relax any of them, we will do so"". Ms Sturgeon said a total of 177 cases had now been linked to the outbreak - 12 more than yesterday - with 900 contacts having been identified. She added: ""In the last few days we have seen a slight fall in the number of new cases in Grampian and in those directly associated with the cluster. ""But despite this slight reduction, cases are still far higher than in any other part of the country - and considerably higher than they were in Grampian before the outbreak started"". The first minister said the Scottish government's conclusion, based on the advice it had received, was that ""it is not yet possible to lift any of the restrictions that were put in place last week for Aberdeen."" The first cases in the Aberdeen cluster were linked to The Hawthorn bar Ms Sturgeon said she knew people in Aberdeen would be disappointed by the decision, and thanked them for ""complying so well with the rules"". She added: ""We continue to watch closely for any signs that the outbreak has spread to Aberdeenshire in any significant way, but at present we are not placing any additional restrictions on people living in the shire"". She said the city council had been fully involved in the discussions, with the police reporting ""good compliance"" with the restrictions in the city since they were imposed last Wednesday. The restrictions in Aberdeen mean: bars, cafes, restaurants and pubs are closed no travel more than five miles for leisure or holidays no travel to the city for leisure or to visit friends and family, even if you live in Aberdeenshire no indoor visits with other households visiting suspended for most hospitals It emerged last week that eight Aberdeen FC players had visited the city's Soul Bar the previous Saturday, with two later testing positive for Covid-19. Eight Aberdeen players are self-isolating after visiting a bar in the city before the local lockdown was imposed The revelation angered the first minister, and has led tothe cancellation of the club's next two matches. One person who was among a cluster of five cases in north east Angus had been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak. Health officials in Aberdeenshire have also been investigating a potential cluster in the Stonehaven/Portlethen area, but no connection to Aberdeen had yet been established.

Disney ends historic 20th Century Fox brand,"Walt Disney has brought to an end one of the best-known names in the entertainment industry, 20th Century Fox. It comes as the legendary House of Mouse has rebranded one of its TV studios as 20th Television. It follows January's rebranding of the 85-year-old film company 20th Century Fox as 20th Century Studios. Last year Disney completed a $71.3bn (Â£54.7bn) deal to buy the bulk of Rupert Murdoch's Fox media assets. Disney has also renamed its other television studios, including changing ABC Studios and ABC Signature Studios to ABC Signature while Fox 21 Television Studios will become Touchstone Television. The Disney-Fox giant in four charts Walt Disney buys Murdoch's Fox for $52bn Disney culls 'Fox' from 20th Century Fox in rebrand ""Our new studio names and logos mark a new day for ABC Signature, 20th Television and Touchstone Television while honouring their rich histories and the creative power of The Walt Disney Company,"" Craig Hunegs, president of Disney television studios, said in a statement. Both the 20th Century TV and film rebrands retained the famous fanfare theme tune and searchlight logo. 20th Century Fox Television, which can trace its roots back to 1949, has been home to some of TV's most famous shows including the original Batman series, M*A*S*H and The Simpsons. Earlier this year, when the film studio 20th Century Fox was rebranded, there were suggestions that Disney wanted to distance itself from Mr Murdoch's highly partisan, right-wing Fox News network. Disney is already a dominant force in US news, as the owner of the ABC network. It is also taking on Netflix with its own streaming service Disney+. The 20th Century Fox film studio is known for producing some of the biggest movies of all-time, including Avatar and Titanic. 20th Century Fox was created in 1935 when Twentieth Century Pictures and Fox Films merged. Disney's movie-making history dates back to 1937, with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and now includes Lucasfilm - which makes the Star Wars franchise - and Marvel Studios among its stable of film companies.

Dementia sufferers' virus death rate 'horrifying',"This video can not be played David Williams, 82, died in April after testing positive days after he returned home from respite care Figures exposing the pandemic's impact on people with dementia in Wales have been described as ""horrifying"". They account for more than one in five Covid-19 deaths, prompting calls for a dedicated dementia task force to be set up in case of a second wave. Charities, experts and families have told BBC Wales they must be involved in efforts to plan ahead. The Welsh Government said itsdementia action plan,externalwas being ""prioritised in the Covid-19 context"". Ceri Higgins says we owe it to those who have died to find out why After losing her 82-year old father to coronavirus in April, Ceri Higgins from Tonteg in Rhondda Cynon Taff said she had ""lots of questions going through my head every day"". David Williams had tested positive just days after returning home following a brief period of respite care in a local nursing home. Restrictions at the time meant the former RAF engineer and pillar of his local community then spent weeks in hospital without any contact from his family. ""We felt like our lives were out of control because we couldn't have any input really into what was important to him and to us,"" she said. Family visit plea over dementia patients Dementia deaths up in first months of pandemic Ms Higgins, who had spent the last 11 years caring for her father ""pretty much 24/7"" said they had developed their own language and way of talking to help him communicate and understand. A ""really lovely nurse"" - who rang to say Mr Williams was dying - was able to use some of the phrases and talk to him about his family and his love of dogs in his final moments. Dementia is the main pre-existing condition associated with coronavirus deaths While that had been a huge comfort, Ms Higgins said life since her father's death had been like ""being in the middle of a maze"" - unable to hold the funeral he would have wanted, and growing increasingly concerned not enough was being done to investigate why people with dementia had been so badly affected. She said: ""I watched a government briefing where Andrew Goodall [NHS Wales' chief executive] was talking about bringing like-minded people in the world of cancer together to discuss a way forward and how that would help people. ""And I thought this should be happening for people living with dementia - we need a dementia task force. ""To see such figures for around the time my dad passed away makes me think that's a knock-on from before the pandemic and all the issues for people living with dementia right before that. It's just staggering. ""Every week when we see the number of deaths, [the government] says we must remember that behind every one person dying is a family grieving. ""Well, we owe it [to them] to find out why they died, what were the circumstances behind it."" 'Hidden catastrophe' in care homes, charities warn Dame Barbara Windsor moves to care home What do the stats tell us in Wales? Ms Higgins started volunteering for a service offering companion phone calls to people living with dementia a week after her father's death. ""This is about basic health-support needs. People who are isolated, losing key skills, potentially not seeing their families, not being stimulated,"" she said. ""We need to stop and take a few minutes and say, 'look, before we move on, we need to understand what's happening to people with dementia' and we need to do that now because, for many, it's going to be too late."" From a total figure of 2,450 deaths in Wales attributed to coronavirus between March and June, the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) report shows 543 had dementia or Alzheimer's disease. It is by far the main pre-existing condition associated with Covid deaths. By comparison, there were 233 deaths of people with underlying lower lung diseases, 222 with blood flow problems to the heart, and 49 with diabetes. The picture is even more stark in England where a quarter of Covid deaths between March and June had been in people with dementia. In addition, a separate ONS report on death registrations not associated with Covid-19 has revealed a 52.2% increase in so-called excess deaths of people with dementia during the pandemic across England and Wales. Excess deaths compare numbers dying this year with those in a five-year average of previous years. Cheryl Williams: ""Lack of face-to-face contact with family... it's had a profound impact"" It is the largest surge in deaths of any health condition and has been described as ""staggering"" by the Alzheimer's Society. ""The disproportionate number of people with dementia who have died during the pandemic is something that should concern us all,"" said Cheryl Williams of the charity. ""Certainly many care homes didn't have adequate PPE [personal protective equipment] for staff at the outset of the pandemic. ""It may not have been enough of a priority for the government in the early days."" Like Ceri Higgins, Ms Williams believes there are wider questions beyond infection control as to why people with dementia were ""worst hit"". ""Lack of face-to-face contact with family, friends, social interaction - it's had a profound impact,"" she said. Charles Musselwhite: ""It shows how certain groups get forgotten about"" Charles Musselwhite, associate professor in gerontology - the study of ageing - at Swansea University, said he had viewed the statistics with ""a mixture of horror and sadness"". ""We always knew that older people were much more vulnerable, much more at risk,"" he said. ""But, really, I think it shows how certain groups get forgotten about. ""Of course in hindsight it's easy to pick on things we could have done differently and things we'd like to do differently again in the future. ""But this is one group that we knew were vulnerable and they haven't been protected in any serious sense."" ""There are a lot of really good groups for people living with dementia, charities, third sector organisations, experts such as ourselves. ""We need to involve them more about what to do should there be a second wave, on how to manage this much more carefully. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Throughout the pandemic we have met regularly with the dementia care Covid-19 partnership forum, which includes people with lived experience, to understand ways in which we can support individuals with dementia and their families through this pandemic. ""We have developed guidance to support local action and which is helping us identify the increased rehabilitation needs of people affected directly and indirectly by the pandemic. ""This includes people affected by the impact of the lockdown measures. TheQuarter 2 NHS Operating Framework,externalhighlights the need to plan and develop rehabilitation services. ""In order to support this work, Welsh Government'sDementia Oversight of Implementation and Impact Group,external(DOIIG) has been reinstated and is meeting virtually to ensure that the actions set out within thedementia action plan,externalare prioritised in the Covid-19 context.""

A-level student hopes assessed grades are 'fair'Students share their thoughts ahead of A-level results - and after the summer exams were cancelled.Wales,"Begw Rowlands: ""I hope that the way they've gone about it is as fair as it could possibly be"" ""I'm quite relaxed about it, I've never been one to worry about exams,"" says 17-year-old Begw Rowlands, one of thousands of young people waiting for A-level results. But after exams were cancelled, this year is different because ""obviously we haven't been able to do an exam and feel that went well or that didn't go as well"". Begw, from the Vale of Glamorgan, always intended taking a year out before applying for drama school next year. A Careers Wales survey found that 38% of A-level pupils said the pandemic had affected their future plans. Begw, who studied A-level drama and Welsh, BTEC music and the Welsh baccalaureate, says she was pleased at first when exams were cancelled. ""I was quite chuffed to begin with actually, because no one wants to do exams,"" she says. ""But, obviously, Year 13 is the pinnacle of your school experience and you kind of want to prove yourself."" This year's grades have been calculated using grades assessed by schools and colleges which have then gone through a standardisation process to make sure they are consistent. A mass upgrading of A-Level results should not be needed in Wales despite some predicted grades being lowered, the Welsh Government has insisted. Mass exam result upgrade 'not expected' in Wales Exam results lowered after 'generous grading' Results in Wales will be 'balanced and fair' ""I hope that the way they've gone about it is as fair as it could possibly be,"" Begw says. She's currently working as an assistant in a hospital and hopes to travel when that's possible, as well as keeping up with her drama. Students want exam results upgraded across UK Universities told to hold places open until appeal The Careers Wales survey also found that three quarters of pupils in exam years were worried about their grades. ""It's natural for young people to be worried about their exam results,"" says Stephen Williams from Careers Wales. ""If they're not what they were expecting, just take a step back. ""Try not to get too emotional and try to think about things logically, talk things through with people that are important to them and make contact with us. ""We will help them put things into perspective and start looking at how we get to where you wanted to get to."" Brother and sister Imogen and Scott Gilmour from Powys, are pupils in Caereinion High School. Before the pandemic, both were preparing to sit exams, Imogen, 16, doing GCSE and Scott A Levels. Scott, 18, says he was apprehensive after hearing there would be no exams and was initially concerned the results would be ""less credible"". Imogen and Scott Gilmour Exam results lowered after 'generous grading' Exam board says grades will be 'balanced and fair' He's hoping to study law and both he and Imogen, from Meifod, will receive their results via email rather than visiting the school. ""Obviously I hope I do well, but I don't feel it's the end of the world if I don't get exactly what I need. ""I'm not worried I'm going to do terribly but I have thought about the possibility of me not doing as well as I need to - to get to university because both of my university choices are quite high requirements,"" he said. Imogen intends to stay on for sixth form to study biology, chemistry, physics and maths. She says: ""I'm feeling okay about the whole thing and I'm quite excited that it's getting emailed to us at a specific time. ""It will just be nice to be able to sit there with your family and wait for it."" She says she was also a ""little apprehensive because when you do exams you have some idea of how you might have done"". ""But with this, it's a little bit more tricky because you don't know at all how the teachers are going to grade you."" A-level results in Wales, England and Northern Ireland are due out on Thursday Similar grading systems were adopted in other parts of the UK and in Scotland the government was forced to make aU-turnafter tens of thousands of teacher assessed grades were lowered. Education researcher Jane Nicholas said the system in Wales is different in some ways. ""Most of the candidates for A-level this year will have already sat the AS exam under normal conditions last year, which means that 40% of their mark is taken from the mark they achieved in the AS level,"" she says. What will happen on A-level results day? 'Exam results don't define you - you do' ""That gives, I think, some reassurance that they'll be more weight given to actual data about what those individual pupils were able to achieve. ""But, certainly, there is a lot of concern and rightfully so from the candidates themselves. ""It's a really stressful time for them and their parents, it always is at exam time. ""This week is always very stressful for everybody, but it's been uniquely so this year."" Mass A-level result upgrade 'not expected' in Wales As the GCSE pass rate falls, how to appeal or resit?

Coronavirus: Loans announced for pandemic rent arrears,"Loans are to be made available to private tenants who have built up rent arrears during the pandemic Housing Minister Julie James says the money will be paid directly to the landlord or agent and tenants will be able to pay back the amount over five years with an APR rate of 1% Two more people have died with coronavirus, according to Public Health Wales Face coverings will be made mandatory in more places if coronavirus ""starts to spread"", Wales' first minister says Latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of the coronavirus lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent About 80 jobs at the National Trust in Wales could be lost due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic Some brass bands may die out unless they can rehearse in person again, musicians have warned Catherine Evans and Richard Porter That's all from our live updates from the Welsh Government's weekly briefing. This afternoon's updates are:  There are fears brass bands will not be able to survive lockdown without being able to rehearse in person again. But in recent months, bands across Wales have been creative, practising and putting on concerts online. When Brecon Town Concert Band met for their first rehearsal after lockdown they were not able to meet inside - but they did the next best thing. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Brecon band plays again, but outdoors Coronavirus has exposed the ""grim truth"" of homelessness, says Plaid Cymru's health spokeswoman Delyth Jewell. Welcoming the announcement of loans for private tenants in arrears due to the pandemic, she added the commitment to tackling homelessness and the housing crisis was ""long overdue"". âTo truly address these long terms problems we need a housing first model, more affordable homes being built and ending no-fault evictions for good,"" she said. âHomelessness is and remains a political choice that should have been tackled long ago. Access to housing should be a human right."" Department store group Debenhams says itwill cut 2,500 more jobsas it struggles to survive the coronavirus pandemic. This is on top of the 4,000 announced since May, meaning the retailer will have cut a third of its workforce. The cuts will be mainly across its UK stores and distribution centre, but it said no more shops were planned to shut. During lockdown just four gardeners have been responsible for the upkeep of Bodnant Gardens About 80 jobs at the National Trust in Wales could be lost due to the coronavirus pandemic. Houses, gardens and shops managed by the charity were closed in March as lockdown began. Now despite being able to reopen some sites to visitors, the trust has warnedmany historical properties may have to remain closed for years. Assistant director Rebecca Williams said the lack of income meant the trust had to make ""very difficult decisions"". The UK's largest conservation charity, the National Trust looks after historic houses, gardens and hundreds of miles of coastline in Wales. It had previously announced about1,200 jobs would be cut acrossthe charity as a result of anticipated losses of Â£200m. The latest two people to die with coronavirus in Wales were both in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board region, covering the whole of north Wales. It has recorded 407 deaths, the highest number of any health board in Wales. Two more deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales takes the total to 1,581, according to Public Health Wales.  There have been two more  deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales (PHW). It takes the number of pandemic deaths across Wales to 1,581. A further 13 cases of Covid-19 have also been recorded by PHW. It means there have now been 17,476 positive cases of Covid-19 in Wales since the start of the pandemic.  The latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of
lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The
rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was down, at 2.7%, with
8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, Office for
National Statistics (ONS) figures show. That
is 20,000 fewer than the same period a year ago. The
rate of unemployment across the UK was higher at 3.9%. Gerwyn Davies from the
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the professional body
for human resources, said: ""The jobs market appears resilient on
the surface, partly because the official statistics lag events by a couple of
months. ""And
with a spike in redundancies over the coming months now almost inevitable due
to the unwinding of the Job Retention Scheme, we can expect to see unemployment
rise sharply too."" Read more here. Citizens Advice has welcomed a scheme to help people who have fallen into rental arrears during lockdown. It follows an announcement during the Welsh Government's weekly coronavirus briefing that tenants will be able to pay back arrears using a Tenancy Saver Loan. Rebecca Woolley, Citizens Advice Wales director, said: 

""Research has shown that renters have been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus crisis. ""We're pleased that the Welsh Government is taking steps to help people who have built up rent arrears during the crisis through no fault of their own."" She said to ensure the scheme is effective, it was essential users were not pushed further into financial difficulty with interest charges, which would mean additional costs. Julie James says
it is âtoo early to sayâ what the level of appeals might look like after A-level
results are announced on Thursday. The housing minister's comments comes after theScottish Government apologised over the way exams in Scotland were marked. Ms James was asked during the Welsh Government's weekly news conference whether exam appeals in Wales would be made free. She said: âThe
appeals process in Wales will be in place. ""The schools will be able to appeal
if they need to do so; we'll wait to see what the results are. ""It's too early to
say at the moment what the level of appeal might look like or what the results
might be. ""Weâre a couple of days in advance of the results coming out.â The latest unemployment figures for Wales âdonât tell the whole storyâ, the housing minister has said. The figures suggest thefull force of lockdown has not hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. The rate of unemployment in Wales between April and June was 2.7%, with 8,000 fewer people unemployed than between January and March, official figures showed. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Julie James said: âWe don't think these figures tell the whole story. âWe definitely think that the picture will become clearer over the coming months as the furlough scheme winds down, and as companies take stock of where that leaves them. âWe're still in the easing process so people are still trying to gauge whether their companies are still viable and what that means for income and so on, so it's very difficult to say right now exactly where we are.â ""We absolutely rely on the good faith and good conscience"" of Welsh people to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, Julie James has said. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs weekly coronavirus
briefing, the housing minister said people needed to comply with regulations to keep cases down. She said: âWe want people to continue to be cautious and to continue
to obey the rules and in that way we have the best chance of stopping a second
wave. âOf course weâve got preparations in place with our local
authorities and other public services in order to prepare. Itâs only sensible
that any government would do that."" Julie James says local authorities should only âenforceâ social distancing measures for pubs, bars and restaurants as a âlast resortâ if they flout the rules. Speaking during the coronavirus press conference, the minister said the Welsh Government had given further powers to councils to enforce rules, but it was important they worked with local businesses in an âengaged"" and ""educatedâ way. She said: âLocal authorities are working with their local businesses to ensure that they understand the rules, that theyâre able to apply those rules, and then only enforce when itâs obvious that somebody is deliberately flouting those rules.â The Minister for Housing
and Local Government has said the Welsh Government is ""very reliant on
people doing the right thing"" by wearing face masks on public transport. Julie James told the weekly news conference the government had given local
authorities the power to enforce this rule. But she said authorities should
""engage, educate and only enforce right at the end of that process"". She added that the Welsh Government is
""expecting people to just behave reasonably"". And she reiterated: ""They are mandatory
on public transport in Wales."" In response to questions about reassurance for Welsh students who are expecting exam results next week, Julie James said: âI am really happy to reassure every learner in Wales that
the model here is very different.â It followsconcerns about the way grades are being awarded in England and Scotland. She said the system âtakes into account work that
has been completed by the students"". ""For example, here in Wales weâve never let
go of AS-Levels so if you took A-Levels this year then you would have had your
AS-Levels last year and they would have contributed 40% to your A-Level
grade.â âWe are very keen that our learners are given the accolades
they need for the hard work that theyâve done but also that they get the grades
they deserve and those grades are robust.â The housing minister says âit's hard to put actual numbersâ on
how many people may look to benefit from a new scheme to help them with rent
arrears. Earlier Julie James said the Welsh Government was making Â£8m
available to help those who have fallen behind with their rent payments as a
result of the pandemic. Speaking at the weekly Welsh Government press conference,
Ms James said: âWeâre expecting a particular cohort of people to benefit from
this. âAnyone who's entitled to benefit or is in socially
rented housing has a different route to help themâ¦ So we're encouraging people
who have recourse to any of the other public funds to use that public fund. âThis is for a particular cohort of people who weren't in
any rent arrears before and this rent is as a result of Covid-19, so
they won't have had substantial rent arrears before March of this year and have
now found themselves through no fault of their own in this particular
circumstance. âIt's hard to put actual numbers on that, we know the
cohort exists, it's very difficult to track them exactly. âWe think Â£8m is sufficient.â The housing and local government
minister also announced a new loan scheme for tenants who have built up rent
arrears during the pandemic. Julie James told the Welsh Government's news
conference she hoped the Â£8m scheme would ""stop many thousands of people
from eviction and even homelessness"". The scheme is for private sector
tenants who are not on benefits. It will not apply to people who
were in significant rental arrears before March - when lockdown began. The Welsh Government says once the loan is accepted the money will be paid directly to the landlord or
agent and tenants will be able to pay back the amount over five years with an
APR rate of 1%. There is no maximum amount for
the loan but it will be limited to covering rent arrears only. Welsh Housing and Local Government
Minister Julie James has told the Welsh Government's weekly news conference that since lockdown
started more than 2,000 people who were homeless or in unsuitable accommodation
had now been given somewhere to live. She confirmed Â£50m would be spent
on projects to ensure no-one would need to âreturn to life on the streetsâ. Ms James said all 22 local councils
across Wales had come up with innovative projects but there remained ""some
big and complex issues which we're not going to solve overnight"". ""Long-lasting and
transformative solutions"" were needed ""if we're going to end
homelessness for good"", she said. A man who lost his job
at the beginning of the pandemic has said it is harder for older people to find
work. Myke Jones, from
Cwmbran, was working in IT project management. He is now trying to apply for
new jobs at the age of 58. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's a big competition, I've noticed a huge
difference in the past couple of months in the fact that jobs are few and far
between. âYou're
looking at 200-plus people applying for those jobs. ""I've spent ages
on my CV trying to make it look flashy and say the right things, but the video
interview comes along and the moment they see you, you can tell they see
straight away 'you're quite old' and they tend to shy away. ""I
struggle to pay our bills, we've got mortgages to pay, I can't see my pension
covering it all so I'm going to be working for a long time yet. I can see a lot
of travelling and staying away from home."" Mr
Jones has also been recovering from cancer during lockdown. ""We
live in a flat, we haven't got a garden, I need to be a bit more careful so I
don't go out as much as most people and that worry I've got about cancer
returning just adds to the mix of 'I'm struggling to find a job, how will I pay
the bills next month'."" It comes as the latest unemployment figures suggest the full force of lockdown has not yet hit jobs in Wales to a significant extent. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
PM understands exam grades 'anxiety',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says schools are the âlast thingâ the government wants to close as part of any local lockdown restrictions It is understandable that there is ""anxiety"" over exam grades, the prime minister has said, as pupils prepare to receive estimated results this week for tests cancelled during lockdown. Visiting a school in London, Boris Johnson said he was also ""very keen that exams should go ahead as normal"". A-level results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due on Thursday. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasapologised for the handling of its exam results. She acknowledged ""we did not get it right"" after results estimated by teachers for cancelled exams were downgraded. The Scottish Qualifications Authority lowered grades using an algorithm - with pass rates for pupils in deprived areas downgraded further than those in more affluent parts. Ms Sturgeon said her priority was to resolve the concernsabout how some results had been downgraded, following protests by pupils. With pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland awaiting A-level results this week, Mr Johnson said on a visit to a school in east London that he wanted their hard work ""properly reflected"". ""Clearly, because of what has happened this year, there is some anxiety about what grades pupils are going to get, and everybody understands the system - that the teachers are setting the grades, then there's a standardisation system,"" he said. ""We will do our best to ensure that the hard work of pupils is properly reflected."" Could reopening schools spread coronavirus? How will schools reopen fully? How will exam results day work this year? Ofqual, England's exam regulator, said that following the row in Scotlandit wanted to reassure students,externalthat grades have been calculated in the ""fairest possible"" way. It said it would publish data on grades by socio-economic status on results day, adding that early analysis showed poorer students and ethnic minorities ""have not been disadvantaged by this year's awarding process"". The head of the university admissions service said this summer was likely to be the ""busiest"" ever period for the clearing system, which matches students with places after results are published - including those who have missed the grades for their initial offer. Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said she believed up to 80,000 students could find a place through clearing, beating last year's record of 73,325. Some students were likely to abandon plans for a gap year as the pandemic restricted travel, and could apply through clearing instead, she suggested. The fall in overseas students meant it was a ""good year"" for UK applicants seeking a place, Ms Marchant added. A recent analysis by the PA news agency showed that the select Russell Group universities still had 4,500 undergraduate courses with vacant places. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? One 18-year-old said she felt students in her school year had been treated like ""guinea pigs"". ""I'm expecting the worst scenario possible at this point,"" said Cheyenne Williams from Barnhill Community High School in north-west London. ""I have doubts that grades will be allocated on a fair basis."" Meanwhile, some parents criticised suggestions that students could sit exams in the autumn if they were unhappy with their estimated grade. Helen Milne, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, whose son will collect his results this week, said: ""How on earth are children meant to take resits in October when they haven't been in school for six months and there are no teachers to teach them?"" But others defended the approach. ""It's not great but I can't think of a better system,"" said Helen Jones from Abingdon in Oxfordshire. ""Nobody wanted to have a pandemic and you can't put the lives of a whole cohort on hold for a year."" Elsewhere, Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonsaid there was little evidence of coronavirus being transmitted in schoolsand the plan to fully reopen England's schools in September was guided by the best science. It is usually pupils who are nervous about exam results and going back to school. But this year it's ministers who are feeling the heat. And those in England will be looking with extreme nervousness at the car crash over Scotland's replacement exam grades - because the problems that outraged Scottish students are going to reappear in England's A-level results on Thursday. ""Everybody understands the system that the teachers are setting the grades, then there's a standardisation system,"" Boris Johnson said on a school visit. But in reality teachers' predicted grades have mostly been sidelined - and instead the two key factors for grades will be how pupils are ranked and schools' previous results. As the row in Scotland has shown, pegging estimated grades to how schools usually perform will be seen as locking in disadvantage. It means bright pupils in low-achieving schools can lose out. And many more will be confused at the gap between their teachers' predictions and their results. But so far there are no signs of the emergency brakes from ministers in England. Instead they are relying on schools being able to appeal against harsh results and that disappointed pupils can take back-up exams in the autumn. As if the exam pressure wasn't enough, there are high political stakes about the fast-approaching new school year and the promise that all pupils will be going back full time. Government advisers have warned the nation may have reached the limit of what can be reopened in society safely. But asked whether parents should brace for local closures to combat flare-ups of the virus, Mr Johnson said education was a priority. ""The last thing we want to do is close schools. Education is a priority for the country - that is simple social justice,"" he said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours?

Exam results day rituals put on hold,"Results day razzmatazz is likely to be muted this year By any measure, this summer's results days are some of the weirdest ever. So how will the need for social distancing and extra hygiene impact some of the most emotionally charged days of the school calendar? ""You laugh, you cry, you celebrate with your friends,"" one teenager told the BBC. But this year much of that is probably out. How will I get my exam results this year? A-level and GCSE results to be higher this summer It's the big moment. You queue, you're handed your envelope. You open it... This year the big decision for schools has been whether to invite students in to pick up their results at all. Many students are being asked to look out for an email or log in to the school portal at 08:00 - and to avoid their school or college. But, equally, many schools are inviting students in. ""It will be more important than ever this year to be able to congratulate students on their achievements, to console those who haven't achieved their results they were hoping for and advise them on the next steps,"" says the Association of School and College Leaders. If schools and colleges do invite pupils in, they're advised to minimise contact and mixing, keep them in small groups  and observe social distancing. And that is likely to mean.... Under social distancing hugging is out, unless you are living with the person you plan to hug. Elbow or foot bumps might be better, if less satisfying in the moment. Hugging will probably have to be restricted to people in the same household Jumping in the air and waving your results sheet is only really acceptable if you go to one of those schools with acres of pitches on which to socially distance your celebrations. Bear in mind that if you jump too much you are likely to exert yourself and risk breathing any germs you might be carrying over anyone standing too close - so keep your distance. And if you're receiving results by email at home, jumping would inevitably be less spontaneous. You'd have to print out your own results sheet and then hunt down some classmates also willing to jump in a socially distanced manner. Look before you leap - jumping could be bad manners Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone. This year some schools are only inviting in students who need to discuss their grades, so any crying will perhaps happen more privately than normal. Many students who have missed their grades will appreciate the extra privacy, but others will miss being buoyed up by hugs and sympathy from friends. At any rate, if you do cry, it's pretty important not to dribble on anyone from outside your household. Regular results day selfies of you and your friends standing in a row, expressing joy and amazement, are probably out this year. Maybe this is the day to dust off the selfie stick for some high angled, socially distanced shots of you and your mates with your results sheets. Alternatively you could just scrap the selfie idea and just ask someone else to take the photo, but maybe you should also think about antimicrobial wipes for your phone and a plentiful supply of hand sanitiser. Some parents like to gather at the school gates on results day, waiting for their offspring to reveal their grades. But this year the government is asking schools that do decide to open to ""continue to make it clear to parents that they cannot gather at entrance gates or doors or enter the site unless they have a pre-arranged appointment"". Results parties will have to be socially distanced this year ""After GCSEs, we were in the school, laughing and crying and then we all went out as friends together, we all had a party at someone's house. It was nice I liked that experience."" But two years on, for this student, now 18, the virus means parties will have to be a bit more circumspect, particularly in areas where local lockdowns are in force.

'I'm over the moon... and so are all my pals',"Lauren, Luke and Kelly are among thousands of students whose estimated grades were lowered Lauren Steele, 16, from East Kilbride was sitting at home nervously watching the television when she heard the education secretary read her name out in parliament. ""I didn't expect to hear that at all,"" she said. ""It was kind of funny to be honest. My phone started going straight away"". Lauren was one of the pupils who wrote to John Swinney criticising the Scottish Qualifications Authority's (SQA) moderation of this year's results. Like many across Scotland, she had been downgraded by the national exam body and received lower grades that she had been predicted to achieve by teachers. However, in his statement to Holyrood Mr Swinney mentioned her and several other young people who had influenced his decision to accept teacher estimates of scores. The move affects about 75,000 Scottish pupils who will now have their marks upgraded following the government U-turn. As for Lauren, she said her family were proud of her no matter what exam results she received, but said she was ""really glad and grateful"" about the decision. She had been predicted to get a B in Higher French by her teachers but was instead awarded a C by the SQA. She said she wrote the letter to John Swinney because ""the hard work of some pupils was being ignored"". Lauren said she was shocked to hear Education Secretary John Swinney say her name in parliament She joked that her family were shocked by her decision to contact the education secretary, saying it was out of character for her to get involved. Lauren said it was the right decision to intervene, however. ""Everyone is just so relieved. I think a lot of people thought 'There's no point making a stand, the government won't do anything'. ""I was one of the few people who did think we need to do something. I just felt that something needed to be done. ""If it wasn't for the online petitions, the letters, the emails then this wouldn't have happened. I'm feeling so much better now"". In Motherwell, Alex Robertson was worried that his 16-year-old son Luke had been disadvantaged because he couldn't sit his exams during the pandemic. Mr Robertson said he felt like Luke's grades had suffered unfairly and that he was worried about the appeals process going forward. Luke had been predicted to achieve mostly As but received a mixed bag of As, Bs and Cs on results day. But after Mr Swinney's announcement, Mr Robertson said he was delighted that the role of the teacher would be recognised in deciding his son's grades. Luke Robertson said he planned to go onto study pharmacy or pharmacology ""Luke was sitting watching the TV and the smile just spread across his face,"" Mr Robertson said. ""That was the kind of reaction I was hoping for when he opened his envelope last week. The right thing has been done. ""It's a mixed bag of emotions. I'm happy but we shouldn't have been here in the first place. It's taken a week but we got there,"" he added. Why we think our exam results were unfair Scottish school pupils have results upgraded Medical dream student 'over the moon' with grades U-turn As for Luke, he welcomed the news that his grades would be based on his teacher's original estimates. ""I'm over the moon,"" he said. ""My pals are all really happy too. I can look at the courses I want to do now. Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils had shown ""tremendous resilience"" and apologised for the failed grading system ""It gives me more options and it means this year there is not as much pressure. ""I'm just so happy with the changes,"" Luke added. And for Kelly Wan, 17 from Eyemouth, the announcement made her first day back at school even more exciting. She had hoped to study medicine at university and said she needed all A grades to get there. She had been predicted by her teachers to achieve those grades and did so in her prelim exams. On results day however, she was disappointed to see that her estimated five As had turned into just two and three Bs.  Although ""amazing"" results, she said it wasn't enough to get into her chosen field. But now her original teacher estimates will be accepted and she said she was ""delighted"" about the decision. Kelly Wan said she was ""really gutted"" when she opened the text from the SQA ""When the announcement was made, everyone was screaming with delight,"" Kelly said. ""I feel really good. I'm delighted. The week prior had really lowered my motivation with school. She said that the announcement meant she was more determined than ever to get to university and study medicine. ""I know I can do it now. It has boosted my self-esteem. It's given me something to look forward to,"" she said.
