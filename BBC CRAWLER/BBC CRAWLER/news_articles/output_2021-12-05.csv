Trump social media firm says it has raised $1bn,"Donald Trump's new social media firm says it has entered into agreements to raise $1bn (Â£755m) from investors ahead of a planned stock market listing. The Trump Media & Technology Group is working to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. It comes as Mr Trump remains banned from Twitter and Facebook following the attack on the US Capitol in January. ""$1bn sends an important message to Big Tech that censorship and political discrimination must end,"" he said. ""As our balance sheet expands, Trump Media & Technology Group will be in a stronger position to fight back against the tyranny of Big Tech."" Mr Trump announced plans to launch Truth Social earlier this year, saying it would allow conversation ""without discrimination on the basis of political ideology"". Michael Jackson imitator charged over Capitol riot Steve Bannon pleads not guilty to contempt charge The Trump Media & Technology Group has partnered on the project with Digital World Acquisition, a so called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections. On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured the $1bn from from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn. It would appear to underscore the former US president's ability to attract strong financial backing despite the controversy surrounding his time in charge. Protestors storming the US Capitol in January Mr Trump was banned from top social media platforms after the 6 January attack by his supporters on the US Capitol in Washington DC amid concerns the then-president would inspire further violence. It came after Mr Trump made claims, without evidence, of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election. Many Wall Street firms snubbed the opportunity to invest in the former president's new venture, according to Reuters. But some hedge funds, family investment firms and high net-worth individuals have backed it. Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram at the time he was blocked, according to a presentation on his company's website. He has also repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency again in 2024. However, there have been questions about the state of the former president's finances. Last month a congressional committee found he had""grossly exaggerated"" the profitability of his Washington DC hotel- claims the Trump Organization called ""misleading"". Trump Media & Technology Group's partnership with Digital World Acquisition has already attracted scrutiny. Last month Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action. Truth Social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022. It is the first of three stages in the Trump Media plan, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release. In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com's AWS cloud service and Google Cloud.

Pope condemns treatment of migrants in Europe,"The Pope has denounced ""narrow self-interest and nationalism"" over the way European countries treats migrants. Speaking on the Greek island of Lesbos, Pope Francis called the neglect of migrants the ""shipwreck of civilisation"". The Pope first visited Lesbos in 2016, when it was a major entry point for people trying to reach Europe. Since then, new flashpoints have emerged and the Pope expressed regret that little had changed. Last month 27 people died when their inflatable dinghy sank in the Channel between France and the UK. The number of people attempting the crossing has been growing, with more than 26,000 people arriving in the UK so far this year, more than double last year's total. Several people have also died in freezing temperatures attempting to cross into Poland from Belarus, which denies accusations it has been orchestrating the crisis at its border to destabilise the EU. ""In Europe there are those who persist in treating the problem as a matter that does not concern them - this is tragic,"" Pope Francis said. ""History teaches us that narrow self-interest and nationalism lead to disastrous consequences."" The pontiff was speaking at a temporary camp housing about 2,000 asylum-seekers, which replaced the overcrowded Moria camp that was destroyed in fires last year. While the coronavirus pandemic had shown that major challenges had to be confronted together and there were some signs of this happening on climate change, there was little sign of such an approach to migration, he said. ""It is easy to influence public opinion by instilling fear of the other,"" Pope Francis said. ""The remote causes should be attacked, not the poor people who pay the consequences and are even used for political propaganda."" By Fergal Keane, BBC News, Lesbos This was a speech delivered in front of refugees but aimed squarely at political leaders across the European continent. The Pope's words betrayed frustration at what he sees as the failure of politicians to adequately address the migrant issue. His message of compassion for asylum seekers is not new but his language on Lesbos was exceptionally forthright. Pope Francis was speaking against the backdrop of pushbacks of migrants at sea - including close to Lesbos - and on European land borders, as well as the erection of fences to prevent them reaching the EU. Will his words make any difference? They certainly inject a powerfully compassionate element in a debate so often framed in the language of fear. But there is very little political appetite in Europe to liberalise the migration system. Nor is there any sign of the kind of global political will to address the problems of conflict and extreme poverty which drive so many to flee their homes. The number of people entering Europe reached a high point in 2015, when more than a million people fleeing the Syrian civil war and other crises made the journey. Since then numbers have fallen as nations along migrant routes closed borders. The EU also agreed a deal to return failed asylum seekers to Turkey and has provided support for the Libyan coastguard to pick up people who set off to sea. But the flow of people has not stopped, with 1,650 recorded by the International Organization for Migration as having gone missing while attempting to cross the Mediterranean this year. The pontiff met children in the Mavrovouni camp Francis said he understood that there was a lot of ""fatigue and frustration"" over migration that had been exacerbated by the pandemic, but warned that without change there was a risk that civilisation itself would find itself ""shipwrecked"". ""Let us eradicate the prevailing mentality revolving around our ego and personal and national egoisms which determine every decision we take,"" he said. Survivor haunted by deadliest Channel crossing The Channel beaches that host a lethal trade in human hope Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, who was accompanying Francis, said the migration issue was the responsibility of all Europe, not just Greece. More than 8,000 people have crossed into Greece by land and sea this year, down from about 15,000 last year and about 75,000 the previous year, according to EU figures. Greece is building closed camps on several islands to house asylum seekers until their claims are processed. It denies that Greek coast guards push back migrants at sea, insisting that they are saving lives. British Home Secretary Priti Patel has cited the Greek pushbacks as a possible model for the UK to push back migrant boats in the Channel.

Veteran Republican leader Bob Dole dies,"Bob Dole, a World War Two veteran who went on to be a long-time Republican senator and US presidential candidate, has died aged 98. His death was announced in a statement from the Elizabeth Dole Foundation: ""It is with heavy hearts we announce that Senator Robert Joseph Dole died early this morning in his sleep. At his death, at age 98, he had served the United States of America faithfully for 79 years."" Earlier this year Dole had said that he was receiving treatment for lung cancer. His political career was marked by a decade-long stint as the top Republican in the US Senate, and running unsuccessfully for the White House against Bill Clinton in 1996. But decades before his bid for the presidency, on 14 April 1945, Bob Dole was lying on a World War Two battlefield in northern Italy, left for dead. Biden leads tributes to 'dear friend' Bob Dole Despite his lack of combat experience, the young 10th Mountain Division lieutenant had been ordered to lead an attack on a German machine-gun post. Three-quarters of his squad lay strewn on the battlefield. When he ran to help a fallen soldier, gunfire and enemy shells shattered Dole's right arm and upper back. He fell unconscious, and an army sergeant rolled him to safety. He gave him a huge dose of morphine and painted an ""M"" on his forehead - in Dole's own blood - to stop passing medics giving a second, lethal hit. ""I gave him a shot because he's gone,"" the man told his commanding officer. ""At least he'll have some comfort."" That Dole survived was a miracle. That he went on to rebuild his broken body - and become one of the Republican Party's longest-serving senators and a presidential candidate - was a tribute to his determination. Many believed the survival and determination were linked. Dole receives the Congressional Gold Medal from President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan in 2018 Robert Joseph Dole was born on 22 July 1923 and grew up in the Dust Bowl of Kansas during the Great Depression. It was a provincial childhood, 200 miles (320km) from the nearest midsized city. As a youth, Bobby only left Kansas once, on a fishing trip to the mountains of nearby Colorado. His salesmen parents struggled financially - their four children sharing a single room - but preached the values of hard work and religious devotion. They ""taught me to put my trust in God, not government,"" he later said, ""and never confuse the two."" There were no books at home. ""Be a doer, not a stewer,"" was the family motto - with Dole encouraged to play outside at every opportunity. While his friends studied for college, Bob shot hoops and worked serving ice cream at a local drugstore. At the University of Kansas, he studied medicine but did not treat college as a place to expand the mind. Intellectually lazy, he partied and became a star athlete, competing at basketball and football as well as on the track. Then came the war, Dole's enlistment in the army - and the day that changed his life. He lay near death for nine hours on that Italian battleground, with injuries including a fractured shoulder, a broken neck and spine, paralysis, a ruined kidney and bits of shrapnel. The hidden iron in his soul had, fortunately, been left intact. For his service, he was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star but the hardest battle was yet to come. More than three years were spent in recovery, stuck in a sterile hospital room in Michigan fighting off boredom, blood clots and infections that nearly claimed his life. Bob Dole spent 39 months recovering from his injuries in hospital after the war Facing amputation of his arm, he was fortunate to encounter a maverick surgeon who performed multiple operations, free of charge. Dole credited him with an impact on his life second only to his family. Demoralised and robbed of his ability to lead the outdoor life he loved, Dole began to read. Unable to hold the books, he used a projector to beam the pages onto the ceiling above the bed. He devoured the works of Plato, George Washington and, his favourite, Abraham Lincoln. ""It was a way to maintain sanity, I guess,"" he said. He met an occupational therapist, Phyllis Holden, and took her to an officers' club dance. Three months later they married - despite the objections of her parents who believed Dole was in no fit state to care for her. She shook him out of his ""funk"". Returning home, they rigged up a rope-and-pulley system to build up his strength. He kept it there for more than half a century, to remind him how far he had come. Dole using his rope-and-pulley system at his house to help him get stronger He never regained use of his arm and right hand, spending the rest of his life limply holding a pen to discourage innocent offers of a handshake. What he lacked physically, however, he now made up with drive. Unable to write notes, he recorded law school lectures and stayed up all night transcribing them left-handed. He could only write brief notes in his final exams, but they were sharp enough to pass. Encouraged to enter politics, Dole took advice. He was a moderate but saw sense in the argument that ""if you want to do something politically in Kansas, you'd better declare yourself a Republican"". In 1950, he was elected to the state legislature with the help of a campaign featuring a female singing group, Dolls for Dole. A decade later, he made it to Washington as a member of the House of Representatives for a rural area of Kansas that had only just permitted alcohol and saw a 'commie' under every rock. Politics began to consume him, and he built a reputation as the conservative his district expected. The family made the long drive home each summer in a car crammed with pets and luggage. One year their dog died from the heat. With Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. Years later, Dole held back tears while giving the eulogy at his funeral In 1968 - the same year Richard Nixon became president - Dole reached the Senate. But his dedication to politics took a toll on his marriage and at the end of his first term, he divorced. His decision to leave Phyllis shocked her. But, in the course of their last year together, Dole had eaten just two meals with his wife and daughter. It is a measure of the degree to which politics now obsessed him that he consulted Nixon about potential damage to the Republican Party before informing her. By 1972, he was Republican national chairman and with a new partner, Elizabeth Hanford, who shared his enthusiasm for politics. They married three years later. Bob Dole married his second wife, Elizabeth Hanford, in 1975 Elizabeth Dole would later become Ronald Reagan's secretary of transportation and eventually won a seat in the Senate herself. With a reputation for blunt speaking, Dole became incumbent Gerald Ford's vice-presidential running mate in 1976, but they lost. During the campaign Dole blundered in the debate against his opposite number, Walter Mondale, describing America's 20th Century conflicts as ""Democrat wars"". It was a phrase that would come back to haunt him. Public speaking was his weakness as a politician: he was naturally taciturn, couldn't physically write speeches and was loath to rehearse or read words others had written. He was a natural in the House and Senate; at the backend of politics he could do deals, make trade-offs and build consensus. Out front - in the bear-pit of a national election - he lacked the magic ingredient required for success. Jimmy Carter, Reagan and later Bill Clinton had the common touch and easy delivery that Dole could never muster. On the stump, they were fluent but he was staccato, with speeches riddled with random clichÃ©s. Dole became Gerald Ford's vice-presidential running mate in 1976 Nor did he have the thing Americans call ""vision"". His personal story was the stuff of presidents but when asked what he wanted for the country, he struggled - responding with vague fatuities and empty slogans. In 1988, when George HW Bush beat him in the New Hampshire primary, he boiled over on television and demanded his opponent ""stop lying about my record"". He was irritated at Bush's campaign ads and constant posing for the cameras, with photocalls driving trucks and shovelling snow. Dole knew he physically couldn't do the same and the frustration made him snap. He nursed his grievances in the Senate. With his eye still on a national campaign, politically he tacked to the centre ground. With fellow Republican John McCain, he reached across the aisle in a series of bipartisan initiatives, in particular on disability rights. His colleagues in the Senate remembered his ability to listen in meetings (he still couldn't take notes) and his air of inscrutability. McCain knew him for a decade before he discovered Dole had worn a memory bracelet with McCain's name on it throughout his captivity in Vietnam. In 1996, the 73-year-old finally got to run for president. He went up against Bill Clinton, a formidable force with the advantage of incumbency and a booming economy. As a campaigner, Dole had met his match. Dole takes on Bill Clinton during the 1996 presidential campaign In his speech accepting the nomination, he left an open goal. ""Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth."" he said. ""Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith and confidence in action."" Clinton's response was cutting: the country needed a bridge to the future and not the past. Dole failed to find the national cheerleader within him, couldn't stand spin doctors and was cursed with the smile of an undertaker. ""A Dark Man for Dark Times,"" said one Democrat bumper sticker. The oldest first-time presidential candidate in history lost gracefully and by a landslide. Retiring from public office, Dole remained active - becoming a regular on Sunday political talk shows and an influential elder statesman of American politics. He picked up his career in the law, appeared in TV commercials for Dunkin' Donuts and Viagra, and wrote a book on jokes told by US presidents, ranking them by their sense of humour. His endorsement in presidential campaigns remained valuable. He backed moderate Republicans like Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney - with less enthusiasm for his party's emerging right. In 2019, Congress unanimously voted his promotion from captain to colonel for his service during World War Two. He accepted the honour gracefully, although he quipped that, ""I was happy being a captain and it pays the same."" Two years later - when Dole had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer - newly elected President Joe Biden was one of the first to visit the veteran Republican at home. It was a mark of the respect in which Bob Dole was held on both sides of the political divide. Dole, at the age of 92, greets supporters at the WWII Memorial on Veterans Day in 2015 In 2005, Dole wrote his life story. He recalled that moment on the battlefield in Italy, just three weeks before the German surrender. He told how he thought he'd end up on a street corner ""selling pencils""; about how meeting injured troops in Iraq brought back memories; and of the debt America owes to its fighting men. He will be remembered as one of his country's most distinguished public servants - a man who displayed tremendous courage in battle and fortitude in recovery. At his great friend Richard Nixon's funeral, Dole described him in words many would apply to the speaker himself: ""Brave, unafraid of controversy and living every day of his life to the hilt.""

Houses were buried to their rooftops and vehicles wholly submerged. Taufiq Ismail Marzuqi, who filmed the struggle to excavate bodies, told Reuters the rescue efforts were ""very dire"". At least 11 villages in Lumajang, in East Java, were coated in volcanic ash. At least 56 people have been injured, with many suffering burns after they mistook the hot mud flow for flooding. ""There were 10 people carried away by the mud flow,"" said Salim, who lives in the village of Kampung Renteng. ""One of them was almost saved. He was told to run away but said 'I can't, who will feed my cows?'"" One man searching for survivors said 10 people were missing in his village. Another described what happened. ""Locals here thought it was just usual floods. We did not know it was hot mud. All of sudden, the sky turned dark as rains and hot smoke came. Thankfully, it was raining so we could breathe,"" he told AFP. Some relatives of the victims in Lumajang in East Java say they have not yet been able to collect their loved ones as some of the bodies have not yet been identified. People inspect their village which has been buried by volcanic ash A spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said the injured were being treated at various hospitals and medical facilities. Some 1,300 people have been evacuated from the area so far, the agency said, and 10 sand mine workers who were trapped in buildings have been saved. Rescue shelters have been equipped with food, face masks, tarpaulins and body bags. The evacuation has been hampered by choking smoke, a power blackout, and rainstorms during the eruption which turned the debris into mud. An important bridge from the area to the nearby city of Malang was also severed during the eruption. Vehicles have been submerged and homes badly damaged A man and boy flee their home in Lumajang district, along with their livestock The head of Indonesia's geological agency said heavy rain falling on the lip of Mt Semeru's crater caused it to partially collapse, triggering the eruption. There had been no increase in seismicity to suggest any change in magma flow, he said. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) in Darwin, Australia said the ash cloudfrom the eruption appeared to have dissipated,external. The VAAC provides advice to the aviation industry about the location and movement of potentially hazardous volcanic ash. Ash that solidifies on cooler parts of plane engines can disrupt airflow, which can lead to engines stalling or failing completely. It also affects visibility for the pilots and can affect air quality in the cabin - making oxygen masks a necessity. Mt Semeru is in a near permanent state of eruption and regularly spews ash up to about 4,300m, so Saturday's eruption was a ""pretty significant increase in intensity"", Campbell Biggs, a meteorologist at the VAAC, told the BBC. What does volcanic ash do to planes? Mt Semeru rises 3,676m above sea level and is among Indonesia's almost 130 active volcanoes. The last time it erupted was in December 2020, forcing thousands of residents to take shelter. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where continental plates meet, causing frequent volcanic and seismic activity. Videos shared by emergency officials and local media showed residents running away as a giant ash cloud rose behind them. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Investors pledge $1bn to Trump social media firm,"Donald Trump's new social media firm says it has entered into agreements to raise $1bn (Â£755m) from investors ahead of a planned stock market listing. The Trump Media & Technology Group is working to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. It comes as Mr Trump remains banned from Twitter and Facebook following the attack on the US Capitol in January. ""$1bn sends an important message to Big Tech that censorship and political discrimination must end,"" he said. ""As our balance sheet expands, Trump Media & Technology Group will be in a stronger position to fight back against the tyranny of Big Tech."" Mr Trump announced plans to launch Truth Social earlier this year, saying it would allow conversation ""without discrimination on the basis of political ideology"". Michael Jackson imitator charged over Capitol riot Steve Bannon pleads not guilty to contempt charge The Trump Media & Technology Group has partnered on the project with Digital World Acquisition, a so called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections. On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured the $1bn from from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn. It would appear to underscore the former US president's ability to attract strong financial backing despite the controversy surrounding his time in charge. Protestors storming the US Capitol in January Mr Trump was banned from top social media platforms after the 6 January attack by his supporters on the US Capitol in Washington DC amid concerns the then-president would inspire further violence. It came after Mr Trump made claims, without evidence, of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election. Many Wall Street firms snubbed the opportunity to invest in the former president's new venture, according to Reuters. But some hedge funds, family investment firms and high net-worth individuals have backed it. Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram at the time he was blocked, according to a presentation on his company's website. He has also repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency again in 2024. However, there have been questions about the state of the former president's finances. Last month a congressional committee found he had""grossly exaggerated"" the profitability of his Washington DC hotel- claims the Trump Organization called ""misleading"". Trump Media & Technology Group's partnership with Digital World Acquisition has already attracted scrutiny. Last month Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action. Truth Social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022. It is the first of three stages in the Trump Media plan, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release. In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com's AWS cloud service and Google Cloud.

Biden and Putin to talk amid rising Ukraine tensions,"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line US President Joe Biden and Russia's Vladimir Putin will speak via video call on Tuesday, the White House says, amid mounting tensions over Ukraine. It comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had evidence that Russia had made plans for a ""large scale"" attack on Ukraine. But he added it was unclear if Mr Putin had made a final decision to invade. Russia has denied any such intention, and accused Ukraine of executing its own troop build-up. In a statement released on Saturday evening, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Mr Biden will ""underscore US concerns with Russian military activities on the border with Ukraine and reaffirm the United States' support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"" during his call with the Russian president. Ukraine says Russia has deployed armoured vehicles, electronic warfare systems and 94,000 troops along their shared border. Citing intelligence reports, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January. The Russian troop movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. EXPLAINER:Why Russia is stoking border tensions with Ukraine On Friday, Mr Biden warned he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Mr Putin to ""go ahead and do what people are worried he may do"". The US and its European allies have discussed imposing sanctions on Russia if it takes aggressive action. While Ukraine is not a Nato member, it has close ties with the bloc and has received Western weapons including US Javelin anti-tank missiles. Russian officials have denied any plans for an invasion, and say the border troops are there for military exercises. Moscow has accused Nato of engaging in provocative behaviour by holding drills in the Black Sea, off Crimea. Russia's foreign ministry also said Ukraine has itself sent 125,000 troops to their shared border. Kyiv declined to comment on the claim. This video can not be played Biden Putin Summit: Decoding the world leaders' body language This week Britain's most senior military officer said ""we have to be on our guard"" about the potential for conflict in the region. Gen Sir Nick Carter told the BBC that he ""distinctly hoped"" there would not be a war with Russia, but added that Nato would have to be ready for that eventuality. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine are nothing new. In 2014 Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and soon after started to back a separatist insurgency in Ukraine's east. More recently, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has imposed sanctions on a powerful friend of President Putin and banned broadcasts by three pro-Russian TV stations. Presidents Biden and Putin heldtheir only face-to-face talks in Geneva in June. Reuters reports that their last phone call was on 9 July. Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line.

Jail terms of boy's killers to be reviewedArthur Labinjo-Hughes' stepmother and his father were both jailed on Friday for his death.Birmingham & Black Country,"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was found with 130 injuries following his death The couple who killed six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will have their sentences reviewed after claims they are too lenient. Emma Tustinwas jailed for 29 years on Friday for murder and child cruelty and Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, was given 21 years for his manslaughter. The Attorney General's Office said the jail terms will be reviewed to ""determine whether they were too low"". It comes after Tory MP Julian Knight said the sentences were too lenient. Emma Tustin was convicted of Arthur's murder while his father, Thomas Hughes, found guilty of his manslaughter The Attorney General's Office has 28 days from the date of sentence to review a case, assess whether it falls under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, and decide whether to refer to the Court of Appeal. It comes after several football clubs paid tribute to Arthur during Saturday's games. Coventry City, who hosted West Bromwich Albion, Walsall, who met Swindon in the FA Cup second round, and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who played Liverpool, asked supporters to take part in an applause in the sixth minute. Elsewhere, supporters clapped during the West Ham vs Chelsea game as a picture of Arthur was shown on a screen. Birmingham City - the club Arthur supported - tweeted on Saturday that players and fans staged a ""touching tribute"" by also clapping during their game away at Millwall. This video can not be played Birmingham City and Millwall fans pay tribute to Arthur Labinjo-Hughes with applause In a video posted on Twitter on Saturday, Solihull MP Mr Knight said he was standing in Cranmore Road close to Tustin's former home where Arthur was tortured and died in June 2020. He said there was a ""real sense of palpable loss"" over his death, adding there was also ""a sense of anger and questions how this was allowed to happen, how these horrible monsters were allowed to inflict this horrible torture on this young defenceless boy"".

After his death, he was found to have 130 injuries. A serious case review is under way over his death after social workers visited the house in the months before he died and found no cause for concern.

UK tightens travel rules amid Omicron spread,"Travellers heading to the UK will now have to take a Covid test before their departure in an effort to limit spread of the virus, the government has said. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the tightened requirements would come into force from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday. Everyone aged 12 and over will be required to take a pre-departure test a maximum of 48 hours before leaving. Currently people only need to self-isolate until they test negative within two days of arriving. Nigeria will be added from Monday to the red list of countries from where people arriving must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, Mr Javid also confirmed. The health secretary said the government's strategy since the discovery of the Omicron variant had been to ""buy time"" to assess and to ""put in place protective measures"", adding: ""We've always said that we would act swiftly should new data require it."" What are the UK's new travel rules? Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? First data points to Omicron re-infection risk The Department of Health and Social Care later said 21 Omicron cases linked to Nigerian travel had been discovered in recent days. Mr Javid said this number was growing and Nigeria was now second only to South Africa in terms of linked cases to Omicron. He called on people to get a booster vaccine when called to do so by the NHS, describing vaccinations as the country's ""first line of defence"" against coronavirus. A further 26 Omicron cases - of which 25 were recorded in England and one in Scotland -  were confirmed in the UK on Saturday. Those cases took the total for England to 129. Scotland has so far recorded 30 cases while one case was identified in Wales, bringing the total for the UK as a whole to 160. The Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed they will also bring in the updated measures for travellers following the assessment of the UK Health Security Agency. The moves come after pressure on the UK government to tighten the policy on overseas arrivals. Last week the government's scientific advisory body Sage said pre-departure tests for those arriving in the UK would be valuable, in theleaked minutes of a meeting seen by the BBC. Following the latest announcement Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting called for further action and for the number of booster jabs given to be increased to 500,000 per day. In a tweet he said: ""Finally the health secretary accepts Labour's call for pre-departure tests, but why up to 48 hours before flight?"" by Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent While Labour has pushed for pre-departure testing to avoid Omicron spreading, travel businesses will see it as a significant setback - just when green shoots of recovery were emerging. Airlines have supported the red list re-introduction and extension. But they view the introduction of blanket restrictions as unnecessary and ineffective. There was already concern in the industry that people's confidence to travel, and to book future trips, would be knocked by the requirement to take a PCR test within 48 hours of arriving in the UK, and the need to self-isolate until a negative result. The fear is this latest measure will provide a further deterrent. Also, the addition of another country to the red list comes as some UK residents in South Africa are still struggling to get home, because they can't find quarantine hotel rooms available on the day their flight arrives. Earlier this week, Downing Street said any further testing requirement would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry and those planning to go travelling. Commenting on the announcement, British Airways' Chairman Sean Doyle said the move was ""completely out of step with the rest of the world, with every other country taking a measured approach based on the science"". ""Our customers will now be faced with uncertainty and chaos and yet again this a devastating blow for everyone who works in the travel industry,"" he added. Airlines UK said the change was a ""premature"" move that would ""hit industry and passengers before we see the full data"" on the effect of the Omicron variant. The trade body added: ""The red list extension made complete sense - that's what it's there for - but we know from experience that blanket restrictions do not stop the importation of variants. ""It's already here. They've now changed their travel advice twice within a week. It's impossible for anyone to plan."" Travel association Abta said the re-introduction of pre-departure tests would be ""a huge blow"" to ""an already devastated travel industry"". The group called for the government ""to step up to save jobs and businesses"" and for the cost of PCR tests to be reduced. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said additional caution is needed as scientists continue to work to understand the new variant. In a tweet he said: ""We appreciate this will be difficult for the travel sector as we prioritise public health and protect the progress of our world-leading vax and booster programme.""

Travel test changes a 'hammer blow' to industry,"The latest travel rule changes are ""a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Mark Woolhouse said the new rules had come ""too late"" to make a ""material difference"" to a potential wave of the Omicron variant in the UK. The changes include pre-departure tests for people arriving in the UK and Nigeria going on the travel red list. No 10 said the changes were due to a rise in travel-linked Omicron cases. From 04:00 GMT on Tuesday travellers aged 12 and over will be required to show proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test taken no earlier than 48 hours before departure. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the measures were temporary. Nigeria will also be added to the travel red list of countries from Monday, which means UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents returning from the country must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. But the latest changes have been described by the travel industry as a ""hammer blow"", with the Business Travel Association warning livelihoods would be ""devastated"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accepted the latest measures might ""upset or disrupt"" some people, but insisted it was right for ministers to take ""incremental steps"" early to avoid ""bigger disruption"" to travel and the economy. What are the UK's new travel rules? Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? First data points to Omicron re-infection risk Wales 'braced' for 'thousands' more variant cases Prof Woolhouse, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), told the BBC's Andrew Marr that while imported cases of the Omicron variant were ""important"", community transmission of the variant would be the driver of a next wave. He added the numbers of UK Omicron cases were currently ""quite small"" and he strongly suspected the absolute number was ""more in the hundreds than the thousands"". But he warned Omicron was ""spreading pretty rapidly"" in the UK, and if current trends here and in South Africa continued in the coming weeks and months, it could even replace the Delta variant around the world. Asked about Prof Woolhouse's comment the new restrictions had come too late, Mr Raab said there would always be ""Goldilocks criticism that we've done too much or we've done too little"". He said ministers would stay ""eternally vigilant"" to the risks associated with the Omicron variant and that measures, including adding countries to the travel red list, were intended to prevent its ""reseeding"" in the UK. Citingthis week's drop in the number of Covid hospital admissions and deathsand the ""success"" of the vaccination rollout, he said: ""We have steadily and steadfastly created the resilient defences which means we can enjoy Christmas."" But Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said hospitals were already struggling to cope because of winter pressures, and warned the NHS would be in a ""very, very difficult position"" if the new variant led to a surge in hospital admissions. This video can not be played Professor Willem Hanekom: ""Travel bans will do very little to stop the spread of Omicron"" It comes as the UK Health Security Agency reported on Sundaya further 86 cases of the Omicron variant across the UK,external, taking the total so far to 246. Scientists have raised concerns the heavily-mutated variant may be more transmissible than the dominant Delta strain and be able to escape immunity from vaccines. Ten southern African countries had already been added to the UK's travel red list,because of fears about Omicron - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Dennis Mclean and his partner Janet on a previous holiday Denis Mclean has booked a holiday to Tenerife leaving on 27 January but he's thinking about cancelling because of the new rules. ""When they announced we'd have to have a PCR test on the way back within two days, I thought that's manageable. ""But now they want you to do another one 48 hours before you return and it's just the extra cost."" He says he's worried about the rules changing again if they do actually go, but also concerned about rebooking for a later date due to the uncertainty. ""We've waited over two years to have another holiday, and I know there are more important things in life but we gave them up in the pandemic because that's what you had to do,"" he says. ""Sure, variants come along and we've got to tackle that, but I don't think people have certainty any more and it's a shame."" Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a new global set of travel rules to encourage countries to continue sequencing Covid variants without fear of facing a travel blacklist. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""What you will find is as this proceeds, and as we realise that you're going to have to have proof of vaccination that's credible and authentic, if you don't have agreed set of standards and agreed sharing of data, it's going to be much, much harder to get the global economy moving again."" Travel industry bosses said they had not been given sufficient warning of the travel rule changes. Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, said: ""The introduction of pre-departure testing with little warning is a hammer blow to the business travel industry."" ""Public safety is a priority, but businesses will fail, travellers will be stranded and livelihoods devastated by the lack of coherent plans from government,"" he added. Airlines UK said the change was a ""premature"" move that would ""hit industry and passengers before we see the full data"" on the effect of the Omicron variant. The trade body added that previous experiences showed ""blanket restrictions do not stop the importation of variants"", adding the variant was ""already here"". Travel association Abta called for the government ""to step up to save jobs and businesses"" and for the cost of PCR tests to be reduced. Currently, travellers need to self-isolate until they test negative within two days of arriving into the country. The government has said the change to the rules followed new analysis from the UK Health and Security Agency that indicated the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron variant. This increases the effectiveness of pre-departure testing as it is more likely to identify positive cases before travel, the government added. Covid cases have been rising in the UK since the beginning of November, with 43,992 recorded on Sunday. However, deaths and hospital admissions are falling. The UK recorded 54 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Sunday, although the number of deaths recorded over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays.
