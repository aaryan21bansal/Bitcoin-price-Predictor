Morrisons cuts petrol price to below Â£1 a litre,"The supermarket is cutting its petrol price to below Â£1 per litre across the UK Morrisons has become the first major retailer to cut the price of petrol to below the Â£1 per litre threshold at all of its forecourts across the UK. The move comes after oil prices fell to an 18-year low last month, with some questioning why it took retailers so long to pass on the saving. The AA said it hoped more retailers would follow Morrisons' move. The RAC said the lower price was ""much more reflective of what the retailer is itself paying to buy the fuel in"". Morrisons said for a typical 50-litre fill up, customers will save Â£4.50 compared to the current national average price of petrol. In April, some filling stations around the country had been reportedly offering petrol at less than Â£1, but this is thought to be the first time a national chain has sold petrol throughout the UK below the threshold since February 2016. Petrol prices head towards Â£1 in the UK Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? In January, the price of a barrel of Brent Crude had touched $70. By mid-March a price war between oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia led to increased production and pushed prices to fall to close to $30 a barrel. The oversupply of oil coincided with a steep drop in demand thanks to the global coronavirus pandemic which shut factories, grounded airline fleets and meant cars stayed in garages rather than out on the road. As these issues combined the price of Brent Crude - the benchmark used by Europe - fell to just above $20 a barrel - its lowest level since 2002. The AA said that reductions in the wholesale price of petrol many weeks ago should have brought the UK's average pump price down to Â£1 a litre already. During the lockdown, retailers told drivers that they needed to keep prices high to compensate for lower fuel volumes. However, on Sunday night Prime Minister Boris Johnson began encouraging more people to leave their homes, but avoid public transport, which is likely to see more cars on the road. AA spokesperson Luke Bosdet said: ""Drivers can only hope that Morrisons price move this morning will now break the logjam on pump prices. At least, essential workers will no longer feel penalised for having to drive to protect people and keep the country running during the lockdown."" Another factor propping up the price of fuel is that the biggest proportion of the money you hand over for a litre of petrol goes to the government in the form of tax. Fuel duty is charged at 57.95p per litre. On top of that, consumers also have to pay VAT at 20%. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? Why are petrol prices going back up?

PM plan: Questions and answers,"This is the start - the country's doors being edged open a crack. More time in the fresh air for exercise everywhere this week, and a timetable of a sort from Boris Johnson for an achingly gradual return to a recognisable life. In England at least, if you work in construction or manufacturing, or can't do your job from home, you'll be encouraged to go back to work as long as you can keep your distance from others this week. You'll be able, from Wednesday too, to take unlimited exercise; to meet one person from outside your own household as long as you stay two metres apart; you can go and sit in your local park, to sunbathe, or to take part in sport with others from your household. But importantly there will be NO change for the many people who are more vulnerable to the disease who are therefore ""shielding"". But progress beyond the next few days is a series of big ifs. The ambition is to start bringing back some primary school years from the start of June, but it depends how the outbreak progresses. The plan is for some secondary school pupils to be able to see their teachers occasionally before the end of the term. But there is no intention though to reopen them before the summer. There is a hope that from July, some parts of the hospitality trade might be able to open up. But don't take that to mean that pubs will be back in business - rather some limited firms that are able to trade outdoors could be allowed to return. ""If"" was the word the prime minister said again and again. The difficult reality for the government though, and for the public trying to understand what these next phases of the pandemic look like, is that different parts of our social life, different parts of the public sector, and different parts of the economy have to move at different paces because there are different levels of risk. But despite the prime minister's lengthy address there are as many questions raised as answered. Workers in some sectors have been advised to go to work on Monday but told to avoid public transport. What are employers meant to be telling their staff? What are workers meant to do if their only way of getting to work is by limited public transport? What should the parents of secondary school pupils do if they can go back to work, but their children have no prospect of a proper return? There was no mention of face coverings, even though the government has been talking about them being a possible part of their plans. Nor was there a fixed date or detail of when people travelling to the UK by plane will be asked to go into some kind of quarantine. Importantly for so many members of the public, there was vanishingly little detail of when people might be able to see their extended families again. And the prime minister's approach is also creating a very real political tension between Westminster and the devolved administrations. LOCKDOWN:How will it change now? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? With what are thought to be higher rates of the infection in Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have made no bones about their reluctance to move from the ""stay at home"" message. The governments have been trying to stick together in the last few weeks but there is very obvious division now - not just over the message and communication, but over the attitude to the workplace. Any clash like that creates confusion and uncertainty too. This is what the prime minister described as the ""sketch of a plan"" - sketches are rough, and can easily be rubbed out. And it's dependent, at every stage, on how this relatively unknown disease progresses throughout the country. On Monday a document of 50 pages or so will be published that will answer some of Sunday night's questions. The prime minister's statement was designed to try to reassure, to show the country that there is the beginning of a way out of this crisis. Yet it has prompted questions and provided only limited answers. Doubts about Downing Street's approach are spreading beyond the opposition, with one normally loyal senior MP saying: ""The backbenches are getting restless; the PM needs to lead.""

Branson to sell Galactic stake to prop up Virgin,"Sir Richard Branson is selling a stake in Virgin Galactic to raise $500m to prop up his other businesses including Virgin Atlantic. The billionaire has been criticised for seeking financial help from the taxpayer for the airline. Sir Richard will now sell a share of his space tourism business. Virgin Group said it will use the proceeds to support its ""leisure, holiday and travel businesses"" hit by ""the unprecedented impact"" of Covid-19. Branson offers Caribbean island to secure Virgin bailout Virgin Australia slumps into administration Virgin Atlantic said last week it wouldcut more than 3,000 jobsand end its operation at Gatwick. Virgin's Australian airline entered administration last month. The airline industry has been struggling as the coronavirus pandemic brought global travel almost to a halt. Coronavirus-related travel restrictions has seen airlines cancel thousands of flights In April, Sir Richard - who owns 51% of Virgin Atlantic - offered to put his luxury Necker Island resort up as collateral to secure a UK government loan, believed to be around Â£500m. Those talks with the government are continuing. But Virgin Atlantic, which is a private company, has been focusing on discussions with investors. It was reported at the weekend that potential investors include private equity firms Greybull Capital, which came under scrutinyafter the collapse of British Steel, and Apollo Global Management. In March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak wrote to airlinesand airports urging them to find other forms of funding, and that the government would only step in as ""a last resort"" during the coronavirus crisis. The airline has also lined up restructuring specialists Alvarez and Marsal to draw up contingency plans in case of insolvency.

"Non-essential trips to Scotland 'could break law'Nicola Sturgeon says people in Scotland should only be out of their homes for ""essential reasons"".ScotlandComments","This video can not be played Coronavirus: âItâs getting harder but letâs keep supporting each otherâ People who travel to Scotland for anything other than essential purposes are ""potentially in breach of the law"", Nicola Sturgeon has said. The Scottish first minster said there was no need for ""confusion"", even as different lockdown rules come into effect in different parts of the UK. Boris Johnson has urged more people to return to work as part of a plan to gradually ease restrictions in England. But Ms Sturgeon said that in Scotland, ""lockdown remains in place for now"". She said: ""If you are in Scotland, then the law in Scotland applies - and the law says that just now you can only be out of your own home for essential reasons."" And she stressed that ""it is not OK to drive into Scotland to beauty spots to visit places and for leisure"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland How lockdown rules differ between Scotland and England Are the borderlands UK's 'forgotten region'? The prime minister is to set out further details about his ""roadmap"" towards lifting the virus lockdown later on Monday, having unveiled the ""first careful steps"" in a television address on Sunday evening. He said people in England who cannot work from home should start to return to the workplace, while rules around outdoor exercise and recreation are to be eased. Ms Sturgeon said the law and guidance in Scotland had not changed, and said: ""I would hope all employers would respect that."" In a televised statement on Monday evening, she added that restrictions would ""gradually"" be relaxed as the infection rate falls - but said it was ""vital"" to do this carefully so as not to ""jeopardise"" progress made so far. Nicola Sturgeon urged people in England not to travel to Scottish beauty spots While people are now allowed to go out more than once a day for exercise, Scots are still expected to stay at home other than for essential work, to buy food or medicine, or for exercise. At her daily media briefing, the first minister was asked about people who live near the border with England. She said: ""If you live in the Scottish Borders and you come across the border to go to the supermarket, you would certainly not be breaking the law if you were getting food, that's an essential purpose. ""If you live just south of the border and you work in an essential job then equally that is perfectly legitimate. ""But if you are coming to Scotland and are not covered by those essential purposes, then you potentially would be in breach of the law."" Ms Sturgeon added: ""If you live in Scotland right now and you're not working at the moment, or working from home, then my advice is you should continue with that right now. We are not encouraging more people to go back to work right at the minute."" The first minister said she did not think there was any plan or need for ""increased policing"" at the border, but warned people in England not to travel to Scottish beauty spots for recreation. The UK government'sguidance paper,externalfor people in England states: ""When travelling to outdoor spaces, it is important that people respect the rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and do not travel to different parts of the UK where their intended activities there would be prohibited by legislation passed by the relevant devolved administration."" The four nations of the UK will not leave lockdown in lockstep as the UK government had wanted. Instead, Boris Johnson has decided to set the pace in England, accepting that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will proceed at the speeds their devolved governments judge is right. There were lots of questions for Nicola Sturgeon today about the science behind these different approaches and the practical difficulties divergence might cause. But I thought one of her most interesting answers stressed a continuing search for convergence and clarity in what could become an increasingly confusing situation. The first minister said she was ""very open"" to considering the UK government's proposals for England with an interest in adopting the same ""system of phasing"" for lifting lockdown, if not the same timetable. Separately, the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has told me he hopes that as Scotland continues to suppress coronavirus it might be able to ""catch up"" with the dates pencilled in for England. Getting all the governments of the UK to agree on everything has not proved possible - but attempts to coordinate between the four nations have not been abandoned. The UK government has accepted that there could be ""modest divergences"" as ""different parts of the UK move at slightly different speeds"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabtold BBC Scotlandthat ""we will see different nations move at slightly different speeds, and that's reflective of the fact that the prevalence and the transmission rate of the virus is at different stages in different parts of the UK"". Ms Sturgeon also said the fact that Scotland could be on a ""slightly different timeline"" to the rest of the UK was not ""for any political reason"". She said it was because ""the Scottish government is not yet confident that these changes can be made safely in Scotland yet, without running the risk of the virus potentially running out of control again"". The first minister said the rate at which the virus was spreading - the ""R number"" - was still ""slightly higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK on average"", justifying differing approaches. She said: ""Moving at different speeds in different parts of the UK, for good evidence based reasons, need not be a cause for confusion. ""Confusion only arises if we as politicians, and the media who report on us, are either unclear in what we are asking people to do, or if we give a misleading impression, even by omission, that decisions that apply to one nation only are actually UK-wide.""

Dunn crash suspect 'wanted internationally',"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The suspect in the crash which killed Harry Dunn is ""wanted internationally"", a family spokesman said. Mr Dunn 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August and US national Anne Sacoolas is suspected of causing his death by dangerous driving. A Home Office extradition request was rejected by the US in January. A family spokesman said Northants Police had told them Mrs Sacoolas was ""wanted"" but the force denied saying an Interpol Red Notice had been issued. Mr Dunn's parents received an email from police stating that ""wanted circulations should be enacted"" if Mrs Sacoolas left the US, according to the spokesman. He said this had led the family to believe an Interpol Red Notice had been issued. Reacting to the news, Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said: ""It's been a terrible time for us. We are utterly bereft and heartbroken and miss our Harry every minute of every single day."" She said the latest development was ""important news"" and the family were ""in pieces"". ""I just want to urge Mrs Sacoolas to come back to the UK and do the right thing,"" she said. ""Face justice and maybe then our two families can come together after the tragedy and build a bridge."" Motorcyclist Mr Dunn died in a crash with a car near US military base RAF Croughton on 27 August. Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official, claimed diplomatic immunity and returned home. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton The 42-year-old was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December, but an extradition request was rejected. In a statement, Northamptonshire Police said: ""We wish to make it absolutely clear that, at no point, has Northamptonshire Police informed the family spokesperson for the Dunns, Radd Seiger, that an Interpol Red Notice has been issued in respect of Mrs Anne Sacoolas. ""Given that this remains a live case it would be inappropriate to comment further. However, Northamptonshire Police continues to support the Dunn family at this difficult time."" Interpol said it would not confirm whether a red notice had been issued. An Interpol Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. On its website, Interpol states a red notice ""is an international wanted persons notice, but it is not an arrest warrant"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the government had ""worked throughout to try to get justice for Harry Dunn and his family and we have been clear throughout that Ann Sacoolas should return to the UK to face justice"". He said the UK Government had made it clear to the United States and to President Donald Trump that it considered the rejection of an extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas to be "" a denial of justice"". Update 14 May 2020: This story has been updated to reflect a Northamptonshire Police statement issued on 13 May in which the force denied informing the family that an Interpol Red Notice had been issued.

Plan to ease NI lockdown 'over five stages',"The executive has already extended lockdown in NI until 28 May The executive intends to publish a five-stage plan on Tuesday that will set out a slow easing of NI's lockdown. Ministers have been discussing a blueprint, which will not include projected dates, for lifting some restrictions. Setting ""arbitrary timeframes"" would be unhelpful, said junior minister Declan Kearney. Downing Street haspublished a conditional plan to ease lockdown,external, but it mostly applies only in England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own powers to set and lift restrictions at different rates. Speaking at the executive's daily press conference, Sinn FÃ©in's Mr Kearney said discussions on Monday had been detailed and positive, but ""further work is needed in the next 24 hours"". If the plan is signed off by the executive, the first and deputy first ministers are expected to bring it to the assembly on Tuesday for debate. The focus on a recovery plan comes asthree more Covid-19 related deaths have been recorded,externalby the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, taking its total, mostly comprising of hospital deaths, to 438. However, that figure is likely to be higher when all fatalities in the community are recorded. Ministers have said that unlike in England, where Boris Johnson has placed projected dates next to different phases of easing the lockdown, that will not happen in Northern Ireland. ""At any given moment in time we will be operating a staged approach with a three-weekly interval,"" said Mr Kearney. Executive ministers have said people in Northern Ireland should still stay at home as much as possible The executive wants ""sufficient flexibility"" to allow it to make modifications in line with scientific advice, as opposed to setting targeted dates that may need to be pushed back if there is another spike in cases. There will likely only be ""minor changes"" announced by the executive to take effect this week, on issues such as outdoor exercise and potentially some churches being allowed to facilitate individual prayer. Each step will be ""incremental and cautious"", said DUP junior minister Gordon Lyons. ""Social distancing is going to be with us for a very long time. ""Just as it has become a reality of how we shop, it will be a reality of how we work together, study together, socialise and even how we worship - it would be a grave mistake to assume we have beaten Covid-19."" Aphased return of schools is not likely until September. The executive is aware that while its own roadmap may differ from that announced by Downing Street, Northern Ireland is still reliant on Westminster for some financial support. Manybusinesses in NI have availed of the government's furlough scheme, allowing employers to temporarily lay off staff while the government pays 80% of their wages during the crisis. As the infection has spread at different rates in various parts of the UK, Stormont ministers have said Northern Ireland must follow its own criteria and scientific advice. The R-value - or reproduction number- is at the heart of the executive's decision to extend the lockdown until at least the end of May. The R-number shows how many people will get infected for every one person who gets ill. In Northern Ireland, the R-rate is sitting just below one, at 0.8-0.9, and the executive has said it must remain at a low level before restrictions can begin to be lifted. Ministers have already extended the lockdown until 28 May, so the earliest the recovery plan could take effect from would be the beginning of June. In England, fines for breaking lockdown rules will increase to Â£100 from Wednesday - but the executive has not yet decided if it will follow this approach. The Irish government hasalready announced a detailed planfor bringing the Republic of Ireland slowly out of lockdown. It also has five stages, with the first beginning on 18 May and the last phase by 10 August, if the spread of the virus is contained. The promenade in Blackrock, County Louth, which is close to the Irish border Phase one includes the reopening of golf courses on a restricted basis, and outdoor meetings between people from different households. There are questions about how the Republic of Ireland's plan fits with what the NI Executive will announce. The two jurisdictions share a 310-mile long border which people cross each day for work or leisure. At the beginning of the lockdown, it emerged that gardaÃ­ (Irish police)had been informed they had no enforcement powersover people from Northern Ireland, who may have breached Covid-19 regulations in the Republic of Ireland. There have been calls for testing to be increased further across Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has been working to increase its testing capacity sincethe first case of the virus was confirmedin February. Health officials say capacity has grown from 40 tests a day, to more than 2,000 tests now, withanother laboratory due to start workthis week. However, testing remains limited to people who are being admitted to hospital, live in care homes or are essential workers. In care homes, wherealmost half of Covid-19 deaths have been recordedso far, residents and staff are only tested where there is a suspected outbreak, or if they are new entrants to the care home sector. It is not clear when the Executive intends to move to wider testing within the community. There is a considerable difference in the death tolls in the two sets of figures published in Northern Ireland. While the Northern Ireland Statistical Research Agency recorded 516 deaths by 1 May, the Department of Health - which records deaths of patients who tested positive for coronavirus, and therefore mostly died in hospital - had recorded365 deathsby the same date. Nisra's toll is 35% higher because its weekly bulletin, released each Friday, records all fatalities with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate, regardless of where the individual died and whether or not they had been tested for the virus. So although the health department confirmed three more deaths on Sunday, taking its toll to 438, the overall death toll will be significantly higher. The disparity between the two sets of figures has caused confusion, but the department said there was always a time lag for registering deaths in the community - which can take five days - so Nisra's report could not feasibly be linked to the daily figures. Nisra's report on Friday showed there were 27 patients in intensive care with Covid-19 symptoms, compared to 58 a month ago. Although comparisons between countries and regions are difficult due to differences in how statistics are compiled, Northern Ireland's death rate (27 per 100,000 of the population) is similar to that of the Republic of Ireland (29 per 100,000) and significantly lower than that of Great Britain (43 per 100,000). A further 210 coronavirus-related deaths were confirmed across the UK on Monday, taking the total to 32,065. The Republic of Ireland announced a further 12 deaths on Sunday, bringing its overall death toll to 1,458. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Executive ministers have said people in Northern Ireland should still stay at home as much as possible The executive wants ""sufficient flexibility"" to allow it to make modifications in line with scientific advice, as opposed to setting targeted dates that may need to be pushed back if there is another spike in cases. There will likely only be ""minor changes"" announced by the executive to take effect this week, on issues such as outdoor exercise and potentially some churches being allowed to facilitate individual prayer. Each step will be ""incremental and cautious"", said DUP junior minister Gordon Lyons. ""Social distancing is going to be with us for a very long time. ""Just as it has become a reality of how we shop, it will be a reality of how we work together, study together, socialise and even how we worship - it would be a grave mistake to assume we have beaten Covid-19."" Aphased return of schools is not likely until September. The executive is aware that while its own roadmap may differ from that announced by Downing Street, Northern Ireland is still reliant on Westminster for some financial support. Manybusinesses in NI have availed of the government's furlough scheme, allowing employers to temporarily lay off staff while the government pays 80% of their wages during the crisis. As the infection has spread at different rates in various parts of the UK, Stormont ministers have said Northern Ireland must follow its own criteria and scientific advice. The R-value - or reproduction number- is at the heart of the executive's decision to extend the lockdown until at least the end of May. The R-number shows how many people will get infected for every one person who gets ill. In Northern Ireland, the R-rate is sitting just below one, at 0.8-0.9, and the executive has said it must remain at a low level before restrictions can begin to be lifted. Ministers have already extended the lockdown until 28 May, so the earliest the recovery plan could take effect from would be the beginning of June. In England, fines for breaking lockdown rules will increase to Â£100 from Wednesday - but the executive has not yet decided if it will follow this approach. The Irish government hasalready announced a detailed planfor bringing the Republic of Ireland slowly out of lockdown. It also has five stages, with the first beginning on 18 May and the last phase by 10 August, if the spread of the virus is contained. The promenade in Blackrock, County Louth, which is close to the Irish border Phase one includes the reopening of golf courses on a restricted basis, and outdoor meetings between people from different households. There are questions about how the Republic of Ireland's plan fits with what the NI Executive will announce. The two jurisdictions share a 310-mile long border which people cross each day for work or leisure. At the beginning of the lockdown, it emerged that gardaÃ­ (Irish police)had been informed they had no enforcement powersover people from Northern Ireland, who may have breached Covid-19 regulations in the Republic of Ireland. There have been calls for testing to be increased further across Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has been working to increase its testing capacity sincethe first case of the virus was confirmedin February. Health officials say capacity has grown from 40 tests a day, to more than 2,000 tests now, withanother laboratory due to start workthis week. However, testing remains limited to people who are being admitted to hospital, live in care homes or are essential workers. In care homes, wherealmost half of Covid-19 deaths have been recordedso far, residents and staff are only tested where there is a suspected outbreak, or if they are new entrants to the care home sector. It is not clear when the Executive intends to move to wider testing within the community. There is a considerable difference in the death tolls in the two sets of figures published in Northern Ireland. While the Northern Ireland Statistical Research Agency recorded 516 deaths by 1 May, the Department of Health - which records deaths of patients who tested positive for coronavirus, and therefore mostly died in hospital - had recorded365 deathsby the same date. Nisra's toll is 35% higher because its weekly bulletin, released each Friday, records all fatalities with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate, regardless of where the individual died and whether or not they had been tested for the virus. So although the health department confirmed three more deaths on Sunday, taking its toll to 438, the overall death toll will be significantly higher. The disparity between the two sets of figures has caused confusion, but the department said there was always a time lag for registering deaths in the community - which can take five days - so Nisra's report could not feasibly be linked to the daily figures. Nisra's report on Friday showed there were 27 patients in intensive care with Covid-19 symptoms, compared to 58 a month ago. Although comparisons between countries and regions are difficult due to differences in how statistics are compiled, Northern Ireland's death rate (27 per 100,000 of the population) is similar to that of the Republic of Ireland (29 per 100,000) and significantly lower than that of Great Britain (43 per 100,000). A further 210 coronavirus-related deaths were confirmed across the UK on Monday, taking the total to 32,065. The Republic of Ireland announced a further 12 deaths on Sunday, bringing its overall death toll to 1,458. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

We're wrapping up the live page for today but before we go, here's a round-up of Monday's main developments:  Our coverage was brought to you by Jasmine Coleman-Taylor, Sean Fanning, Sophie Williams,  Lauren Turner, Thom Poole, Hugo Bachega, Yaroslav Lukov, Doug Faulkner, Frank Keogh, Matt Henry, Justin Parkinson,
Kate Whannel, Alex Bysouth, Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Andreas Illmer, and Tessa Wong. Twitter has said it started highlighting messages that contain ""disputed or misleading information related to Covid-19"". The social media company said in a statement,externalthat ""new labels and warning messages"" would provide ""additional context and information"" to some of such tweets. They would be used in cases where the risk of harm is not so great that the tweets would have to be removed. But the company said it wouldnât be directly fact-checking tweets or calling the highlighted ones false, stressing its users didnât want it to decide what was true and what wasnât. Social media platforms have been under pressure to take action against coronavirus misinformation, ranging from conspiracy theories about its origins to advertisements for bogus treatments. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged the public to stick to social distancing rules, after the infection rate grew following a relaxation in social distancing. The national coronavirus reproduction number - or simply the R value - was higher than 1 for the third consecutive day, according to the Robert Koch Institute said. The number was 1.07 on Monday, meaning that 100 infected people were on average transmitting the virus to 107 others. The R rate must be held below 1 to
prevent health services from being overwhelmed and continue the gradual easing of restrictions. Germany is hailed by many experts as a success story in dealing with the outbreak. The country currently has nearly 170,000 confirmed infections, with more than 7,400 coronavirus-related deaths. Why R is the crucial number As we reported earlier, Trump says the US has ""prevailed"" in coronavirus testing - while the banners behind him at the press conference read: ""America leads the world in testing."" But is that true? Perhaps the fairest way of comparing different countries' testing is to look at how many tests they're carrying out per 1,000 people. This is because a country such as South Korea, whose population is smaller than a sixth of the US's, will need a lower overall testing capacity in order to control the virus. According to official figures collated by science publication Our World in Data, the US has currently tested26.31out of every 1,000 people. While this is higher than countries such as France and the UK, other nations are testing far more people per 1,000 than the US is. Portugal, which has been held up as an example of how early and widespread testing can help control the virus early, has tested47.66per 1,000 people. Israel, which recently increased its testing operation, has now tested50.35out of 1,000. Bahrain, meanwhile, has managed to test almost 10% of its population of just over 1.5m. President's Trump news conference ended abruptly after he clashed with reporters. He said during the briefing the US led the world on testing, but CBS White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked him why it was a ""global competition"" for him when Americans were dying. ""Go ask China,"" Trump said to Jiang, who is Asian-American. Jiang responded by asking Trump why he was personally telling her to speak to China, who replied he was saying it to anyone who would ask a ""nasty question like that"". He then refused to take questions from a CNN reporter, who had let Jiang ask follow-up questions, before thanking everyone there and walking off. Trump is asked if he was behind the White House memo today which requires anyone in the West Wing to wear a face mask. âYes I did, I required thatâ says President Trump, who has previously described himself as a germaphobe. Trump reportedly was furious when he found out his personal valet, who serves him his meals, tested positive for the virus. Trump was asked why he wants US businesses to reopen without testing easily available, while White House officials have testing on demand. ""If we didn't get the tests done you'd be up here complaining that we weren't getting the tests done,"" he said. ""You complain that we're getting too many tests,"" he added, ""so we can't win."" Trump says the US is now conducting 300,000 tests per day and will hit the 10m mark for total tests this week. According to the Covid Tracking Project, a non-profit charity, the US conducted an average of 248,000 daily tests in the first week of May. However, prominent public health researchers at Harvard University say at least 900,000 daily tests are needed before the US should reopen. As of this week, the US has tested only 2.75% of its 330m population, and no state has tested 10% of residents. In over a dozen states where lockdown measures have been relaxed, including Texas, South Carolina and Arizona, less than two percent of residents have been tested. Trump said in his opening address the US has ""prevailed"". Asked to clarify, the president says he was talking about the nation's testing capability. âYou never prevail
when you have the kind of death you are talking about,"" he said. ""We have done a great job on testing and it
is a big, important function. We have prevailed, we have the best equipment
anywhere in the world."" Asked about the White House staff who tested positive for coronavirus Trump said ""I donât think the system broke down at all"". ""One person tested positive, surprisingly, because the previous day they tested negative,"" he says. ""That's not breaking down. It's the hidden enemy. It's the hidden enemy, Let's remember that."" He adds that people have been going and coming from the White House only because they are essential workers. ""We're running a country,"" he said. US President Donald Trump says the country has increased the number of tests it conducts each day from 150,000 to 300,000. The total number of tests performed in the US passed nine million on Monday and is expected to reach 10 million later this week. The FDA has authorised 79 diagnostic tests on 25 different devices. It authorised the first antigen test on Friday and says 300,000 could be on the market within the next few weeks - such tests quickly detect whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus. Trump says that the US economy will improve in the coming months, a phase that he calls ""transitioning into greatness"". ""Next year we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had. Because it's a pent-up demand,"" he says, calling it ""a demand that weâve never seen"". Like most economies, the US has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic - last week unemployment claims since mid-March hit 33 million. Trump is speaking from the White House Rose Garden. He begins by touting US coronavirus testing, which he says is part of the plan to ""gradually and safely reopen America"", adding that many are very enthusiastic to get back to work. Trump's son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner has been seen wearing a mask as he watched the president speak. There have been more than four million cases of coronavirus recorded worldwide. The charts below show how the worst-hit European countries appear to have passed through the peak. However, Russia is alongside Brazil, Mexico and Peru as one of the countries where the death toll from the virus is rising fast. Below, we see that the number of new cases and deaths from the virus in the US appears to have also moved beyond its peak. The east coast - particularly New York state - is the hardest-hit area. The White House has sent a memo to staff directing more aides to wear masks when in the West Wing or avoid President Trump's office altogether if possible. The memo was obtained by US media moments before Trump is due to deliver remarks from the White House on the role of testing in the effort to reopen the country's economy. It also comes asthree high-ranking members of the White House coronavirus taskforce- including top disease expert Anthony Fauci - are in self-isolation after two White House staff members tested positive. According to US media, the latest White House memo on masks is unlikely to apply to Trump, who has so far not worn one during the pandemic. Trump aides are wearing masks in the White House Rose Garden Our colleague Anthony Zurcher is at the White House, where he says the number of Trump aides wearing masks has already risen since last week. He says all of the press aides are donning masks for Trump's briefing. Reality Check The health secretary set a target of 100,000 tests per day in the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government hit its daily testing target with 100,490 tests on Sunday. The target, set by Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month, was for 100,000 tests per day in the UK to diagnose coronavirus. The government said the figure was reached on 30 April and then 1 May - although there was some criticism about how tests were counted - but the target was then missed for eight consecutive days. Johnson has talked of raising the target further to 200,000 tests per day by the end of this month. We have been looking athow the government is getting on with seven of its coronavirus targets- including testing. Nduka OrjinmoBBC News, Lagos Prodest Home after bulldozers ripped through part of the hotel The authorities in Nigeria's oil-rich southern Rivers state have demolished two hotels over an alleged breach of lockdown rules intended to contain the spread of coronavirus. State Governor Nyesom Wike, who supervised the tearing down of Edemete Hotel and Prodest Home on Sunday, said the operators had flouted an order that hotels should be closed. He said people who had tested positive for the virus had been found in hotels across the state. But he did not say if anyone who had Covid-19 had been staying in either of the demolished hotels. Read the full story here. Reality Check Schools have been shut as part of the strategy to curb the spread of the virus The UK prime minister was asked about the childcare provision for people expected to go back to work before schools reopen. Boris Johnson says if people do not have access to childcare, it is only fair to see that as a barrier to their ability to go back to work. People who cannot work from home - such as those in the manufacturing and construction sectors - are being ""actively encouraged"" to return to work from Wednesday. But ministers say schools in England should prepare to begin to open for more pupils from 1 June, with only selected year groups - including Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - going back in smaller class sizes. Secondary schools and FE colleges are also being told to plan for some face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils. Read more about the timetable for schools reopening. The last question of the press conference concerned whether schools contribute to the infection rate. ""They
do contribute a certain amount, and this is what is being modelled carefully,"" replied Chris Whitty. ""We are very committed to publishing all of the science behind Sage. ""That is happening but never as fast as people want."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Non-essential trips to Scotland 'could break law',"This video can not be played Coronavirus: âItâs getting harder but letâs keep supporting each otherâ People who travel to Scotland for anything other than essential purposes are ""potentially in breach of the law"", Nicola Sturgeon has said. The Scottish first minster said there was no need for ""confusion"", even as different lockdown rules come into effect in different parts of the UK. Boris Johnson has urged more people to return to work as part of a plan to gradually ease restrictions in England. But Ms Sturgeon said that in Scotland, ""lockdown remains in place for now"". She said: ""If you are in Scotland, then the law in Scotland applies - and the law says that just now you can only be out of your own home for essential reasons."" And she stressed that ""it is not OK to drive into Scotland to beauty spots to visit places and for leisure"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland How lockdown rules differ between Scotland and England Are the borderlands UK's 'forgotten region'? The prime minister is to set out further details about his ""roadmap"" towards lifting the virus lockdown later on Monday, having unveiled the ""first careful steps"" in a television address on Sunday evening. He said people in England who cannot work from home should start to return to the workplace, while rules around outdoor exercise and recreation are to be eased. Ms Sturgeon said the law and guidance in Scotland had not changed, and said: ""I would hope all employers would respect that."" In a televised statement on Monday evening, she added that restrictions would ""gradually"" be relaxed as the infection rate falls - but said it was ""vital"" to do this carefully so as not to ""jeopardise"" progress made so far. Nicola Sturgeon urged people in England not to travel to Scottish beauty spots While people are now allowed to go out more than once a day for exercise, Scots are still expected to stay at home other than for essential work, to buy food or medicine, or for exercise. At her daily media briefing, the first minister was asked about people who live near the border with England. She said: ""If you live in the Scottish Borders and you come across the border to go to the supermarket, you would certainly not be breaking the law if you were getting food, that's an essential purpose. ""If you live just south of the border and you work in an essential job then equally that is perfectly legitimate. ""But if you are coming to Scotland and are not covered by those essential purposes, then you potentially would be in breach of the law."" Ms Sturgeon added: ""If you live in Scotland right now and you're not working at the moment, or working from home, then my advice is you should continue with that right now. We are not encouraging more people to go back to work right at the minute."" The first minister said she did not think there was any plan or need for ""increased policing"" at the border, but warned people in England not to travel to Scottish beauty spots for recreation. The UK government'sguidance paper,externalfor people in England states: ""When travelling to outdoor spaces, it is important that people respect the rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and do not travel to different parts of the UK where their intended activities there would be prohibited by legislation passed by the relevant devolved administration."" The four nations of the UK will not leave lockdown in lockstep as the UK government had wanted. Instead, Boris Johnson has decided to set the pace in England, accepting that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will proceed at the speeds their devolved governments judge is right. There were lots of questions for Nicola Sturgeon today about the science behind these different approaches and the practical difficulties divergence might cause. But I thought one of her most interesting answers stressed a continuing search for convergence and clarity in what could become an increasingly confusing situation. The first minister said she was ""very open"" to considering the UK government's proposals for England with an interest in adopting the same ""system of phasing"" for lifting lockdown, if not the same timetable. Separately, the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has told me he hopes that as Scotland continues to suppress coronavirus it might be able to ""catch up"" with the dates pencilled in for England. Getting all the governments of the UK to agree on everything has not proved possible - but attempts to coordinate between the four nations have not been abandoned. The UK government has accepted that there could be ""modest divergences"" as ""different parts of the UK move at slightly different speeds"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabtold BBC Scotlandthat ""we will see different nations move at slightly different speeds, and that's reflective of the fact that the prevalence and the transmission rate of the virus is at different stages in different parts of the UK"". Ms Sturgeon also said the fact that Scotland could be on a ""slightly different timeline"" to the rest of the UK was not ""for any political reason"". She said it was because ""the Scottish government is not yet confident that these changes can be made safely in Scotland yet, without running the risk of the virus potentially running out of control again"". The first minister said the rate at which the virus was spreading - the ""R number"" - was still ""slightly higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK on average"", justifying differing approaches. She said: ""Moving at different speeds in different parts of the UK, for good evidence based reasons, need not be a cause for confusion. ""Confusion only arises if we as politicians, and the media who report on us, are either unclear in what we are asking people to do, or if we give a misleading impression, even by omission, that decisions that apply to one nation only are actually UK-wide.""

PM 'not expecting' flood of people back to work,"This video can not be played ""Employers will not be allowed to get away with forcing people to work in conditions that are not Covid-secure"" A ""sudden big flood"" of people returning to work is not expected after the release of new coronavirus guidance, Boris Johnson has said. The PM said measures, including encouraging people in England to return to work if safe, were ""baby steps"". He also said employers should be sympathetic to workers who do not have access to childcare. It came as new rules said people in England can soon meet one person from outside their household, at a distance. From Wednesday, people can socialise in open spaces or play one-to-one sport such as tennis with another person, as long as they stay 2m apart. Mr Johnson used Monday's daily Downing Street briefing to clarify hisreturn to work message,saying employers would need to prove they met a new safety standard, dubbed ""Covid secure"". He said: ""I don't think any of us expect that tomorrow or for the rest of this week there is going to be a sudden big flood of people back to work. ""I think a lot of people will now start to think whether they fall into that category, whether they could think about going back to work."" He told people in England their workplaces ""must be safe, must be Covid secure and employers will not be allowed to get away with forcing people to work in conditions that are not Covid secure"". ""Everyone must obey social distancing and we're going to have a lot more inspections by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), we'll have a random spot inspections to check that companies are doing the right thing,"" he said. ""If people find themselves in conditions that they think are unsafe, then they should immediately report it and we will take action, and that goes for all work."" It comes as a further 210 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus,taking the total number of deaths recorded to 32,065,external. After eight days of missing its goal of 100,000 tests a day, on Monday the government counted 100,490 tests on 10 May. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told the Downing Street briefing that Office for National Statistics data suggests an estimated 136,000 people were currently infected with coronavirus in the UK. He said the amount of time it may take for this number to halve is around two weeks on current infection rates. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Earlier, the government published newguidance for the public,external, as well asa lengthy strategy document,external, on the next steps in its coronavirus response in England. The information includes new advice for people in England to wear face coverings while on public transport and in some shops. It also set out how, from Wednesday, people in England will be allowed to meet one person from outside their household as long as they stay outdoors and stay 2m apart. Sage, the government's group of scientific advisers, said the risk of infection outside is significantly lower than inside, according to the strategy document. Mr Johnson told Parliament the public should exercise ""good, solid, British common sense"" in adapting their lives to the next phase of the coronavirus response. Scotland: Non-essential trips 'could break law' NI: Plan to ease lockdown 'over five stages' Wales: 'Do not drive from England to exercise' But Mr Johnson defended the differing approaches between the UK nations after leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said ""stay at home"" messages remained in place there. ""For those who think that the 'stay alert' is not the right message, I think it is absolutely the right message for our country now,"" he said. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have devolved powers over their own lockdown restrictions. It comes as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy releasednew guidance for UK employers,externalon how to implement social distancing measures, with eight separate documents published for sectors which can now reopen. What are the new rules? Who am I allowed to meet now? How to make your own face mask The HSE has been given Â£14m in funding for extra call-centre workers, inspectors and equipment. The guidance for employers says they could be Covid secure by re-designing workplaces with 2 metre (6ft) distances in mind, staggering start times, building one-way systems and publishing detailed risk assessments. The Trades Union Congress said the new guidelines were ""a step in the right direction"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used an official response to the PM's coronavirus address on Sunday to urge further clarity and reassurance for workers and parents that returning to work and school would be safe. This video can not be played In a recorded statement, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK couldn't ""go back to business as usual"" after coronavirus The new guidance said the government's ambition was for all primary school children in England to return to school for a month before the summer. Childminders in England will also be permitted to look after children again. Fresh guidance published for primary schools on Monday nightsaid class sizes should be limited to 15and drop-off and pick-up times staggered when they are able to return. Asked during the Downing Street briefing what people should do in the meantime if they do not have access to childcare and cannot work from home, Mr Johnson said he was sure employers would be understanding. ""If people don't have access to childcare and they have a child who isn't back in school then I think that's only fair to regard that as an obvious barrier to their ability to go back to work and I am sure employers will agree with that,"" he said. The PM told Parliament the government's ""roadmap"" would help control Covid-19 Meanwhile, the guidance confirmed garden centres will also be able to reopen on Wednesday with distancing measures in place. It is likely that the government will continue to advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to continue to shield beyond June, the strategy document added. The 60-page document also said: People in England can drive to any outdoor open space in the country - but not to other UK nations whose rules should be respected Healthy people aged 70 and over should take particular care to minimise contact with others - even if they have not been advised to shield by the NHS Clothes should be washed regularly if people work with others outside of their household Doors and windows should be left open in places where people from different households interact A ""rapid re-engineering of government's structures and institutions"" is needed to deal with Covid-19 Fines for those who do not follow the rules in Englandwill increase from Â£60 to Â£100 from Wednesday, with maximum total penalties for repeat offenders of Â£3,200. Speaking about potential future measures, Mr Johnson told MPs the government was exploring how to safely allow people to expand their household to include one other ""on a strictly reciprocal basis"". The new guidance also reflected the government's three-step plan, announced by the PM on Sunday night. CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Fact or fiction?

Care-worker death rate twice that of health workers,"People working in social care in England and Wales have been twice as likely to die with coronavirus as the general working-age population, Office for National Statistics figures show. But healthcare workers have been no more likely to die than other workers. Nearly two-thirds of the 2,494 20- to 64-year-olds whose deaths were linked to Covid-19 were men. And 63 were male security guards, making them almost twice as likely to die as even men working in social care. The ONS analysis,external, up to 20 April, factored in age but did not take account of people's ethnicity, location, wealth or underlying health conditions. As a result, it cannot prove the deaths were caused by the jobs people do or by other factors. Being male, from an ethnic minority and having other health problems increase the risk of dying with Covid-19. Of the 2,494 deaths analysed, 131 were care workers - 86 female and 45 male. But because many more social care workers are female, this equates to a death rate of 23.4 per 100,000 for men and 9.6 per 100,000 for women. However, despite their close proximity to patients, healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, had much lower death rates. This may be because they had better access to personal protective equipment (PPE) than other workers. Remembering 100 NHS workers who have died The overall death rate for men aged 20-64 in England and Wales linked to Covid-19 was 9.9 deaths per 100,000, compared with 5.2 for women. For male security guards, it was 45.7. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

"Cover faces in enclosed areas, people in England urged","People in England should now aim to wear face coverings on public transport and in some shops, the UK government has said. A document outlining new coronavirus lockdown rules,externalsuggests face coverings for enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible. That advice had already been recommended by the governmentsin ScotlandandNorthern Ireland. People are also allowed to meet one person from another household outside. It came after Boris Johnson announced on Sunday a ""conditional plan"" to begin lifting England's coronavirus lockdown. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own powers over the lockdown and have not lifted measures to the same extent. The PMled the government's daily Downing Street briefingafter appearing before MPs in the House of Commons. Mr Johnson told Parliament the ""roadmap"" for lifting the lockdown would enable the country to ""control"" the disease if people continue to follow the rules. What are the new rules? Who am I allowed to meet now? How to make your own face mask Are you going back to work today? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external He said the public should exercise ""good, solid, British common sense"" in adapting their lives to the next phase of the coronavirus response. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons the country needed more ""clarity and reassurance"" from the government, and that ""both are in pretty short supply"". He later added: ""The prime minister said he was setting out a roadmap, but if we're to complete the journey safely a road map needs clear directions. So many of us have questions that need answering."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the UK cannot ""go back to business as usual"" after dealing with coronavirus. It comes as a further 210 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus,taking the total number of deaths recorded to 32,065,external. After eight days of missing its goal of 100,000 tests a day, on Monday the government counted 100,490 tests on 10 May. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told the Downing Street briefing that Office for National Statistics data suggests an estimated 136,000 people are currently infected with coronavirus in the UK. He said the amount of time it may take for this number to halve is around two weeks on current infection rates. The government published a 50-page document on Monday afternoon, alongsidenew guidance for the public,external, setting out more details of its planned timetable for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. The PM said the government's ""roadmap"" would help control Covid-19 ""As more people return to work, there will be more movement outside people's immediate household,"" the guidance says. ""This increased mobility means the government is now advising that people should aim to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops."" The new guidance makes clear that a face covering is not the same as face masks, such as those worn by healthcare workers which ""must continue to be reserved for those who need it"". Public Health England has publishedan online guide, detailing how to make a cloth face covering.,external LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Other countries have already introduced rules about wearing face masks, however the government in Wales said it was not going to make wearing face coverings mandatory. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the evidence was ""not strong enough for that"", but people could choose to wear them if they wished. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy haspublished guidance for companies,external""to help them get their businesses back up and running and workplaces operating as safely as possible"". It features a number of suggestions, including carrying out a workplace risk assessment with trade unions, maintaining a 2m distance wherever possible, and ""reinforcing"" cleaning practices. As we gradually move out of lockdown, we are going to have to accept we are living with more risk than we once were. There is, after all, a virus circulating - that is infectious and can be deadly. The government is taking steps to try to minimise that risk (and of course there is plenty of debate whether it is doing a good job) as well as asking us to play our part by following the guidance, not just for the sake of our own health but also the health of others. But how high is the individual risk? What's become clear since coronavirus emerged is that the most at risk are those with vulnerabilities. Latest data suggests 1% of deaths in hospital in England involve people under 60 with no underlying health condition. Factor in the care home deaths, which are accounting for growing numbers of fatalities, and the overall proportion will be even lower. That is why the government is asking those with health conditions to be more stringent, including for some, continued isolation, which is incredibly tough to do. But for the ""healthy population"" it is clear the personal risk of dying is incredibly low. The younger you are, the lower the risk. For the under-25s, statisticians have likened it to the risk they would face from dying from several days of normal life - there is always the chance you could have an accident or suddenly die. But it is not zero - and that too can be difficult to live with when we are so aware of it. From Wednesday, people in England will also be allowed to meet one person from outside their household as long as they stay outdoors and stay 2m apart, the advice says. Sage, the government's group of scientific advisers, says the risk of infection outside is significantly lower than inside, according to the document. The guidance also said the government's ambition was for all primary school children in England to return to school for a month before the summer. But asked during the Downing Street briefing what people should do if they do not have access to childcare and cannot work from home, Mr Johnson said he was sure employers would be understanding. ""If people don't have access to childcare and they have a child who isn't back in school then I think that's only fair to regard that as an obvious barrier to their ability to go back to work and I am sure employers will agree with that,"" he said. Meanwhile, the new guidance confirmed garden centres will also be able to reopen on Wednesday with distancing measures in place. It is likely that the government will continue to advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to continue to shield beyond June, the document adds. And the document also says: People in England can drive to any outdoor open space in the country - but not to other UK nations Team sports should not be played - but people can exercise with up to one person from outside their household Healthy people aged 70 and over should take particular care to minimise contact with others - even if they have not been advised to shield by the NHS Clothes should be washed regularly if people work with others outside of their household Doors and windows should be left open in places where people from different households come into contact There needs to be ""a rapid re-engineering of government's structures and institutions"" to deal with Covid-19 Fines for those who do not follow the rules in Englandwill increase from Â£60 to Â£100 from Wednesday, with maximum total penalties for repeat offenders of Â£3,200. Speaking about potential future measures, Mr Johnson told Parliament the government was exploring how to safely allow people to expand their household to include one other ""on a strictly reciprocal basis"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures"" The guidance also sets out the government's three-step plan, announced by the PM on Sunday night. All dates could be delayed if not enough progress is made in tackling the virus - and restrictions could be reintroduced, the guidance says. CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Fact or fiction?

How is lockdown being lifted across Europe?,"Face masks are an increasingly common sight throughout Europe Across Europe, lockdown measures are being lifted cautiously, in phases. Businesses are reopening and many children are back in school. Many of Europe's internal borders opened again in mid-June. Thenthe EU lifted external borders to some nationson 1 July, although member states can choose not to allow in travellers from these countries. Here is how Europeans are emerging from life under lockdown. Borussia Dortmund (yellow) v Paderborn: Bundesliga football is behind closed doors Germanybegan reopening smaller shopsin April: in early May control of lifting the lockdown was handed to the 16 federal states. However, Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed that an ''emergency brake'' would be applied anywhere with a surge in new infections. A surge in cases linked to a meat processing plant near the town of GÃ¼tersloh causedregional authorities to reimpose local lockdownson 23 June. Foreign minister Heiko Maas lifteda travel banfor EU member states and specified European countries including the UK. Bundesliga football matchesresumed behind closed doors on 16 May - the first big European league to do so Shops of all sizeshave reopened with extra hygiene and social distancing Shops smaller than 800 sq m were allowed to open from 20 April, alongsidecar dealerships, bicycle shops and bookshops Schoolshave been partially reopened for young children and those taking exams - and the 16 states are moving towards reopening pre-school centres and schools at their own pace Land border controlswere lifted on 15 June Big public events likefestivals are banneduntil at least October Social distancingof 1.5m is required for the time being. What caused Germany's biggest virus outbreak? Italy imposed a strict and lengthy lockdown on 7 March - initially in the north, then nationwide - with a ban on walking or exercising more than 200m (656ft) from home. In early May, some restrictions were relaxed and people are now able to travel for longer distances, as well as visit their relatives in small numbers. On 3 June, Italy unilaterallyreopened its bordersand ended regional travel restrictions, and the country entered phase three of its lockdown lifting on 15 June. Cruises on Italian ships remain suspended.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own powers over the lockdown and have not lifted measures to the same extent. The PMled the government's daily Downing Street briefingafter appearing before MPs in the House of Commons. Mr Johnson told Parliament the ""roadmap"" for lifting the lockdown would enable the country to ""control"" the disease if people continue to follow the rules. What are the new rules?

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external He said the public should exercise ""good, solid, British common sense"" in adapting their lives to the next phase of the coronavirus response. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons the country needed more ""clarity and reassurance"" from the government, and that ""both are in pretty short supply"". He later added: ""The prime minister said he was setting out a roadmap, but if we're to complete the journey safely a road map needs clear directions. So many of us have questions that need answering."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the UK cannot ""go back to business as usual"" after dealing with coronavirus. It comes as a further 210 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus,taking the total number of deaths recorded to 32,065,external. After eight days of missing its goal of 100,000 tests a day, on Monday the government counted 100,490 tests on 10 May. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told the Downing Street briefing that Office for National Statistics data suggests an estimated 136,000 people are currently infected with coronavirus in the UK. He said the amount of time it may take for this number to halve is around two weeks on current infection rates. The government published a 50-page document on Monday afternoon, alongsidenew guidance for the public,external, setting out more details of its planned timetable for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. The PM said the government's ""roadmap"" would help control Covid-19 ""As more people return to work, there will be more movement outside people's immediate household,"" the guidance says. ""This increased mobility means the government is now advising that people should aim to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops."" The new guidance makes clear that a face covering is not the same as face masks, such as those worn by healthcare workers which ""must continue to be reserved for those who need it"".

EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the evidence was ""not strong enough for that"", but people could choose to wear them if they wished. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy haspublished guidance for companies,external""to help them get their businesses back up and running and workplaces operating as safely as possible"". It features a number of suggestions, including carrying out a workplace risk assessment with trade unions, maintaining a 2m distance wherever possible, and ""reinforcing"" cleaning practices. As we gradually move out of lockdown, we are going to have to accept we are living with more risk than we once were. There is, after all, a virus circulating - that is infectious and can be deadly. The government is taking steps to try to minimise that risk (and of course there is plenty of debate whether it is doing a good job) as well as asking us to play our part by following the guidance, not just for the sake of our own health but also the health of others. But how high is the individual risk? What's become clear since coronavirus emerged is that the most at risk are those with vulnerabilities. Latest data suggests 1% of deaths in hospital in England involve people under 60 with no underlying health condition. Factor in the care home deaths, which are accounting for growing numbers of fatalities, and the overall proportion will be even lower. That is why the government is asking those with health conditions to be more stringent, including for some, continued isolation, which is incredibly tough to do. But for the ""healthy population"" it is clear the personal risk of dying is incredibly low. The younger you are, the lower the risk. For the under-25s, statisticians have likened it to the risk they would face from dying from several days of normal life - there is always the chance you could have an accident or suddenly die. But it is not zero - and that too can be difficult to live with when we are so aware of it. From Wednesday, people in England will also be allowed to meet one person from outside their household as long as they stay outdoors and stay 2m apart, the advice says. Sage, the government's group of scientific advisers, says the risk of infection outside is significantly lower than inside, according to the document. The guidance also said the government's ambition was for all primary school children in England to return to school for a month before the summer. But asked during the Downing Street briefing what people should do if they do not have access to childcare and cannot work from home, Mr Johnson said he was sure employers would be understanding. ""If people don't have access to childcare and they have a child who isn't back in school then I think that's only fair to regard that as an obvious barrier to their ability to go back to work and I am sure employers will agree with that,"" he said. Meanwhile, the new guidance confirmed garden centres will also be able to reopen on Wednesday with distancing measures in place. It is likely that the government will continue to advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to continue to shield beyond June, the document adds. And the document also says: People in England can drive to any outdoor open space in the country - but not to other UK nations Team sports should not be played - but people can exercise with up to one person from outside their household Healthy people aged 70 and over should take particular care to minimise contact with others - even if they have not been advised to shield by the NHS Clothes should be washed regularly if people work with others outside of their household Doors and windows should be left open in places where people from different households come into contact There needs to be ""a rapid re-engineering of government's structures and institutions"" to deal with Covid-19 Fines for those who do not follow the rules in Englandwill increase from Â£60 to Â£100 from Wednesday, with maximum total penalties for repeat offenders of Â£3,200.

"P&O Ferries plans to make 1,100 staff redundant","More than 1,000 members of staff at P&O Ferries are set to be made redundant P&O Ferries has announced plans to make 1,100 of its staff redundant. The ferry operator, based in Dover, Kent, said the reduced number of vessels and downturn in business had forced its decision to lay off staff. A spokesperson for the firm said ""right-sizing"" the business was a necessary step to create a viable and sustainable P&O Ferries. The owners of P&O Ferries had previously stated the business neededÂ£257m in aid to avoid collapse. Natalie Elphicke MP has called on P&O's owners to ""stump up or sell to better owners"" Natalie Elphicke, MP for Dover and Deal, said the news was ""disappointing"" and urged P&O's owners to ""stump up or sell to better owners"". She said: ""Let's remember that P&O, which is owned by the Sovereign State of Dubai, has received millions of pounds of financial support from our government in recent weeks. There can be no doubt that Dubai has more than enough money to keep P&O going in full. ""It cannot be right for them to have taken millions of pounds from the hard-working British taxpayer in furlough and freight support payments and then decide to pull the rug."" In April, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem told the BBC the company had applied to the UK government for Â£150m. P&O Ferries is now working towards making 614 staff on the Dover to Calais line redundant, with a further 122 job losses on the lines between Hull and Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. The remainder are officers and shore-side staff on the same routes. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said it was ""utterly shameful"" P&O was kept afloat by the taxpayer. He said: ""This is an attack on British seafarers and crew, and the biggest fear is that these jobs will never return to Dover or Hull. ""But you can guarantee that P&O ferries will still be running passenger ferry services from those ports to protect their owner's profits at the country's expense."" P&O said a consultation period was now under way. It said: ""Since the beginning of the crisis, P&O Ferries has been working with its stakeholders to address the impact of the loss of the passenger business. ""It is now clear that right-sizing the business is necessary to create a viable and sustainable P&O Ferries to get through Covid-19."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

How to make your own face mask,"People across the country have to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. It is compulsory to wear one on public transport and in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, covering the nose and mouth, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown thatthe best materials to use,externalare tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands thoroughly or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth Avoid touching the mask, your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times Try not to keeping taking it off and putting it back on again, eg when going in and out of shops Store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them Wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent VIDEO: How to wear a face covering safely Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other guidance, such as social distancing and hand washing. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut-up sports socks. UK government: How to make a face covering,external Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly. When you have your mask, here are a few reminders of whatnotto do.

What do the new lockdown rules mean?,"This video can not be played ""We cannot let the virus take hold of our lives again"" Coronavirus restrictions in Wales are being tightened following a rise in cases. More than half of the population of Wales are now subject to tighter rules, with the Welsh Government announcing lockdowns for 11 counties and one town.

As well as licensed premises closing earlier, off-licences and supermarkets are now not allowed to sell alcohol after 22:00 and hospitality businesses will be required to provide table service only. People must wear face coverings in shops and other indoor public spaces. No more than six people can meet indoors under an extended household, comprised of up to four different households. Butextended households have been suspended in areas under local lockdown. Lockdown began to ease back in June withnon-essential shops reopeningandall children being able to return to school. Travel restrictions were then lifted on 6 Julyand people were allowed toform ""extended households"", with members of one other home. Self-contained accommodation,hairdressersandbeer gardenswere allowed to reopen a week later, and pubs, bars and cafes have since reopened indoors. On 22 August, people were allowed to form an ""exclusive extended arrangement"" with up to four households - double the previous amount allowed. Staff and pupils then returned to school and students started university in September. But a rise in cases sparked fears a second wave of the virus was on its way. What are the current rules and changes, and how do they apply? Social distancing in Llandudno, Conwy At the start of lockdown, strict rules meant people were unable to meet anyone who they did not live with, in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus. But as restrictions were eased and a travel ban was lifted, many of us were able to socialise again. This video can not be played Richard Bluck says he may not be able to hug his daughter until a vaccine is found The number of people able to meet indoors has been capped at six, although under-11s are not included in the six. These six people must be in an extended household - which can be comprised of four households. People in an extended household can have physical contact, exercise, cook and eat together, and also stay in each other's homes, but the people in the extended household cannot be changed once arranged. Up to 30 people are allowed to meet outdoors, including peoples' gardens. The rules on meeting indoors do not apply in areas which have been placed under local lockdown from September. Extended households are currently suspended in these areas. Despite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal. People must observe the 2m rule when meeting friends Groups of up to 30 are able to meet outdoors, so long as they maintain social distancing. You are able to meet in local parks, open spaces and private gardens, though you should not go into someone's home unless they are in your ""extended household"". The Welsh Government has acknowledged people may have to pass through someone's home to reach a private garden, but individuals have been told not to stay inside. Children under 11 do not have to maintain a 2m distance from each other or from adults because of lower rates of transmission in their age group. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading People in Wales were told to wear face coverings in shops and other indoor public spaces from 14 September, following other parts of the UK. Both customers and staff are legally required to wear face coverings in shops, shopping centres, places of worship, hairdressers and salons, cinemas and museums, gyms and leisure centres, and anywhere that is open to members of the public. But you will not be required to wear face coverings inside a public space where you are there to eat or drink, but you will need to wear one in the parts of the premises where people are not eating or drinking Masks will not be mandatory in workplaces or schools and children under 11 will not be required to wear them. Failing to comply could land you with a fine of up to Â£1,920. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? The original ""stay local"" guidance, asking people to stay within five miles of home, ended in July. But in his announcement on restrictions on 22 September, Mr Drakeford urged people to only take essential journeys. In local lockdown areas, people are not allowed to enter or leave the local authority area unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"". Excuses listed in the law include travelling to work if you are not able to work from home, to go to school, or to give care. You can travel to buy food and medical supplies, seek medical assistance or go to the vets, and move home. If you are buying essential items and there is no reasonable alternative to using shops within these counties, you can do so. However, in most cases there are expected to be alternative options, even if this involves travelling a bit further than you would normally. But people are advised tocheck the restrictions,externalwhen it comes to international travel and travel to other parts of the UK, as some areas have local lockdown restrictions, or are on a quarantine list. Service stations are not affected by local lockdowns and can still provide toilet facilities, fuel and food and drink. Pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants were forced to close at the start of lockdown. But beer gardens and outdoor seating have reopened, with some areas, including Cardiff, shutting roads to create alfresco dining space. Since 3 August, people have been able to enjoy a pint, or a soft drink or meal,indoors at their local or favourite restaurant again, after they were allowed to reopen inside. But after the announcement on 22 September, pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales have to shut at 22:00 every night, which is the same time alcohol sales will be stopped in shops and off-licences. This video can not be played The couple were due to celebrate tying the knot in front of 300 guests Couples can host receptions with food for up to 30 people indoors at weddings and civil ceremonies, if social distancing can be maintained and face coverings are worn. Funeral wakes were also be able to be held indoors, under the same rules. There are limits on the type of activity that can take place, according toWelsh Government guidance,external, including a ban on loud music and buffets. People from an area in local lockdown,such as Caerphilly,external, are allowed to attend wedding ceremonies and funerals outside the county, but not wedding receptions or wakes. Weddings and funerals are permitted in Caerphilly county, but people from outside the county must not attend the reception or wake. Most public toilets are managed by local councils and were closed during the height of the pandemic. While many have reopened, some remain closed, and the Welsh Government has said people should consider this when travelling. Rules on face coverings apply in public toilets. Unless you are part of an extended household, the guidance states you must not use someone else's bathroom, or kitchen, if you are visiting them in their garden. More than 120,000 people were told to self-isolate in Wales during the pandemic, meaning for months they were unable to have contact with relatives or go to the shops. But as restrictions were eased, those classed as high-risk, were allowed togo outside to exercise and meet others- at a 2m distance, but were advised not to go into someone else's home or share food with them. This was paused on 16 August, meaning people could see their loved ones again. Currently you are able to go for a walk, run or cycle as often as you want with people from a second household, as long as you are not in large groups and are at least 2m apart. People can also exercise in groups, with up to 30 people being allowed to play sport outside at once. This means exercise classes, team games such as cricket, and sports clubs can meet, but only if they are organised and supervised. Swimming pools, gyms and leisure centres have also been allowed to reopen. People in counties under lockdown can continue to exercise, but not with people from outside the county. Towns popular with tourists such as Tenby suffered from travel restrictions during lockdown You can book a holiday with members of your household or extended household in self-contained accommodation or hotels, B&Bs andcampsites with shared facilitiesin Wales. But you cannot currently go on holiday with anyone that is not part of your household or extended household. People under local lockdown restrictions are not allowed to leave the county, including to go on holiday elsewhere in Wales. This video can not be played Home hairdressing: The basic tips you need Many people were desperate for a cut, colour or to repair the damage done by doing it themselves by the time hairdressers and barbers reopenedon 13 July. But they are now very different places to those you could simply walk into, chat to friends or browse magazines. For a start, there are strict hygiene rules in place, with hairdressers only able to accept booked appointments. The same applies for visitors to tattooists, beauty and tanning salons, which were allowed to open from 27 July. Rules on face coverings apply in these premises. Following the local lockdowns in six areas of Wales, people can only visit such premises within the county area and must wear face coverings. This video can not be played Pupils at Olfcha Comprehensive get used to new systems at school It's back to school in Wales - but not quite as we knew it before. The ""new normal"" in classrooms means working in bubbles and limited contact with pupils outside their group. But parents and teachers have welcomed the staggered return following six months of disruption. Schools initiallywelcomed back pupils in small groupsfor ""check in, catch up and prepare"" sessions on 29 June after being closed for more than three months. Truancy fines will not be issued if pupils do not attendat the start of the school year, but this plan will be reviewed as the term develops. Dozens of schools have reported cases and entire year groups have self-isolated since the start of term, butEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said it was to be expected. Emergency plumbing is allowed if social distancing is maintained and tradesperson and householders are well Repair and maintenance work can be carried out in people's homes, provided the worker is well, has no Covid-19 symptoms andensures a 2m distance is maintained,external. The Welsh Government recommends no work should be carried out in a household which is isolated or where a vulnerable person is being shielded, unless an emergency repair is needed. Llandaff Cathedral is back open for private prayer During lockdown mosques, synagogues and churches were closed in Wales, and there have been limits on the number of people attending funerals and weddings. From 13 July faith leaders were able to gradually resume services, once they felt ready to do so safely. As discussed, places of worship are public spaces where the Welsh Government has said people should wear face coverings. If you are looking to move house, you can view homes for rent or sale in Wales - but you must follow social distancing rules and keep your hands clean. You can also visit estate agents, sales offices or show rooms, but must wear a face covering. Exercising on the beach at Llandudno People were previously told not to travel to second homes in order protect the smaller NHS hospitals in areas where most Welsh boltholes are situated. However, people can now ""travel as far as they like for all purposes"" according to Mr Drakeford, allowing people to visit second homes, providing they are not leaving, or travelling to, an area under local lockdown.

"P&O Ferries to make 1,100 staff redundant","More than 1,000 members of staff at P&O Ferries are set to be made redundant P&O Ferries has announced plans to make 1,100 of its staff redundant. The ferry operator, based in Dover, Kent, said the reduced number of vessels and downturn in business had forced its decision to lay off staff. A spokesperson for the firm said ""right-sizing"" the business was a necessary step to create a viable and sustainable P&O Ferries. The owners of P&O Ferries had previously stated the business neededÂ£257m in aid to avoid collapse. Natalie Elphicke MP has called on P&O's owners to ""stump up or sell to better owners"" Natalie Elphicke, MP for Dover and Deal, said the news was ""disappointing"" and urged P&O's owners to ""stump up or sell to better owners"". She said: ""Let's remember that P&O, which is owned by the Sovereign State of Dubai, has received millions of pounds of financial support from our government in recent weeks. There can be no doubt that Dubai has more than enough money to keep P&O going in full. ""It cannot be right for them to have taken millions of pounds from the hard-working British taxpayer in furlough and freight support payments and then decide to pull the rug."" In April, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem told the BBC the company had applied to the UK government for Â£150m. P&O Ferries is now working towards making 614 staff on the Dover to Calais line redundant, with a further 122 job losses on the lines between Hull and Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. The remainder are officers and shore-side staff on the same routes. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said it was ""utterly shameful"" P&O was kept afloat by the taxpayer. He said: ""This is an attack on British seafarers and crew, and the biggest fear is that these jobs will never return to Dover or Hull. ""But you can guarantee that P&O ferries will still be running passenger ferry services from those ports to protect their owner's profits at the country's expense."" P&O said a consultation period was now under way. It said: ""Since the beginning of the crisis, P&O Ferries has been working with its stakeholders to address the impact of the loss of the passenger business. ""It is now clear that right-sizing the business is necessary to create a viable and sustainable P&O Ferries to get through Covid-19."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Care-worker death rate twice that of health workersHealthcare workers have been no more likely to die with Covid-19 than other 20- to 64-year-olds.Health,"People working in social care in England and Wales have been twice as likely to die with coronavirus as the general working-age population, Office for National Statistics figures show. But healthcare workers have been no more likely to die than other workers. Nearly two-thirds of the 2,494 20- to 64-year-olds whose deaths were linked to Covid-19 were men. And 63 were male security guards, making them almost twice as likely to die as even men working in social care. The ONS analysis,external, up to 20 April, factored in age but did not take account of people's ethnicity, location, wealth or underlying health conditions. As a result, it cannot prove the deaths were caused by the jobs people do or by other factors. Being male, from an ethnic minority and having other health problems increase the risk of dying with Covid-19. Of the 2,494 deaths analysed, 131 were care workers - 86 female and 45 male. But because many more social care workers are female, this equates to a death rate of 23.4 per 100,000 for men and 9.6 per 100,000 for women. However, despite their close proximity to patients, healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, had much lower death rates. This may be because they had better access to personal protective equipment (PPE) than other workers. Remembering 100 NHS workers who have died The overall death rate for men aged 20-64 in England and Wales linked to Covid-19 was 9.9 deaths per 100,000, compared with 5.2 for women. For male security guards, it was 45.7. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? Among men, some specific occupations had noticeably higher death rates linked to Covid-19, including: taxi drivers and chauffeurs (36.4 deaths per 100,000) chefs (35.9) bus and coach drivers (26.4) sales and retail assistants (19.8) And men in low-skilled jobs were more likely to die with Covid-19 than other groups, including managers, skilled tradesmen and professionals. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, from the University of Southampton, said: ""The forthcoming guidance for safe working simply has to provide extensive detail on how each sector is expected to manage their staff and working environments."" Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the University of Nottingham, said the higher male death rates in many occupations could be ""contributing to the higher overall mortality in men"". ""The higher rate in the confined spaces of taxis and similar vehicles is consistent with what we know about indoor transmission,"" he said.

UK-EU trade talks resume ahead of June summit,"Talks between the UK and EU over a post-Brexit trade deal will enter their third round later, ahead of a decisive summit next month. Both sides are due to decide by the end of June whether the current deadline for negotiating an agreement should be extended beyond the end of December. The UK has said it will not agree to an extension, even if the EU requests one. The latest round of talks, to be held via video link, will end on Friday. After the latest round in April, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said progress had been disappointing, whilst the UK said only ""limited progress"" had been made. There are differences between the two sides on fisheries, competition rules, police co-operation, and how a deal would be enforced. 'Disappointing' progress in UK-EU trade talks UK will refuse any Brexit extension request What happens after Brexit? BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler said the EU accuses the UK of concentrating on its priorities whilst going slow on issues more important to the 27-member bloc. She added that the UK wants to first settle a core trade deal alongside deals on aviation and energy, whilst the EU is keen to focus on fishing quotas and competition rules. She added that although the UK has ruled out extending the talks, leaving tricky areas to the autumn could be risky if coronavirus infections peak again. Negotiations have been held using video-conferencing technology since last month after face-to-face meetings were cancelled due to the pandemic. The UK has rejected the suggestion it is not engaging in all negotiating areas, accusing the EU of making demands not required of its other trade partners. The UK is currently in a transition period under which it must follow most EU regulations, following its legal withdrawal from the bloc on 31 January. Both sidesexchanged legal text on a future trade deal in March. After the negotiations this week, a fourth round of talks is scheduled to begin on 1 June. Under the UK'swithdrawal agreementwith the EU, both sides currently have until 31 December to ratify a trade deal and rules for future co-operation. An extension to the December deadline should be made by the UK-EU ""joint committee"" overseeing the agreement by 1 July. Opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have both called on the UK government to extend the transition period beyond December. Shortly after becoming Labour leader last month, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK should prolong talks beyond December if ""necessary to do so"". He added that the December deadline was ""going to be very, very tight,"" and he thought it ""unlikely"" the government would finish talks in time. But the government insists it is committed to agreeing a deal by December 2020, and an extension would simply prolong disruption for businesses. What happens after Brexit?

Morrisons cuts petrol price to below Â£1 a litreIt is the first time a national chain has sold petrol in the UK at this price since February 2016.,"The supermarket is cutting its petrol price to below Â£1 per litre across the UK Morrisons has become the first major retailer to cut the price of petrol to below the Â£1 per litre threshold at all of its forecourts across the UK. The move comes after oil prices fell to an 18-year low last month, with some questioning why it took retailers so long to pass on the saving. The AA said it hoped more retailers would follow Morrisons' move. The RAC said the lower price was ""much more reflective of what the retailer is itself paying to buy the fuel in"". Morrisons said for a typical 50-litre fill up, customers will save Â£4.50 compared to the current national average price of petrol. In April, some filling stations around the country had been reportedly offering petrol at less than Â£1, but this is thought to be the first time a national chain has sold petrol throughout the UK below the threshold since February 2016. Petrol prices head towards Â£1 in the UK Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? In January, the price of a barrel of Brent Crude had touched $70. By mid-March a price war between oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia led to increased production and pushed prices to fall to close to $30 a barrel. The oversupply of oil coincided with a steep drop in demand thanks to the global coronavirus pandemic which shut factories, grounded airline fleets and meant cars stayed in garages rather than out on the road. As these issues combined the price of Brent Crude - the benchmark used by Europe - fell to just above $20 a barrel - its lowest level since 2002. The AA said that reductions in the wholesale price of petrol many weeks ago should have brought the UK's average pump price down to Â£1 a litre already. During the lockdown, retailers told drivers that they needed to keep prices high to compensate for lower fuel volumes. However, on Sunday night Prime Minister Boris Johnson began encouraging more people to leave their homes, but avoid public transport, which is likely to see more cars on the road. AA spokesperson Luke Bosdet said: ""Drivers can only hope that Morrisons price move this morning will now break the logjam on pump prices. At least, essential workers will no longer feel penalised for having to drive to protect people and keep the country running during the lockdown."" Another factor propping up the price of fuel is that the biggest proportion of the money you hand over for a litre of petrol goes to the government in the form of tax. Fuel duty is charged at 57.95p per litre. On top of that, consumers also have to pay VAT at 20%. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? Why are petrol prices going back up?

It is compulsory to wear one on public transport and in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, covering the nose and mouth, and you should be able to breathe comfortably.

"Cover face on public transport, people advised","People in England should now aim to wear face coverings on public transport and in some shops, the UK government has said. A document outlining new coronavirus lockdown rules,externalsuggests face coverings for enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible. That advice had already been recommended by the governmentsin ScotlandandNorthern Ireland. People are also allowed to meet one person from another household outside. It came after Boris Johnson announced on Sunday a ""conditional plan"" to begin lifting England's coronavirus lockdown. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own powers over the lockdown and have not lifted measures to the same extent. The PMled the government's daily Downing Street briefingafter appearing before MPs in the House of Commons. Mr Johnson told Parliament the ""roadmap"" for lifting the lockdown would enable the country to ""control"" the disease if people continue to follow the rules. What are the new rules? Who am I allowed to meet now? How to make your own face mask Are you going back to work today? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external He said the public should exercise ""good, solid, British common sense"" in adapting their lives to the next phase of the coronavirus response. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons the country needed more ""clarity and reassurance"" from the government, and that ""both are in pretty short supply"". He later added: ""The prime minister said he was setting out a roadmap, but if we're to complete the journey safely a road map needs clear directions. So many of us have questions that need answering."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the UK cannot ""go back to business as usual"" after dealing with coronavirus. It comes as a further 210 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus,taking the total number of deaths recorded to 32,065,external. After eight days of missing its goal of 100,000 tests a day, on Monday the government counted 100,490 tests on 10 May. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told the Downing Street briefing that Office for National Statistics data suggests an estimated 136,000 people are currently infected with coronavirus in the UK. He said the amount of time it may take for this number to halve is around two weeks on current infection rates. The government published a 50-page document on Monday afternoon, alongsidenew guidance for the public,external, setting out more details of its planned timetable for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. The PM said the government's ""roadmap"" would help control Covid-19 ""As more people return to work, there will be more movement outside people's immediate household,"" the guidance says. ""This increased mobility means the government is now advising that people should aim to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops."" The new guidance makes clear that a face covering is not the same as face masks, such as those worn by healthcare workers which ""must continue to be reserved for those who need it"". Public Health England has publishedan online guide, detailing how to make a cloth face covering.,external LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Other countries have already introduced rules about wearing face masks, however the government in Wales said it was not going to make wearing face coverings mandatory. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the evidence was ""not strong enough for that"", but people could choose to wear them if they wished. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy haspublished guidance for companies,external""to help them get their businesses back up and running and workplaces operating as safely as possible"". It features a number of suggestions, including carrying out a workplace risk assessment with trade unions, maintaining a 2m distance wherever possible, and ""reinforcing"" cleaning practices. As we gradually move out of lockdown, we are going to have to accept we are living with more risk than we once were. There is, after all, a virus circulating - that is infectious and can be deadly. The government is taking steps to try to minimise that risk (and of course there is plenty of debate whether it is doing a good job) as well as asking us to play our part by following the guidance, not just for the sake of our own health but also the health of others. But how high is the individual risk? What's become clear since coronavirus emerged is that the most at risk are those with vulnerabilities. Latest data suggests 1% of deaths in hospital in England involve people under 60 with no underlying health condition. Factor in the care home deaths, which are accounting for growing numbers of fatalities, and the overall proportion will be even lower. That is why the government is asking those with health conditions to be more stringent, including for some, continued isolation, which is incredibly tough to do. But for the ""healthy population"" it is clear the personal risk of dying is incredibly low. The younger you are, the lower the risk. For the under-25s, statisticians have likened it to the risk they would face from dying from several days of normal life - there is always the chance you could have an accident or suddenly die. But it is not zero - and that too can be difficult to live with when we are so aware of it. From Wednesday, people in England will also be allowed to meet one person from outside their household as long as they stay outdoors and stay 2m apart, the advice says. Sage, the government's group of scientific advisers, says the risk of infection outside is significantly lower than inside, according to the document. The guidance also said the government's ambition was for all primary school children in England to return to school for a month before the summer. But asked during the Downing Street briefing what people should do if they do not have access to childcare and cannot work from home, Mr Johnson said he was sure employers would be understanding. ""If people don't have access to childcare and they have a child who isn't back in school then I think that's only fair to regard that as an obvious barrier to their ability to go back to work and I am sure employers will agree with that,"" he said. Meanwhile, the new guidance confirmed garden centres will also be able to reopen on Wednesday with distancing measures in place. It is likely that the government will continue to advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to continue to shield beyond June, the document adds. And the document also says: People in England can drive to any outdoor open space in the country - but not to other UK nations Team sports should not be played - but people can exercise with up to one person from outside their household Healthy people aged 70 and over should take particular care to minimise contact with others - even if they have not been advised to shield by the NHS Clothes should be washed regularly if people work with others outside of their household Doors and windows should be left open in places where people from different households come into contact There needs to be ""a rapid re-engineering of government's structures and institutions"" to deal with Covid-19 Fines for those who do not follow the rules in Englandwill increase from Â£60 to Â£100 from Wednesday, with maximum total penalties for repeat offenders of Â£3,200. Speaking about potential future measures, Mr Johnson told Parliament the government was exploring how to safely allow people to expand their household to include one other ""on a strictly reciprocal basis"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures"" The guidance also sets out the government's three-step plan, announced by the PM on Sunday night. All dates could be delayed if not enough progress is made in tackling the virus - and restrictions could be reintroduced, the guidance says. CORONAVIRUS QUIZ:Fact or fiction?

"Simpler funerals are now the norm, says Dignity","Funeral services in churches have not been possible since lockdown measures were rolled out in the UK Families are opting for simpler, cheaper funeral services amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to UK funeral services group Dignity. Although its first-quarter revenues rose 2%, by April it made less money per funeral as services shrunk in size and extras such as limousines were cut. About 60% of Dignity's funerals are now simple services, up from 20% last year. Average income per funeral - excluding ancillary revenues - has dropped to Â£2,200, down from Â£2,648 in January. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidin April that the number of deaths in England and Wales was nearly double what would normally be expected, hitting a 20-year high. There were around 20,000 ""excess deaths"" recorded in a single week in March, Dignity said Dignity reported an 11% fall in operating profit for the first three months of 2020, with customers choosing lower-cost funerals as the coronavirus pandemic grew. Underlying revenue for the period rose 2% to Â£83.1m as the number of deaths in the 13 weeks of the year increased 1% to 161,000. The figures include only the first few days of the UK's lockdown which Prime Minister Boris Johnson put into effect from 23 March. Dignity said the possible number of deaths from Covid-19 was ""a matter of substantial speculation"". Although the government did not put a maximum number on the number of funeral attendees, it said only close family should attend services and all should observe social distancing throughout. During April, Dignity said average income for its full funeral services had fallen to Â£3,150 after it decided to withdraw limousine options and church services also ended. The funeral provider said it would not provide any financial forecasts for the rest of the year. How coronavirus changed death, grief and funerals Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

Saudi Arabia triples VAT as Covid-19 hits economy,"Saudi Arabia is tripling its value added tax (VAT) as part of austerity measures to support its coronavirus-hit economy. The government in Riyadh also said it will suspend its cost of living allowance to shore up state finances. The oil-rich nation has seen its income plummet as the impact of the pandemic has forced down global energy prices. The kingdom first introduced VAT two years ago as part of efforts to cut its reliance on world crude oil markets. Saudi Arabia's state news agency said VAT will increase from 5% to 15% as of 1 July, while the cost of living allowance will be suspended from 1 June. The allowance of 1,000 riyals ($267; Â£217) per month to state employees was introduced in 2018 to help offset increased financial burdens including VAT and a rise in the price of petrol. ""These measures are painful but necessary to maintain financial and economic stability over [the] medium to long term... and overcome the unprecedented coronavirus crisis with the least damage possible,"" finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in the statement. What shape will the coronavirus recession be? Saudi Aramco raises record $25.6bn in share sale US oil prices turn negative as demand dries up The announcement came after state spending outstripped income, pushing the kingdom into a $9bn (Â£7.2bn) budget deficit in the first three months of the year. That's as oil revenues in the period fell by almost a quarter from a year earlier to $34bn, pulling down total revenues by 22%. At the same time Saudi Arabia's central bank saw its foreign reserves fall in March at their fastest rate in at least two decades and to their lowest level since 2011. The measures to fight the impact of coronavirus are expected to slow the pace and scale of economic reforms launched by Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman. Last year Saudi Arabia raised a record $25.6bn in the initial public offering of shares in state-owned oil giant Aramco in Riyadh. The share sale was at the heart of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to modernise the economy and wean it off its dependence on oil. What shape will the coronavirus recession be?

"High Streets see 'fastest ever' footfall dropSpringboard says the fall in the number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets was ""unprecedented"".Business","The number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell at its fastest rate ever in April as the lockdown forced people to stay indoors, industry figures show. Footfall fell by more than 80% after all but essential shops closed their doors, according to Springboard. That was almost double the level of March's downturn when there was a 41.3% drop in visits to shopping locations. Springboard said the April slump was a ""decline of unprecedented magnitude"". UK 'set for deepest downturn in living memory' Shoppers swap clothes for drink as retail sales sink Shopping centres were the worst hit by the drop in footfall, as visits fell by 84.8%. Meanwhile, the number of visits to High Streets around the country fell by 83.3% and footfall at retail parks was 68.1% lower. The presence of supermarkets and wide-open spaces, which allowed for better social distancing, meant retail parks performed slightly better than other areas, according to the retail analyst company. ""What has become clear, but what is not obvious from the headline rate, is the shift in consumer behaviour away from large towns and cities to smaller more local centres,"" said Diane Wehrle from Springboard. At 20 smaller town centres, including Harold Hill, Prescot, Kenilworth and Dudley, footfall decreased by less than 60%. Meanwhile, major city centres such as Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Bristol and London were among the 20 areas that saw the biggest drops in footfall. ""The overriding focus on safe shopping and the greater emphasis on community that has come to the fore means that trips to larger towns and cities have been curtailed,"" said Ms Wehrle. ""Indeed, it is the first evidence available that suggests how consumers may respond to easing of restrictions."" She said it was a contrast to ""pre-coronavirus days"" when small High Streets faced an increasing struggle to attract shoppers. ""The path of recovery for retail may well be led by smaller high streets which can offer both safety and community benefits. ""For larger destinations, the emphasis on safety suggests that those environments that have the capability to control shopper numbers - such as retail parks and shopping centres - will be the next phase of recovery, followed by large towns and cities which inevitably face issues around pedestrian congestion.""

More European nations begin easing restrictions,"West Wing employees told to wear masks after two members of Trump administration staff tested positive for coronavirus. UK PM Boris Johnson defends new ""stay alert"" message, saying most people should stay at home where possible UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government's roadmap out of lockdown leaves ""questions that need answering"" People in England should cover their faces in settings where they can't social distance, the government says Russia now has the third-highest number of confirmed cases in the world, overtaking UK and Italy In France, people are able to walk outside for the first time in weeks without filling in a permit In New York state, some low-risk businesses and activities will resume after 15 May Thank you for following our coverage. We're wrapping up the live page for today but before we go, here's a round-up of Monday's main developments:  Our coverage was brought to you by Jasmine Coleman-Taylor, Sean Fanning, Sophie Williams,  Lauren Turner, Thom Poole, Hugo Bachega, Yaroslav Lukov, Doug Faulkner, Frank Keogh, Matt Henry, Justin Parkinson,
Kate Whannel, Alex Bysouth, Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Andreas Illmer, and Tessa Wong. Twitter has said it started highlighting messages that contain ""disputed or misleading information related to Covid-19"". The social media company said in a statement,externalthat ""new labels and warning messages"" would provide ""additional context and information"" to some of such tweets. They would be used in cases where the risk of harm is not so great that the tweets would have to be removed. But the company said it wouldnât be directly fact-checking tweets or calling the highlighted ones false, stressing its users didnât want it to decide what was true and what wasnât. Social media platforms have been under pressure to take action against coronavirus misinformation, ranging from conspiracy theories about its origins to advertisements for bogus treatments. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged the public to stick to social distancing rules, after the infection rate grew following a relaxation in social distancing. The national coronavirus reproduction number - or simply the R value - was higher than 1 for the third consecutive day, according to the Robert Koch Institute said. The number was 1.07 on Monday, meaning that 100 infected people were on average transmitting the virus to 107 others. The R rate must be held below 1 to
prevent health services from being overwhelmed and continue the gradual easing of restrictions. Germany is hailed by many experts as a success story in dealing with the outbreak. The country currently has nearly 170,000 confirmed infections, with more than 7,400 coronavirus-related deaths. Why R is the crucial number As we reported earlier, Trump says the US has ""prevailed"" in coronavirus testing - while the banners behind him at the press conference read: ""America leads the world in testing."" But is that true? Perhaps the fairest way of comparing different countries' testing is to look at how many tests they're carrying out per 1,000 people. This is because a country such as South Korea, whose population is smaller than a sixth of the US's, will need a lower overall testing capacity in order to control the virus. According to official figures collated by science publication Our World in Data, the US has currently tested26.31out of every 1,000 people. While this is higher than countries such as France and the UK, other nations are testing far more people per 1,000 than the US is. Portugal, which has been held up as an example of how early and widespread testing can help control the virus early, has tested47.66per 1,000 people. Israel, which recently increased its testing operation, has now tested50.35out of 1,000. Bahrain, meanwhile, has managed to test almost 10% of its population of just over 1.5m. President's Trump news conference ended abruptly after he clashed with reporters. He said during the briefing the US led the world on testing, but CBS White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked him why it was a ""global competition"" for him when Americans were dying. ""Go ask China,"" Trump said to Jiang, who is Asian-American. Jiang responded by asking Trump why he was personally telling her to speak to China, who replied he was saying it to anyone who would ask a ""nasty question like that"". He then refused to take questions from a CNN reporter, who had let Jiang ask follow-up questions, before thanking everyone there and walking off. Trump is asked if he was behind the White House memo today which requires anyone in the West Wing to wear a face mask. âYes I did, I required thatâ says President Trump, who has previously described himself as a germaphobe. Trump reportedly was furious when he found out his personal valet, who serves him his meals, tested positive for the virus. Trump was asked why he wants US businesses to reopen without testing easily available, while White House officials have testing on demand. ""If we didn't get the tests done you'd be up here complaining that we weren't getting the tests done,"" he said. ""You complain that we're getting too many tests,"" he added, ""so we can't win."" Trump says the US is now conducting 300,000 tests per day and will hit the 10m mark for total tests this week. According to the Covid Tracking Project, a non-profit charity, the US conducted an average of 248,000 daily tests in the first week of May. However, prominent public health researchers at Harvard University say at least 900,000 daily tests are needed before the US should reopen. As of this week, the US has tested only 2.75% of its 330m population, and no state has tested 10% of residents. In over a dozen states where lockdown measures have been relaxed, including Texas, South Carolina and Arizona, less than two percent of residents have been tested. Trump said in his opening address the US has ""prevailed"". Asked to clarify, the president says he was talking about the nation's testing capability. âYou never prevail
when you have the kind of death you are talking about,"" he said. ""We have done a great job on testing and it
is a big, important function. We have prevailed, we have the best equipment
anywhere in the world."" Asked about the White House staff who tested positive for coronavirus Trump said ""I donât think the system broke down at all"". ""One person tested positive, surprisingly, because the previous day they tested negative,"" he says. ""That's not breaking down. It's the hidden enemy. It's the hidden enemy, Let's remember that."" He adds that people have been going and coming from the White House only because they are essential workers. ""We're running a country,"" he said. US President Donald Trump says the country has increased the number of tests it conducts each day from 150,000 to 300,000. The total number of tests performed in the US passed nine million on Monday and is expected to reach 10 million later this week. The FDA has authorised 79 diagnostic tests on 25 different devices. It authorised the first antigen test on Friday and says 300,000 could be on the market within the next few weeks - such tests quickly detect whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus. Trump says that the US economy will improve in the coming months, a phase that he calls ""transitioning into greatness"". ""Next year we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had. Because it's a pent-up demand,"" he says, calling it ""a demand that weâve never seen"". Like most economies, the US has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic - last week unemployment claims since mid-March hit 33 million. Trump is speaking from the White House Rose Garden. He begins by touting US coronavirus testing, which he says is part of the plan to ""gradually and safely reopen America"", adding that many are very enthusiastic to get back to work. Trump's son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner has been seen wearing a mask as he watched the president speak. There have been more than four million cases of coronavirus recorded worldwide. The charts below show how the worst-hit European countries appear to have passed through the peak. However, Russia is alongside Brazil, Mexico and Peru as one of the countries where the death toll from the virus is rising fast. Below, we see that the number of new cases and deaths from the virus in the US appears to have also moved beyond its peak. The east coast - particularly New York state - is the hardest-hit area. The White House has sent a memo to staff directing more aides to wear masks when in the West Wing or avoid President Trump's office altogether if possible. The memo was obtained by US media moments before Trump is due to deliver remarks from the White House on the role of testing in the effort to reopen the country's economy. It also comes asthree high-ranking members of the White House coronavirus taskforce- including top disease expert Anthony Fauci - are in self-isolation after two White House staff members tested positive. According to US media, the latest White House memo on masks is unlikely to apply to Trump, who has so far not worn one during the pandemic. Trump aides are wearing masks in the White House Rose Garden Our colleague Anthony Zurcher is at the White House, where he says the number of Trump aides wearing masks has already risen since last week. He says all of the press aides are donning masks for Trump's briefing. Reality Check The health secretary set a target of 100,000 tests per day in the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government hit its daily testing target with 100,490 tests on Sunday. The target, set by Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month, was for 100,000 tests per day in the UK to diagnose coronavirus. The government said the figure was reached on 30 April and then 1 May - although there was some criticism about how tests were counted - but the target was then missed for eight consecutive days. Johnson has talked of raising the target further to 200,000 tests per day by the end of this month. We have been looking athow the government is getting on with seven of its coronavirus targets- including testing. Nduka OrjinmoBBC News, Lagos Prodest Home after bulldozers ripped through part of the hotel The authorities in Nigeria's oil-rich southern Rivers state have demolished two hotels over an alleged breach of lockdown rules intended to contain the spread of coronavirus. State Governor Nyesom Wike, who supervised the tearing down of Edemete Hotel and Prodest Home on Sunday, said the operators had flouted an order that hotels should be closed. He said people who had tested positive for the virus had been found in hotels across the state. But he did not say if anyone who had Covid-19 had been staying in either of the demolished hotels. Read the full story here. Reality Check Schools have been shut as part of the strategy to curb the spread of the virus The UK prime minister was asked about the childcare provision for people expected to go back to work before schools reopen. Boris Johnson says if people do not have access to childcare, it is only fair to see that as a barrier to their ability to go back to work. People who cannot work from home - such as those in the manufacturing and construction sectors - are being ""actively encouraged"" to return to work from Wednesday. But ministers say schools in England should prepare to begin to open for more pupils from 1 June, with only selected year groups - including Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - going back in smaller class sizes. Secondary schools and FE colleges are also being told to plan for some face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils. Read more about the timetable for schools reopening. The last question of the press conference concerned whether schools contribute to the infection rate. ""They
do contribute a certain amount, and this is what is being modelled carefully,"" replied Chris Whitty. ""We are very committed to publishing all of the science behind Sage.

Coronavirus in Wales: First day of lockdown changes,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson allows people in England to drive to parks and beaches - but this does not apply to people in Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford says the stay-at-home message in Wales has not changed Counsel General Jeremy Miles says people in England should not drive to Wales As of Monday, people in Wales are allowed to exercise outside more than once a day A further five people have died in Wales with coronavirus, taking the total to 1,116 Nicola Bryan, Michael Pearlman and Gemma Ryall That's it from us. We'll be back again tomorrow from 07:00 BST. We'll leave you with a recap of today's main coronavirus news from Wales: After Prime Minister Boris Johnson's high profile speech outlining a relaxation of lockdown rules in England on Sunday evening, you could be forgiven for being a touch confused about what you are allowed to do. It did come just days after First Minister Mark Drakeford announced only ""modest"" changes to the rules in Wales. Let us explain the key differences between the rules either side of the border. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Are you still confused about lockdown? First Minister Mark Drakeford has reiterated that ""it is Welsh law that applies"" when it comes to deciding coronavirus restrictions in Wales. Speaking at the Welsh Government's daily briefing on Monday, Mr Drakeford explained the easing of restrictions in England, announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday, did not apply in Wales. ""Travelling to Wales to exercise is not to exercise locally,"" he said.

Speaking at Brynawel Fuchsia and Garden Centre in the Vale of Glamorgan on Monday, one customer said it was ""absolutely fabulous"" to be able see the business open again. Another said her garden was her ""happy place"" and praised the Welsh Government's decision to allow the centres to reopen - provided social distancing is observed. First Minister Mark Drakeford has advised all over-70s to stay at home due to their vulnerability to Covid-19, and has banned all but essential travel. If you are out
exercising, on your way to work or going to a supermarket and bump into someone outside of your household you can have a chat with them as
long as you socially distance, the Welsh Government has told BBC Wales. However,you cannot pre-arrange to meet them. âThe bottom lineâ, BBC Wales was told, is that groups of people
shouldn't arrange to meet. Confusion came after Mark Drakeford said earlier: âThe rules in Wales are that two people can meet providing they observe social distancing, so if one person from a household is going out and meeting another member of their family then under our rules that would be permitted."" Member of the Senedd for South Wales Central, Andrew RT Davies, tweeted Mr Drakeford had been ""wrong at lunchtime's press briefing"", adding: ""This takes the biscuit!""  Allow Twitter content?

shown towards NHS workers was a concern over the bank holiday weekend. Helen Whyley, director
of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, has been speaking to Gareth Lewis on
BBC Radio Wales to explain the situation. âUnfortunately nurses
and other clinicians have been experiencing violence and aggressive behaviour
towards them over this weekend,â she said. âIt's not something that
comes as unusual for them because it happens often when we have a bank holiday
or large celebrations when certain parts of our society do drink too much and
this can result in bad behaviour. âI guess what it reminds
is we don't just need people clapping on a Thursday night about carers and
showing them the respect and value from doing that, but pulling that right through
to their everyday behaviour and remembering people go to work to help others
and that it's really not appropriate to act in any way that doesn't show
respect and value for those around you. âClearly social
distancing rules are there for a reason - they're about slowing down the spread
of this virus across our communities so if people have not been following these
over the weekend and coming together to have parties, then clearly there is a
heightened risk of increased spread."" The comments come after Walesâ First Minister Mark Drakeford said
that the police saw an increase in alcohol-related violence associated with VE
Day celebrations and increased traffic across many areas of the road network. Jury trials in Wales and England will resume from next week, almost two months after being put on hold amid coronavirus lockdown measures. The first courts where new juries will be sworn in include the Old Bailey in London and Cardiff Crown Court. Facilities are being assessed at other courts with a view to gradually increasing cases when safe to do so. Special arrangements are in place to maintain social distancing alongside other safety measures. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said: ""It is important that the administration of justice continues to function whenever it is possible in an environment which is consistent with the safety of all those involved. ""Jury service is an essential part of criminal justice and jurors perform a vital duty."" Boris Johnson will be back on our screens at 19:00 BST to hold a press conference with the government's advisers Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. The BBC will also be broadcasting a response from the Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer at 17:50 on BBC Radio 4 and 18:55 on BBC One and the BBC News channel. ""It is very clear that Brois Johnson has confused us all with his new government guidelines,"" the Labour MP for Pontypridd has tweeted. She urged people to stay home. ""Modest"" lockdown changes came into force in Wales today. People are now able to exercise outside more than once a day in Wales and some garden centres have reopened. The stay-at-home message in Wales has not changed, the First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new message to ""stay alert, control the virus, save lives"" has beenrejected by ministers in Wales and Scotland. Allow Twitter content?

Boris Johnson had said ""we don't want to see people travelling to another home for a holiday, or a second home,"" after announcing that people in England would be allowed to drive somewhere to exercise. The prime minister was responding to a question from Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Fay Jones during a Commons debate on his statement about changes to lockdown rules in England. She asked: ""Would he agree with me that while the R number (rate of infection per person) continues to vary across the country, restrictions in Wales remain the same and the changes that he announced last night are not a green light for tourism or for people to travel to their second homes in Wales?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""Absolutely."" ""We don't want to see people travelling to another home for a holiday or to a second home, that is not what this is about. ""It is about allowing people the pleasure of going to parks and places of natural beauty."" The Welsh Government has introduced a strict ban on second home visits, in order to protect health services in rural and tourist areas from being overwhelmed by demand for treatment. Fay Jones took part in the debate by video conference An airline boss says he will be âvery surprisedâ if travel demand recovers before 2023/2024. Akbar al-Baker, chief executive officer of Qatar Airways, also warned that many business travellers may never return, having become used to working remotely. The Middle Eastern airline, which has daily flights between Cardiff and Doha, has continued to operate throughout the pandemic, maintaining services to around 30 destinations. Before the outbreak, Qatar Airways served 165 destinations. It aims to build services back up to 80 destinations by the end of June. Al-Baker told Reuters news agency that he predicts the airline will be able to fill between 50% and 60% of seats. He said Qatar Airways will encourage passengers to keep a safe distance while onboard. The airline announced on Monday that it was giving 100,000 free return flights to healthcare staff around the world. Wales

Mr Johnson added that primary schools and shops may begin reopening in June, and that people in England should be ""actively encouraged"" to go to work if they cannot work from home. However, leades of the UK's devolved nations, including Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford, have rejected the new ""stay alert"" advice in favour of keeping the ""stay at home"" message.

SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford says ""it is obvious the last 24 hours have spread confusion"" and warns that ""mixed messaging risks lives"". He asks Boris Johnson in the House of Commons why the UK government did not share the new ""stay alert"" slogan with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations before it appeared in the Sunday papers. In reply, the prime minister said there had been cooperation across the four nations adding: ""I think we have been able to make a huge amount of progress together."" Mr Johnson says there is ""always political temptation to accentuate divisions but that is not the approach of the government"". No professional sport, even behind closed doors, will be staged in Englanduntil 1 June at the earliest, the UK government has announced. The decision will affect Welsh clubs such as Cardiff City and Swansea City which play in English tournaments. There will be no cricket played in England and Wales until at least 1 July, following a decision by the England and Wales Cricket Board. British horse racing had hoped toresume behind closed doors later this month,having been on hold since 17 March. In response to Sir Keir Starmer's question about different rules in different nations, Boris Johnson tells MPs: ""There will be myriad hypothetical questions."" ""But let's be absolutely clear - I think everybody understands what we are trying to do together,"" the prime minister adds. ""And that is working together as a country to obey social distancing rules that everyone understands. ""This is the moment for the whole country to come together, obey those rules and apply their common sense in the application of those rules."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said there is ""not consensus in messaging or policy"" between the UK government and ministers in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Responding to Boris Johnson's statement to the Commons on changes to lockdown rules in England, Sir Keir notes that travel to outdoor spaces by people in England is allowed irrespective of distance. ""Can you travel to the border but not beyond the border?"" he asks. ""That makes enforcement extremely difficult."" Sir Keir Starmer asked if English people would be allowed to drive cross the border into Wales Earlier today, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said people coming into Wales to exercise would be breaking Welsh, as it was not deemed to be exercising locally. He said police chiefs were worried thattraffic into Wales could continue to increase from across the border. ""Our struggle against the virus has placed this country under the kind of strain that will be remembered for generations,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the House of Commons. ""We are seeing the indomitable spirit of Britain."" Closing his statement on amending lockdown restrictions in England, he says: ""People should stay alert by working from home if you possibly can, by limiting contact with others, by keeping your distance and by washing your hands. ""If everyone stays alert we can keep the infections down,"" he adds. ""That is how we will be able to save lives and save livelihoods."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Colombian airline Avianca files for bankruptcy,"Avianca planes have been grounded since March Colombia's national airline, Avianca, has filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court. The carrier is the second-largest in Latin America, but its passenger operations have been grounded since March because of coronavirus. It said the pandemic had cut more than 80% of its income, and it was struggling with high fixed costs. If it fails to come out of bankruptcy, Avianca will be the first major airline to go under amid the pandemic. In a statement, the firm said it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a court in New York. The process postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, giving it time to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business. Chief executive Anko van der Werff said the move was needed to ensure the New York-listed airline emerge as a ""better, more efficient airline that operates for many more years"". How will airlines get flying again? More than 140 of its aircraft have been grounded since Colombian President Ivan Duque closed the country's airspace in March. Most of its 20,000 employees have been put on unpaid leave. Behind KLM, Avianca is the second-longest continually running airline in the world. It previously filed for bankruptcy in the early 2000s, and was rescued by a deal with Bolivian oil tycoon German Efromovich. The airline grew quickly under his stewardship, but its growing debt led to a successful boardroom coup against Mr Efromovich last year. It is now run by Kingsland Holdings. The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a huge blow to the international aviation industry, as governments impose travel restrictions and confinement measures. Global air travel has fallen by 90%, according to the International Air Transport Association. The body predicts Latin American airlines will lose $15bn (Â£12bn; â¬13.9bn) in revenues this year - the biggest drop in the industry's history.

PM's address prompts questions as well as answers,"This is the start - the country's doors being edged open a crack. More time in the fresh air for exercise everywhere this week, and a timetable of a sort from Boris Johnson for an achingly gradual return to a recognisable life. In England at least, if you work in construction or manufacturing, or can't do your job from home, you'll be encouraged to go back to work as long as you can keep your distance from others this week. You'll be able, from Wednesday too, to take unlimited exercise; to meet one person from outside your own household as long as you stay two metres apart; you can go and sit in your local park, to sunbathe, or to take part in sport with others from your household. But importantly there will be NO change for the many people who are more vulnerable to the disease who are therefore ""shielding"". But progress beyond the next few days is a series of big ifs. The ambition is to start bringing back some primary school years from the start of June, but it depends how the outbreak progresses. The plan is for some secondary school pupils to be able to see their teachers occasionally before the end of the term. But there is no intention though to reopen them before the summer. There is a hope that from July, some parts of the hospitality trade might be able to open up. But don't take that to mean that pubs will be back in business - rather some limited firms that are able to trade outdoors could be allowed to return. ""If"" was the word the prime minister said again and again. The difficult reality for the government though, and for the public trying to understand what these next phases of the pandemic look like, is that different parts of our social life, different parts of the public sector, and different parts of the economy have to move at different paces because there are different levels of risk. But despite the prime minister's lengthy address there are as many questions raised as answered. Workers in some sectors have been advised to go to work on Monday but told to avoid public transport. What are employers meant to be telling their staff? What are workers meant to do if their only way of getting to work is by limited public transport? What should the parents of secondary school pupils do if they can go back to work, but their children have no prospect of a proper return? There was no mention of face coverings, even though the government has been talking about them being a possible part of their plans. Nor was there a fixed date or detail of when people travelling to the UK by plane will be asked to go into some kind of quarantine. Importantly for so many members of the public, there was vanishingly little detail of when people might be able to see their extended families again. And the prime minister's approach is also creating a very real political tension between Westminster and the devolved administrations. LOCKDOWN:How will it change now? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? With what are thought to be higher rates of the infection in Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have made no bones about their reluctance to move from the ""stay at home"" message. The governments have been trying to stick together in the last few weeks but there is very obvious division now - not just over the message and communication, but over the attitude to the workplace. Any clash like that creates confusion and uncertainty too. This is what the prime minister described as the ""sketch of a plan"" - sketches are rough, and can easily be rubbed out. And it's dependent, at every stage, on how this relatively unknown disease progresses throughout the country. On Monday a document of 50 pages or so will be published that will answer some of Sunday night's questions. The prime minister's statement was designed to try to reassure, to show the country that there is the beginning of a way out of this crisis. Yet it has prompted questions and provided only limited answers.

Prison watchdog 'concerned' at health meeting ban,"The Independent Monitoring Board at HMP Wayland in Norfolk said it was prevent from attending some meetings A prison watchdog barred from healthcare meetings said it was ""very concerned"" and had ""a right to attend"". The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) at HMP Wayland in Norfolk claims it has been ""prevented"" from attending meetings on health service provision. The board raised the issue in itsannual report,externaland said it planned to escalate its concerns. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it had been excluded because ""commercially sensitive"" matters were discussed. In its report, the IMB said the decision to ban it from the quarterly meetings followed a change in healthcare provider at the 1,000-capacity menâs prison, near Thetford. The report said: ""It is to be regretted that since the change of healthcare provider, the IMB has been excluded from attending healthcare meetings, in contravention of our right to attend any meetings. ""Consequently, it has been difficult to monitor healthcare as closely as we should like and to get accurate healthcare statistics."" IMBs comprise independent, unpaid volunteers who monitor day-to-day life at prisons to ensure proper standards of care and decency are maintained. Wayland IMB chairman Mike Gander told the BBC: ""We are very concerned at our exclusion and we are thinking of taking this to a high level within Her Majestyâs Prison and Probation Service."" He said the IMB only wanted to attend the meetings as observers. He questioned the cited concerns over ""commercial sensitivity"", claiming a number of providers were present at the meetings - which cover health provision at three Norfolk prisons - meaning they were unlikely to disclose sensitive information in front of other companies. In addition, he said, IMB members were required to sign the Official Secrets Act, meaning they would not share such information, even if it was raised. The BBC asked the MoJ whether the IMB had a right to attend, and whether it accepted monitoring healthcare and having accurate healthcare statistics was an important part of the IMBâs role. The MoJ has yet to respond in detail, but did say the IMB should have access to minutes of healthcare meetings and relevant healthcare data.

LiveLiveChina infections rise as new city cluster emerges10 minutes ago10 minutes ago Welcome to our coverageWelcome to our coverageLive China infections rise as new city cluster emerges  10 minutes ago,"West Wing employees told to wear masks after two members of Trump administration staff tested positive for coronavirus. UK PM Boris Johnson defends new ""stay alert"" message, saying most people should stay at home where possible UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government's roadmap out of lockdown leaves ""questions that need answering"" People in England should cover their faces in settings where they can't social distance, the government says Russia now has the third-highest number of confirmed cases in the world, overtaking UK and Italy In France, people are able to walk outside for the first time in weeks without filling in a permit In New York state, some low-risk businesses and activities will resume after 15 May Thank you for following our coverage. We're wrapping up the live page for today but before we go, here's a round-up of Monday's main developments:  Our coverage was brought to you by Jasmine Coleman-Taylor, Sean Fanning, Sophie Williams,  Lauren Turner, Thom Poole, Hugo Bachega, Yaroslav Lukov, Doug Faulkner, Frank Keogh, Matt Henry, Justin Parkinson,
Kate Whannel, Alex Bysouth, Saira Asher, Owen Amos, Andreas Illmer, and Tessa Wong. Twitter has said it started highlighting messages that contain ""disputed or misleading information related to Covid-19"". The social media company said in a statement,externalthat ""new labels and warning messages"" would provide ""additional context and information"" to some of such tweets. They would be used in cases where the risk of harm is not so great that the tweets would have to be removed. But the company said it wouldnât be directly fact-checking tweets or calling the highlighted ones false, stressing its users didnât want it to decide what was true and what wasnât. Social media platforms have been under pressure to take action against coronavirus misinformation, ranging from conspiracy theories about its origins to advertisements for bogus treatments. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged the public to stick to social distancing rules, after the infection rate grew following a relaxation in social distancing. The national coronavirus reproduction number - or simply the R value - was higher than 1 for the third consecutive day, according to the Robert Koch Institute said. The number was 1.07 on Monday, meaning that 100 infected people were on average transmitting the virus to 107 others. The R rate must be held below 1 to
prevent health services from being overwhelmed and continue the gradual easing of restrictions. Germany is hailed by many experts as a success story in dealing with the outbreak. The country currently has nearly 170,000 confirmed infections, with more than 7,400 coronavirus-related deaths. Why R is the crucial number As we reported earlier, Trump says the US has ""prevailed"" in coronavirus testing - while the banners behind him at the press conference read: ""America leads the world in testing."" But is that true? Perhaps the fairest way of comparing different countries' testing is to look at how many tests they're carrying out per 1,000 people. This is because a country such as South Korea, whose population is smaller than a sixth of the US's, will need a lower overall testing capacity in order to control the virus. According to official figures collated by science publication Our World in Data, the US has currently tested26.31out of every 1,000 people. While this is higher than countries such as France and the UK, other nations are testing far more people per 1,000 than the US is. Portugal, which has been held up as an example of how early and widespread testing can help control the virus early, has tested47.66per 1,000 people. Israel, which recently increased its testing operation, has now tested50.35out of 1,000. Bahrain, meanwhile, has managed to test almost 10% of its population of just over 1.5m. President's Trump news conference ended abruptly after he clashed with reporters. He said during the briefing the US led the world on testing, but CBS White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked him why it was a ""global competition"" for him when Americans were dying. ""Go ask China,"" Trump said to Jiang, who is Asian-American. Jiang responded by asking Trump why he was personally telling her to speak to China, who replied he was saying it to anyone who would ask a ""nasty question like that"". He then refused to take questions from a CNN reporter, who had let Jiang ask follow-up questions, before thanking everyone there and walking off. Trump is asked if he was behind the White House memo today which requires anyone in the West Wing to wear a face mask. âYes I did, I required thatâ says President Trump, who has previously described himself as a germaphobe. Trump reportedly was furious when he found out his personal valet, who serves him his meals, tested positive for the virus. Trump was asked why he wants US businesses to reopen without testing easily available, while White House officials have testing on demand. ""If we didn't get the tests done you'd be up here complaining that we weren't getting the tests done,"" he said. ""You complain that we're getting too many tests,"" he added, ""so we can't win."" Trump says the US is now conducting 300,000 tests per day and will hit the 10m mark for total tests this week. According to the Covid Tracking Project, a non-profit charity, the US conducted an average of 248,000 daily tests in the first week of May. However, prominent public health researchers at Harvard University say at least 900,000 daily tests are needed before the US should reopen. As of this week, the US has tested only 2.75% of its 330m population, and no state has tested 10% of residents. In over a dozen states where lockdown measures have been relaxed, including Texas, South Carolina and Arizona, less than two percent of residents have been tested. Trump said in his opening address the US has ""prevailed"". Asked to clarify, the president says he was talking about the nation's testing capability. âYou never prevail
when you have the kind of death you are talking about,"" he said. ""We have done a great job on testing and it
is a big, important function. We have prevailed, we have the best equipment
anywhere in the world."" Asked about the White House staff who tested positive for coronavirus Trump said ""I donât think the system broke down at all"". ""One person tested positive, surprisingly, because the previous day they tested negative,"" he says. ""That's not breaking down. It's the hidden enemy. It's the hidden enemy, Let's remember that."" He adds that people have been going and coming from the White House only because they are essential workers. ""We're running a country,"" he said. US President Donald Trump says the country has increased the number of tests it conducts each day from 150,000 to 300,000. The total number of tests performed in the US passed nine million on Monday and is expected to reach 10 million later this week. The FDA has authorised 79 diagnostic tests on 25 different devices. It authorised the first antigen test on Friday and says 300,000 could be on the market within the next few weeks - such tests quickly detect whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus. Trump says that the US economy will improve in the coming months, a phase that he calls ""transitioning into greatness"". ""Next year we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had. Because it's a pent-up demand,"" he says, calling it ""a demand that weâve never seen"". Like most economies, the US has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic - last week unemployment claims since mid-March hit 33 million. Trump is speaking from the White House Rose Garden. He begins by touting US coronavirus testing, which he says is part of the plan to ""gradually and safely reopen America"", adding that many are very enthusiastic to get back to work. Trump's son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner has been seen wearing a mask as he watched the president speak. There have been more than four million cases of coronavirus recorded worldwide. The charts below show how the worst-hit European countries appear to have passed through the peak. However, Russia is alongside Brazil, Mexico and Peru as one of the countries where the death toll from the virus is rising fast. Below, we see that the number of new cases and deaths from the virus in the US appears to have also moved beyond its peak. The east coast - particularly New York state - is the hardest-hit area. The White House has sent a memo to staff directing more aides to wear masks when in the West Wing or avoid President Trump's office altogether if possible. The memo was obtained by US media moments before Trump is due to deliver remarks from the White House on the role of testing in the effort to reopen the country's economy. It also comes asthree high-ranking members of the White House coronavirus taskforce- including top disease expert Anthony Fauci - are in self-isolation after two White House staff members tested positive. According to US media, the latest White House memo on masks is unlikely to apply to Trump, who has so far not worn one during the pandemic. Trump aides are wearing masks in the White House Rose Garden Our colleague Anthony Zurcher is at the White House, where he says the number of Trump aides wearing masks has already risen since last week. He says all of the press aides are donning masks for Trump's briefing. Reality Check The health secretary set a target of 100,000 tests per day in the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government hit its daily testing target with 100,490 tests on Sunday. The target, set by Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month, was for 100,000 tests per day in the UK to diagnose coronavirus. The government said the figure was reached on 30 April and then 1 May - although there was some criticism about how tests were counted - but the target was then missed for eight consecutive days. Johnson has talked of raising the target further to 200,000 tests per day by the end of this month. We have been looking athow the government is getting on with seven of its coronavirus targets- including testing. Nduka OrjinmoBBC News, Lagos Prodest Home after bulldozers ripped through part of the hotel The authorities in Nigeria's oil-rich southern Rivers state have demolished two hotels over an alleged breach of lockdown rules intended to contain the spread of coronavirus. State Governor Nyesom Wike, who supervised the tearing down of Edemete Hotel and Prodest Home on Sunday, said the operators had flouted an order that hotels should be closed. He said people who had tested positive for the virus had been found in hotels across the state. But he did not say if anyone who had Covid-19 had been staying in either of the demolished hotels. Read the full story here. Reality Check Schools have been shut as part of the strategy to curb the spread of the virus The UK prime minister was asked about the childcare provision for people expected to go back to work before schools reopen. Boris Johnson says if people do not have access to childcare, it is only fair to see that as a barrier to their ability to go back to work. People who cannot work from home - such as those in the manufacturing and construction sectors - are being ""actively encouraged"" to return to work from Wednesday. But ministers say schools in England should prepare to begin to open for more pupils from 1 June, with only selected year groups - including Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - going back in smaller class sizes. Secondary schools and FE colleges are also being told to plan for some face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils. Read more about the timetable for schools reopening. The last question of the press conference concerned whether schools contribute to the infection rate. ""They
do contribute a certain amount, and this is what is being modelled carefully,"" replied Chris Whitty. ""We are very committed to publishing all of the science behind Sage. ""That is happening but never as fast as people want."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

when you have the kind of death you are talking about,"" he said. ""We have done a great job on testing and it
is a big, important function. We have prevailed, we have the best equipment
anywhere in the world."" Asked about the White House staff who tested positive for coronavirus Trump said ""I donât think the system broke down at all"". ""One person tested positive, surprisingly, because the previous day they tested negative,"" he says. ""That's not breaking down. It's the hidden enemy. It's the hidden enemy, Let's remember that."" He adds that people have been going and coming from the White House only because they are essential workers. ""We're running a country,"" he said. US President Donald Trump says the country has increased the number of tests it conducts each day from 150,000 to 300,000. The total number of tests performed in the US passed nine million on Monday and is expected to reach 10 million later this week. The FDA has authorised 79 diagnostic tests on 25 different devices. It authorised the first antigen test on Friday and says 300,000 could be on the market within the next few weeks - such tests quickly detect whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus. Trump says that the US economy will improve in the coming months, a phase that he calls ""transitioning into greatness"". ""Next year we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had. Because it's a pent-up demand,"" he says, calling it ""a demand that weâve never seen"". Like most economies, the US has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic - last week unemployment claims since mid-March hit 33 million. Trump is speaking from the White House Rose Garden. He begins by touting US coronavirus testing, which he says is part of the plan to ""gradually and safely reopen America"", adding that many are very enthusiastic to get back to work. Trump's son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner has been seen wearing a mask as he watched the president speak. There have been more than four million cases of coronavirus recorded worldwide. The charts below show how the worst-hit European countries appear to have passed through the peak. However, Russia is alongside Brazil, Mexico and Peru as one of the countries where the death toll from the virus is rising fast. Below, we see that the number of new cases and deaths from the virus in the US appears to have also moved beyond its peak. The east coast - particularly New York state - is the hardest-hit area. The White House has sent a memo to staff directing more aides to wear masks when in the West Wing or avoid President Trump's office altogether if possible. The memo was obtained by US media moments before Trump is due to deliver remarks from the White House on the role of testing in the effort to reopen the country's economy. It also comes asthree high-ranking members of the White House coronavirus taskforce- including top disease expert Anthony Fauci - are in self-isolation after two White House staff members tested positive. According to US media, the latest White House memo on masks is unlikely to apply to Trump, who has so far not worn one during the pandemic. Trump aides are wearing masks in the White House Rose Garden Our colleague Anthony Zurcher is at the White House, where he says the number of Trump aides wearing masks has already risen since last week. He says all of the press aides are donning masks for Trump's briefing. Reality Check The health secretary set a target of 100,000 tests per day in the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government hit its daily testing target with 100,490 tests on Sunday. The target, set by Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month, was for 100,000 tests per day in the UK to diagnose coronavirus. The government said the figure was reached on 30 April and then 1 May - although there was some criticism about how tests were counted - but the target was then missed for eight consecutive days. Johnson has talked of raising the target further to 200,000 tests per day by the end of this month. We have been looking athow the government is getting on with seven of its coronavirus targets- including testing. Nduka OrjinmoBBC News, Lagos Prodest Home after bulldozers ripped through part of the hotel The authorities in Nigeria's oil-rich southern Rivers state have demolished two hotels over an alleged breach of lockdown rules intended to contain the spread of coronavirus. State Governor Nyesom Wike, who supervised the tearing down of Edemete Hotel and Prodest Home on Sunday, said the operators had flouted an order that hotels should be closed. He said people who had tested positive for the virus had been found in hotels across the state. But he did not say if anyone who had Covid-19 had been staying in either of the demolished hotels. Read the full story here. Reality Check Schools have been shut as part of the strategy to curb the spread of the virus The UK prime minister was asked about the childcare provision for people expected to go back to work before schools reopen. Boris Johnson says if people do not have access to childcare, it is only fair to see that as a barrier to their ability to go back to work. People who cannot work from home - such as those in the manufacturing and construction sectors - are being ""actively encouraged"" to return to work from Wednesday. But ministers say schools in England should prepare to begin to open for more pupils from 1 June, with only selected year groups - including Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - going back in smaller class sizes. Secondary schools and FE colleges are also being told to plan for some face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils. Read more about the timetable for schools reopening. The last question of the press conference concerned whether schools contribute to the infection rate. ""They
do contribute a certain amount, and this is what is being modelled carefully,"" replied Chris Whitty. ""We are very committed to publishing all of the science behind Sage. ""That is happening but never as fast as people want."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
