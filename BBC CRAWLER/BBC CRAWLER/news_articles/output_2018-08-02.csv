'Scream heard' before midwife vanished,"Samantha Eastwood was last seen leaving work on Friday morning A scream was heard near the home of a midwife who has been missing for nearly a week, police have said. Samantha Eastwood, 28, was last seen leaving Royal Stoke University Hospital at 07:45 BST on Friday and did not return later for her night shift. She has not used her bank cards or car since going missing, police believe. Det Supt Simon Duffy said the report by neighbours of hearing a scream ""forms part of one of a number of theories"" regarding Ms Eastwood's disappearance. The noise was heard in the vicinity of Ms Eastwood's address in Stockton Brook, Stoke-on-Trent, at about 14:00 on Friday. Samantha Eastwood is recently single though had been planning to marry in June, police said Det Supt Duffy said he was unable to comment further on this element of the investigation. The force is treating her case as a ""high-risk missing person"" inquiry. A 32-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent, who wasarrested earlier this week on suspicion of kidnapfollowing her disappearance, has been released under investigation. This video can not be played The last CCTV footage of the missing midwife has been released Several locations are being searched and the public has been urged to report any sightings of vehicles parked in ""strange locations"", isolated areas or lay-bys. Midlands Live: Artist's Harry Kane fiver spent in off licence; Armed police arrest two Det Supt Duffy said: ""As far as we can ascertain, she's taken no bank cards with her. ""That has obviously ramped up the concern because we can't see there's been any access to finances through usual means, and similarly, the vehicle as well. ""That just leads us to say it is totally out of character."" Police are treating the disappearance of Samantha Eastwood as a ""high risk missing person"" inquiry Police saidshe had been in a relationship and engaged, but it had been broken off earlier in the year and she is currently single and living alone. A post shared on Facebook indicated that Ms Eastwood appeared to have been selling her wedding dress on an online marketplace. Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Liz Rix, chief nurse at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, said: ""The way her colleagues talk about Sam, it's clear that she is an absolutely dedicated and committed midwife. ""We do call ourselves a family and one of our family is missing. ""We want to see Sam back where she belongs, working with the team that absolutely loves her."" This video can not be played ""One of our family is missing"", says chief nurse Liz Rix Earlier on social media, Ms Rix said it had been a ""difficult week"" for staff at Royal Stoke University Hospital where Ms Eastwood works. She added that when Ms Eastwood did not turn up for work ""her colleagues immediately knew something was not right"". ""Everyone here is praying for her safe return and our thoughts are with Sam's family. ""If Sam reads this, I just want to say that we really miss you and we just want to know that you are safe"", she said. CCTV footage of missing midwife released.

Police removed opposition officials from the electoral commission stage when they rejected the results. The chairman of Mr Chamisa's MDC Alliance said the count could not be verified.

""This land is home to all of us and we will sink or swim together,""Mr Mnangagwa said in a series of tweets,external. The day after the election, the MDC Alliance said Mr Chamisa had won the presidential vote, pre-empting an official announcement and prompting its supporters to celebrate in some areas of Harare.

Apple's market value hits $1 trillion,"Apple has become the world's first public company to be worth $1 trillion (Â£767bn). The iPhone maker's market value reached the figure in New York on Thursday and its shares closed at a new record high of $207.39. The stock has been rising since Tuesday when it reported better than expected results for the three months to June. Apple beat Silicon Valley rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft to become the first to hit the $1 trillion valuation. Since the iPhone first went on sale in 2007, Apple shares have soared by 1,100% and have jumped almost a third in the past year. The rise is even more astonishing - 50,000% - since the company first listed in 1980. That dwarfs the 2,000% increase for the S&P 500 index over the same period. Apple traces its origins to the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976 and was initially best known for its Mac personal computers before its smartphone paved the way for the app economy. Mr Jobs, who died in 2011 and was succeeded as chief executive by Tim Cook, oversaw the development of the iPhone, which transformed Apple's fortunes. In 2006 the company had sales of less than $20bn and posted profits of almost $2bn. Last year its sales hit $229bn, with profits of $48.4bn, making it the most profitable listed US company. PetroChina was briefly worth about $1.1 trillion after floating in Shanghai in 2007, although most of its shares were held by the Chinese government. It is now worth about $220bn. Despite its $1 trillion price tag, many analysts still do not view Apple's shares as expensive given that they trade at about 15 times expected profits, compared with a figure of 82 for Amazon and 25 times for Microsoft. Also boosting Apple shares in recent months was the company's decision to set aside $100bn to buy back stock. This video can not be played Why Apple is worth $1 trillion... and who could challenge it Apple opened a store in Milan last week By Dave Lee, North America technology reporter It may have been the vision of Steve Jobs that hurtled Apple towards this milestone, but it was the business acumen of Tim Cook that tipped them over. While other tech stocks have struggled, Apple has soared ahead. The surge in its shares has been driven by two key factors. It is selling fewer iPhones, but by releasing a more expensive version last year, it is making more money per device. Apple has also diversified the sources of its profits. It now makes about $10bn every three months from services such as selling apps, cloud storage and music streaming. The firm told investors this week that it expected a very strong end to the year helped, naturally, by the release of yet another new iPhone. Stock markets are volatile, and a small but growing threat from Chinese smartphone makers might eat into Apple's margins in the coming years. But no matter what your view of the company and its products, Apple devices have changed the world - and today made financial history as well. Why Apple is worth $1 trillion.

Man who threw baby out of window jailed,"Sean Ziemelis, 31, has been sentenced to life with a minimum term of 12 years A man who threw a seven-month-old baby and its mother out of a window has been jailed for life. Sean Ziemelis also gouged the boy's eyes and strangled him after using cannabis, Luton Crown Court heard. The baby suffered superficial injuries after he was caught by a crowd which gathered underneath the window of the first floor flat in Luton on 1 August 2017. Ziemelis, 31, of Reginald Street, Luton, admitted attempted murder. He also pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm and common assault. Prosecutor James Lofthouse said Ziemelis had taken cannabis the previous night. At 02:00 BST on 1 August, the child's mother found Ziemelis with his thumbs in the baby's eyes. She screamed for help and he started to strangle the boy, the court heard. The 31-year-old then produced a knife and was hit with a piece of wood by the baby's grandmother before throwing her across the room. The baby's mother was punched until she fell in and out of consciousness. When police arrived Ziemelis was covered in blood Mr Lofthouse said: ""He dangled him out of the window for a couple of minutes. ""A crowd had gathered because of the commotion. People were shouting not to hurt the baby."" The court heard Ziemelis threw the baby away from the crowd, but a man managed to catch him. He then threw the mother out of the window. She sustained cuts, bruises and a loose tooth after her fall was broken by bins which neighbours had placed underneath the window. Members of the public dragged Ziemelis out of the window and he was hit with fists and bottles. When police arrived, he told them he did not remember throwing the baby or the mother. Psychiatrist Dr David Bond said Ziemelis' risk of causing serious harm to the public was increased when he used cannabis. Sentencing him to life in prison with a minimum term of 12 years, Judge Richard Foster said: ""I do not need a professional to tell me you are dangerous. Anyone who could do that to a child is dangerous. ""The appropriate sentence is life imprisonment. Any other sentence would not be adequate to reflect what happened"" Ziemelis will be treated under the Mental Health Act at Brockfield House before returning to prison.

US accuses Russia of 'pervasive' meddling,"This video can not be played Dan Coats: Russia's 'pervasive campaign' against US continues US national security chiefs have lined up to warn American democracy is in the ""crosshairs"" of foreign adversaries for elections in 2018 and 2020. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said: ""We continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to weaken and divide the US."" Mr Coats said the efforts were less robust so far than in 2016, and did not appear directed at a single party. The Kremlin denies US claims it meddled in its last presidential election. US National Security Adviser John Bolton, FBI Director Chris Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also spoke at Thursday's White House news conference. Trump sides with Russia against FBI Who's who in Trump-Russia drama?,external All you need to know about Trump Russia story Mr Coats said Russia was not the only country that was trying to intervene in US elections, without elaborating. One reporter questioned whether US President Donald Trump had adequately challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin on the matter at their bilateral summit in Finland last month. (L-R) White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and National Security Agency Director General Paul Nakasone at Mr Bolton stepped forward to maintain that it had been discussed. ""President Putin said the first issue that President Trump raised was election meddling,"" the national security adviser told reporters. Mr Coats was asked if he was accusing rogue Russian individuals or the Kremlin itself of intervening in US elections. ""Both,"" the intelligence director replied. He said the hackers were trying to steal information from candidates and government officials and were seeking to influence voters through social media bots. Mr Coats said: ""Our focus here today is simply to tell the American people we acknowledge the threat. It is real."" He added that agencies were meeting weekly to focus on election security ahead of the mid-term elections in November when most of the US Congress faces the voters. Ms Nielsen said: ""Our democracy itself is in the crosshairs. ""Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy and it has become clear that they have become the target of our adversaries."" This video can not be played The ways Trump and Putin see eye to eye President Donald Trump was strongly criticised last month for not condemning alleged Russian actions, while he was in Helsinki. He has continually called investigations into the matter - and whether his campaign team colluded with Moscow in 2016 - as a witch-hunt. But the message from the White House on Thursday could not have been clearer. The FBI director said: ""Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day. ""This is a threat that we need to take extremely seriously."" The NSA director said his agency and US Cyber Command were ""prepared to conduct operations against those actors attempting to undermine our nation's midterm elections"".

The Met said he was pronounced dead at the scene. The two men in custody, aged 18 and 19, were arrested nearby, officers added. The two other wounded men, aged 16 and 31, were airlifted to hospital, where they remain. Drill is a dark form of rap music often featuring violent lyrics. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Kamara spoke about its effect on crime in London. ""You see with the crime that's happening right now, music does influence it. You've got to put your hands up and say drill music does influence it,"" he said. ""But knife crime and gun crime has been going on way before drill music, so if you want to talk about 10 years, 20 years, people were still getting cheffed up [attacked with knives].""

Some feature references to other groups in the capital, including long-running rivals Zone 2 from Peckham. In one track, Moscow17 tell Zone 2 to ""check the scoreboard"", while another asks ""how you gonna make it even?"". Mr Kamara was accused and cleared of murdering Mr Mohamed - a brother of a member of Zone 2 - alongside another member of Moscow17, Kevin Aka-Kadjo.

A police cordon remains in place at the scene on Warham Street, Camberwell Speaking outside the family home, Mr Kamara's father Lamin Kama said: ""Our family are in a lot of distress at the moment."" He declined to comment further, adding only that his son had three brothers. A neighbour, who gave his name only as Andy, said: ""My dog was going crazy and when I looked out there was this guy lying on the floor. There was blood.""

Drill: Is it right to blame the music genre for violence? Another neighbour, Sidney Virgo, 80, said: ""I knew this was going to happen.

Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, also part of the Moscow17 drill group, was found with fatal gunshot wounds in the same street in which Mr Kamara was stabbed At the time of his death, 17-year-old Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton's mother, Pretana Morgan, called for a halt in the wave of violence in the capital. ""Let my son be the last and be an example to everyone. Just let it stop. What must be, must be,"" she said. ""It's not about race, it's not about nation, it's not about culture. Nothing. It's just a human race."" Wednesday's stabbing happened hours after Cressida Dickreportedly said rates of violence in the capital were stabilising,external. It is the 85th homicide in the capital so far this year. A spike in the number of killings earlier in the year saw London's murder rate overtake that of New York, with knife crime a major factor. Harriet Harman, MP for Camberwell and Peckham, said ""anxiety"" about recent local violence has now turned to ""anger"".

Firefighter couldn't tell mum she would die,"Zainab Deen died with her two-year-old son A firefighter has recalled having to keep up a pretence that a woman trapped in the Grenfell Tower fire was going to be saved - despite knowing crews were unable to reach her. Christopher Batcheldor was on the phone to Zainab Deen, who was trapped on the 14th floor with her two-year-old son. Midway through the call he learnt crews could not get past the 12th floor. ""I basically lied to her and continued to tell her that we were coming for her,"" he told the Grenfell inquiry. He broke down on Thursday as he recalled the phone call, which lasted over an hour. Ms Deen, 32, and her son, Jeremiah, both died in the fire. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Grenfell inquiry: What five reports reveal Mr Batcheldor, a crew manager at Fulham, had been handed the phone to speak to Ms Deen by a man called Francis, who he believed was her brother. He told how Ms Deen's son died while he was on the phone to her. He recalled hearing a young boy crying at the beginning of the call, but was later told by Ms Deen, ""My boy's dead"" and ""I want to be with my son"". He replied: ""Don't talk like that. We are coming for you. Don't give up."" He then passed the phone back to Francis and told him to ""tell her you love her and that you are waiting for her. Tell her to keep fighting"". Jeremiah was trapped with his mother on the 14th floor When Mr Batcheldor learnt Ms Deen could not be rescued, he said he ""just couldn't tell her"". He said he had to ""keep up the pretence that she was OK"" for Francis, even when she was no longer responding. After five to 10 minutes of quiet he heard ""ear-splitting screams"" before silence. He knew Ms Deen had died but could not bring himself to tell Francis and instead told him they had been disconnected and perhaps her battery had gone. Mr Batcheldor broke down as he recalled the conversation The inquiry has heard five weeks of evidence from London Fire Brigade personnel and in October will hear from survivors, the bereaved and the local community. The inquiry's chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said he hoped all evidence would be heard by the end of 2018 with an interim report released early in the new year.

Apple's market value hits $1 trillionThe iPhone maker's value soars following better-than-expected quarterly results this week.Business,"Apple has become the world's first public company to be worth $1 trillion (Â£767bn). The iPhone maker's market value reached the figure in New York on Thursday and its shares closed at a new record high of $207.39. The stock has been rising since Tuesday when it reported better than expected results for the three months to June. Apple beat Silicon Valley rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft to become the first to hit the $1 trillion valuation. Since the iPhone first went on sale in 2007, Apple shares have soared by 1,100% and have jumped almost a third in the past year. The rise is even more astonishing - 50,000% - since the company first listed in 1980. That dwarfs the 2,000% increase for the S&P 500 index over the same period. Apple traces its origins to the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976 and was initially best known for its Mac personal computers before its smartphone paved the way for the app economy. Mr Jobs, who died in 2011 and was succeeded as chief executive by Tim Cook, oversaw the development of the iPhone, which transformed Apple's fortunes. In 2006 the company had sales of less than $20bn and posted profits of almost $2bn. Last year its sales hit $229bn, with profits of $48.4bn, making it the most profitable listed US company. PetroChina was briefly worth about $1.1 trillion after floating in Shanghai in 2007, although most of its shares were held by the Chinese government. It is now worth about $220bn. Despite its $1 trillion price tag, many analysts still do not view Apple's shares as expensive given that they trade at about 15 times expected profits, compared with a figure of 82 for Amazon and 25 times for Microsoft. Also boosting Apple shares in recent months was the company's decision to set aside $100bn to buy back stock. This video can not be played Why Apple is worth $1 trillion... and who could challenge it Apple opened a store in Milan last week By Dave Lee, North America technology reporter It may have been the vision of Steve Jobs that hurtled Apple towards this milestone, but it was the business acumen of Tim Cook that tipped them over. While other tech stocks have struggled, Apple has soared ahead. The surge in its shares has been driven by two key factors. It is selling fewer iPhones, but by releasing a more expensive version last year, it is making more money per device. Apple has also diversified the sources of its profits. It now makes about $10bn every three months from services such as selling apps, cloud storage and music streaming. The firm told investors this week that it expected a very strong end to the year helped, naturally, by the release of yet another new iPhone. Stock markets are volatile, and a small but growing threat from Chinese smartphone makers might eat into Apple's margins in the coming years. But no matter what your view of the company and its products, Apple devices have changed the world - and today made financial history as well. Why Apple is worth $1 trillion.

Police urge dogs to wear shoes,"Zurich City Police dogs are equipped with boots so that they don't burn their feet on hot walkways Police in the Swiss city of Zurich are urging owners to buy shoes for their dogs, in order to protect their paws in the high temperatures, reports say. According to the public broadcaster SRF, the police in Zurich have launched the ""Hot Dog campaign"",external, and are educating dog owners on how they can protect their four-legged friends in the hot weather, given that the overheated pavements can be painful on their feet. A prolonged heatwave throughout Europe means that Switzerland has had one of the hottest summers since records began in 1864, with temperatures this July hovering around 30C (86F).Parts of the country have also experienced droughts, the SwissInfo news website reports,external. According to Zurich Police Spokesperson Michael Walker, 30 degrees can feel like 50-55 degrees on the ground, and can cause particular discomfort to canines. ""When a dog walks on hot asphalt, he can burn his feet - just like a human walking barefoot,"" he tells SRF. The Zurich City Police are advising owners to check before taking their dogs out on walks whether the ground is too hot, by measuring the temperature with the back of their hand for five seconds. They are also advising pet owners against leaving animals in hot cars, and ensuring that they have enough drinking water.

Hundreds of Facebook users have praised the campaign, which features pictures of some of the service dogs wearing protective footwear. Zurich City Police says that the dogs also wear shoes while investigating break-ins, and to protect car seats when they take sniffer dogs inside a vehicle.

Human actions boosted heatwave oddsReality Check: Mapping the global heatwave,"The current UK heat wave has dried out some reservoirs Climate change resulting from human activities made the current Europe-wide heatwave more than twice as likely to occur, say scientists. Researchers compared the current high temperatures with historical records from seven weather stations, in different parts of Europe. Their preliminary report found that the ""signal of climate change is unambiguous,"" in this summer's heat. They also say the scale of the heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented. 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves How long will it last? Your heatwave questions Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands' The scale and breadth of the current heat being experienced across Europe has prompted many questions about the influence of global warming on extreme events. To try and see if there is a connection, researchers looked at data from seven weather stations, in Finland, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. They chose these locations because they all had digitised records dating back to the early 1900s, unlike the UK. The team also used computer models to assess the scale of human-influenced climate change. The researchers found that in the weather stations in the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark, climate change has generally increased the odds of the current heatwave by more than two-fold. This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 There are several different definitions of what exactly makes a heatwave but the researchers in this study have gone with the hottest consecutive three-day period in a year. This has allowed them to  compare the data from the seven different locations over the past 100 years or so. ""In many parts of Europe three day heat is not very exceptional and you could argue that it would be better to look at longer,"" said Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford, one of the study's authors. ""But we've looked at longer periods and it doesn't change the result very much."" The researchers also say the warmest three days in succession this year may not yet have happened but they believe that even if next week is warmer, it won't change the overall impact. Scientists are loath to say a specific event was ""caused"" by climate change - however they believe that this new study joins a growing list of solid links between rising temperatures and extreme events. One thing the researchers can't say right now is whether the high pressure system that has been blocked over Europe for almost two months was caused by climate change. The scientists, from theWorld Weather Attribution,externalgroup say they will address this question when they formally publish their findings in a scientific journal later this year. They can't be that definite. However the study does give figures for what are termed ""return periods"" or the chances of something happening again. Hippos in a zoo in Italy were given frozen watermelon to cope with the heat They estimate that in southern Scandinavia it's likely there will be a similar heatwave every 10 years, while further south, in the Netherlands, it's likely to be once every five years. This ties in with projections from several scientists that the type of heatwave we've had this summer could occur every second year by the 2040s. ""The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable - the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford. ""What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace - in some cases, it already has,"" she added. While acknowledging that the current heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented in the historical record, the researchers were not able to clearly resolve the impact of human influence. That's because summer temperatures there vary a good deal from year to year so the trend was impossible to estimate from the observations, the authors said. Despite their reservations about the Arctic they argue that their initial findings should prompt more action on cutting carbon from governments. ""We are not taking the right measures,"" said Dr Robert Vautard, from the CNRS in France. ""We are discovering climate change rather than doing something against it."" It involves some serious number crunching! This new research is called an attribution study - the researchers work out how often these type of extreme heat events have happened at each of the weather stations they looked at. The heatwave has been linked to extensive forest fires in Sweden They compare those findings to modelled results of the climate without the influence of human emissions of carbon dioxide. This way they can work out how much climate change has tipped the odds of a rare event happening. The list continues to grow. The major European heatwave of 2003 was among the first events to be linked though it took scientists several years to do it - eventually they concluded that human induced climate change had made the event 500% more likely! These days the attributions studies are much faster - just last year scientists concluded that the flooding in Houston, Texas was made 38% more likely by climate change while the so-called ""Lucifer"" heatwave in Eastern Europe was made 10 times more likely.  This new study was completed in less than a week.

Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave,"Countries across the world have been facing extremely high temperatures this summer. From the UK, across to Scandinavia and Japan, the hot weather is expected to continue for the rest of the month. Japan has just declared a natural disaster, with high temperatures leading to thousands being admitted to hospital with heat stroke. Various temperature records forJuly were brokenin southern California, eastern Canada, Algeria and Norway. In Oman, the coolest overnight temperature was recorded at 42.6 C - which may well have been the highest low ever. Sweden has been hit by forest fires spreading as far north asthe Arctic Circle. In Greece, at least 60 people have diedin wildfiresin the region around Athens. Reality Check has looked at the global picture - which countries have been hotter than normal? Many countries have experienced above average temperatures in the month of July so far. The map shows the countries where temperatures are higher or lower compared with what you'd expect for this period of time. Blue colours indicate cooler temperatures than the 1981-2010 regional average, and red shows where's its been hotter. The countries where it has been much warmer than average: UK, Scandinavia (in particular Norway and Sweden), eastern Canada, parts of eastern Siberia, Japan and the region around the Caspian Sea. It's been colder than average in: Parts of southern Europe including Spain and Portugal, parts of northern Siberia in Russia and and the southernmost part of South America. Based on the data used to populate the map, collected by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the hottest July on record in Europe was 2010. Then it was two degrees above the average. July 2018 is likely to rank among the hottest for Europe, but is unlikely to be number one. Globally the month was the fifth hottest June since 1880, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information. The hottest June was 2016 where the global temperature was 0.91C above the average. It was the 42nd consecutive June and the 402nd consecutive month with temperatures above average, according to their data. In the UK, this June was provisionally the third warmest since 1910 and the average maximum temperatures were between 2 and 3 Â°C above average in most areas, according to theUK Met Office,external. There's never one single factor that explains hot weather around the world. The BBC's science editor David Shukman says: ""What is striking now is that multiple heatwaves are happening at the same time."" ""The key is the jet stream. This year it's been meandering in great loops and the UK has ended up to the south of it. Add to that sea temperatures similar to previous heatwaves and climate change, the warming of the atmosphere - it all makes heatwaves more likely. ""Climate scientists are not saying we will get heatwaves every year. But they do say the risks of extreme heat are going up.""

Who were the first residents of Stonehenge?,"Researchers have shown that cremated humans at Stonehenge were from the same region of Wales as the stones used in construction. The key question was to understand the geographic origin of the people buried at Stonehenge. The key innovation was finding that high temperatures of cremation can crystallise a skull, locking in the chemical signal of its origin. The findings have beenpublished in the journal Scientific Reports.,external The first long-term residents of Stonehenge, along with the first stones, arrived about 5,000 years ago. While it is already known that the""bluestones"" that were first used to build Stonehengewere transported from 150 miles (240 km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire, almost nothing is known about the people involved. The scientists' work shows that both people and materials were moving between the regions and that, for some of these people, the move was permanent. When their lives ended, their cremated remains were placed under the ancient monument in what is now Wiltshire. A cremated skull fragment from the site Lead author Dr Christophe Snoeck compared the levels of different forms, or isotopes, of the element strontium against a national database to work out where the cremated individuals spent the last years of their lives. Strontium is present in many bedrocks. And different geographical areas have distinctive strontium signatures. So by matching the strontium ""fingerprints"" in human remains to the strontium profiles of different geographical regions, a person's place of origin can be roughly determined. Dr Snoeck, who is now an international expert in cremation following a PhD at the University of Oxford, said that ""about 40% of the cremated individuals did not spend their later lives on the Wessex chalk where their remains were found."" While the news of Stonehenge has tended to focus on ""how"" and ""why"" it was built, the question of ""who"" built it is often forgotten. With this new method, the authors were able to be precise about where the cremated persons came from. Unfortunately, the cremation destroyed other chemical signals that might tell us who these people were, and their social rank. The bluestones at Stonehenge are thought to have been quarried in Wales However, Dr Rick Schulting, senior author on the study, said: ""These must have been important people. Being buried at Stonehenge is the ancient equivalent of being interred in Westminster Abbey today."" He said: ""The evidence suggests that some of the people buried at Stonehenge must have spent much of their last 10 or so years in Wales. Although we tend to think that immigration is a new thing, these people were obviously able to travel substantial distances across difficult terrain."" Now that this new technique has been proven to work, the scientists would like to sample other cremated remains at the iconic Stonehenge site to see if the Welsh connection was transient or sustained over many years. The study will also open up research on many other cremated remains that have been found across the UK. They would also like to work out how the remains were cremated, and why cremation is sometimes preferred over burial. The lead scientist, Christophe, has already moved on. Since completing his PhD at Oxford, he has immigrated to Belgium, where he iscoordinating a large project,externalon migration and cremation in pre-historic Belgium.

Firefighter 'lied to woman he knew would die',"Zainab Deen died with her two-year-old son A firefighter has recalled having to keep up a pretence that a woman trapped in the Grenfell Tower fire was going to be saved - despite knowing crews were unable to reach her. Christopher Batcheldor was on the phone to Zainab Deen, who was trapped on the 14th floor with her two-year-old son. Midway through the call he learnt crews could not get past the 12th floor. ""I basically lied to her and continued to tell her that we were coming for her,"" he told the Grenfell inquiry. He broke down on Thursday as he recalled the phone call, which lasted over an hour. Ms Deen, 32, and her son, Jeremiah, both died in the fire. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Grenfell inquiry: What five reports reveal Mr Batcheldor, a crew manager at Fulham, had been handed the phone to speak to Ms Deen by a man called Francis, who he believed was her brother. He told how Ms Deen's son died while he was on the phone to her. He recalled hearing a young boy crying at the beginning of the call, but was later told by Ms Deen, ""My boy's dead"" and ""I want to be with my son"". He replied: ""Don't talk like that. We are coming for you. Don't give up."" He then passed the phone back to Francis and told him to ""tell her you love her and that you are waiting for her. Tell her to keep fighting"". Jeremiah was trapped with his mother on the 14th floor When Mr Batcheldor learnt Ms Deen could not be rescued, he said he ""just couldn't tell her"". He said he had to ""keep up the pretence that she was OK"" for Francis, even when she was no longer responding. After five to 10 minutes of quiet he heard ""ear-splitting screams"" before silence. He knew Ms Deen had died but could not bring himself to tell Francis and instead told him they had been disconnected and perhaps her battery had gone. Mr Batcheldor broke down as he recalled the conversation The inquiry has heard five weeks of evidence from London Fire Brigade personnel and in October will hear from survivors, the bereaved and the local community. The inquiry's chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said he hoped all evidence would be heard by the end of 2018 with an interim report released early in the new year.

Warning as Europe's heat nears record,"In Madrid, the heat has driven people to the city's fountains As Europe bakes in another heatwave, forecasters say the all-time temperature record could be broken in the coming days. The current European record is 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in July 1977. Temperatures are rising in Spain and Portugal, aided by a surge of hot air sweeping in from Africa. BBC Weather says the current forecast for southwestern Spain and southern and southeastern Portugal is 47C (116.6F) on both Friday and Saturday. Portugal's national record is 47.4C (117.3F), set in 2003. Spain's peak of 47.3C (117.1F) was only set in July last year. In the UK, temperatures are expected to reach about 33C (91.4F) in the southeast. In pictures: Europe heatwave Spain's national weather service has put a warning in place until at least Sunday, saying the heatwave will be ""especially intense and lasting in the southwest"". Europe's weather warning group, Meteoalarm, has already issued red warnings - categorised as very dangerous and posing a risk to life - for much of southern Portugal and for the Badajoz province in Spain.

Sweden's highest peak, a glacier on the Kebnekaise mountain, is melting at a rate of several centimetres a day. Scientists monitoring the decline say the glacier will lose its title of the highest point to the mountain's northern tip. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has urged drivers to watch out for reindeer and sheep sheltering in tunnels to cool down. Tore Lysberg of the administration told AFP news agency that ""the animals retreat to colder places; both reindeer and sheep find refuge in tunnels and shaded areas"". The temperature reached 31.2C on Wednesday in Finnmark, inside the Arctic Circle, but it is now below 20C. Wildfires have raged across Greece killing more than 90 people, and Sweden has battled dozens of fires as far north as the Arctic Circle. While fires are an annual problem in much of Europe, the hot, dry conditions for an extended period of time made those fires much more likely. Researchers said thatclimate change made Europe's extended heatwave twice as likelyas it would otherwise have been. The long, hot summer has been so consistent that it has put a strain onGerman breweries, who have sold so much beer that there is a bottle shortage- bouncing back from record low sales last year. And in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, extremely low water levels in the river Elbe have led to the discovery of World War Two grenades and ammunition, police said. A few discoveries were made by people actively searching for old explosives on the river bed - which police warned was both ""forbidden and dangerous"".

Ripped-up lottery ticket wins ÃÂ£58m jackpot,"This video can not be played Fred and Lesley Higgins matched all the numbers in the Euromillions draw. A retired couple have won a Â£58m lottery jackpot - despite the winning ticket being mistakenly ripped in two. Fred and Lesley Higgins, from Aberdeenshire, matched all the numbers in the Euromillions draw on 10 July. But when Mr Higgins checked his numbers, the shop assistant initially told him it was not a winner, ripped up the ticket and threw it away. When the machine then told them to contact Camelot, it was quickly retrieved from the bin. When he got home and checked the numbers, Mr Higgins discovered they had scooped a total of Â£57,975,367. Mr Higgins, 67, and his wife Lesley, 57, from Laurencekirk, were regular players of the Tuesday and Friday draw. Mr Higgins took last week's tickets into his local shop to be checked while he bought his tickets for the following week. See more stories and videos like this He asked the retailer to run them through the machine in case of a winner. He said: ""I handed the ticket over and the young man put it through the machine, telling me it wasn't a winner.Â  He ripped the ticket in two and threw it into the bin, as they would with all non-winning tickets.Â  But this time, the terminal produced a chitty which said I needed to retain my ticket and call Camelot. ""The retailer immediately grabbed it out of the bin and handed it to me, not realising it was a winner before he discarded it."" Money worries over: Lesley Higgins has now handed in her notice as she prepares for a more leisurely lifestyle Although the ticket had been torn in two, all the numbers were still clear, so Mr Higgins took it back home to make the call. While his wife was having a nap, he logged onto the National Lottery website to double-check the numbers. He said: ""The first matched, then the second matched, match, match - we had them all. ""When Lesley woke, I explained we had a winning ticket and what had happened.Â I showed her the numbers, asked her to check and she misread them, thinking we were Â£5.7m richer rather than an amazing Â£57m. ""I felt really calm at that point - I think it was just sinking in - so I then called Camelot and explained what had happened."" The torn ticket made processing the win slightly more complicated. A security team came out to see the couple and visit the store to check the course of events and look at the CCTV footage. The couple revealed they had kept the ticket at their home while the investigation took place. Mrs Higgins, who worked as an account manager at the Montrose Port Authority, said: ""It was in an envelope, in a filing cabinet, up the stairs. And I had written on the envelope, in red letters, Money Worries Over! ""It was there for a whole week and the only person we told was my daughter."" Lesley Higgins was ""elated"" to discover the win The couple have their eye on buying a property abroad With the money firmly in their account, the couple - who have been married for 35 years - have already made their first purchase, a brand new Audi Cabriolet. Mr Higgins, a retired Audi administrator, said: ""We had a really comfortable life before the win but we did have dreams of living abroad.Â  We love Gozo, which is where my niece lives, so we always thought we would get somewhere out there. ""But I have to say since we won, I've got my eye on somewhere in France and Lesley seems to be looking at property in Barbados. I think it might be fun to explore a few places before we commit to buying anything."" And as a keen collector of malt whisky, Mr Higgins said there may be a few more to add to his collection.Â He added: ""It is our wedding anniversary on 20 August and my birthday a couple of days later, so I think a celebration is in order before we decide what comes next."" The couple bought and checked their winning ticket at the Scotmid in High Street, Laurencekirk. Sean Grant is relieved at the happy ending after ripping the winning lottery ticket The assistant who threw away the ticket was Sean Grant. He told the BBC it was out of habit that he binned the Â£58m ticket: ""Mr Higgins came in with 2 lottery tickets for me to check. ""The first one wasn't a winner so I binned it. The second one was a winner but I didn't expect it to be that much. I just ripped it and binned it because 99% of people don't want the ticket returned to them. ""I went back to the lottery machine and it said it was in excess of what we could pay so I had to get the ticket out of the bin and return it to Mr Higgins."" He added: ""I apologised and said that he had to phone Camelot and that he had won a decent amount of money but I didn't expect it to be that much, mind. To hear that they had won Â£58m was just amazing and for a local couple it's even better. I don't even pay out Â£50 or Â£100, never mind Â£58m."" A spokeswoman for Scotmid said: ""Huge congratulations to Fred and Lesley Higgins - we are delighted for them. We have been working closely with the winners, Camelot and our store management to support due process. ""The individual concerned acted quickly and openly and rectified the situation. The most important thing is that two people's lives have changed forever and all involved agree this was an honest mistake that was immediately rectified, reported and resolved."" The winning Euromillions numbers from the draw on 10 July were 3, 8, 26, 33, 45 and the two Lucky Stars were 7 and 10. Christine and Colin Weir have used their fortune to fund a number of good causes Chris and Colin Weir - Â£161m Colin and Christine Weir became the UK's biggest lottery winners when they scooped Â£161m in a Euromillions draw in July 2011. The couple, from Largs, North Ayrshire, have used their money for political and charitable causes. They have invested heavily in Partick Thistle football club, donated a significant amount to the SNP and the Yes Scotland campaign and launched the Weir Trust, a philanthropic venture to support Scottish charities and community projects. It has given away about Â£5m since it was founded. David and Carol Martin took half of the Â£66m jackpot David and Carol Martin - Â£66m The couple from Hawick in the Scottish Borders won Â£66m in a National Lottery jackpot in January 2016. Carol said she was stunned when her husband said they had won. ""I thought he was just joking,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it."" Tommy and Linda Parker won Â£25m in October 2017 Tommy and Linda Parker - Â£25m Retired East Lothian man Tommy Parker vowed to build his wife Linda a house after their Â£25m win in the lotto in October 2017.

And I had written on the envelope, in red letters, Money Worries Over! ""It was there for a whole week and the only person we told was my daughter."" Lesley Higgins was ""elated"" to discover the win The couple have their eye on buying a property abroad With the money firmly in their account, the couple - who have been married for 35 years - have already made their first purchase, a brand new Audi Cabriolet. Mr Higgins, a retired Audi administrator, said: ""We had a really comfortable life before the win but we did have dreams of living abroad.Â  We love Gozo, which is where my niece lives, so we always thought we would get somewhere out there. ""But I have to say since we won, I've got my eye on somewhere in France and Lesley seems to be looking at property in Barbados. I think it might be fun to explore a few places before we commit to buying anything."" And as a keen collector of malt whisky, Mr Higgins said there may be a few more to add to his collection.Â He added: ""It is our wedding anniversary on 20 August and my birthday a couple of days later, so I think a celebration is in order before we decide what comes next."" The couple bought and checked their winning ticket at the Scotmid in High Street, Laurencekirk. Sean Grant is relieved at the happy ending after ripping the winning lottery ticket The assistant who threw away the ticket was Sean Grant. He told the BBC it was out of habit that he binned the Â£58m ticket: ""Mr Higgins came in with 2 lottery tickets for me to check. ""The first one wasn't a winner so I binned it. The second one was a winner but I didn't expect it to be that much. I just ripped it and binned it because 99% of people don't want the ticket returned to them. ""I went back to the lottery machine and it said it was in excess of what we could pay so I had to get the ticket out of the bin and return it to Mr Higgins."" He added: ""I apologised and said that he had to phone Camelot and that he had won a decent amount of money but I didn't expect it to be that much, mind. To hear that they had won Â£58m was just amazing and for a local couple it's even better. I don't even pay out Â£50 or Â£100, never mind Â£58m."" A spokeswoman for Scotmid said: ""Huge congratulations to Fred and Lesley Higgins - we are delighted for them. We have been working closely with the winners, Camelot and our store management to support due process. ""The individual concerned acted quickly and openly and rectified the situation. The most important thing is that two people's lives have changed forever and all involved agree this was an honest mistake that was immediately rectified, reported and resolved."" The winning Euromillions numbers from the draw on 10 July were 3, 8, 26, 33, 45 and the two Lucky Stars were 7 and 10. Christine and Colin Weir have used their fortune to fund a number of good causes Chris and Colin Weir - Â£161m Colin and Christine Weir became the UK's biggest lottery winners when they scooped Â£161m in a Euromillions draw in July 2011. The couple, from Largs, North Ayrshire, have used their money for political and charitable causes. They have invested heavily in Partick Thistle football club, donated a significant amount to the SNP and the Yes Scotland campaign and launched the Weir Trust, a philanthropic venture to support Scottish charities and community projects. It has given away about Â£5m since it was founded. David and Carol Martin took half of the Â£66m jackpot David and Carol Martin - Â£66m The couple from Hawick in the Scottish Borders won Â£66m in a National Lottery jackpot in January 2016. Carol said she was stunned when her husband said they had won. ""I thought he was just joking,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it."" Tommy and Linda Parker won Â£25m in October 2017 Tommy and Linda Parker - Â£25m Retired East Lothian man Tommy Parker vowed to build his wife Linda a house after their Â£25m win in the lotto in October 2017.

Who were the first residents of Stonehenge?The likely first long-term inhabitants of Stonehenge are revealed in a new study.Science & Environment,"Researchers have shown that cremated humans at Stonehenge were from the same region of Wales as the stones used in construction. The key question was to understand the geographic origin of the people buried at Stonehenge. The key innovation was finding that high temperatures of cremation can crystallise a skull, locking in the chemical signal of its origin. The findings have beenpublished in the journal Scientific Reports.,external The first long-term residents of Stonehenge, along with the first stones, arrived about 5,000 years ago. While it is already known that the""bluestones"" that were first used to build Stonehengewere transported from 150 miles (240 km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire, almost nothing is known about the people involved. The scientists' work shows that both people and materials were moving between the regions and that, for some of these people, the move was permanent. When their lives ended, their cremated remains were placed under the ancient monument in what is now Wiltshire. A cremated skull fragment from the site Lead author Dr Christophe Snoeck compared the levels of different forms, or isotopes, of the element strontium against a national database to work out where the cremated individuals spent the last years of their lives. Strontium is present in many bedrocks. And different geographical areas have distinctive strontium signatures. So by matching the strontium ""fingerprints"" in human remains to the strontium profiles of different geographical regions, a person's place of origin can be roughly determined. Dr Snoeck, who is now an international expert in cremation following a PhD at the University of Oxford, said that ""about 40% of the cremated individuals did not spend their later lives on the Wessex chalk where their remains were found."" While the news of Stonehenge has tended to focus on ""how"" and ""why"" it was built, the question of ""who"" built it is often forgotten. With this new method, the authors were able to be precise about where the cremated persons came from. Unfortunately, the cremation destroyed other chemical signals that might tell us who these people were, and their social rank. The bluestones at Stonehenge are thought to have been quarried in Wales However, Dr Rick Schulting, senior author on the study, said: ""These must have been important people. Being buried at Stonehenge is the ancient equivalent of being interred in Westminster Abbey today."" He said: ""The evidence suggests that some of the people buried at Stonehenge must have spent much of their last 10 or so years in Wales. Although we tend to think that immigration is a new thing, these people were obviously able to travel substantial distances across difficult terrain."" Now that this new technique has been proven to work, the scientists would like to sample other cremated remains at the iconic Stonehenge site to see if the Welsh connection was transient or sustained over many years. The study will also open up research on many other cremated remains that have been found across the UK. They would also like to work out how the remains were cremated, and why cremation is sometimes preferred over burial. The lead scientist, Christophe, has already moved on. Since completing his PhD at Oxford, he has immigrated to Belgium, where he iscoordinating a large project,externalon migration and cremation in pre-historic Belgium.

Corbyn hoping to speak at Jewish venue,"This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing opposition from Jewish organisations over plans to deliver a speech at a Jewish venue, the BBC understands. Labour had approached the Jewish Museum, in London, to ask if Mr Corbyn could speak there on Friday. Officials at the museum have turned down the request, but talks are said to be continuing about an event next week. The museum said it was ""interested in being a space that would facilitate genuine healing dialogue"" with Labour. A statement from the museum said: ""We seek to represent the entire Jewish community and welcome people from all backgrounds. We work to break down barriers."" Action against me ridiculous, says Hodge Labour 'shaken' by anti-Semitism row A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The BBC understands the museum is seeking clarification and reassurances about the nature of Mr Corbyn's speech. It also wants to ensure leading Jewish organisations are consulted and invited to the event and also to make sure that Mr Corbyn addresses specific concerns about Labour's code of conduct. The document is currently at the centre of an ongoing row about the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations. The Jewish Museum hosts an annual Holocaust Memorial Day event Sources have expressed concern that Mr Corbyn's planned speech could further damage relations between him and the Jewish community. Another source, at a leading Jewish organisation, expressed their strong opposition to the speech, dismissing it as a ""stunt"". They say Mr Corbyn has refused requests for a meeting and has not consulted them as promised in the wake of the row over the code of conduct.

'Scream heard' before midwife vanishedThe NHS worker has not used her bank cards or car since she was last seen leaving work on Friday.Stoke & Staffordshire,"Samantha Eastwood was last seen leaving work on Friday morning A scream was heard near the home of a midwife who has been missing for nearly a week, police have said. Samantha Eastwood, 28, was last seen leaving Royal Stoke University Hospital at 07:45 BST on Friday and did not return later for her night shift. She has not used her bank cards or car since going missing, police believe. Det Supt Simon Duffy said the report by neighbours of hearing a scream ""forms part of one of a number of theories"" regarding Ms Eastwood's disappearance. The noise was heard in the vicinity of Ms Eastwood's address in Stockton Brook, Stoke-on-Trent, at about 14:00 on Friday. Samantha Eastwood is recently single though had been planning to marry in June, police said Det Supt Duffy said he was unable to comment further on this element of the investigation. The force is treating her case as a ""high-risk missing person"" inquiry. A 32-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent, who wasarrested earlier this week on suspicion of kidnapfollowing her disappearance, has been released under investigation. This video can not be played The last CCTV footage of the missing midwife has been released Several locations are being searched and the public has been urged to report any sightings of vehicles parked in ""strange locations"", isolated areas or lay-bys. Midlands Live: Artist's Harry Kane fiver spent in off licence; Armed police arrest two Det Supt Duffy said: ""As far as we can ascertain, she's taken no bank cards with her. ""That has obviously ramped up the concern because we can't see there's been any access to finances through usual means, and similarly, the vehicle as well. ""That just leads us to say it is totally out of character."" Police are treating the disappearance of Samantha Eastwood as a ""high risk missing person"" inquiry Police saidshe had been in a relationship and engaged, but it had been broken off earlier in the year and she is currently single and living alone. A post shared on Facebook indicated that Ms Eastwood appeared to have been selling her wedding dress on an online marketplace. Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Liz Rix, chief nurse at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, said: ""The way her colleagues talk about Sam, it's clear that she is an absolutely dedicated and committed midwife. ""We do call ourselves a family and one of our family is missing. ""We want to see Sam back where she belongs, working with the team that absolutely loves her."" This video can not be played ""One of our family is missing"", says chief nurse Liz Rix Earlier on social media, Ms Rix said it had been a ""difficult week"" for staff at Royal Stoke University Hospital where Ms Eastwood works. She added that when Ms Eastwood did not turn up for work ""her colleagues immediately knew something was not right"". ""Everyone here is praying for her safe return and our thoughts are with Sam's family. ""If Sam reads this, I just want to say that we really miss you and we just want to know that you are safe"", she said. CCTV footage of missing midwife released.

iPhone demand boosts Apple profits,"This video can not be played Why Apple is worth $1 trillion... and who could challenge it Apple shares hit a record on Wednesday, pushing the market value of the tech giant closer to the $1 trillion mark. The shares rose more than 5% to end at more than $201, close to the roughly $207 price needed to make it a $1tn company. The rise came after Apple reported strong demand for its most expensive iPhones, boosting quarterly revenue despite just 1% growth in shipments. The average iPhone price hit $724 (Â£552), well above the expected $694. The firm said its $999 iPhone X - launched last year - remained its most popular iPhone model in the quarter and had driven the higher sales price. Revenue growth of 31% in Apple's services business, which includes the App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, also boosted the firm's performance. Is Samsung's Galaxy S9 flagship a flop? State firm hosts Apple's data in China Apple to close iPhone security loophole Overall the tech giant's revenue jumped 17% year-on-year to a quarterly record of $53.3bn (Â£40.6bn), with every region except Japan reporting double digit growth. Profits rose to $11.5bn, up 32% compared to the same period in 2017. ""The lesson Apple's management has learned from the iPhone X, is when you sell a smartphone for more than $1,000 you can sell fewer units and still reap the financial benefits,"" said analyst Thomas Forte from DA Davidson & Co. If Apple's momentum continues, it could be the first US company to hit a $1tr market value. Globally,PetroChina reached that milestone in 2007,external, though the market cap, which is generally calculated by multiplying the number of shares in a company by its current share price, was measured using the price of its Shanghai-listed shares, not those traded elsewhere, and has since fallen. Apple already claims a market capitalisation of about $975bn, making it the world's most valuable company, ahead of Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft. To reach the $1tn threshold, Apple will need to see further increases to its share price - though exactly how high the price has to climb depends on how many shares Apple has. That is changing as the firm is engaged in a generous share buyback programme, which it expanded by $100bn in May. The company is also vulnerable to trade tensions between the US and China, which have led to new tariffs and rattled global stock markets. The US is mulling additional duties on $200bn in Chinese imports, which could affect Apple's operations.  In recent days, state media in China have also had reports that fault Apple for not doing enough to counter spam in its messaging service. Apple chief executive Tim Cook told financial analysts on Tuesday that the firm is assessing the risk from the latest US tariff proposal but has not felt direct effects from the higher duties already put in place. ""Our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences,"" he said. However, he said he was optimistic that ""this will get sorted out"". Apple sold 41.3m iPhones in the April through June period, up 1% from last year. The appetite for the firm's most expensive phones marked a contrast with the world's largest smartphone sellerSamsung, which disappointed investorsby warning of lower than expected sales of its high-end Galaxy S9 . But Chinese tech company Huawei, which reported 15% revenue growth in the first half of this year, overtook Apple to become the world's second-biggest smartphone seller in the quarter, according to market research firmsCanalys,externalandIDC,external.

"Action against me ridiculous, says Hodge","Dame Margaret Hodge has been a fierce critic of Labour's new anti-Semitism guidelines Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has criticised the disciplinary action she is facing by the party - saying she has ""no idea"" what the allegations are. She said it was ""ridiculous"" how her case was handled compared with executive committee member Pete Willsman - who apologised over comments about members of the Jewish community. The action is over a confrontation she had with Mr Corbyn about anti-Semitism. Labour said it did not comment on individual cases. It added that in all cases, people are told the nature of the complaint and kept informed about the process. Labour takes action against MP Hodge Labour 'shaken' by anti-Semitism row A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Meanwhile, following the recent row about Labour's response to anti-Semitism allegations, the party is understood to have approached the Jewish Museum in London about Mr Corbyn making a speech there, but nothing has been confirmed. Speaking on Woman's Houron BBC Radio 4, Dame Margaret said she had chosen to confront Mr Corbyn in anger at what she said was the party's ""arrogance"" over its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism. Labour's guidelines repeat the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition but has rewritten the wording of some of the examples of anti-Semitism it lists. Dame Margaret accused Labour of ""playing around"" with the international definition, and said she had gone to tell Mr Corbyn he was ""perceived as being anti-Semitic"". She denied reports she had sworn at him. This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away Three weeks on, she said: ""I still do not know what the allegations against me are, I have no idea what the process they are going to follow... this seems to me a very very unfair process."" Some Labour figures, including the shadow defence secretary, have called for the action against Dame Margaret to be dropped - and shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour needed to ""move on"". Mr Willsman, an ally of Mr Corbyn, was recorded during a National Executive Committee meeting suggesting Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks and saying he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He later apologised and said not all of his remarks were accurately reported. A party source said earlier this week that the apology meant the matter had been resolved. Dame Margaret added: ""He said it in front of the leader, in front of the general secretary, when I hear that and hear no action being taken, I think it all beggars belief... I think it's ridiculous."" Labour campaign group Momentum has withdrawn its support for Mr Willsman over his remarks - it had been backing him as one of nine pro-Corbyn candidates in the NEC elections. It said it welcomed his apology but described his comments as ""deeply insensitive"" and ""inappropriate"". But not everyone is happy at Momentum's decision, which Matt Wrack of the Fire Brigades Union said was ""cowardly, undemocratic and politically inept"".

Sign language GCSE plan after boy's fight,"Daniel Jillings, 12, want to be able to sit a GCSE in British Sign Language when he takes his exams A GCSE in British Sign Language (BSL) could be introduced in the UK before the next general election following a campaign by a deaf schoolboy. The government reversed its decision to delay any new qualifications after Daniel Jillings, 12, and his family, from Suffolk, campaigned for one to be available in time for his GCSEs. Their lawyers argued the lack of a BSL GCSE might be ""discriminatory and unlawful"", as it is his first language. Ministers may now make an ""exception"". This video can not be played British Sign Language: GCSE victory for 12-year-old campaigner The government had previously stated no new GCSEs would be introduced in this parliament. In March, School Standards Minister Nick Gibb arguednot everything needed to be taught at GCSE, adding: ""We value British Sign Language, however a huge number of steps would have to be gone through for the BSL qualification to be accredited as a GCSE."" An online crowdfunding page set up to help pay for the family's legal challenge to the government ruling raised more than Â£6,000. Daniel's family has been campaigning for the new qualification Daniel's mother, Ann Jillings, from Lowestoft, said: ""We are not asking for any special treatment, all we want is for Daniel and other deaf children across the country to be given the same opportunities as other pupils."" On Wednesday, Mr Gibb said: ""We will consider any proposals put forward for a GCSE in British Sign Language."" However, he stressed it would ""need to meet the rigorous standards set by both the department and Ofqual"". ""If these expectations are met and a British Sign Language GCSE is ready to be introduced, we will then consider whether to make an exception to our general rule that there should be no new GCSEs in this parliament,"" he said. Steve Haines, from the National Deaf Children's Society said there were 45,000 deaf children in the UK who wanted to sit a BSL GCSE and described the turnaround as ""a powerful signal to deaf children everywhere"".

Bank of England raises UK interest rates,"The Bank of England has raised the interest rate for only the second time in a decade. The rate has risen by a quarter of a percentage point, from 0.5% to 0.75% - the highest level since March 2009. While the decision means that the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages will pay more, the rise will be welcomed by savers. Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, said there would be further ""gradual"" and ""limited"" rate rises to come. Interest rates: Your questions answered What an interest rate rise means for you The interest rate rise is all about your wages Savers should not expect too much from a rate rise Five things we learned from the Bank of England Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,externalwith your stories Some business groups questioned the decision to raise the rate now ahead of the UK agreeing a Brexit deal with the European Union. However, Mr Carney told the BBC that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would cut rates if needed. ""There are a variety of scenarios that can happen with Brexit â¦ but in many of those scenarios interest rates should be at least at these levels and so this decision is consistent with that,"" he said. ""In those scenarios where the interest rate should be lower, well then the MPC which meets eight times a year would, I'm confident, take the right decision to adjust interest rates at that time."" This video can not be played Bank of England Governor Mark Carney Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""While a quarter-point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty."" The Bank's MPC had been expected to raise interest rates in May, but held fire because the economy went through a weak patch at the start of the year - partly because of the harsh weather conditions, dubbed the Beast from the East. The Bank is now confident that the dip was temporary and that economic growth will recover from the 0.2% rate seen in the first quarter, to 0.4% in the second quarter and maintain that pace later in the year. Homeowners with a variable rate or tracker mortgage will face an increase in payments The Bank is sticking to previous guidance that there will be further interest rate rises, but Mr Carney said these will be ""limited and gradual"". ""Rates can be expected to rise gradually. Policy needs to walk, not run, to stand still,"" he said. However, the Institute of Directors said the Bank had ""jumped the gun"" by raising the rate now. It said: ""The rise threatens to dampen consumer and business confidence at an already fragile time. ""Growth has remained subdued, and the recent partial rebound is the least that could be expected after the lack of progress in the year's first quarter."" More than3.5 millionresidential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate The average standard variable rate mortgage is4.72% On a Â£150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost byÂ£224 A Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers. Half did not move after the last rate rise No easy access savings account at a major High Street bank pays interest of more than0.5% The Bank said a pick-up in the economy is being supported by household spending, which the Bank said had been ""erratic"" earlier in the year. It is also believes the recent series of store closures on the High Street does not reflect a lack of appetite for shopping. In its Quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank said: ""Although in the past year the number of retail closures have increased and retail footfall has fallen, contacts of the Bank's agents suggest that mainly reflects shifts in consumer demand to online stores and from goods to services."" This video can not be played Homeowner Sarah Cottingham: ""All my spare money goes on my mortgage now"" Commenting on Brexit, Mr Carney said the Monetary Policy Committee ""recognises that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal"". He said: ""Negotiations are now entering a critical period, with the UK and EU both seeking an agreement by the end of the year. ""Although the range of potential outcomes is wide, what matters for monetary policy is how people react to developments."" He said British households so far have been ""resilient - but not indifferent - to Brexit news"". The Bank sees continuing ""modest"" economic growth of 1.4% this year and an increase to 1.8% next year. The unemployment rate is expected to fall further from 4.2% and wage growth is expected to pick up. Inflation is forecast to fall back to 2% - the Bank of England's target - by 2020. The Bank sees some clouds on the economic horizon. The Bank of England said a trade row between the US and China was weighing on the global economic outlook It said the outlook for the global economy was a bit gloomier, partly owing to the trade war between the US and China which has seen tariffs imposed on a range of goods. It also highlighted a slowdown in the UK housing market this year, which has been ""concentrated in London"", where mortgage completions are down 12% on 2016. But the Bank thinks that weakness might just be specific to the capital and may not say much about the prospects for the UK housing market as a whole. The Bank is sticking to its guidance that interest rates will continue to head higher, but only at gradual pace and to a limited extent. The financial markets have taken this on board and are forecasting one, and perhaps two, rises of 0.25% before 2020. It also seems unlikely the UK will return to interest rates of 5% and above. In its inflation report, the Bank said that an ageing population would hold relatively more assets, while lower productivity means reduced demand for capital from businesses. Combined, those two trends would lower the interest rate needed to stop the economy from overheating. As a result the Bank estimates that the equilibrium interest rate would be between 2% and 3%.

What the rate rise means for you,"This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% after much speculation. Expectations of a strengthening economy, solid employment levels, more consumer spending and the potential for wages to rise have all played a part in the decision. The Bank's main priority is to keep the rising cost of living - known as inflation - under control. It uses its key interest rate, known as the Bank rate or base rate, which is the reference point for how much banks and building societies pay savers and charge borrowers in interest. Generally, a rise in the Bank rate is good for the UK's 45 million savers and bad for borrowers - but the reality is a bit more nuanced. Here are the key points. More than3.5 millionresidential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate The average standard variable rate mortgage is4.72% On a Â£150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost byÂ£224 A Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers. Half did not move after the last rate rise No easy access savings account at a major High Street bank pays interest of more than0.5% Across the UK, 9.1 million households have a mortgage. Of these, more than 3.5 million are on a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. These are the people who would be most affected, as their monthly payments would increase. The relatively small rise will not be particularly painful for the vast majority of householders, although debt charities say that some squeezed families will find this extra burden a real challenge. Those on such variable rates tend to be older, and with relatively small outstanding mortgage balances. The average outstanding balance is Â£112,000. For somebody with 20 years left on this mortgage, the monthly bill rise by about Â£14 a month. For those with a larger balance, then clearly the rise in the mortgage bill will be greater. The vast majority of new mortgage loans - 96% - are on fixed interest rates, typically for two or five years. Currently half of all outstanding loans are on fixed rates, equating to about 4.7 million households. Some of these rates are expected to rise after the latest announcement. Of course, none of these borrowers would see an immediate rise. However, when such borrowers reach the end of their term, they may find they have to make higher monthly payments. That said, they could - depending on when they took out their loan - end up on a cheaper deal. Lenders offering fixed rates tend to be especially competitive. Some rates may rise on other types of borrowing such as personal loans and credit cards. Should they rise, that would have relatively little impact on a credit card interest rate that is generally about 18%. When base rates rise, so do savings rates, in theory. But it depends on the extent to which banks and building societies want to increase their deposits. So after November's rate increase, banks were slow to pass on any rise to savers, or they typically passed ona fraction of the full increase. In fact, half of all savings accounts did not move at all after the last Bank rate rise in November. Commentators say savers could probably expect something similar this time. According to the Bank of England, returns on longer-term cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) were little changed in December. Yet they jumped significantly in January, with average returns on cash ISAs going up from 0.36% to 0.94%. In February and March they held steady at 0.86%, before falling subsequently to 0.63% by the end of June. For the average cash Isa saver with Â£11,200 locked away, the latest rise - if passed on - could mean Â£28 more a year in interest. Any rate rise might also good for retirees buying an annuity - a financial product that provides an income for life. Annuity rates follow the yields - or interest rates - on long-dated government bonds, otherwise known as gilts. These yields could be expected to rise amid an environment of rising interest rates, giving retirees better value for money when they buy an annuity. Back in November 2011, a 65-year-old buying a joint annuity for Â£100,000 would have got an annual income of Â£5,404. Last year, that had dropped by Â£1,318 to Â£4,086. However, by now this has risen to about Â£4,670. Depending on how the market views the likelihood of further base rate rises, annuity rates may continue to creep up. According to Willliam Burrows, of Better Retirement, a 1% rise in gilt yields translates into an 8% rise in annuity rates - but this remains a long-term consideration. ""Annuity rates have been in the doldrums since the EU referendum in 2016, when gilt yields fell dramatically. Any increase in the bank rate should result in higher gilt yields, which will in turn lead to higher annuities,"" he said. ""However, don't hold your breath waiting for annuity rates to rise, because it is normally a slow process."" But we are still a long way from the heady days of the 1990s, when a Â£100,000 pension pot would have bought an annual income of about Â£15,000 a year.

Apple shares hit record on iPhone growth,"This video can not be played Why Apple is worth $1 trillion... and who could challenge it Apple shares hit a record on Wednesday, pushing the market value of the tech giant closer to the $1 trillion mark. The shares rose more than 5% to end at more than $201, close to the roughly $207 price needed to make it a $1tn company. The rise came after Apple reported strong demand for its most expensive iPhones, boosting quarterly revenue despite just 1% growth in shipments. The average iPhone price hit $724 (Â£552), well above the expected $694. The firm said its $999 iPhone X - launched last year - remained its most popular iPhone model in the quarter and had driven the higher sales price. Revenue growth of 31% in Apple's services business, which includes the App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, also boosted the firm's performance. Is Samsung's Galaxy S9 flagship a flop? State firm hosts Apple's data in China Apple to close iPhone security loophole Overall the tech giant's revenue jumped 17% year-on-year to a quarterly record of $53.3bn (Â£40.6bn), with every region except Japan reporting double digit growth. Profits rose to $11.5bn, up 32% compared to the same period in 2017. ""The lesson Apple's management has learned from the iPhone X, is when you sell a smartphone for more than $1,000 you can sell fewer units and still reap the financial benefits,"" said analyst Thomas Forte from DA Davidson & Co. If Apple's momentum continues, it could be the first US company to hit a $1tr market value. Globally,PetroChina reached that milestone in 2007,external, though the market cap, which is generally calculated by multiplying the number of shares in a company by its current share price, was measured using the price of its Shanghai-listed shares, not those traded elsewhere, and has since fallen. Apple already claims a market capitalisation of about $975bn, making it the world's most valuable company, ahead of Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft. To reach the $1tn threshold, Apple will need to see further increases to its share price - though exactly how high the price has to climb depends on how many shares Apple has. That is changing as the firm is engaged in a generous share buyback programme, which it expanded by $100bn in May. The company is also vulnerable to trade tensions between the US and China, which have led to new tariffs and rattled global stock markets. The US is mulling additional duties on $200bn in Chinese imports, which could affect Apple's operations.  In recent days, state media in China have also had reports that fault Apple for not doing enough to counter spam in its messaging service. Apple chief executive Tim Cook told financial analysts on Tuesday that the firm is assessing the risk from the latest US tariff proposal but has not felt direct effects from the higher duties already put in place. ""Our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences,"" he said. However, he said he was optimistic that ""this will get sorted out"". Apple sold 41.3m iPhones in the April through June period, up 1% from last year. The appetite for the firm's most expensive phones marked a contrast with the world's largest smartphone sellerSamsung, which disappointed investorsby warning of lower than expected sales of its high-end Galaxy S9 . But Chinese tech company Huawei, which reported 15% revenue growth in the first half of this year, overtook Apple to become the world's second-biggest smartphone seller in the quarter, according to market research firmsCanalys,externalandIDC,external.

Savers: 'Don't expect too much',"Long-suffering savers have seen little return on their money for years - so any rise in interest rates is likely to bring some good news. Yet, commentators say that even after the rise in interest rates announced by the Bank of England, savers should not expect too much. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has raised the Bank rate from 0.5% to 0.75%. After the last rate rise, half of savings account rates were unchanged. ""Do not expect things to happen automatically. Savers have to be active to find better returns,"" said Tom Adams, of comparison site Savings Champion. Interest rates: What would a rise mean for you? Why are so many of us not saving for a rainy day? In November, the Bank raised interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5%. Savers would have expected that to be fed into the rates paid in their own accounts, and the Bank's governor Mark Carney said at the time that he expected the rise to be passed on. ""Obviously we will watch it closely,"" he said. Nine months on and those who watch these things closely say that only 50% of savings accounts saw an increase in interest rates after the Bank's November move. Of those which did see a rate rise, the average was an increase of 0.2 percentage points, rather than the full 0.25. This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The reason for this, in part, is that the largest banks, particularly, had money sloshing around from schemes that allowed them access to cheap funds to lend out. In other words, they did not need to offer better rates to attract savers to deposit money with them. They could also rely on custom from people walking into their local branches. Charlotte Nelson, of financial information service Moneyfacts, said that no major High Street bank had an easy access savings account paying more than the current Bank rate of 0.5%. ""The savings market is so different to how it used to be,"" she said. ""Banks simply have not needed savers' funds like they once did."" In addition, she said that banks which had passed on November's rate rise had been ""choosy"" over which customers would benefit. For example, some customers may have seen little change on a lower tier of savings, but slightly more generous returns on bigger sums. So, after the latest Bank rate rise, she also points out that savers need to be patient. It usually takes around a month after the MPC's decision before banks make any wholesale changes to their own rates. Building societies may require a general meeting to decide on interest rate changes which, again, takes some time to convene. Some banks currently pay just 0.05% a year on instant access savings accounts. In July, the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), suggested that banks could be forced to set a minimum interest rate on their savings accounts. The FCA said it was concerned that savers who stayed with the same bank or building society for a long time got poor returns on their money. Even though the Bank has raised the base rate, commentators say that it remains the case that loyalty for savers simply does not pay.

Five things we learned from the Bank,"Bank of England policymakers have voted unanimously to raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75%. The bank left its forecasts for UK growth, inflation and employment broadly unchanged. And it signalled that any further rate increases would be gradual. Here are five things we learned. Pay packets are rising. The bank noted that the lifting of the 1% pay cap for public sector workers and broader pay growth would start generating inflationary pressures over the coming years. It said official data last year already showed that workers who switched jobs or were promoted were already enjoying pay rises seen before the financial crisis. Pay was only subdued for those stuck in the same job. The bank said more recent earnings growth suggested ""pay rises have broadened out"". Past experience suggests when house prices fall in the capital, the rest of the market follows. But the bank outlined three reasons why London was likely to be the exception rather than the rule. First, London's higher prices mean properties in the capital are more affected by borrowing limits and tax changes brought in to rein-in risk. Second, the buy-to-let market, which has also been hit by a stamp duty surcharge, is more concentrated in London. Third, Brexit uncertainty has triggered a fall in net EU migration. This has hit London more than elsewhere because many live in the capital. Bank of England raises UK interest rates What the interest rate rise means for you Savers: 'Don't expect too much' The bank lowered its forecasts for global growth this year and next, blaming heightened trade tensions. It predicted the global economy will expand by 3.75% this year and 3.5% in 2019. This is slightly lower than its respective estimates of 4% and 3.75% three months ago. It said global tit-for-tat steel tariffs were weighing on metals prices as well as global share prices. ""Trade protectionism... could weigh further on the global outlook,"" the bank said. Households have been feeling the pinch, but the bank says that, generally, rising wealth - partly due to higher house prices - had helped to boost consumption in recent years. Policymakers said: ""Household balance sheets look relatively strong compared to the past as the stock of both financial and housing assets has risen considerably faster than the stock of debt."" See more stories and videos like this And the bank believes these factors will continue to support consumer spending, even as real pay remains weak. With more people in work than ever before and ""historically high"" rates of job security, the bank said households are less likely to feel the need to squirrel away savings, which would also support economic growth. The Bank of England used the latest inflation report to spell out why interest rates were unlikely to return to the 5% level seen before the financial crisis. An older population, greater saving and weakness in productivity growth meant there was less need to borrow. The bank said interest rates were ""likely to remain materially below the 5% level set on average prior to the crisis"" and settle at between 2% to 3% in the long term.

Pope moves to oppose the death penalty,"Pope Francis has in the past spoken out against executions Pope Francis has changed the teachings of the Catholic faith to officially oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, the Vatican has said. The Catechism of the Church, a codified doctrine which sums up teachings, had previously stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases. It now says it is ""inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person"". Pope Francis has spoken out against executions in the past. Last October, he had said the Church's policy on the death penalty was one area where teaching was not static and could change with modern concerns. The text of the catechism was first set by Pope John Paul II in October 1992, and earlier stated that the death penalty was ""an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good"". However, the new text says there is ""an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes"". Profile: Pope Francis Pope tells gay Chilean sex abuse victim 'God loves you' Video: Boy's wish granted with Popemobile ride It also argues that today's more effective detention methods protect citizens and ""do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption"". The Church will now work for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide The Church will now work with determination for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, a statement from the Holy See said. By James Reynolds, BBC News, Rome The Catholic Church may base its faith on an unchanging Bible, but that does not stop the institution from updating some of its most important teachings. Centuries ago, popes called Christians to Holy War, commanded their own armies, and showed little anxiety about the killing of their enemies. In modern times, popes have re-invented themselves as symbols of global peace. But until now the Church had taught that the death penalty was ""an acceptable, albeit extreme means of safeguarding the common good"". Pope Francis - who has made mercy a theme of his papacy - has now decided that this has to change by ruling the death penalty ""inadmissible"". This may put the Church in direct conflict with conservative Catholics in the US who insist that capital punishment is justified. Historically, the Church has mostly been unopposed to the death penalty, including into the 20th Century. In 1952, Pope Pius XII said it was not a violation of the universal right to life. Pope John Paul II argued for imprisonment over execution wherever possible, although Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI, wrote that the death penalty could be permissible. The death penalty is still legal in 53 countries around the world. In the United States, where 22% of the population are Catholic, execution is still legal in 31 states. It is still also legal in Cuba, Dominica and Uganda - where about half of their populations are Catholic. The only place in Europe where it is still legal is Belarus, which has a sizeable Catholic minority of about 7% of the population.

Dad warns over mementoes for dead son,"Keith Will said he would sleep by his son's grave to stop the council from removing mementoes The father of a boy who died after being found on fire in an Aberdeen street says he will sleep by his son's grave to prevent mementoes being removed by the city council. Preston Flores, 7,died after suffering burns to much of his bodyin the incident on Bedford Avenue in 2014. His family have received a letter from the council saying items by his grave may be removed by maintenance staff. Preston's father Keith Will said that would be ""just disgraceful"". The council said maintenance of the cemetery would be carried out in a ""sensitive and dignified manner"". Preston was badly burned in April 2014 after apparently being drenched in petrol. He died days later in hospital, two days before his eighth birthday. A police investigation found no criminality had been involved, andno fatal accident inquiry was ordereddespite pleas from his family. Preston died in April 2014 after he was badly burned near his home in Aberdeen Preston was buried at Hazlehead Cemetery, and his family recently received a letter from Aberdeen City Council saying that any mementoes placed on the grass in front of the headstones must be removed to allow the grass to be cut safely. The letter, seen by BBC Scotland, is from the Bereavement Services department. It reads: ""For health and safety reasons, any vase or memento placed in the head ground of a lair must be at least 75mm (3 inches) from the grass edge to allow ground maintenance. ""No glass, mesh/netting, food liquids or any noise emitting items will be allowed. These will be removed immediately without prior notice."" Parents with children in the small baby section at the same cemeteryreceived similar letters earlier this year. Mr Will told BBC Scotland: ""I will sleep in front of my son's grave if I have to, to stop them taking the stuff. ""They are not going to just take it. There wasn't even a date on the letter, they just said they were going to start pulling things out if it's not removed. ""Preston isn't here anymore, we can't buy him gifts for his birthday or Christmas, that's why we leave things here. ""We will do whatever it takes, I will start a petition to stop them removing things. They have already done it in the baby section, it is just disgraceful."" Keith is now calling for a meeting with Aberdeen City Council. In a statement the local authority said: ""This is a standard letter which is issued as and when maintenance of lairs is undertaken. ""We appreciate that this is a sensitive issue for lair owners and would like to assure them that the maintenance of the cemetery is carried out in a sensitive and dignified manner.""

Boost for sign language GCSE campaign,"Daniel Jillings, 12, want to be able to sit a GCSE in British Sign Language when he takes his exams A GCSE in British Sign Language (BSL) could be introduced in the UK before the next general election following a campaign by a deaf schoolboy. The government reversed its decision to delay any new qualifications after Daniel Jillings, 12, and his family, from Suffolk, campaigned for one to be available in time for his GCSEs. Their lawyers argued the lack of a BSL GCSE might be ""discriminatory and unlawful"", as it is his first language. Ministers may now make an ""exception"". This video can not be played British Sign Language: GCSE victory for 12-year-old campaigner The government had previously stated no new GCSEs would be introduced in this parliament. In March, School Standards Minister Nick Gibb arguednot everything needed to be taught at GCSE, adding: ""We value British Sign Language, however a huge number of steps would have to be gone through for the BSL qualification to be accredited as a GCSE."" An online crowdfunding page set up to help pay for the family's legal challenge to the government ruling raised more than Â£6,000. Daniel's family has been campaigning for the new qualification Daniel's mother, Ann Jillings, from Lowestoft, said: ""We are not asking for any special treatment, all we want is for Daniel and other deaf children across the country to be given the same opportunities as other pupils."" On Wednesday, Mr Gibb said: ""We will consider any proposals put forward for a GCSE in British Sign Language."" However, he stressed it would ""need to meet the rigorous standards set by both the department and Ofqual"". ""If these expectations are met and a British Sign Language GCSE is ready to be introduced, we will then consider whether to make an exception to our general rule that there should be no new GCSEs in this parliament,"" he said. Steve Haines, from the National Deaf Children's Society said there were 45,000 deaf children in the UK who wanted to sit a BSL GCSE and described the turnaround as ""a powerful signal to deaf children everywhere"". However, he said the ""campaign isn't over yet"" and government and exam regulator Ofqual must do ""everything they can... to develop this GCSE as quickly as possible"". Alex Rook, public law expert at firm Irwin Mitchell which represents Daniel's family, said they were ""delighted that the government has backed down from its original position"" and said it was a ""major turning point"".

Almost all lemurs face extinction,"Experts say 105 of 111 lemur species and subspecies are now under threat Almost every species of lemur, wide-eyed primates unique to Madagascar, is under threat of extinction. That is the conclusion of an international group of conservationists, who carried out an assessment of the animals' status. This ""Primate Specialist Group"" reviewed and compared the latest research into lemur populations and the threats to their habitat and survival. Lemurs, they concluded, are the most endangered primates in the world. In a statement, Russ Mittermeier, from the charityGlobal Wildlife Conservation,external, who is chair of the Primate Specialist Group which delivered the alarming conclusions, said that it highlighted the ""very high extinction risk to Madagascar's unique lemurs"" and was ""indicative of the grave threats to Madagascar biodiversity as a whole"". This video can not be played Victoria Gill explains the threat to primates, with the help of some lemurs ""Madagascar's unique and wonderful species are its greatest asset,"" he added. The animals face a variety of threats, primarily the destruction of their tropical forest habitat, from so-called slash-and-burn agriculture, illegal logging, charcoal production and mining. Primates face extinction crisis New great ape species identified Chimp communication gestures translated The hunting of lemurs for food, and their live capture for the pet trade has also emerged as a serious threat to their survival. Prof Christoph Schwitzer from Bristol Zoological Society is deputy chair of the Primate Specialist Group. He told the BBC: ""More and more, we are seeing unsustainable levels of lemur poaching. ""We see commercial hunting as well - probably for local restaurants. And this is a new phenomenon for Madagascar - we didn't see it at this scale 15 years ago."" The indri is the largest lemur species and is known locally as a babakoto, which means 'man of the forest' There are 111 known species and subspecies of lemur, all endemic to Madagascar, and this group concluded that 105 of those were under threat. This workshop, convened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the first step in an official assessment of the conservation status of every studied species, which is ultimately published as what is known as the Red List of Threatened Species. The findings though will go through a peer review process before the Red List is officially updated to reflect them. Although the conclusions sound dire, that is the aim of this assessment process - to examine the latest research and use it to work out what the most urgent conservation priorities are. The northern sportive lemur is Critically Endangered The IUCN has also already implemented what it calls a ""lemur action plan,external"" to save the animals, with plans including protecting habitats where the most threatened species live and tackling poverty through ecotourism schemes, in order to help local people to avoid the need to hunt the animals. Prof Schwitzer said that he was an ""eternal optimist"", adding that it was ""important that people shout about this"". ""People who love lemurs need to shout about these problems and get the message out there,"" he told BBC News. ""When we published the lemur action plan and the media picked up on it, suddenly we had people call offering to help - to donate money or other resources. ""That can really make a difference.""

Stonehenge: First residents from west Wales,"Researchers have shown that cremated humans at Stonehenge were from the same region of Wales as the stones used in construction. The key question was to understand the geographic origin of the people buried at Stonehenge. The key innovation was finding that high temperatures of cremation can crystallise a skull, locking in the chemical signal of its origin. The findings have beenpublished in the journal Scientific Reports.,external The first long-term residents of Stonehenge, along with the first stones, arrived about 5,000 years ago. While it is already known that the""bluestones"" that were first used to build Stonehengewere transported from 150 miles (240 km) away in modern-day Pembrokeshire, almost nothing is known about the people involved. The scientists' work shows that both people and materials were moving between the regions and that, for some of these people, the move was permanent. When their lives ended, their cremated remains were placed under the ancient monument in what is now Wiltshire. A cremated skull fragment from the site Lead author Dr Christophe Snoeck compared the levels of different forms, or isotopes, of the element strontium against a national database to work out where the cremated individuals spent the last years of their lives. Strontium is present in many bedrocks. And different geographical areas have distinctive strontium signatures. So by matching the strontium ""fingerprints"" in human remains to the strontium profiles of different geographical regions, a person's place of origin can be roughly determined. Dr Snoeck, who is now an international expert in cremation following a PhD at the University of Oxford, said that ""about 40% of the cremated individuals did not spend their later lives on the Wessex chalk where their remains were found."" While the news of Stonehenge has tended to focus on ""how"" and ""why"" it was built, the question of ""who"" built it is often forgotten. With this new method, the authors were able to be precise about where the cremated persons came from. Unfortunately, the cremation destroyed other chemical signals that might tell us who these people were, and their social rank. The bluestones at Stonehenge are thought to have been quarried in Wales However, Dr Rick Schulting, senior author on the study, said: ""These must have been important people. Being buried at Stonehenge is the ancient equivalent of being interred in Westminster Abbey today."" He said: ""The evidence suggests that some of the people buried at Stonehenge must have spent much of their last 10 or so years in Wales. Although we tend to think that immigration is a new thing, these people were obviously able to travel substantial distances across difficult terrain."" Now that this new technique has been proven to work, the scientists would like to sample other cremated remains at the iconic Stonehenge site to see if the Welsh connection was transient or sustained over many years. The study will also open up research on many other cremated remains that have been found across the UK. They would also like to work out how the remains were cremated, and why cremation is sometimes preferred over burial. The lead scientist, Christophe, has already moved on. Since completing his PhD at Oxford, he has immigrated to Belgium, where he iscoordinating a large project,externalon migration and cremation in pre-historic Belgium.

Pope changes teaching on death penalty,"Pope Francis has in the past spoken out against executions Pope Francis has changed the teachings of the Catholic faith to officially oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, the Vatican has said. The Catechism of the Church, a codified doctrine which sums up teachings, had previously stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases. It now says it is ""inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person"". Pope Francis has spoken out against executions in the past. Last October, he had said the Church's policy on the death penalty was one area where teaching was not static and could change with modern concerns.

"Pope changes teaching on death penaltyChurch teaching previously allowed it in some cases, but it has now been declared ""inadmissible"".Europe","Pope Francis has in the past spoken out against executions Pope Francis has changed the teachings of the Catholic faith to officially oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, the Vatican has said. The Catechism of the Church, a codified doctrine which sums up teachings, had previously stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases. It now says it is ""inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person"". Pope Francis has spoken out against executions in the past. Last October, he had said the Church's policy on the death penalty was one area where teaching was not static and could change with modern concerns. The text of the catechism was first set by Pope John Paul II in October 1992, and earlier stated that the death penalty was ""an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good"".

Provide baby boxes 'to reduce sleep risks',"New mothers in the UK should all be given Finnish-style baby boxes to reduce the risks of unsafe co-sleeping, the Royal College of Midwives has said. The cardboard boxes, which come with essential items such as clothes, books and blankets, can be used as beds. They are provided for all new babies in Scotland and in some parts of England. Extending the scheme would provide all babies with a safe space to sleep and particularly benefit those from deprived backgrounds, the RCM said. Baby box scheme rolled out across Scotland Cot death charity doubts baby box benefits Do baby boxes really save lives? The RCM said research had identified a number of risk factors for cot death or sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI). These include babies sharing sleeping surfaces with parents who smoke, drink or take drugs, and sleeping on soft or unsafe surfaces, such as a sofa. It said these risk factors tended to be higher in more deprived or isolated communities, with a large proportion of SUDI occurring in homes with high levels of deprivation. It is in these environments that baby boxes could be especially beneficial in providing safe sleep spaces for the baby, a new position statement from the RCM said. In England some NHS Trusts have introduced pilot schemes or full baby box schemes over the past two years. Wales and Northern Ireland do not have any baby box schemes. The box tradition originates from Finland, where for 75 years every pregnant woman has been given a box, which also includes with things such as nappies, bedding and a mattress. Gill Walton, the RCM's chief executive and general secretary, said giving the boxes to all new mothers in the UK would provide a ""more equal start to life for the baby"". ""Most importantly, by enabling parents to give their babies a safe sleeping space, baby boxes may reduce unsafe co-sleeping or babies sleeping in an inappropriate place such as a sofa,"" she added. The RCM did, however, acknowledge that there was limited evidence around baby boxes reducing deaths from SUDI. It said that baby boxes needed to be safe, of high quality and the box and mattress should meet at least the minimum UK safety standards. Decisions about what they contained should be made in discussion with health professionals, experts on SUDI and child safety, and parents, the RCM added. The Lullaby Trust, a charity that aims to prevent unexpected deaths in infancy, said for those who did not have a cot or Moses basket, a baby box might be better than co-sleeping in ""hazardous circumstances"". But its chief executive Francine Bates said it was not currently possible for baby boxes to fully comply with safety standards. She said: ""Additionally, there is still no evidence directly linking the use of a baby box with a reduction in infant mortality or sudden infant death syndrome. ""Given current pressures on public health budgets,  we question whether the call to introduce the scheme across the country  is the best use of resources to reduce infant deaths."" A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to ensuring that every child in Wales, regardless of their circumstances, gets the best start in life. ""We have no plans at present to introduce an equivalent to the Scottish baby box in Wales but we will review the evaluation of the Scottish model."" A spokeswoman for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said: ""The department will monitor the progress and outcomes of pilot schemes in Scotland, England and parts of the Republic of Ireland to support future consideration of the introduction of such a scheme in Northern Ireland.""

Hodge: Action against me 'ridiculous',"Dame Margaret Hodge has been a fierce critic of Labour's new anti-Semitism guidelines Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has criticised the disciplinary action she is facing by the party - saying she has ""no idea"" what the allegations are. She said it was ""ridiculous"" how her case was handled compared with executive committee member Pete Willsman - who apologised over comments about members of the Jewish community. The action is over a confrontation she had with Mr Corbyn about anti-Semitism. Labour said it did not comment on individual cases. It added that in all cases, people are told the nature of the complaint and kept informed about the process. Labour takes action against MP Hodge Labour 'shaken' by anti-Semitism row A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Meanwhile, following the recent row about Labour's response to anti-Semitism allegations, the party is understood to have approached the Jewish Museum in London about Mr Corbyn making a speech there, but nothing has been confirmed. Speaking on Woman's Houron BBC Radio 4, Dame Margaret said she had chosen to confront Mr Corbyn in anger at what she said was the party's ""arrogance"" over its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism. Labour's guidelines repeat the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition but has rewritten the wording of some of the examples of anti-Semitism it lists. Dame Margaret accused Labour of ""playing around"" with the international definition, and said she had gone to tell Mr Corbyn he was ""perceived as being anti-Semitic"". She denied reports she had sworn at him. This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away Three weeks on, she said: ""I still do not know what the allegations against me are, I have no idea what the process they are going to follow... this seems to me a very very unfair process."" Some Labour figures, including the shadow defence secretary, have called for the action against Dame Margaret to be dropped - and shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour needed to ""move on"". Mr Willsman, an ally of Mr Corbyn, was recorded during a National Executive Committee meeting suggesting Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks and saying he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He later apologised and said not all of his remarks were accurately reported. A party source said earlier this week that the apology meant the matter had been resolved. Dame Margaret added: ""He said it in front of the leader, in front of the general secretary, when I hear that and hear no action being taken, I think it all beggars belief... I think it's ridiculous."" Labour campaign group Momentum has withdrawn its support for Mr Willsman over his remarks - it had been backing him as one of nine pro-Corbyn candidates in the NEC elections. It said it welcomed his apology but described his comments as ""deeply insensitive"" and ""inappropriate"". But not everyone is happy at Momentum's decision, which Matt Wrack of the Fire Brigades Union said was ""cowardly, undemocratic and politically inept"".

Easier streaming dents illegal downloads,"Beyonce and Jay-Z's new album was illegally downloaded by many fans after being released exclusively on Tidal Music piracy is falling out of favour as streaming services become more widespread, new figures show. One in 10 people in the UK use illegal downloads, down from 18% in 2013, according to YouGov's Music Report. The trend looks set to continue - with 22% of those who get their music illegitimately saying they do not expect to be doing so in five years. ""It is now easier to stream music than to pirate it,"" said one survey participant. Another respondent said: ""Spotify has everything from new releases to old songs, it filled the vacuum, there was no longer a need for using unverified sources."" Apple boss says streaming services 'are too similar' Game of Thrones S7 pirated billion times Music 'stream-ripping' rapidly growing The news will be encouraging to the music industry, which isreturning to growthafter piracy brought it to its knees in the 2000s. It has campaigned heavily to shut down sites that offer pirated music - from Napster and allofmp3 to Pirate Bay and Megaupload. Among those surveyed by YouGov, 36% said it was becoming more difficult to find unauthorised sources to verify music. However, record labels remain concerned by the rise of ""stream ripping"" services. Converting and downloading YouTube videos is a violation of the site's terms and conditions Such apps allow users to ""grab"" music from streaming services like YouTube and Spotify and store the file on their phone or computer, which prevents artists and record labels getting revenue from future streams. YouGov noted that some illegal downloading may be the result of streaming exclusives - with 44% of respondents saying they only download songs illegally when they can't access them elsewhere. One of this year's most-pirated albums is Beyonce and Jay-Z's Everything Is Love, which was initially released as an exclusive on Tidal. Justin Marshall, associate director of YouGov, said: ""While illegal downloads still present a significant challenge to the music industry, there appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel. ""Whether or not streaming is what finally banishes illegal downloads remains to be seen, but there are encouraging signs."" YouGov surveyed 4,009 UK adults between 6-13 March this year. However, its findings may have been skewed by respondents who were reluctant to admit accessing music illegally. Aseparate report by piracy-tracking company MUSO,external, published in March, said there had been 300 billion visits to piracy sites in 2017, up 1.6%. Music piracy rose 14.7%, it said, with the UK ranked 10th in the world for accessing illegal sites.

"Hosepipe ban called off after rainA hosepipe ban for north-west England is called off, days before it was due to start.England","Low water levels in Wayoh Reservoir at Edgworth near Bolton last month The first hosepipe ban of the summer that would have affected seven million people in England has been called off. The temporary ban by United Utilities (UU) was due to start in the North West on Sunday to ""safeguard essential supplies"". But recent rainfall, cooler temperatures and a reduction in water usage have led to it being lifted. UU has warned that it may still need to introduce a ban at a later stage if the dry weather continues. Martin Padley thanked customers for conserving water and said the company did not ""want to inconvenience customers unnecessarily at this time"". ""Our leakage teams are working 24 hours a day to find and repair as many leaks as possible and we have been moving water around our network,"" he said. United Utilities last imposed a ban in 2010 ""The long range forecast from the Met Office is one of relatively dry weather into the autumn, so future restrictions are still a possibility if more rain doesn't arrive."" Forecasters predict temperatures in northern England would reach the mid-20s, with some rain while southern parts could reach 30C on Friday. Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. Reality Check: Do hosepipe bans work? What are the effects of a heatwave? How to keep your plants alive in a heatwave Europe's 48C heat record could be broken Mr Padley urged UU customers to continue taking steps to save water in their homes and gardens. Robert Light, from the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""Consumers deserve great credit for the way they've responded to the call to use water wisely."" Earlier this month UU, which supplies about 3.2 million properties, said it wasmoving water from Wales to boost depleted suppliesacross north-west England.

"Hodge: Action against me 'ridiculous'The Labour MP says it ""beggars belief"" she is facing action, unlike NEC member Peter Willsman.UK Politics","Dame Margaret Hodge has been a fierce critic of Labour's new anti-Semitism guidelines Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has criticised the disciplinary action she is facing by the party - saying she has ""no idea"" what the allegations are. She said it was ""ridiculous"" how her case was handled compared with executive committee member Pete Willsman - who apologised over comments about members of the Jewish community. The action is over a confrontation she had with Mr Corbyn about anti-Semitism. Labour said it did not comment on individual cases. It added that in all cases, people are told the nature of the complaint and kept informed about the process. Labour takes action against MP Hodge Labour 'shaken' by anti-Semitism row A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Meanwhile, following the recent row about Labour's response to anti-Semitism allegations, the party is understood to have approached the Jewish Museum in London about Mr Corbyn making a speech there, but nothing has been confirmed. Speaking on Woman's Houron BBC Radio 4, Dame Margaret said she had chosen to confront Mr Corbyn in anger at what she said was the party's ""arrogance"" over its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism. Labour's guidelines repeat the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition but has rewritten the wording of some of the examples of anti-Semitism it lists. Dame Margaret accused Labour of ""playing around"" with the international definition, and said she had gone to tell Mr Corbyn he was ""perceived as being anti-Semitic"". She denied reports she had sworn at him. This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away Three weeks on, she said: ""I still do not know what the allegations against me are, I have no idea what the process they are going to follow... this seems to me a very very unfair process."" Some Labour figures, including the shadow defence secretary, have called for the action against Dame Margaret to be dropped - and shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour needed to ""move on"". Mr Willsman, an ally of Mr Corbyn, was recorded during a National Executive Committee meeting suggesting Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks and saying he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He later apologised and said not all of his remarks were accurately reported. A party source said earlier this week that the apology meant the matter had been resolved. Dame Margaret added: ""He said it in front of the leader, in front of the general secretary, when I hear that and hear no action being taken, I think it all beggars belief... I think it's ridiculous."" Labour campaign group Momentum has withdrawn its support for Mr Willsman over his remarks - it had been backing him as one of nine pro-Corbyn candidates in the NEC elections. It said it welcomed his apology but described his comments as ""deeply insensitive"" and ""inappropriate"". But not everyone is happy at Momentum's decision, which Matt Wrack of the Fire Brigades Union said was ""cowardly, undemocratic and politically inept"".

Hosepipe ban called off after rain,"Low water levels in Wayoh Reservoir at Edgworth near Bolton last month The first hosepipe ban of the summer that would have affected seven million people in England has been called off. The temporary ban by United Utilities (UU) was due to start in the North West on Sunday to ""safeguard essential supplies"". But recent rainfall, cooler temperatures and a reduction in water usage have led to it being lifted. UU has warned that it may still need to introduce a ban at a later stage if the dry weather continues. Martin Padley thanked customers for conserving water and said the company did not ""want to inconvenience customers unnecessarily at this time"". ""Our leakage teams are working 24 hours a day to find and repair as many leaks as possible and we have been moving water around our network,"" he said. United Utilities last imposed a ban in 2010 ""The long range forecast from the Met Office is one of relatively dry weather into the autumn, so future restrictions are still a possibility if more rain doesn't arrive."" Forecasters predict temperatures in northern England would reach the mid-20s, with some rain while southern parts could reach 30C on Friday. Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. Reality Check: Do hosepipe bans work? What are the effects of a heatwave? How to keep your plants alive in a heatwave Europe's 48C heat record could be broken Mr Padley urged UU customers to continue taking steps to save water in their homes and gardens. Robert Light, from the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""Consumers deserve great credit for the way they've responded to the call to use water wisely."" Earlier this month UU, which supplies about 3.2 million properties, said it wasmoving water from Wales to boost depleted suppliesacross north-west England.

Europe's 48C heat record could be broken,"In Madrid, the heat has driven people to the city's fountains As Europe bakes in another heatwave, forecasters say the all-time temperature record could be broken in the coming days. The current European record is 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in July 1977. Temperatures are rising in Spain and Portugal, aided by a surge of hot air sweeping in from Africa. BBC Weather says the current forecast for southwestern Spain and southern and southeastern Portugal is 47C (116.6F) on both Friday and Saturday. Portugal's national record is 47.4C (117.3F), set in 2003. Spain's peak of 47.3C (117.1F) was only set in July last year. In the UK, temperatures are expected to reach about 33C (91.4F) in the southeast. In pictures: Europe heatwave Spain's national weather service has put a warning in place until at least Sunday, saying the heatwave will be ""especially intense and lasting in the southwest"". Europe's weather warning group, Meteoalarm, has already issued red warnings - categorised as very dangerous and posing a risk to life - for much of southern Portugal and for the Badajoz province in Spain.

Sweden's highest peak, a glacier on the Kebnekaise mountain, is melting at a rate of several centimetres a day. Scientists monitoring the decline say the glacier will lose its title of the highest point to the mountain's northern tip. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has urged drivers to watch out for reindeer and sheep sheltering in tunnels to cool down. Tore Lysberg of the administration told AFP news agency that ""the animals retreat to colder places; both reindeer and sheep find refuge in tunnels and shaded areas"". The temperature reached 31.2C on Wednesday in Finnmark, inside the Arctic Circle, but it is now below 20C. Wildfires have raged across Greece killing more than 90 people, and Sweden has battled dozens of fires as far north as the Arctic Circle. While fires are an annual problem in much of Europe, the hot, dry conditions for an extended period of time made those fires much more likely. Researchers said thatclimate change made Europe's extended heatwave twice as likelyas it would otherwise have been. The long, hot summer has been so consistent that it has put a strain onGerman breweries, who have sold so much beer that there is a bottle shortage- bouncing back from record low sales last year. And in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, extremely low water levels in the river Elbe have led to the discovery of World War Two grenades and ammunition, police said. A few discoveries were made by people actively searching for old explosives on the river bed - which police warned was both ""forbidden and dangerous"".

More firms 'should publish gender pay gap'MPs say only half the UK's workforce is required to report the difference between men and women's salaries.UKComments,"All organisations with more than 50 employees should publish details of what they pay the men and women who work for them, MPs have said. A report by the Business Committee,externalcalled for the net to be widened to include smaller firms, saying there was evidence of wider pay gaps among them.

The report said recently published gender pay figures had ""shone a spotlight"" on the issue of a gender pay gap and helped women raise any disparities.

Number of mobile calls drops for first time,"On average, people pick up their phone once every 12 minutes The number of voice calls made on mobile phones in the UK fell for the first time ever in 2017 - despite the fact we seem hooked on our devices. That is according tothe latest report from telecoms regulator Ofcom,,externalwhich charts what it describes as a decade of digital dependence. A total of 78% of all adults now own a smartphone. On average, people check them once every 12 minutes during their waking hours, the study claims. Two in five adults look at their phone within five minutes of waking, while a third check their phones just before falling asleep, according to the report. A high percentage (71%) say they never turn off their phones and 78% say they could not live without it. While three-quarters of the British public still regard voice calling as an important function of their phones, more (92%) say web browsing is crucial. The report finds that the total volume of calls made on mobiles fell by 1.7% in 2017, even though making them is the cheapest it has ever been. That does not necessarily mean people are talking less, however, because Ofcom has not collated figures for chat apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, which could account for some of the decline. ""Over the last decade, people's lives have been transformed by the rise of the smartphone, together with better access to the internet and new services,"" said Ofcom's director of market intelligence Ian Macrae. ""Whether it is working flexibly, keeping up with current affairs or shopping online, we can do more on the move than ever before. ""But while people appreciate their smartphone as their constant companion, some are finding themselves feeling overloaded when online, or frustrated when they're not."" The Louis family all use their phones daily, for different reasons The Louis family all depend on their smartphones but for different reasons, While mum Kirsten uses it from the moment she wakes up to check social media, the family calendar, the weather as well as for shopping, her husband Andre - who is visually impaired - relies on it for a whole range of things, including booking taxis and reading emails. He describes himself as ""hooked"", saying the phone has been life-changing because, before he had one, he had to rely on the kindness of strangers when out and about. Son Jake currently has his usage restricted to when he is in the family home, where he uses it to play games, message family and friends and go on YouTube. Five-year-old Alice has yet to catch the mobile bug - she does not have a phone and does not want one. For now. Have you set any rules for when and where you use your phone? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The average daily time spent on a smartphone is two hours 28 minutes, rising to three hours 14 minutes for 18 to 24-year-olds, the report indicates. Most people expect a constant internet connection, with the majority of adults saying the internet is an essential part of their lives, and one in five spending more than 40 hours a week online. The average is a more modest 24 hours a week online, with more than half of that time spent on mobile phones. Phone etiquette: How not to lose friends Confessions of a smartphone addict Facebook and Instagram introduce time limit tool What is 5G and what will it mean for you? For the first time, women spent more time online than men, particularly in the age group 18 to 34 where females spent an average half an hour longer online than men. Seven in 10 commuters use their smartphones on their journey to work, with nearly a half saying they use it to complete ""essential tasks"". This video can not be played James Reevell looks at the tricks technology companies use to keep you hooked on your phone On average, users get through 1.9GB (gigabytes) of data each month, according to the report. The amount of time people spend glued to screens has become a focus of the big tech firms in recent months, with both Apple and Google offering dashboards built into their operating systems which allow people to see how much time they spend on various apps and websites. Facebook has also just announced tools to limithow much time people spendon the social network. The fact that mobile phones are now integral to people's lives means they are having to develop a set of etiquette rules about their usage. More than half agree that connected devices interrupt face-to-face conversations with family and friends, with 43% admitting to spending too much time online. The vast majority object to people using their phones during meal times, with both young and old agreeing. But when it comes to whether it is acceptable to be on a phone while watching TV, 62% of the over-55s object compared with only 21% of those aged 18-34. The key function of a mobile device also divides the generations. While older people think web browsing is the most crucial use of their devices, youngsters regard video streaming as more important. Our obsession with our phones is good news for advertisers. Nearly a quarter of all advertising spend is now on mobiles, and if mobile advertising was stripped away, ad revenue would be in decline for the first time. When asked in 2008 what was the most important device they owned, more than half the respondents to that year's report said it was the TV with only 13% identifying their mobile phone as the crucial gadget. Fast forward to 2018 and 48% regard their smartphone as the most important, followed by the TV (28%). The TV remains important though and despite the rise of on-demand and subscription services, broadcast TV still accounts for the majority (71%) of viewing time. Other findings from the report include: 42% of houses now own a smart TV - with Ofcom predicting this will rise substantially in coming years the average household spends Â£124 on communication services each month 40% of households subscribe to Netflix one in eight homes now has a smart speaker Tricks that keep you hooked on your phone.

"Easier streaming dents illegal downloads'It is easier to stream music than to pirate it,' say fans, as the number of illegal downloads falls.","Beyonce and Jay-Z's new album was illegally downloaded by many fans after being released exclusively on Tidal Music piracy is falling out of favour as streaming services become more widespread, new figures show. One in 10 people in the UK use illegal downloads, down from 18% in 2013, according to YouGov's Music Report. The trend looks set to continue - with 22% of those who get their music illegitimately saying they do not expect to be doing so in five years. ""It is now easier to stream music than to pirate it,"" said one survey participant. Another respondent said: ""Spotify has everything from new releases to old songs, it filled the vacuum, there was no longer a need for using unverified sources."" Apple boss says streaming services 'are too similar' Game of Thrones S7 pirated billion times Music 'stream-ripping' rapidly growing The news will be encouraging to the music industry, which isreturning to growthafter piracy brought it to its knees in the 2000s. It has campaigned heavily to shut down sites that offer pirated music - from Napster and allofmp3 to Pirate Bay and Megaupload. Among those surveyed by YouGov, 36% said it was becoming more difficult to find unauthorised sources to verify music. However, record labels remain concerned by the rise of ""stream ripping"" services. Converting and downloading YouTube videos is a violation of the site's terms and conditions Such apps allow users to ""grab"" music from streaming services like YouTube and Spotify and store the file on their phone or computer, which prevents artists and record labels getting revenue from future streams. YouGov noted that some illegal downloading may be the result of streaming exclusives - with 44% of respondents saying they only download songs illegally when they can't access them elsewhere. One of this year's most-pirated albums is Beyonce and Jay-Z's Everything Is Love, which was initially released as an exclusive on Tidal. Justin Marshall, associate director of YouGov, said: ""While illegal downloads still present a significant challenge to the music industry, there appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel. ""Whether or not streaming is what finally banishes illegal downloads remains to be seen, but there are encouraging signs."" YouGov surveyed 4,009 UK adults between 6-13 March this year. However, its findings may have been skewed by respondents who were reluctant to admit accessing music illegally. Aseparate report by piracy-tracking company MUSO,external, published in March, said there had been 300 billion visits to piracy sites in 2017, up 1.6%. Music piracy rose 14.7%, it said, with the UK ranked 10th in the world for accessing illegal sites.

What the interest rate rise means for you,"This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% after much speculation. Expectations of a strengthening economy, solid employment levels, more consumer spending and the potential for wages to rise have all played a part in the decision. The Bank's main priority is to keep the rising cost of living - known as inflation - under control. It uses its key interest rate, known as the Bank rate or base rate, which is the reference point for how much banks and building societies pay savers and charge borrowers in interest. Generally, a rise in the Bank rate is good for the UK's 45 million savers and bad for borrowers - but the reality is a bit more nuanced. Here are the key points. More than3.5 millionresidential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate The average standard variable rate mortgage is4.72% On a Â£150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost byÂ£224 A Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers. Half did not move after the last rate rise No easy access savings account at a major High Street bank pays interest of more than0.5% Across the UK, 9.1 million households have a mortgage. Of these, more than 3.5 million are on a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. These are the people who would be most affected, as their monthly payments would increase. The relatively small rise will not be particularly painful for the vast majority of householders, although debt charities say that some squeezed families will find this extra burden a real challenge. Those on such variable rates tend to be older, and with relatively small outstanding mortgage balances. The average outstanding balance is Â£112,000. For somebody with 20 years left on this mortgage, the monthly bill rise by about Â£14 a month. For those with a larger balance, then clearly the rise in the mortgage bill will be greater. The vast majority of new mortgage loans - 96% - are on fixed interest rates, typically for two or five years. Currently half of all outstanding loans are on fixed rates, equating to about 4.7 million households. Some of these rates are expected to rise after the latest announcement. Of course, none of these borrowers would see an immediate rise. However, when such borrowers reach the end of their term, they may find they have to make higher monthly payments. That said, they could - depending on when they took out their loan - end up on a cheaper deal. Lenders offering fixed rates tend to be especially competitive. Some rates may rise on other types of borrowing such as personal loans and credit cards. Should they rise, that would have relatively little impact on a credit card interest rate that is generally about 18%. When base rates rise, so do savings rates, in theory. But it depends on the extent to which banks and building societies want to increase their deposits. So after November's rate increase, banks were slow to pass on any rise to savers, or they typically passed ona fraction of the full increase. In fact, half of all savings accounts did not move at all after the last Bank rate rise in November. Commentators say savers could probably expect something similar this time. According to the Bank of England, returns on longer-term cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) were little changed in December. Yet they jumped significantly in January, with average returns on cash ISAs going up from 0.36% to 0.94%. In February and March they held steady at 0.86%, before falling subsequently to 0.63% by the end of June. For the average cash Isa saver with Â£11,200 locked away, the latest rise - if passed on - could mean Â£28 more a year in interest. Any rate rise might also good for retirees buying an annuity - a financial product that provides an income for life. Annuity rates follow the yields - or interest rates - on long-dated government bonds, otherwise known as gilts. These yields could be expected to rise amid an environment of rising interest rates, giving retirees better value for money when they buy an annuity. Back in November 2011, a 65-year-old buying a joint annuity for Â£100,000 would have got an annual income of Â£5,404. Last year, that had dropped by Â£1,318 to Â£4,086. However, by now this has risen to about Â£4,670. Depending on how the market views the likelihood of further base rate rises, annuity rates may continue to creep up. According to Willliam Burrows, of Better Retirement, a 1% rise in gilt yields translates into an 8% rise in annuity rates - but this remains a long-term consideration. ""Annuity rates have been in the doldrums since the EU referendum in 2016, when gilt yields fell dramatically. Any increase in the bank rate should result in higher gilt yields, which will in turn lead to higher annuities,"" he said. ""However, don't hold your breath waiting for annuity rates to rise, because it is normally a slow process."" But we are still a long way from the heady days of the 1990s, when a Â£100,000 pension pot would have bought an annual income of about Â£15,000 a year.

Dad who killed adopted baby 'overlooked',"This video can not be played Matthew Scully-Hicks made a 999 call two months before Elsie died claiming she fell down stairs A father who murdered his baby just weeks after adopting her may have slipped under the radar as he was seen as a ""positive parent"", a review has found. Elsie Scully-Hicks died in May 2016 when she was 18 months old. She was subjected to a catalogue of injuries by killer Matthew Scully-Hicks in the eight months he had care of her. A child practice review said these were never considered anything other than ""childhood accidents"". Cardiff and Vale's Regional Safeguarding Children Board agreed that while Elsie's death could not have been predicted it could potentially have been prevented. Elsie's catastrophic injuries included a fractured skull, bruises and a broken leg at the hands of her adopted father at their Cardiff home. But a report said professionals failed to ""see a pattern emerging with injuries"", and that they viewed the adoption as ""very successful"" with events in the child's life viewed through a ""positive lens"". Matthew Scully-Hicks maintained that his adopted daughter's injuries were accidental Personal trainer Scully-Hicks, originally of Delabole, Cornwall, had denied murdering the 18-month-old butwas found guilty at Cardiff Crown Courtafter trial last year. He must serve at least 18 years behind bars before being considered for release. Baby murder 'a rogue' adoption Elsie Scully-Hicks: Dad of adopted baby guilty of murder Baby Elsie's catalogue of injuries 999 call made four days before Elsie died The review, published by the Regional Safeguarding Children's Board on Thursday, said there were missed opportunities ""to raise safeguarding concerns and instigate child protection procedures"" and no evidence was seen of injuries being considered as a pattern. This was despite Elsie needing medical treatment on numerous occasions while in Scully-Hicks's care, including: In November 2015 she went to the GP as she could not bear weight on her leg - an X-ray later found she had a fracture In December 2015 she suffered a large bruise on her forehead In March 2016 she was described as vomiting after falling through stair gates Despite the list of injures, Scully-Hicks's explanations were accepted by health professionals who lacked ""professional curiosity"", the report said. The failure to spot a second fracture on the X-ray in 2015, which was not examined by a specialist paediatric radiologist, meant an opportunity was missed to flag up safeguarding concerns, as getting two fractures from a minor fall would have been highly unusual. Scully-Hicks said Elsie fell down these stairs less than three months before she died Scully-Hicks and his husband Craig went through a year-long assessment before being formally allowed to adopt Elsie. The couple decided Scully-Hicks would stay at home while Craig continued to work as a company director with frequent trips away overnight. But the report said the overall presentation was of a ""happy united family"" and those working with the child either did not consider or did not raise the possibility that the child was being harmed. The sharing of information between social workers and the adoption service did not happen until three weeks after she fell down the stairs, it added. Two social workers and an independent reviewing officer from the Vale of Glamorgan Council saw the large bruise on Elsie's forehead during an adoption review at the Scully-Hicks's home in December 2016. But they failed to make any note of it and it was not brought to the attention of the adoption court, along with concerns that Elsie was developing a squint. This is not the first Child Practice Review, or Serious Case Review, that raises concerns about information sharing. Different organisations and different people within those organisations didn't share information about Elsie's injuries as well as they should have. It meant that individually they all had crucial parts of the jigsaw, but nobody had the full picture of the abuse that Elsie suffered, other than her adopted father Matthew Scully-Hicks - the man responsible for her brutal murder. If professionals had been more curious about her injuries and shared the information properly, safeguarding opportunities might not have been missed and potentially, the outcome could have been different. Scully-Hicks said he did not know how Elsie sustained her fatal injuries During his trial, Scully-Hicks claimed he never harmed Elsie and said she must have suffered her fatal injuries after he changed her for bed at home on 25 May 2016. She died at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales four days later, after doctors determined she could not be saved and her ventilator was switched off. A pathologist said her injuries were ""very typical"" of a shaken baby. A CT scan showed she hadbleeding on the brainand a post-mortem examination revealed she had also suffered broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. There was alsohaemorrhaging within both of Elsie's retinas- associated with inflicted trauma or injury. Dr Sarah Harrison, who examined Elsie after her death, said her leg injuries looked like those sustained in major trauma incidents such as a car accident. Elsie was named Shayla O'Brien by her birth family when she was born in November 2014. She was put up for adoption in May 2015, and adopted by personal trainer Scully-Hicks and his husband when she was 10-months-old. But her birth family said they always hoped she would be reunited with them. However they were visited by social services in January 2017 and were told Elsie had died in May the previous year. Matthew Scully-Hicks claimed Elsie had fallen down the stairs after a wooden stair gate accidentally opened when she pulled herself up on it Following the publication of the report, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board executive nurse director Ruth Walker apologised to Elsie's birth and adoptive family, adding that staff had been ""deeply affected"" by her death. Changes have since been made, including that all children referred by their GP for having a suspected fracture will now be seen by a consultant in A&E. Vale of Glamorgan council's director of social services Lance Carver said it was ""difficult to second-guess"" what would have happened if the bruise had been recorded properly and he apologised for it not being done. He said the death of a child was incredibly rare and supervision changes had been made, including more robust sharing of information. No disciplinary actions had been taken against any members of staff as the report did not ""indicate that it would be appropriate"". The National Adoption Service for Wales said adoption services must learn from Elsie's death.

Drill rapper dies in 'gang' attack,"Siddique Kamara was known by his rap name Incognito A rapper in London's drill music scene, who was cleared of murder earlier this year, has been stabbed to death. Three men were found with stab wounds on Warham Street, Camberwell, at 19:20 BST on Wednesday. Victim Siddique Kamara, also known as Incognito and SK, was cleared at the Old Bailey in January ofmurdering Abdirahman Mohamed. Two men are in custody on suspicion of murder. The Met said ""one line of inquiry is this being gang-related"". Mr Kamara, 23, was friends with fellow rapperRhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, who was found with fatal gunshot wounds in Warham Street in May. Friends have paid tribute to the performer, who was part of the Moscow17 group. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Met said he was pronounced dead at the scene. The two men in custody, aged 18 and 19, were arrested nearby, officers added. The two other wounded men, aged 16 and 31, were airlifted to hospital, where they remain. Drill is a dark form of rap music often featuring violent lyrics. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Kamara spoke about its effect on crime in London. ""You see with the crime that's happening right now, music does influence it. You've got to put your hands up and say drill music does influence it,"" he said. ""But knife crime and gun crime has been going on way before drill music, so if you want to talk about 10 years, 20 years, people were still getting cheffed up [attacked with knives]."" Abdirahman Mohamed was attacked in Peckham in June 2017 - Mr Kamara was cleared of his murder in January Incognito's music videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube. Some feature references to other groups in the capital, including long-running rivals Zone 2 from Peckham. In one track, Moscow17 tell Zone 2 to ""check the scoreboard"", while another asks ""how you gonna make it even?"". Mr Kamara was accused and cleared of murdering Mr Mohamed - a brother of a member of Zone 2 - alongside another member of Moscow17, Kevin Aka-Kadjo. Earlier this year, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick calledon social media platforms such as YouTubeto take down videos that glamorise violence. A police cordon remains in place at the scene on Warham Street, Camberwell Speaking outside the family home, Mr Kamara's father Lamin Kama said: ""Our family are in a lot of distress at the moment."" He declined to comment further, adding only that his son had three brothers. A neighbour, who gave his name only as Andy, said: ""My dog was going crazy and when I looked out there was this guy lying on the floor. There was blood."" Andy, who said he has lived in the area on and off for about 15 years, added: ""It's getting really rough around here."" Reality Check: is London's murder rate still higher than New York's? Drill: Is it right to blame the music genre for violence? Another neighbour, Sidney Virgo, 80, said: ""I knew this was going to happen. As soon as kids start gathering that's when something like this happens."" He said his neighbour's son had also been seriously stabbed on the estate just over a week ago. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, also part of the Moscow17 drill group, was found with fatal gunshot wounds in the same street in which Mr Kamara was stabbed At the time of his death, 17-year-old Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton's mother, Pretana Morgan, called for a halt in the wave of violence in the capital. ""Let my son be the last and be an example to everyone. Just let it stop. What must be, must be,"" she said. ""It's not about race, it's not about nation, it's not about culture. Nothing. It's just a human race."" Wednesday's stabbing happened hours after Cressida Dickreportedly said rates of violence in the capital were stabilising,external. It is the 85th homicide in the capital so far this year. A spike in the number of killings earlier in the year saw London's murder rate overtake that of New York, with knife crime a major factor. Harriet Harman, MP for Camberwell and Peckham, said ""anxiety"" about recent local violence has now turned to ""anger"". She said her constituents believe a reduction in police officers means the area has become ""a safe haven for people to carry out their criminal acts"". Is it right to blame drill music for violence?

President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa has concluded his press conference at State House in the capital, Harare, where he defended the legitimacy of his win at the polls. He said he was validated by both the national electoral commission and EU observers - a statement at odds with the head of the EU observer mission's conclusion that an ""un-level playing field and lack of trust"" had marred the election process. Mr Mnangagwa said: The constitution, as well as domestic and municipal law, states that Zec [the electoral commission] pronounces the one who has won the election. I have accepted it.  The EU told me there was peace, transparency and freedom during the campaign period. They also told me the voting process was peaceful, transparent and well-organised.

""Zimbabwe is open for business"" has been one of his favourite campaign phrases. President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa has called the deaths of six people from clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday ""an unfortunate incident"" and says he will set up an independent commission to investigate what happened. He also pledged to provide support to bereaved families once in office. He told reporters at an ongoing press conference in Harare: I'm informed that after the burning of several vehicles and the locking up of people in a room to burn them, the police was overwhelmed and they summoned assistance from the army to stop the wanton destruction.  I've told the nation I am going to institute an independent commission to inquire into these issues. It will be composed of our nationals as well as foreign nationals.  He also addressed the opposition MDC Alliance's plans to challenge the results of the polls in court: Zimbabwe is enjoying democracy. Any party can proceed to challenge the results in the courts.""

Congolese security forces have fired shots to disperse the several thousand followers of opposition leader MoÃ¯se Katumbi who are waiting to welcome him as he attempts to cross the border from Zambia, says the BBC's Poly Muzalia. Latest reports indicate that Mr Katumbi is currently at immigration on the Zambian side of border town Kasumbalesa, meanwhile his supporters have gathered on the Congolese side. Congolese opposition leader MoÃ¯se Katumbi has crossed
no-manâs land between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo with
thousands of his supporters who came to meet him. He is currently at immigration, reports the BBCâs senior Africa correspondent Anne
Soy. Earlier we quoted his supporters as saying he had crossed the border. On Friday morning, the authorities said he would not be allowed to
enter the country. He had requested authorisation to fly back from South Africa, but when this was denied he decided to fly to Zambia and then cross the border into DR Congo by road. The border town of Kasumbalesa is about 95km (59 miles)
to his hometown Lubumbashi. A wealthy businessman and former governor, Mr Katumbi left
DR Congo in 2016. He was later sentenced in absentia to 36 months in prison
on charges he says are politically motivated. He wants to return before a deadline for people to
register their candidacy for the long-delayed presidential elections â now
scheduled to take place in December. Who is MoÃ¯se Katumbi? Zimbabwe's opposition leader Nelson Chamisa addressed Wednesday's violence, where troops and riot police clashed with MDC Alliance protesters, during a Friday press conference in Harare. ""The thank you we are getting for being peaceful was a thank you of bullets, guns and tanks."" Here are some images from Friday's Friday's conference:  Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, from the MDC Alliance, has called the Zimbabwe election result a ""coup"" against the will of the people. ""Yesterday's coup against your will is temporary,"" he said at a press conference in the capital, Harare, which was delayed by riot police. He said they had ""back-ups"" of voter tallies, which he alleged the ruling Zanu-PF wanted to destroy when police raided the MDC headquarters on Thursday. President Emmerson Mnangagwa won the vote with 50.8% of the vote, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced on Thursday evening. The president avoided a run-off by just 36,464 votes out of more than 4.8 million cast. The opposition MDC Allicance will negate the results of Zimbabwe's July presidential election as it was rigged, the party's leader Nelson Chamisa has told journalists. He said their collated results ""indicated that we won"" by 2.3 million. According to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec), President Emmerson Mnangagwa received 2.46 million votes (50.8%) and Mr Chamisa 2.15 million (44.3%).

Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service The largest independent election observer mission in Zimbabwe says the official results from the presidential poll are broadly consistent with its own findings. The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (Zesn) studied a sample from 750 polling stations and whilst agreeing that the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa won the most votes, it says it cannot definitely confirm whether or not there should have been a run-off. The electoral commission said Mr Mnangagwa had secured 50.8%, narrowly avoiding the need for a second round. The opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa, says he will produce evidence to back up his claim that the election result was rigged. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec), which announced the results, said there was ""no skulduggery"" involved in the vote tally. But EU observers said they had found an ""un-level playing field and lack of trust"" in the election process. EU and Commonwealth observers have criticised the four-day delay in announcing the results A legal adviser for Nelson Chamisa, Zimbabwe's opposition MDC Alliance leader, has told reporters in the capital, Harare, that the press conference will now go ahead.

Can vote heal Zimbabwe?,"Rival party supporters in Harare Zimbabweans are going to the polls on Monday in the first vote since Robert Mugabe was ousted in November, but BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane says the legacy of his 37-year rule cannot be overlooked. They simply cannot imagine defeat. Crowds of Zanu-PF supporters streamed into the national stadium in the capital, Harare, on Saturday morning and every person I spoke to had the same conviction: Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mr Mugabe as president, was going to win. And win big. ""It's gonna be an absolutely resounding victory for Emmerson Mnangagwa,"" said Stanley Bote, a young businessman from Harare. ""You have to consider all he has achieved since coming into office."" There has been a party atmosphere among ruling party supporters Many others simply laughed when I suggested the possibility of an opposition victory. Inside the stadium bands played, rappers rapped. The party went on. Zanu-PF has massive financial resources, control of the state media and immense powers of patronage. In the nearly 40 years since independence, winning by fair means or foul is a Zanu-PF tradition. At the heart of President Mnangagwa's campaign lies an implicit confidence that Zimbabweans will be willing to forget, if not forgive, his own and his party's appalling record of misrule and human rights abuses. Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe The 'crocodile' who snapped back His party's campaign literature and rhetoric stresses the imperatives of the present: investment, jobs, education and health care. In fact all of the things that were steadily ruined in decades of Zanu-PF rule. But Mr Mnangagwa believes the people should be grateful because he and his co-conspirators in the army rid the country of Robert Mugabe last November. This video can not be played In June Emmerson Mnangagwa told Fergal Keane he was as ""soft as wool"" The mantra ""Zimbabwe is open for business"" is repeated ceaselessly as the ruling party presents itself as the guarantor of investor-friendly stability. Ever since the military intervention of last November the new president has been at pains to avoid apologising for the abuses of the past because, as he claimed to me recently, he was ""always for peace"". I asked if he would show humility and acknowledge his own responsibility. He refused, insisting to me that he had never been ruthless but was ""as soft as wool"". This is the essential fiction for a man trying to persuade the international community and his own people that he represents a different Zanu-PF to the one they knew and feared. Yet Mr Mnangagwa was as close as it was possible to be to decisions that inflicted terror and misery. In recent days I travelled to Matabeleland in the south of the country to meet survivors of the massacres of the early 1980s when soldiers of the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade carried out a campaign of torture and killing. Attacks by dissidents opposed to Mr Mugabe opened the way for waves of terror directed against the perceived political enemies of the government. This category was expanded beyond the dissidents to include thousands of members of the Matabele people from the same ethnic group as Mr Mugabe's opponent at the time, Joshua Nkomo. Sinikiwe Ncube's father disappeared when she was 12 years old Mr Mnangagwa was then state security minister. His close ally, Perence Shiri - the current agriculture minister - is remembered in Matabeleland as commander of the Fifth Brigade with the nickname of ""Black Jesus"" because he could decide who lived and who died. Sinikiwe Ncube was 12 years old when two strangers appeared at the door of her family home near Balagwe village. ""They asked my father to come with them and we never saw him again."" Her father, Samson Ncube, was a teacher and may have been targeted because he was an educated man, the kind of figure whose words were trusted by locals. I asked Ms Ncube if she was willing to forgive those responsible for his disappearance. ""How can we forgive when the perpetrators have not acknowledged what they did, when they have not apologised. Let them come and say sorry and then we can forgive,"" she said. Campaigner Dumisane Mpofu, of the human rights group Freedom First, told me that the memory of past atrocities would prompt voters to reject President Mnangagwa. ""Definitely... it is a given,"" he said. ""It is likely to influence people to think differently, knowing they might bring into power a political party able to build sustainable peace for their future.""

""Not at all,"" she replied, ""that's just my shield in case they come calling."" This video can not be played Why Zimbabwe's election is historic The experience of the Matabeleland massacres is confined to an older generation in a distinct geographical area. But more recent excesses linger in the minds of voters across Zimbabwe. The crackdowns that followed the election of 2008 saw murders and beatings. According to Human Rights Watch up to 200 people were killed, more than 5,000 suffered violent abuse and more than 30,000 were displaced. This time around there has been nothing like that violence. But there are persistent complaints of intimidation, the politics of quiet but persistent threat in small villages. There are hundreds of international observers deployed for these elections but can they hope to uncover what happens when a traditional leader or ruling party official warns villagers in remote places? The idea that the ruling party saw and heard everything was carefully fostered in past polls. 23 candidates on the presidential ballot 55 parties contesting the parliamentary vote 5,635,706 people have re-registered to a new voters' roll; the opposition still has doubts about its accuracy 43.5% of registered voters are under 35 10,985 polling stations 16 years since EU and US observers were allowed to monitor elections This election is a test not only of political support but of individual freedom. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has accused the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) - the body which oversees the poll - of bias and arrogance. It has complained repeatedly about irregularities in the voters roll and the security of ballot papers. At one point in the past few days the MDC actively debated boycotting the poll. This video can not be played Zimbabwe election: What do young people want? But anger over past violence and allegations of current intimidation may play to the advantage of the opposition. An opinion poll last week saw the MDC close the gap with Zanu-PF from 11 percentage points to three, with 20% of voters undecided. It is only the second of two opinion polls, so some degree of circumspection is advised. The final MDC rally of the campaign in Harare drew a crowd of many thousands. Under its new leader, Nelson Chamisa, a lawyer and pastor, the party's rallies have taken on the fervour of a revivalist campaign. His skull was fractured when beaten up by state security agents in 2007 Became an MP at 25, a cabinet minister at 31 and could be the youngest president at 40 A recently qualified pastor, he has been using the hashtag #GodIsInIt for his campaign Witty and humorous orator - his rallies and news conferences are accompanied by much laughter The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' He has been criticised for making extravagant promises - the introduction of a high-speed bullet train, bringing the Olympics to Zimbabwe - but younger Zimbabweans in particular relish his energy and optimism. More than 40% of registered voters are under the age of 35. A generation that has lived with relentless economic decline and corruption under Zanu-PF may be willing to overlook Mr Chamisa's more outlandish statements in return for the precious offering of hope. Audrey Garakara is desperate for a job and is confident of an MDC victory At the rally I met Audrey Garakara, a media studies graduate who has been unemployed since leaving college in 2014. She told me economic desperation made her campaign for an MDC victory. ""This is our year. We will have a free Zimbabwe. Free from corruption. We are winning this election."" On both sides there is confidence. Past experience would suggest that the power of the Zanu-PF machine and the promise of stability will see Mr Mnangagwa legitimise his presidency. But Mr Chamisa has run a strong campaign - energetically crossing the country, refining his message to focus on more possible economic ambitions. He was just two years old when Mr Mnangagwa joined Mr Mugabe in the first post-independence cabinet in 1980. On Monday the two will fight for the future of Zimbabwe in an election whose outcome is tantalisingly hard to predict.

Interest rates expected to rise today,"Mortgages can become more expensive when the Bank of England raises the base rate At midday on Thursday theBank of Englandis expected to raise interest rates for only the second time in a decade. Economists and investors expect the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to increase rates from 0.5% to 0.75%. Changes to the Bank rate affect tens of millions of savings accounts, loans and mortgages. This is because banks use it as a reference point for the amount they pay savers and charge borrowers. Any increase on Thursday would follow a similar rise in November 2017,when the MPC raised rates from a record low of 0.25%. It would also take the so-called Bank Rate to its highest level since 2009. Simon Jack: Why interest rates are going up What would an interest rate rise mean for you? Savers 'should not expect too much from a rise' How the MPC makes its decision Investors are betting there is more than a 90% chance that interest rates will rise to 0.75%. Many economists had expected rates to rise earlier. However, weak economic data, partly due to thefreezing winter temperatures caused by the ""Beast from the East""have seen the Bank keep rates on hold this year. The UK economy expanded by just 0.2% in the first three months of the year. Bank staff believe this weakness was temporary and expect the economy to expand by 0.4% in the second quarter. In June,three out of nine policymakers, including the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane, voted for rates to rise to 0.75%. Five votes are needed to change policy. While many analysts expect another split decision on Thursday, solid employment growth, steady pay growth and a rebound in consumer spending are expected to justify an increase. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, to ""stress that the August hike is a slow and steady step on the MPC's path to normalisation"". When the Bank Rate goes up, so should rates on mortgages and savings accounts. When policymakers raised interest rates last November,it predicted that savers would reap the benefits of a rate rise more quickly than borrowers would feel the pinch. In reality, however, it's not so simple. Sir Dave Ramsden, one of the Bank's deputy governors, warned savers ""never"" to expect banks and building societies to fully pass on rate rises. He said the financial crisis had triggered a change in the returns savers should expect. While rates remain low, he said many savings accounts were now offering higher returns than Bank Rate. Cheaper mortgage deals in recent years have also encouraged people to lock in promotional rates. Those on fixed-rate deals will feel no immediate impact from a rate rise. Back in 2010, just 38% of people who took out a new mortgage fixed their rates, according to the Financial Conduct Authority. That figure is now 90% for new mortgages, and two-thirds of all home loans. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates to 0.75% The Bank of England will also release its latest forecasts for economic growth, jobs and inflation on Thursday. While pay is finally starting to outpace price rises, wage growth remains modest by historical standards. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), rose by 2.4% in the year to June. This is slightly lower than the 2.5% rate expected by the Bank in its forecast three months ago. Unemployment, at 4.2% in the three months to May, is slightly higher than the 4.1% predicted by the Bank. On Thursday, the Bank will provide an indication of the level of the rate we should expect in normal times. In other words: when inflation is steady at the Bank's 2% target and the economy is running at its maximum speed limit. Of course, these are not normal times. While any interest rate rises are expected to be ""limited and gradual"", Mr Carney has warned that ""guidance is not a promise of the future path of policy"". He said the final Brexit deal was ""potentially the most important"" factor that would influence monetary policy in the coming months and years, and added that the Bank was ready for all outcomes. In short, guidance is good, but not gospel - and all bets are off in the event of a Brexit shock. More than3.5 millionresidential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate The average standard variable rate mortgage is4.72% On a Â£150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost byÂ£224 A Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers.

Drill rapper stabbed to death in street,"Siddique Kamara was known by his rap name Incognito A rapper in London's drill music scene, who was cleared of murder earlier this year, has been stabbed to death. Three men were found with stab wounds on Warham Street, Camberwell, at 19:20 BST on Wednesday. Victim Siddique Kamara, also known as Incognito and SK, was cleared at the Old Bailey in January ofmurdering Abdirahman Mohamed. Two men are in custody on suspicion of murder. The Met said ""one line of inquiry is this being gang-related"". Mr Kamara, 23, was friends with fellow rapperRhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, who was found with fatal gunshot wounds in Warham Street in May. Friends have paid tribute to the performer, who was part of the Moscow17 group. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Met said he was pronounced dead at the scene. The two men in custody, aged 18 and 19, were arrested nearby, officers added. The two other wounded men, aged 16 and 31, were airlifted to hospital, where they remain. Drill is a dark form of rap music often featuring violent lyrics. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Kamara spoke about its effect on crime in London. ""You see with the crime that's happening right now, music does influence it. You've got to put your hands up and say drill music does influence it,"" he said. ""But knife crime and gun crime has been going on way before drill music, so if you want to talk about 10 years, 20 years, people were still getting cheffed up [attacked with knives]."" Abdirahman Mohamed was attacked in Peckham in June 2017 - Mr Kamara was cleared of his murder in January Incognito's music videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube. Some feature references to other groups in the capital, including long-running rivals Zone 2 from Peckham. In one track, Moscow17 tell Zone 2 to ""check the scoreboard"", while another asks ""how you gonna make it even?"". Mr Kamara was accused and cleared of murdering Mr Mohamed - a brother of a member of Zone 2 - alongside another member of Moscow17, Kevin Aka-Kadjo. Earlier this year, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick calledon social media platforms such as YouTubeto take down videos that glamorise violence. A police cordon remains in place at the scene on Warham Street, Camberwell Speaking outside the family home, Mr Kamara's father Lamin Kama said: ""Our family are in a lot of distress at the moment."" He declined to comment further, adding only that his son had three brothers. A neighbour, who gave his name only as Andy, said: ""My dog was going crazy and when I looked out there was this guy lying on the floor. There was blood."" Andy, who said he has lived in the area on and off for about 15 years, added: ""It's getting really rough around here."" Reality Check: is London's murder rate still higher than New York's? Drill: Is it right to blame the music genre for violence? Another neighbour, Sidney Virgo, 80, said: ""I knew this was going to happen. As soon as kids start gathering that's when something like this happens."" He said his neighbour's son had also been seriously stabbed on the estate just over a week ago. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, also part of the Moscow17 drill group, was found with fatal gunshot wounds in the same street in which Mr Kamara was stabbed At the time of his death, 17-year-old Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton's mother, Pretana Morgan, called for a halt in the wave of violence in the capital. ""Let my son be the last and be an example to everyone. Just let it stop. What must be, must be,"" she said. ""It's not about race, it's not about nation, it's not about culture. Nothing. It's just a human race."" Wednesday's stabbing happened hours after Cressida Dickreportedly said rates of violence in the capital were stabilising,external. It is the 85th homicide in the capital so far this year. A spike in the number of killings earlier in the year saw London's murder rate overtake that of New York, with knife crime a major factor. Harriet Harman, MP for Camberwell and Peckham, said ""anxiety"" about recent local violence has now turned to ""anger"". She said her constituents believe a reduction in police officers means the area has become ""a safe haven for people to carry out their criminal acts"". Is it right to blame drill music for violence?

Google 'plans censored China search engine'The US giant is reportedly developing a search engine that would block sensitive queries.Technology,"The new search app would reportedly ""blacklist sensitive queries"" Google is developing a version of its search engine that will conform to China's censorship laws, reports say. The company shut down the engine in 2010, complaining that free speech was being limited. Butonline news site The Intercept,externalsays Google has been working on a project code-named Dragonfly that will block terms like human rights and religion, a move sure to anger activists. One state-owned newspaper in China, Securities Daily, dismissed the report. When questioned about the claim, a spokeswoman for Google provided a brief statement. ""We provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com,"" it said. What was life like before Google? Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? State firm hosts Apple's data in China ""But we don't comment on speculation about future plans."" Citing internal Google documents and inside sources, it said that Dragonfly was begun back in the spring of 2017 and accelerated in December after Google's CEO Sundar Pichai met a Chinese government official. It said an Android app with versions called Maotai and Longfei had been developed and could be launched within nine months if Chinese government approval was won. Both Reuters and Agence France-Presse said separate sources had confirmed the report to the news agencies. The search app would ""blacklist sensitive queries"", The Intercept says, identifying and filtering websites currently blocked by China's so-called Great Firewall. According to documents it had seen, a search via the app would result in a list with banned websites removed and a disclaimer saying that ""some results may have been removed due to statutory requirements"". It said the BBC News website and Wikipedia would be among those blocked. Google has not officially commented on The Intercept report. Spokesman Taj Meadows told AFP: ""We don't comment on speculation about future plans."" One worker who spoke to Reuters said he had transferred himself out of his unit to avoid being involved in the project. Another source who spoke to AFP said: ""There's a lot of angst internally. Some people are very mad we're doing it."" But some believe such a move should not be a surprise. Chief executive Sundar Pichaiwas quite clear about his ambitions,externalwhen he told a conference in 2016: ""Google is for everyone - we want to be in China serving Chinese users."" Amnesty International said Google should not proceed with the programme. Patrick Poon, a China researcher for Amnesty, said in a statement: ""It will be a dark day for internet freedom if Google has acquiesced to China's extreme censorship rules to gain market access. Hiding from China's all-seeing state Artificial intelligence: Hype, hope and fear ""In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory."" Not a great deal. However, the state-owned Securities Daily cited ""relevant departments"" as saying reports of the return of Google to the Chinese market were not true. Reuters quoted a Chinese official as saying that Google had been in contact with Chinese authorities on the matter, but there was no approval for the programme as yet. Quite simply, China is the biggest internet market in the world. Despite its main search engine and YouTube video platform being blocked, Google still has more than 700 employees and three offices in China, and has been developing alternative projects. Its Google Translate app for smartphones was approved in China last year. It also invested in Chinese live-stream game platform Chushou in January and has launched an artificial intelligence game on the social media app WeChat. There's strict censorship of popular Western sites, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Certain topics like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 are completely blocked. References to political opposition, dissidents and anti-communist activity are also banned as are those of free speech and sex. China has in the past two years imposed increasingly strict rules on foreign companies, includingnew censorship restrictions. ""Don't be evil"" may no longer be Google's motto, but most of its employees still see themselves as working for a business that puts long-term principles ahead of short-term profit. One of those principles is freedom of expression, so if it does go ahead with a censored search engine for China it can expect plenty of pushback, not only from civil liberties groups but from its own staff. After all they managed toend a deal with the US militaryover software for targeting drone strikes. This time the prize - access to the vast and growing Chinese market - is much bigger. But Google is already being warned that complying with Chinese censorship is a complex business requiring an army of moderators. It may decide that the damage to its brand in the West is too high a price to pay for a venture into China whose success is far from guaranteed.

Smaller firms 'should share gender pay gap',"All organisations with more than 50 employees should publish details of what they pay the men and women who work for them, MPs have said. A report by the Business Committee,externalcalled for the net to be widened to include smaller firms, saying there was evidence of wider pay gaps among them. Currently, only firms of more than 250 staff must state the average pay difference between men and women. Committee chair Rachel Reeves said some of the biggest gaps were ""obscene"". The report said recently published gender pay figures had ""shone a spotlight"" on the issue of a gender pay gap and helped women raise any disparities. However, only half of the UK's workforce is covered by the present reporting requirements. The report said the new reporting regime was a ""step forward"", but called for the government to be more ambitious. Key findings from the data published in April included: Gender pay gaps of more than 40% were not uncommon in some sectors Almost four in five (78%) organisations reported gender pay gaps in favour of men Labour's Rachel Reeves, chair of the committee, said the biggest gender pay gaps of more than 40% were ""obscene and entirely unacceptable"". ""Transparency on gender pay can only be the first step. ""A persistent gender pay gap shows that companies are failing to harness fully the talents of half the population. The penalties of working part-time, both financial and in terms of career progression, are a major cause."" What is the gender pay gap at your company? Gender pay gap: Six things we've learnt She said companies needed to ""take a lead"", suggesting they could offer flexible working at senior levels. The report calls for firms to publish annual progress reports, including action plans for tackling any wage gaps. The government said the UK was one of the few countries in the world to require employers to publish comprehensive gender pay gap data. The Government Equalities Office said it was publishing new guidance for firms on recruitment and the progression of women, and ways to close their gender pay gap. Minister for Women and Equalities Penny Mordaunt said it was ""appalling"" that in the 21st Century there was still a big difference between men and women's average earnings. ""We need to take action to ensure businesses know how they can make best use of their best talent and make their gender pay gaps a thing of the past,"" she said. This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? Sam Smethers, chief executive of women's rights group the Fawcett Society, said: ""We have to move on from simply reporting the pay gap, to taking action to close it."" The CBI, the UK business group, said companies with a diverse workforce and leadership perform better than those without. Matthew Percival, from the group, said: ""The gender pay gap is a societal challenge with a complex mix of causes. ""Businesses need to work in partnership with the government on improving careers advice in schools and offering affordable childcare for working parents."" Although there was no requirement to report, 238 businesses with fewer than 250 employees voluntarily filed their pay gap figures by April.

Micro-engraver Graham Short made six of the notes after Kane won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals during the 2018 World Cup. He used the note at a shop in Cefn Coed last Wednesday. The artist previously etchedJane Austen on to new Â£5 notes when they were first circulated and those have been valued at Â£50,000. Mr Short, from Birmingham, chose Merthyr Tydfil because his father was born in nearby Dowlais. This video can not be played Graham Short's portrait of the Queen on a pinhead fetched Â£100,000 The other notes were spent in Meriden in the West Midlands, and the Elephant House in Edinburgh - where JK Rowling used to write. A fourth note will be spent in Northern Ireland. Harry Kane's portrait put on Â£5 notes 'Â£50,000' fiver sent in Christmas card What happened to the fivers 'worth Â£50,000'? He gifted the other two notes to the Football Association and to Tottenham Hotspur forward Kane himself. Harry Kane won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals during the 2018 World Cup Mr Short uses very fine needles to scratch the images into clear sections of the notes. They remain legal tender, so it is up to sharp-eyed customers or shopkeepers to see if they have one. Explaining his decision to spend the money in Merthyr, Mr Short said: ""I wanted someone to find it who perhaps needed the money, and they can perhaps sell it for whatever - holidays or Christmas. ""I like the magical feeling of it and just want people to be as excited as I am. ""It's just a bit of fun, but it also puts my art beyond the walls of a gallery. My art sells for a lot of money now and it's really out of reach for most people. ""But if they find this and sell it and make a lot of money, I'll be really pleased with that."" It is not the first time Mr Short's sterling work has been valued highly, with a portrait of the Queen being sold for Â£100,000 in 2016. The valuation comes from the Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, which insures his etchings at Â£50,000 each. Money specialist website Change Checker says the phenomenon of people spending big money on banknotes depends on the notes having ""an interesting story behind them"". It said: ""AA01 banknotes were part of the first batch of banknotes printed or serial number AK47 have been particularly popular thanks to the machine gun connotations. ""It really is just personal preference and what someone is willing to pay to have a certain banknote in their collection."" Manpreet Kaur, who owns the off licence where the Harry Kane Â£5 note was spent - but failed to spot it for herself - said: ""You don't think.

"Hosepipe ban called off after rainA hosepipe ban for north-west England is called off, days before it was due to start.","Low water levels in Wayoh Reservoir at Edgworth near Bolton last month The first hosepipe ban of the summer that would have affected seven million people in England has been called off. The temporary ban by United Utilities (UU) was due to start in the North West on Sunday to ""safeguard essential supplies"". But recent rainfall, cooler temperatures and a reduction in water usage have led to it being lifted. UU has warned that it may still need to introduce a ban at a later stage if the dry weather continues. Martin Padley thanked customers for conserving water and said the company did not ""want to inconvenience customers unnecessarily at this time"". ""Our leakage teams are working 24 hours a day to find and repair as many leaks as possible and we have been moving water around our network,"" he said. United Utilities last imposed a ban in 2010 ""The long range forecast from the Met Office is one of relatively dry weather into the autumn, so future restrictions are still a possibility if more rain doesn't arrive."" Forecasters predict temperatures in northern England would reach the mid-20s, with some rain while southern parts could reach 30C on Friday. Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. Reality Check: Do hosepipe bans work? What are the effects of a heatwave? How to keep your plants alive in a heatwave Europe's 48C heat record could be broken Mr Padley urged UU customers to continue taking steps to save water in their homes and gardens. Robert Light, from the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""Consumers deserve great credit for the way they've responded to the call to use water wisely."" Earlier this month UU, which supplies about 3.2 million properties, said it wasmoving water from Wales to boost depleted suppliesacross north-west England. The first half of the summer in the UK has been the driest since 1961, UU said. The company's drought plan says its ""minimum level of service""permits bans no more than once in 20 years, on average,external. It last imposed a ban in 2010 and the called off ban would have been the third in the company's 23-year history. Last year, the water regulator handed the company an Â£8m ""underperformance"" penalty.

French rappers brawl at Paris airport,"This video can not be played Booba (pictured) is a well-known rival of Kaaris Two French rappers have been arrested after fighting broke out at a Paris airport that caused flight delays and the closure of part of the building. Booba and Kaaris were detained along with members of their entourages following scuffles at a departure lounge at Orly airport on Wednesday. Police say 11 people were arrested in relation to the incident. The clashes, which took place at a duty-free shop at the airport, were witnessed by dozens of tourists. French rappers Booba (L) and Kaaris Footage posted on social media showed the men fighting between the shelves of the shop and chasing and kicking one another around the departure lounge. The two rappers had been on their way to a concert in Barcelona. However, the reason behind the altercation is not yet clear. ""A small number of flights were delayed by 15 to 30 minutes at the time of the fight and the hall was temporarily closed,"" a spokesperson for the airport told AFP news agency. Booba, real name Ãlie Yaffa, is one of France's most successful rap artists, selling millions of albums and downloads.

Google 'plans censored China search engine',"The new search app would reportedly ""blacklist sensitive queries"" Google is developing a version of its search engine that will conform to China's censorship laws, reports say. The company shut down the engine in 2010, complaining that free speech was being limited. Butonline news site The Intercept,externalsays Google has been working on a project code-named Dragonfly that will block terms like human rights and religion, a move sure to anger activists. One state-owned newspaper in China, Securities Daily, dismissed the report. When questioned about the claim, a spokeswoman for Google provided a brief statement. ""We provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com,"" it said. What was life like before Google? Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? State firm hosts Apple's data in China ""But we don't comment on speculation about future plans."" Citing internal Google documents and inside sources, it said that Dragonfly was begun back in the spring of 2017 and accelerated in December after Google's CEO Sundar Pichai met a Chinese government official. It said an Android app with versions called Maotai and Longfei had been developed and could be launched within nine months if Chinese government approval was won. Both Reuters and Agence France-Presse said separate sources had confirmed the report to the news agencies. The search app would ""blacklist sensitive queries"", The Intercept says, identifying and filtering websites currently blocked by China's so-called Great Firewall. According to documents it had seen, a search via the app would result in a list with banned websites removed and a disclaimer saying that ""some results may have been removed due to statutory requirements"". It said the BBC News website and Wikipedia would be among those blocked. Google has not officially commented on The Intercept report. Spokesman Taj Meadows told AFP: ""We don't comment on speculation about future plans."" One worker who spoke to Reuters said he had transferred himself out of his unit to avoid being involved in the project. Another source who spoke to AFP said: ""There's a lot of angst internally. Some people are very mad we're doing it."" But some believe such a move should not be a surprise. Chief executive Sundar Pichaiwas quite clear about his ambitions,externalwhen he told a conference in 2016: ""Google is for everyone - we want to be in China serving Chinese users."" Amnesty International said Google should not proceed with the programme. Patrick Poon, a China researcher for Amnesty, said in a statement: ""It will be a dark day for internet freedom if Google has acquiesced to China's extreme censorship rules to gain market access. Hiding from China's all-seeing state Artificial intelligence: Hype, hope and fear ""In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory."" Not a great deal. However, the state-owned Securities Daily cited ""relevant departments"" as saying reports of the return of Google to the Chinese market were not true. Reuters quoted a Chinese official as saying that Google had been in contact with Chinese authorities on the matter, but there was no approval for the programme as yet. Quite simply, China is the biggest internet market in the world. Despite its main search engine and YouTube video platform being blocked, Google still has more than 700 employees and three offices in China, and has been developing alternative projects. Its Google Translate app for smartphones was approved in China last year. It also invested in Chinese live-stream game platform Chushou in January and has launched an artificial intelligence game on the social media app WeChat. There's strict censorship of popular Western sites, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Certain topics like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 are completely blocked. References to political opposition, dissidents and anti-communist activity are also banned as are those of free speech and sex. China has in the past two years imposed increasingly strict rules on foreign companies, includingnew censorship restrictions. ""Don't be evil"" may no longer be Google's motto, but most of its employees still see themselves as working for a business that puts long-term principles ahead of short-term profit. One of those principles is freedom of expression, so if it does go ahead with a censored search engine for China it can expect plenty of pushback, not only from civil liberties groups but from its own staff. After all they managed toend a deal with the US militaryover software for targeting drone strikes. This time the prize - access to the vast and growing Chinese market - is much bigger. But Google is already being warned that complying with Chinese censorship is a complex business requiring an army of moderators. It may decide that the damage to its brand in the West is too high a price to pay for a venture into China whose success is far from guaranteed.

'Unequal treatment of victims' condemned,"Abi Ilumoka's family said they were not told her killer had been given escorted visits in the community Victims of offenders whose mental illness contributed to their crime are being ""ignored"" in England and Wales, the Victims' Commissioner has said. Baroness Newlove called for them to be given the same rights as other victims. One woman, whose sister and unborn child were killed, said the family was not told when the offender - who had paranoid schizophrenia - was allowed escorted visits into the community. The Ministry of Justice said it would consider Baroness Newlove's comments. Baroness Newlove conducted a report which suggested that while it was right for the justice system to treat mentally disordered offenders differently to those of a ""sound mind"", all victims should receive the same entitlements under the Victims' Code. However, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme this was not currently the case. ""There are people who don't have a voice and it's vital that they are given the same rights to be heard, as the effect of the crimes is devastating,"" she said. Her review found: victims of mentally disordered offenders are not entitled to submit a victim personal statement (VPS) when the offender's case is reviewed by the Mental Health Tribunal they are not entitled to attend the tribunal and present the VPS in person some victims have to deal directly with hospital staff and not have the support of a victim liaison officer changes announced by the government to make parole more transparent, and decisions open to challenge by victims, will not apply to victims of mentally disordered offenders She said the report highlighted ""the inconsistency"" between the experiences and rights of victims of mentally disordered offenders in Scotland compared with England and Wales. In Scotland, victims can attend the tribunal and submit their statement in person. She said this allowed victims ""to feel they have a voice in proceedings and have a fair hearing"". The Crown Prosecution Service says clinically-recognised mental disorders include personality disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and learning disabilities. Victim's family 'cheated' as killer gets day release Behind bars with a mental illness In 2008, Yemi Ilumoka's sister Abi was stabbed to death by her boyfriend, Benjamin Anabah, while heavily pregnant. Anabah was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia and admitted manslaughter with diminished responsibility. The family were told he would be held indefinitely in a secure hospital. But two years later, Yemi received an email ""out of the blue"" saying Anabah was going to the Mental Health Tribunal and he could be discharged. She began ""shaking and crying"". Abi Ilumoka was killed by her boyfriend, Benjamin Anabah, in June 2008 She had never been informed about what a Mental Health Tribunal was or that this could happen at some point. She later found out, with the help of her MP, that Anabah had been going out of the hospital on escorted visits for two years, without the family being told. ""All along we were thinking he's behind lock and key,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""Turned out he'd been released into the community for visits, with no risk assessment done for family. ""He'd been walking around, going to college near where my mum lives."" After finding out about his escorted leave the family has been informed that Anabah has now been moved to a secure hospital far from the family's home and has not been discharged. Baroness Newlove said the pain and trauma felt by victims of such crimes was ""no less"" than other victims, and that ""they deserve the same care and support"". She added that the Victims' Code should be extended to the NHS, and further training should be given to victim liaison officers and hospital staff who engage with victims, ""so that they know what information they're entitled to and how they should treat vulnerable victims"". The Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to ensuring we continue to have a fair and equitable justice system which includes reflecting the needs of victims"". ""This is why we are spending almost Â£100m on support for victims this year alone, and will publish our Victims' Strategy this summer."" It added: ""Victims of mentally disordered offenders are already entitled to participate in the victim contact scheme and can make representations about conditions of discharge, such as preventing offenders making contact or entering the area where they live.""

The artist previously etchedJane Austen on to new Â£5 notes when they were first circulated and those have been valued at Â£50,000. Mr Short, from Birmingham, chose Merthyr Tydfil because his father was born in nearby Dowlais. This video can not be played Graham Short's portrait of the Queen on a pinhead fetched Â£100,000 The other notes were spent in Meriden in the West Midlands, and the Elephant House in Edinburgh - where JK Rowling used to write. A fourth note will be spent in Northern Ireland. Harry Kane's portrait put on Â£5 notes 'Â£50,000' fiver sent in Christmas card What happened to the fivers 'worth Â£50,000'? He gifted the other two notes to the Football Association and to Tottenham Hotspur forward Kane himself. Harry Kane won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals during the 2018 World Cup Mr Short uses very fine needles to scratch the images into clear sections of the notes. They remain legal tender, so it is up to sharp-eyed customers or shopkeepers to see if they have one. Explaining his decision to spend the money in Merthyr, Mr Short said: ""I wanted someone to find it who perhaps needed the money, and they can perhaps sell it for whatever - holidays or Christmas. ""I like the magical feeling of it and just want people to be as excited as I am. ""It's just a bit of fun, but it also puts my art beyond the walls of a gallery. My art sells for a lot of money now and it's really out of reach for most people. ""But if they find this and sell it and make a lot of money, I'll be really pleased with that."" It is not the first time Mr Short's sterling work has been valued highly, with a portrait of the Queen being sold for Â£100,000 in 2016. The valuation comes from the Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, which insures his etchings at Â£50,000 each. Money specialist website Change Checker says the phenomenon of people spending big money on banknotes depends on the notes having ""an interesting story behind them"". It said: ""AA01 banknotes were part of the first batch of banknotes printed or serial number AK47 have been particularly popular thanks to the machine gun connotations. ""It really is just personal preference and what someone is willing to pay to have a certain banknote in their collection."" Manpreet Kaur, who owns the off licence where the Harry Kane Â£5 note was spent - but failed to spot it for herself - said: ""You don't think. Someone will give you a note and then another customer comes in and needs a five pounds note. ""That's why I missed it.""

Mentally ill offenders' victims 'ignored',"Abi Ilumoka's family said they were not told her killer had been given escorted visits in the community Victims of offenders whose mental illness contributed to their crime are being ""ignored"" in England and Wales, the Victims' Commissioner has said. Baroness Newlove called for them to be given the same rights as other victims. One woman, whose sister and unborn child were killed, said the family was not told when the offender - who had paranoid schizophrenia - was allowed escorted visits into the community. The Ministry of Justice said it would consider Baroness Newlove's comments. Baroness Newlove conducted a report which suggested that while it was right for the justice system to treat mentally disordered offenders differently to those of a ""sound mind"", all victims should receive the same entitlements under the Victims' Code. However, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme this was not currently the case. ""There are people who don't have a voice and it's vital that they are given the same rights to be heard, as the effect of the crimes is devastating,"" she said. Her review found: victims of mentally disordered offenders are not entitled to submit a victim personal statement (VPS) when the offender's case is reviewed by the Mental Health Tribunal they are not entitled to attend the tribunal and present the VPS in person some victims have to deal directly with hospital staff and not have the support of a victim liaison officer changes announced by the government to make parole more transparent, and decisions open to challenge by victims, will not apply to victims of mentally disordered offenders She said the report highlighted ""the inconsistency"" between the experiences and rights of victims of mentally disordered offenders in Scotland compared with England and Wales. In Scotland, victims can attend the tribunal and submit their statement in person. She said this allowed victims ""to feel they have a voice in proceedings and have a fair hearing"". The Crown Prosecution Service says clinically-recognised mental disorders include personality disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and learning disabilities. Victim's family 'cheated' as killer gets day release Behind bars with a mental illness In 2008, Yemi Ilumoka's sister Abi was stabbed to death by her boyfriend, Benjamin Anabah, while heavily pregnant. Anabah was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia and admitted manslaughter with diminished responsibility. The family were told he would be held indefinitely in a secure hospital. But two years later, Yemi received an email ""out of the blue"" saying Anabah was going to the Mental Health Tribunal and he could be discharged. She began ""shaking and crying"". Abi Ilumoka was killed by her boyfriend, Benjamin Anabah, in June 2008 She had never been informed about what a Mental Health Tribunal was or that this could happen at some point. She later found out, with the help of her MP, that Anabah had been going out of the hospital on escorted visits for two years, without the family being told. ""All along we were thinking he's behind lock and key,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""Turned out he'd been released into the community for visits, with no risk assessment done for family. ""He'd been walking around, going to college near where my mum lives."" After finding out about his escorted leave the family has been informed that Anabah has now been moved to a secure hospital far from the family's home and has not been discharged. Baroness Newlove said the pain and trauma felt by victims of such crimes was ""no less"" than other victims, and that ""they deserve the same care and support"". She added that the Victims' Code should be extended to the NHS, and further training should be given to victim liaison officers and hospital staff who engage with victims, ""so that they know what information they're entitled to and how they should treat vulnerable victims"". The Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to ensuring we continue to have a fair and equitable justice system which includes reflecting the needs of victims"". ""This is why we are spending almost Â£100m on support for victims this year alone, and will publish our Victims' Strategy this summer."" It added: ""Victims of mentally disordered offenders are already entitled to participate in the victim contact scheme and can make representations about conditions of discharge, such as preventing offenders making contact or entering the area where they live.""

Brownies launch badge for 'future pilots',"Kate McWilliams said she did not consider becoming a pilot until adulthood Girlguiding group Brownies has launched an aviation badge as part of a campaign to encourage more women to become pilots. To earn the badge, Brownies will have to perform aeronautical experiments and name 40 things that fly. At present, women account for around 3% of commercial airline pilots worldwide. Pilot and former Brownie Kate McWilliams said the plan was to ""engage girls in a pilot career from an early age"", adding it was a ""fantastic"" job. Girlguiding overhauls badges to help girls 'thrive' EasyJet - which is part of the campaign - wants 20% of its new entrant pilots to be female by 2020. The figure was 6% in September 2015, and 12% a year later. The new award is one of117 badges available to Brownies,external, which is made up of girls aged between seven and 10.

Government youth scheme criticised,"Millions of pounds of is being spent on the government's flagship citizenship scheme for young people while local youth clubs are closing, councils say. The National Citizen Service, a four-week summer scheme for 15 to 17-year-olds - accounts for 95% of central governmentspending on youth services,external. But the Local Government Association said only 12% of eligible teens took part in 2016. The government said the service has improved 400,000 young people's lives. Launched by former Prime Minister David Cameron - who now chairs its board of patrons - in 2011, the service cost the government Â£634m between 2014/15 and 2017/18. The government said it was investing another Â£80 million on youth projects. National Citizen Service: Call for 'radical thinking' for voluntary scheme But the LGA said it was ""wrong"" that funding was tied up in one ""very short programme"", saying more than 600 youth centres had closed between 2012 and 2016. The money should instead be given to local councils, who could then provide ""all-year-round provision for young people"", it added. The LGA represents 370 councils in England and Wales. The citizen service runs in England and Northern Ireland. This video can not be played The government hopes even more young people will sign up for service next year The NCS was launched in 2011 by David Cameron as part of his ""Big Society"" project. Now open to teenagers between the ages of 15 and 17, the NCS is a four-week programme that runs in local communities during the summer. Volunteers take part in outdoor activities such as rock climbing and canoeing - while also working on community projects and learning skills such as money management. Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the LGA's children and young people board, said that while the NCS was a ""good programme"", the government needed to ""provide targeted support to a much wider group of young people"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mervyn Kaye, who runs youth clubs in Lewisham, said the work of the NCS was ""great"", but said ""time change"". ""Simply put, youth workers need to be local. At a time of scarcity, local authorities need that cash to fund youth clubs."" He said the NCS helped ""very small numbers"" of young adding: ""Where do they go afterwards, if you cut youth services?"" But the scheme's chief executive Michael Lynas said the NCS was a national scheme which was why it was funded by central government, adding that councils spent twice as much every year on local youth services. He added: ""It's growing very quickly, and it's working for those young people."" This is not the first time the NCS has faced calls for change. In 2017, thePublic Accounts Committee (PAC) saidit ""may no longer be justifiable"" to keep the NCS going unless costs could be brought down. The PAC report added that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which has overall responsibility for the scheme, lacked the data to ""measure long-term outcomes of the programme or understand what works"".

Man dies in stabbing on gun death street,"Siddique Kamara was known by his rap name Incognito A rapper in London's drill music scene, who was cleared of murder earlier this year, has been stabbed to death. Three men were found with stab wounds on Warham Street, Camberwell, at 19:20 BST on Wednesday. Victim Siddique Kamara, also known as Incognito and SK, was cleared at the Old Bailey in January ofmurdering Abdirahman Mohamed. Two men are in custody on suspicion of murder. The Met said ""one line of inquiry is this being gang-related"". Mr Kamara, 23, was friends with fellow rapperRhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, who was found with fatal gunshot wounds in Warham Street in May. Friends have paid tribute to the performer, who was part of the Moscow17 group. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Met said he was pronounced dead at the scene. The two men in custody, aged 18 and 19, were arrested nearby, officers added. The two other wounded men, aged 16 and 31, were airlifted to hospital, where they remain. Drill is a dark form of rap music often featuring violent lyrics. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Kamara spoke about its effect on crime in London. ""You see with the crime that's happening right now, music does influence it. You've got to put your hands up and say drill music does influence it,"" he said. ""But knife crime and gun crime has been going on way before drill music, so if you want to talk about 10 years, 20 years, people were still getting cheffed up [attacked with knives]."" Abdirahman Mohamed was attacked in Peckham in June 2017 - Mr Kamara was cleared of his murder in January Incognito's music videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube. Some feature references to other groups in the capital, including long-running rivals Zone 2 from Peckham. In one track, Moscow17 tell Zone 2 to ""check the scoreboard"", while another asks ""how you gonna make it even?"". Mr Kamara was accused and cleared of murdering Mr Mohamed - a brother of a member of Zone 2 - alongside another member of Moscow17, Kevin Aka-Kadjo. Earlier this year, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick calledon social media platforms such as YouTubeto take down videos that glamorise violence. A police cordon remains in place at the scene on Warham Street, Camberwell Speaking outside the family home, Mr Kamara's father Lamin Kama said: ""Our family are in a lot of distress at the moment."" He declined to comment further, adding only that his son had three brothers. A neighbour, who gave his name only as Andy, said: ""My dog was going crazy and when I looked out there was this guy lying on the floor. There was blood."" Andy, who said he has lived in the area on and off for about 15 years, added: ""It's getting really rough around here."" Reality Check: is London's murder rate still higher than New York's? Drill: Is it right to blame the music genre for violence? Another neighbour, Sidney Virgo, 80, said: ""I knew this was going to happen. As soon as kids start gathering that's when something like this happens."" He said his neighbour's son had also been seriously stabbed on the estate just over a week ago. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, also part of the Moscow17 drill group, was found with fatal gunshot wounds in the same street in which Mr Kamara was stabbed At the time of his death, 17-year-old Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton's mother, Pretana Morgan, called for a halt in the wave of violence in the capital. ""Let my son be the last and be an example to everyone. Just let it stop. What must be, must be,"" she said. ""It's not about race, it's not about nation, it's not about culture. Nothing. It's just a human race."" Wednesday's stabbing happened hours after Cressida Dickreportedly said rates of violence in the capital were stabilising,external. It is the 85th homicide in the capital so far this year. A spike in the number of killings earlier in the year saw London's murder rate overtake that of New York, with knife crime a major factor. Harriet Harman, MP for Camberwell and Peckham, said ""anxiety"" about recent local violence has now turned to ""anger"". She said her constituents believe a reduction in police officers means the area has become ""a safe haven for people to carry out their criminal acts"". Is it right to blame drill music for violence?

Voice calls drop despite smartphone fever,"On average, people pick up their phone once every 12 minutes The number of voice calls made on mobile phones in the UK fell for the first time ever in 2017 - despite the fact we seem hooked on our devices. That is according tothe latest report from telecoms regulator Ofcom,,externalwhich charts what it describes as a decade of digital dependence. A total of 78% of all adults now own a smartphone. On average, people check them once every 12 minutes during their waking hours, the study claims. Two in five adults look at their phone within five minutes of waking, while a third check their phones just before falling asleep, according to the report. A high percentage (71%) say they never turn off their phones and 78% say they could not live without it. While three-quarters of the British public still regard voice calling as an important function of their phones, more (92%) say web browsing is crucial. The report finds that the total volume of calls made on mobiles fell by 1.7% in 2017, even though making them is the cheapest it has ever been. That does not necessarily mean people are talking less, however, because Ofcom has not collated figures for chat apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, which could account for some of the decline. ""Over the last decade, people's lives have been transformed by the rise of the smartphone, together with better access to the internet and new services,"" said Ofcom's director of market intelligence Ian Macrae. ""Whether it is working flexibly, keeping up with current affairs or shopping online, we can do more on the move than ever before. ""But while people appreciate their smartphone as their constant companion, some are finding themselves feeling overloaded when online, or frustrated when they're not."" The Louis family all use their phones daily, for different reasons The Louis family all depend on their smartphones but for different reasons, While mum Kirsten uses it from the moment she wakes up to check social media, the family calendar, the weather as well as for shopping, her husband Andre - who is visually impaired - relies on it for a whole range of things, including booking taxis and reading emails. He describes himself as ""hooked"", saying the phone has been life-changing because, before he had one, he had to rely on the kindness of strangers when out and about. Son Jake currently has his usage restricted to when he is in the family home, where he uses it to play games, message family and friends and go on YouTube. Five-year-old Alice has yet to catch the mobile bug - she does not have a phone and does not want one. For now. Have you set any rules for when and where you use your phone? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The average daily time spent on a smartphone is two hours 28 minutes, rising to three hours 14 minutes for 18 to 24-year-olds, the report indicates. Most people expect a constant internet connection, with the majority of adults saying the internet is an essential part of their lives, and one in five spending more than 40 hours a week online. The average is a more modest 24 hours a week online, with more than half of that time spent on mobile phones. Phone etiquette: How not to lose friends Confessions of a smartphone addict Facebook and Instagram introduce time limit tool What is 5G and what will it mean for you? For the first time, women spent more time online than men, particularly in the age group 18 to 34 where females spent an average half an hour longer online than men. Seven in 10 commuters use their smartphones on their journey to work, with nearly a half saying they use it to complete ""essential tasks"". This video can not be played James Reevell looks at the tricks technology companies use to keep you hooked on your phone On average, users get through 1.9GB (gigabytes) of data each month, according to the report. The amount of time people spend glued to screens has become a focus of the big tech firms in recent months, with both Apple and Google offering dashboards built into their operating systems which allow people to see how much time they spend on various apps and websites. Facebook has also just announced tools to limithow much time people spendon the social network. The fact that mobile phones are now integral to people's lives means they are having to develop a set of etiquette rules about their usage. More than half agree that connected devices interrupt face-to-face conversations with family and friends, with 43% admitting to spending too much time online. The vast majority object to people using their phones during meal times, with both young and old agreeing. But when it comes to whether it is acceptable to be on a phone while watching TV, 62% of the over-55s object compared with only 21% of those aged 18-34. The key function of a mobile device also divides the generations. While older people think web browsing is the most crucial use of their devices, youngsters regard video streaming as more important. Our obsession with our phones is good news for advertisers. Nearly a quarter of all advertising spend is now on mobiles, and if mobile advertising was stripped away, ad revenue would be in decline for the first time. When asked in 2008 what was the most important device they owned, more than half the respondents to that year's report said it was the TV with only 13% identifying their mobile phone as the crucial gadget. Fast forward to 2018 and 48% regard their smartphone as the most important, followed by the TV (28%). The TV remains important though and despite the rise of on-demand and subscription services, broadcast TV still accounts for the majority (71%) of viewing time. Other findings from the report include: 42% of houses now own a smart TV - with Ofcom predicting this will rise substantially in coming years the average household spends Â£124 on communication services each month 40% of households subscribe to Netflix one in eight homes now has a smart speaker Tricks that keep you hooked on your phone.

Can post-Mugabe vote heal Zimbabwe?,"Rival party supporters in Harare Zimbabweans are going to the polls on Monday in the first vote since Robert Mugabe was ousted in November, but BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane says the legacy of his 37-year rule cannot be overlooked. They simply cannot imagine defeat. Crowds of Zanu-PF supporters streamed into the national stadium in the capital, Harare, on Saturday morning and every person I spoke to had the same conviction: Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mr Mugabe as president, was going to win. And win big. ""It's gonna be an absolutely resounding victory for Emmerson Mnangagwa,"" said Stanley Bote, a young businessman from Harare. ""You have to consider all he has achieved since coming into office."" There has been a party atmosphere among ruling party supporters Many others simply laughed when I suggested the possibility of an opposition victory. Inside the stadium bands played, rappers rapped. The party went on. Zanu-PF has massive financial resources, control of the state media and immense powers of patronage. In the nearly 40 years since independence, winning by fair means or foul is a Zanu-PF tradition. At the heart of President Mnangagwa's campaign lies an implicit confidence that Zimbabweans will be willing to forget, if not forgive, his own and his party's appalling record of misrule and human rights abuses. Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe The 'crocodile' who snapped back His party's campaign literature and rhetoric stresses the imperatives of the present: investment, jobs, education and health care. In fact all of the things that were steadily ruined in decades of Zanu-PF rule. But Mr Mnangagwa believes the people should be grateful because he and his co-conspirators in the army rid the country of Robert Mugabe last November. This video can not be played In June Emmerson Mnangagwa told Fergal Keane he was as ""soft as wool"" The mantra ""Zimbabwe is open for business"" is repeated ceaselessly as the ruling party presents itself as the guarantor of investor-friendly stability. Ever since the military intervention of last November the new president has been at pains to avoid apologising for the abuses of the past because, as he claimed to me recently, he was ""always for peace"". I asked if he would show humility and acknowledge his own responsibility. He refused, insisting to me that he had never been ruthless but was ""as soft as wool"". This is the essential fiction for a man trying to persuade the international community and his own people that he represents a different Zanu-PF to the one they knew and feared. Yet Mr Mnangagwa was as close as it was possible to be to decisions that inflicted terror and misery. In recent days I travelled to Matabeleland in the south of the country to meet survivors of the massacres of the early 1980s when soldiers of the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade carried out a campaign of torture and killing. Attacks by dissidents opposed to Mr Mugabe opened the way for waves of terror directed against the perceived political enemies of the government. This category was expanded beyond the dissidents to include thousands of members of the Matabele people from the same ethnic group as Mr Mugabe's opponent at the time, Joshua Nkomo. Sinikiwe Ncube's father disappeared when she was 12 years old Mr Mnangagwa was then state security minister. His close ally, Perence Shiri - the current agriculture minister - is remembered in Matabeleland as commander of the Fifth Brigade with the nickname of ""Black Jesus"" because he could decide who lived and who died. Sinikiwe Ncube was 12 years old when two strangers appeared at the door of her family home near Balagwe village. ""They asked my father to come with them and we never saw him again."" Her father, Samson Ncube, was a teacher and may have been targeted because he was an educated man, the kind of figure whose words were trusted by locals. I asked Ms Ncube if she was willing to forgive those responsible for his disappearance. ""How can we forgive when the perpetrators have not acknowledged what they did, when they have not apologised. Let them come and say sorry and then we can forgive,"" she said. Campaigner Dumisane Mpofu, of the human rights group Freedom First, told me that the memory of past atrocities would prompt voters to reject President Mnangagwa. ""Definitely... it is a given,"" he said. ""It is likely to influence people to think differently, knowing they might bring into power a political party able to build sustainable peace for their future."" Hustling for cash in Zimbabwe 'Magic owls', ghost voters and Zimbabwe's election The story behind Zimbabwe's scarf Is it easier to poke fun after Mugabe? What happened to Zimbabwe's land reforms? Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? But in several encounters I found wariness. ""I have nothing to say,"" a young shopkeeper responded when I asked how she felt about the election. I tried to take a sample of opinion on the dust-blown main street of Maphisa, a small town near the notorious Antelope Mine where bodies were dumped in the 1980s. A group of men was waiting outside a cafe, hoping to pick up casual labour. But they were unwilling to speak. Two women on their way to an opposition rally shook their heads and walked away when I asked for their views. On the wall of a hut in Bhalagwe village, I noticed a flag bearing the face of President Mnangagwa. ""So you're a Zanu-PF supporter?"" I asked the woman living there. ""Not at all,"" she replied, ""that's just my shield in case they come calling."" This video can not be played Why Zimbabwe's election is historic The experience of the Matabeleland massacres is confined to an older generation in a distinct geographical area. But more recent excesses linger in the minds of voters across Zimbabwe. The crackdowns that followed the election of 2008 saw murders and beatings. According to Human Rights Watch up to 200 people were killed, more than 5,000 suffered violent abuse and more than 30,000 were displaced. This time around there has been nothing like that violence. But there are persistent complaints of intimidation, the politics of quiet but persistent threat in small villages. There are hundreds of international observers deployed for these elections but can they hope to uncover what happens when a traditional leader or ruling party official warns villagers in remote places? The idea that the ruling party saw and heard everything was carefully fostered in past polls. 23 candidates on the presidential ballot 55 parties contesting the parliamentary vote 5,635,706 people have re-registered to a new voters' roll; the opposition still has doubts about its accuracy 43.5% of registered voters are under 35 10,985 polling stations 16 years since EU and US observers were allowed to monitor elections This election is a test not only of political support but of individual freedom. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has accused the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) - the body which oversees the poll - of bias and arrogance. It has complained repeatedly about irregularities in the voters roll and the security of ballot papers. At one point in the past few days the MDC actively debated boycotting the poll. This video can not be played Zimbabwe election: What do young people want? But anger over past violence and allegations of current intimidation may play to the advantage of the opposition. An opinion poll last week saw the MDC close the gap with Zanu-PF from 11 percentage points to three, with 20% of voters undecided. It is only the second of two opinion polls, so some degree of circumspection is advised. The final MDC rally of the campaign in Harare drew a crowd of many thousands. Under its new leader, Nelson Chamisa, a lawyer and pastor, the party's rallies have taken on the fervour of a revivalist campaign. His skull was fractured when beaten up by state security agents in 2007 Became an MP at 25, a cabinet minister at 31 and could be the youngest president at 40 A recently qualified pastor, he has been using the hashtag #GodIsInIt for his campaign Witty and humorous orator - his rallies and news conferences are accompanied by much laughter The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' He has been criticised for making extravagant promises - the introduction of a high-speed bullet train, bringing the Olympics to Zimbabwe - but younger Zimbabweans in particular relish his energy and optimism. More than 40% of registered voters are under the age of 35. A generation that has lived with relentless economic decline and corruption under Zanu-PF may be willing to overlook Mr Chamisa's more outlandish statements in return for the precious offering of hope. Audrey Garakara is desperate for a job and is confident of an MDC victory At the rally I met Audrey Garakara, a media studies graduate who has been unemployed since leaving college in 2014. She told me economic desperation made her campaign for an MDC victory. ""This is our year. We will have a free Zimbabwe. Free from corruption. We are winning this election."" On both sides there is confidence. Past experience would suggest that the power of the Zanu-PF machine and the promise of stability will see Mr Mnangagwa legitimise his presidency. But Mr Chamisa has run a strong campaign - energetically crossing the country, refining his message to focus on more possible economic ambitions. He was just two years old when Mr Mnangagwa joined Mr Mugabe in the first post-independence cabinet in 1980. On Monday the two will fight for the future of Zimbabwe in an election whose outcome is tantalisingly hard to predict.

"MP Keith Vaz 'bullied Commons clerks'The ex-home affairs committee chairman is accused of bullying clerks in the Commons, BBC learns.","This video can not be played Former clerk Jenny McCullough alleges she was bullied by MP Keith Vaz Labour MP Keith Vaz bullied clerks who sought to uphold the rules and process of the Commons,Newsnighthas learned. One clerk claims Mr Vaz, who in 2016 quit as the head of a select committee after a tabloid reported he had hired prostitutes, told her she was bad at her job because she was ""not a mother"". Accounts of his behaviour were recorded in the clerk's appraisals but no one in the Commons intervened to protect her. Mr Vaz denies breaching any of the rules of the House and denies bullying. Jenny McCullough served as a clerk in the House of Commons from 2002 to 2011. She has claimed Mr Vaz repeatedly bullied and undermined her position in the House while he was chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. Newsnight's Chris Cook: Analysis on Westminster bullying Other clerks have told Newsnight that this was part of a pattern of behaviour. They said that the Leicester East MP was prone to bullying clerks, particularly those who tried to stand up for the standards of the House. Ms McCullough alleges that Mr Vaz said she was a poor clerk because she was ""not a mother"". He also made jokes about whether Ms McCullough was a security threat, on account of her Northern Irish background and accent. Mr Vaz was chairman of the home affairs committee from 2007 until his resignation in 2016 - the Sunday Mirror reportedhe was caught hiring prostitutes and showing willing to pay for drugs.An inquiry into that is ongoing. Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East Ms McCullough's relationship with Mr Vaz deteriorated rapidly on an official committee trip to Russia and Ukraine in 2008, when Ms McCullough raised concerns with Mr Vaz about his compliance with the rules and protocols of the House. The rules and standards around these trips demand, for example, that MPs arrange an itinerary before leaving that can be signed off. They also demand that hospitality is either arranged by the committee as part of the programme or appropriately declared. Newsnight has seen emails from Ms McCullough to her manager relating her concerns. For example, she was worried about who was paying for a dinner on the trip. ""The chairman refused to tell me who we would be meeting or what the arrangements were beyond that we would be dining with Ivan, a friend of his who was (or used to be, I couldn't find out) a 'senator',"" she wrote. But when she arrived, she discovered that it was what she called a ""large"" and ""opulent"" dinner, thrown in the MPs' honour.  She did not know who the guests at the dinner were. She emailed her manager saying: ""We didn't pay - I didn't know who did."" Ms McCullough says that when she stood up to Mr Vaz about her concerns he launched into a ""tirade"" against her in a hotel lobby. ""He then demanded to know what age I was. He told me that I didn't know how the House worked and that I didn't respect the authority of members - that I had an attitude problem."" She said this was when Mr Vaz told her she was bad at her job because she was not a mother. When they returned, Ms McCullough's colleagues recall Mr Vaz's criticism of Ms McCullough being unrelenting and personal. Ms McCullough told Newsnight that she was eventually asked to stop coming to team meetings, because his reaction to her presence was too disruptive, and prevented any work from being done by the team. She was eventually moved to another job elsewhere in the House. But, not feeling protected at work, later chose to leave. Her problems with Mr Vaz were known to the House of Commons management. Her annual appraisal for the year 2008 stated that ""Jenny had excellent relations with Home Office officials and other witnesses, and with all the committee apart from the chairman, who chose to try to bully her. Jenny understandably and properly stood her ground, which the chairman resented."" A representative for Mr Vaz told Newsnight that he denied any bullying, and said: ""No complaint or allegation of this nature has ever been brought to his attention. ""Our client had considered that he and Ms McCullough had previously had a good working relationship, and had always considered her to be very effective as a clerk."" He particularly denied making light of Ms McCullough's origins or motherhood. After Ms McCullough left the House, she complained about the way that she had been treated. She told Newsnight: ""I didn't feel able to complain about Keith Vaz because I was afraid of him. When I was on the home affairs committee I saw that he had friends in the police and friends in the law. ""He said that one of the principal clerks was a friend and by the time I was leaving the house he had a friend in the Speaker. I thought it could only end badly for me."" The House of Commons told Newsnight: ""We are aware that in the past the House has not had a robust process in place to deal with instances of bullying and harassment. ""We are confident that our new Independent Complaints and Grievance Policy will mean that allegations can be dealt with effectively and sensitively."" Keith Vaz accused of bullying clerks.

"Trump demands inquiry end 'right now'The president said his former campaign manager, now on trial, is being treated worse than Al Capone.US & Canada","Mr Trump said Mr Manafort was being treated worse than the Prohibition-era Chicago mobster Al Capone US President Donald Trump has ramped up his attacks on the Russia investigation by demanding it end ""right now"". In a series of tweets, he said Attorney General Jeff Sessions must halt the inquiry into alleged election meddling. Mr Trump also labelled special counsel Robert Mueller, who leads the probe, ""totally conflicted"". His remarks are notable because he himself has previously acknowledged the US Department of Justice should be free from political interference. According to US media, some Trump aides believe that Mr Mueller will report soon on the findings of his 14-month investigation as they relate to the president. Allow Twitter content?

In a fusillade of tweets on Wednesday, the Republican president also lashed out at the case against his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose trial is entering its second day. Mr Manafort's trial is the first arising from Mr Mueller's investigation. Mr Trump also said Mr Manafort was being treated worse than the Prohibition-era Chicago mobster Al Capone.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later said at a press briefing that the tweet is ""not an order"". She described it as Mr Trump's ""opinion"", adding: ""I think he's been crystal clear about how he feels about the investigation from the beginning."" Analysis by Jon Sopel, BBC North America Editor There is nothing new about the president's frustration, agitation and anger at the special counsel investigation. But this is the first time in overt terms that he has called on the attorney general to fire Robert Mueller. The timing is interesting too - his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has just gone on trial, accused of failing to declare the extent of his business connections with pro-Moscow Ukrainian politicians. It also comes as the Mueller inquiry starts moving closer to the Trump family circle - in particular, the behaviour of his son, Donald Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner over a meeting at Trump Tower during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who had close links to the Kremlin. Technically the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, can't fire Mueller as he has recused himself from the Russia investigation. Ironically, one of the areas the Mueller investigation is looking at is whether the president has used Twitter to try to pressurise or intimidate his attorney general. The president's tweet today might be seen as relevant. Mr Manafort, 69, led Mr Trump's campaign for three months until August 2016. He is charged with tax evasion and money-laundering stemming from his political consultancy work in Ukraine. Trump ex-campaign chief 'lied', court told A courtroom sketch shows Mr Manafort seated during the opening day of his trial on Tuesday But Mr Manafort is not accused of aiding Russia's alleged attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election Mr Trump's way, a focus of the Mueller investigation. The special counsel is also scrutinising whether there were any attempts by the president to obstruct justice. The president wields significant constitutional authority over the Department of Justice since it belongs to the executive branch of US government. But it has been a US civic tenet ever since the Nixon-era Watergate scandal that the agency should be free from political interference. Mr Trump has previously acknowledged it is ""the saddest thing"" that he is not supposed to meddle with the law agency. Utah's Republican Senator Orrin Hatch told journalists that many ""wish the Mueller investigation would go away,"" but added, ""that's not going to happen"". The third highest-ranking Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, told reporters on Capitol Hill: ""Most of us up here believe the process needs to play out, and it will."" Democratic congressman Adam Schiff called the president's words ""an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight"". On Wednesday, District Judge TS Ellis took issue with the term ""oligarch"" - which prosecutors used to describe the Ukrainian politicians for whom Mr Manafort worked - calling the word ""pejorative"". ""We're not going to have a case tried that he associated with despicable people and, therefore, he's despicable,"" the judge said. ""That's not the American way."" On Tuesday, prosecutors called as their first witness Democratic strategist Tad Devine, who worked for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election. Mr Devine described how in 2010 they both assisted now-deposed Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych during his presidential campaign. Mr Manafort ""worked harder than anybody"" during the campaign, he said. The court also heard on Wednesday from an FBI agent who led the raid on Mr Manafort's Virginia home, an incident that has been heavily criticised by Mr Trump. Matthew Mikuska testified that he knocked three times on the door before using a key to open it.

""But of course, this is a unique circumstance and I'm really very keen to get back to work."" The family have spent the first few weeks of Neve's life in a ""bubble"" at home in Auckland, but will return to Wellington, where New Zealand's parliament is based, on Saturday. Ms Ardern took six weeks of maternity leave Ms Ardern's partner Clarke Gayford, a television presenter, will be a stay-at-home dad, allowing her to focus on running the country. It is, she says, a privilege many other women do not have. ""I'm very very lucky,"" she told Radio NZ,external. ""I have a partner who can be there alongside me, who's taking up a huge part of that joint responsibility because he's a parent too, he's not a babysitter.""
