Vietnam braces for killer storm,"People were earlier evacuated from the Vietnamese province of Ben Tre A tropical storm that was threatening southern Vietnam has weakened and is expected to dissipate within 48 hours. The Weather Prediction Center says Storm Tembin, with wind gusts up to 58mph (93km/h), is 170 miles south-southwest of Ho Chi Minh City, and is moving westward. Nearly a million people were earlier told to prepare for evacuation and some 70,000 were moved from low-lying areas. Tembin killed at least 240 people as it swept through the Philippines. Rescuers are searching for more than 100 people still missing. Bridges and roads on the southern island of Mindanao were destroyed or blocked by landslides, while nearly 1,000 houses were wrecked and many rice fields washed away.

Russia doping ban minister steps aside,"Vitaly Mutko will remain the chief organiser of the 2018 football World Cup Russia's most senior football official has temporarily stood down as he fights a ban given for state-backed doping. Vitaly Mutko was banned from the Olympics for life in early December having been accused of running a huge Olympic doping programme. Mr Mutko said he would stand down as president of the Russian Football Union while he contests the ban. He has always denied taking part in doping but Russia was banned from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics. Mr Mutko will continue to carry out his role as the chief organiser of next summer's football World Cup in Russia. Whistleblower Vitaly Stepanov, a former Russian anti-doping agency worker, told the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that Mr Mutko, a former sports minister, ""created and ran"" Russia's ""state-directed"" doping programme. Russian doping - how we got here Who gets Russia's medals in Pyeongchang? Mr Mutko, he said, ""received help from other state officials"" including ""Vladimir Putin's authorisation of a decree that required urine and blood samples carried by foreign anti-doping inspectors to be approved"". Mr Mutko was also directly implicated in the McLaren report,an independent investigation looking into whether the Russia state backed doping in sport. Russia has repeatedly denied running a state-sponsored doping programme. This video can not be played IOC president: An 'unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympics' Mr Stepanov's testimony, made public in early December, led to Russia's ban from the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

'Letting clean Russians compete is right' Mr Mutko, one of Russia's deputy prime ministers, said that he would step down ""so that our organisations are not disturbed during the legal investigation"". He said he was appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Archbishop: Populist leaders 'deceitful',"The Archbishop of Canterbury has used his Christmas Day sermon to focus on terrorist atrocities and deceitfulness of ""populist leaders"" in 2017. Preaching to worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Rev Justin Welby compared the Holy Family to modern-day refugees. He also contrasted Jesus with ""populist leaders that deceive"" their people. His Catholic counterpart, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, called for a rejection of ""radical individualism"" in society. Preaching at the Sung Eucharist service, the Archbishop said that the nature of power meant those who have it, seek to hold on to it. He said: ""In 2017 we have seen around the world tyrannical leaders that enslave their peoples, populist leaders that deceive them, corrupt leaders that rob them, even simply democratic, well-intentioned leaders of many parties and countries who are normal, fallible human beings."" He condemned terrorist atrocities and those who claimed that terror was ""the path to freedom in God"". Like the Popethe Archbishop drew parallels between the Nativity story and the migrant crisis. He said: ""[The Holy Family] flee as refugees, like over 60 million people today. ""Yet their story is the beginning of ours, it is an invitation to lives of freedom, found through God's freely offered love."" In his midnight homily, the Roman Catholic Church's most senior cleric in England and Wales warned of ""radical individualism"" in society  and said there was ""conflict in the air, not dialogue"". Cardinal Nichols added he hoped Christmas would bring ""green shoots of hope"". Speaking to the BBC before the Christmas midnight Mass in Westminster Cathedral, London, Cardinal Nichols said: ""In social media there's a barrage of views and once a statement or claim is made there's immediately a counterclaim, and the mode of exchange is conflict."" Cardinal Nichols was critical of social media He added that society needs ""to get over that notion that faith in God and reason are somehow opposed"". He said ""the heart has reasons that the mind doesn't always understand"". When asked about the part that religion plays in conflicts, he maintained faith was not the primary reason for unrest in places like the Middle East. ""Even the conflict in Northern Ireland; reading of it it that it was essentially about religious faith, is an inadequate rather superficial meaning. ""Most conflicts are about power and  territories and borders and wealth,"" the cardinal said. ""Often religious identity is in there in the mix but I don't think for the most part it is the key issue.""

Pope calls for peace for Jerusalem,"This video can not be played Pope Francis urged people to ""see Jesus"" in the oppressed Pope Francis has used his traditional Christmas Day message to call for ""peace for Jerusalem"" and dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. Acknowledging ""growing tensions"" between them, he urged a ""negotiated solution... that would allow the peaceful co-existence of two states"". US President Donald Trump recently announced that America recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The controversial move drew international condemnation. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Last week, UN members decisively backed a non-binding resolution that said any decisions regarding the status of Jerusalem were ""null and void"" and must be cancelled. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as their future capital, and all countries currently keep their embassies in Tel Aviv. The Roman Catholic leader gave his Urbi et Orbi speech, which in Latin means ""To the city and world"", in Saint Peter's Square. What makes Jerusalem so holy? Profile: Pope Francis Guatemala to move embassy to Jerusalem US plays hardball at UN over Jerusalem vote ""On this festive day let us ask the lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land,"" he told the crowd. ""Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached, one that would allow the peaceful co-existence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognised borders."" The pontiff's speech touched on other pressing international issues,external, from the migration crisis to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, from Venezuela to North Korea. Guatemala has said it plans to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, following Mr Trump's announcement. It joined the US and Israel, and Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo, in voting against the UN resolution. However, 128 countries backed the resolution while others abstained. Jerusalem is home to sites sacred to Judaism and Islam, and because of its role in the life of Jesus, the city is also one of the holiest places for Christians. The city's status goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. This video can not be played Israeli PM Netanyahu: 'I'll be your Christmas tour guide' Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.

Putin rival barred from Russian election,"Mr Navalny was seen as the only candidate with a chance of challenging President Putin Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been formally barred from competing in next year's presidential election. The Central Electoral Commission has said Mr Navalny was ineligible because of a corruption conviction which he says is politically motivated. He has urged his supporters to boycott the March vote. Mr Navalny, 41, was widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging President Vladimir Putin. ""We're declaring a strike by voters. The procedure that we're invited to take part is not an election,"" Mr Navalny said after the decision, adding that he would lead protests across the country. Known for his anti-corruption campaign and protests against Mr Putin, Mr Navalny was given a five-year suspended sentence in a retrial earlier this year on embezzlement charges. Navalny: Russia's vociferous opposition leader The commission's head, Ella Pamfilova, said her institution was simply applying the law which disqualifies Mr Navalny. Twelve of the 13 members rejected his application as candidate, with one member abstaining citing a conflict of interest. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny talks to the BBC's Hardtalk programme in January Reacting to the widely expected decision, Mr Navalny said the case was intended to block him from ""speaking the truth"" about the situation in Russia, and that barring him from running would deny millions of Russians their vote. ""Only Putin and the candidates that he personally chose, ones who don't pose the slightest threat to him, are taking part [in the vote],"" he added. He said he would launch an appeal in Russia's Constitutional Court. Mr Navalny said on Sunday he had gathered the 500 signatures needed to secure his candidacy, hoping that this would pressure the election commission into allowing him to run. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow Alexei Navalny is far from the only opposition politician in Russia. But the anti-corruption campaigner is currently the most popular and best known. For months he's been travelling the country to meet voters, stage rallies and protests. He's been trying to force the authorities to let him run for president by demonstrating his widespread support. There was some speculation that the Kremlin might consider that, to ignite interest in an insipid race and boost Vladimir Putin's legitimacy. But it would also give Alexei Navalny a nationwide TV platform to criticise Mr Putin directly. Now he's been barred, Nr Navalny is mobilising his support network to campaign for a mass boycott, to slash turnout and cut into Mr Putin's mandate. He also plans street protests. But the electoral commission chief on Monday pointed to other critical politicians permitted on to the presidential ballot and shrugged off Mr Navalny's talk of ""millions of supporters"". For now, it looks like the Kremlin has calculated that blocking him from the race is a risk it can manage. Mr Navalny was first sentenced in 2013 accused of embezzling timber worth 16m roubles ($500,000; Â£330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor. The verdict was quashed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which said he was not given a fair hearing.A retrial earlier this yeargave him the exact same sentence. Mr Putin is seeking a fourth term that would see him become the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. He still retains a massive approval rating and is almost certain to ease to victory in the election.

Railway station hosts homeless banquet,"This video can not be played Guests were given goodie bags filled with essentials It's no ordinary commuter Monday at Euston Station in London. The last train left at 23:00 on Sunday and the passengers are home - but the concourse is busy with people sitting down to a Christmas Day feast. An arrivals board reads: ""Special notice: Network Rail invites you to Euston Station. Merry Christmas!"" For the first time, the transport hub has become a homeless shelter for 200 people - as one of many public spaces that normally lie empty on Christmas. Some 45 volunteers have worked overnight to transform the station ready for a banquet of smoked salmon, soup, a roast, and Christmas pudding. Next to barred ticket terminals and a shut WH Smith, Boots and Paperchase, tables and chairs are decorated with red poinsettias. Sharon has come to Euston for some company on Christmas Day One of today's guests, Sharon, says she has worn her best dress for the occasion. ""My support worker Christine told me about this a couple of weeks ago,"" she says. ""I knew I didn't have anything to do. I would be at home on my own and at times you're lonely, especially at Christmas."" Sharon, who moved to London from the US two decades ago, says she had to give up work as a retail manager because of a leg injury, but hopes to return next year. ""I'm on the mend, I'll definitely be dancing today!"" Joe Hendry, Euston's station manager, initially dismissed the idea About 120,000 people pass through Euston every day, making it Britain's fifth-busiest train station, according toticket sales data.,external But today is more relaxed; cheers erupt as a pianist plays Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. It's a novelty for those who normally work at Euston, including station manager Joe Hendry. ""I initially didn't think it would be possible,"" he says. ""But turning up to work today at 06:30 this morning and seeing everyone here - it's wonderful. ""We have a big local homeless population here, so I've seen some familiar faces."" Warning over UK's 'hidden' homeless One in 25 people homeless in worst areas Reality Check: Who is homeless? Jay, originally from Cork, moves from place to place in the area, and is currently living in an abandoned solicitors' office. ""If I wasn't here I'd be in the office - there's 20 of us - we would try and have a good time,"" he says. Jay squats in local properties, and says he would otherwise be unable to afford a Christmas dinner ""We got tickets for today - it's nice to have something to do, we have bare cooking facilities and don't have much money for nice food."" But word has spread. Outside the station, people - many clutching blankets and shopping bags - are trying to get entry to the dinner, which is ticket-only and tightly guarded by Euston's security staff. This video can not be played Network Rail's Steve Naybour: ""Santa came last night"" to Euston The event was the brainchild of a group of Network Rail workers, including Steve Naybour, who was inspired by the Glastonbury Festival's use of vacant fields. ""Every year the festival uses fallow ground that would otherwise be unused - in a similar way, we thought about how we can use our empty stations,"" he says. Steve's used to working over Christmas - and has a shift on Boxing Day - but says today is different. ""It's amazing to see the concourse looking so festive, which would normally be packed with commuters.""

Sound of Music's Louisa von Trapp dies,"Heather Menzies, second right next to Julie Andrews, has died aged 68 Heather Menzies-Urich, who played Louisa Von Trapp in The Sound of Music, has died aged 68. Her death was announced by the estate of the musical's creators, Rodgers & Hammerstein, on Monday. She was diagnosed with brain cancer four weeks ago and died on Christmas Eve, news site TMZ quoted her son Ryan as saying. ""She was an actress, a ballerina and loved living her life to the fullest,"" he told TMZ. Born Heather Menzies in Toronto, she was 15 when the musical film was released in 1965. It went on to win 10 Oscars, including best picture. She played the mischievous third Von Trapp child Louisa, but her later television and film appearances did not hit the same heights. At 23, she posed nude for Playboy magazine under the headline The Tender Trapp, a decision she said horrified her Presbyterian parents, who were originally from Scotland. She married actor and film producer Robert Urich in 1975, but he died in 2002. Among those to pay tribute were Kym Karath, who played Gretl in the film. Allow Twitter content?

Bus crashes into Moscow subway,"This video can not be played The bus hit the entrance of a pedestrian underpass in Moscow A bus left a road in Moscow before ploughing into a subway entrance, leaving four people dead and 11 injured, Russian officials say. Footage shows people scattering as the bus ran down wide steps before being brought to a halt by the tunnel's roof. The incident happened near Slaviansky Boulevard metro station. There is no suggestion it was a terror attack. Russian investigators said the driver told police the vehicle had started to move suddenly. He tried to apply the brakes but they did not work, the investigative committee said. The crash happened in icy conditions. All those killed in the crash were knocked down by the bus, which had been at a standstill before it drove on to the pavement and careered down the steps of the underpass. The victims included a woman in her thirties and a teenager. Health officials said two of the injured were in a serious condition. Interfax news agency reported that the bus was not even a year old. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin told reporters at the scene that an inspection of the entire Moscow bus fleet had been ordered. The driver is being held by police It is not the first deadly incident at the station Security camera footage broadcast on Russian television showed a number of people being struck by the bus as it went down the steps of the metro station in the west of the city. A preliminary examination showed the driver of the bus was sober, news agencies said. He has been held by police. In July 2014,21 people were killed when a train derailednear the same station after braking abruptly. Monday is a normal working day in Moscow, where the Orthodox Christmas will be celebrated on 7 January.

Russia football head quits amid doping ban,"Vitaly Mutko will remain the chief organiser of the 2018 football World Cup Russia's most senior football official has temporarily stood down as he fights a ban given for state-backed doping. Vitaly Mutko was banned from the Olympics for life in early December having been accused of running a huge Olympic doping programme. Mr Mutko said he would stand down as president of the Russian Football Union while he contests the ban. He has always denied taking part in doping but Russia was banned from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics. Mr Mutko will continue to carry out his role as the chief organiser of next summer's football World Cup in Russia. Whistleblower Vitaly Stepanov, a former Russian anti-doping agency worker, told the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that Mr Mutko, a former sports minister, ""created and ran"" Russia's ""state-directed"" doping programme. Russian doping - how we got here Who gets Russia's medals in Pyeongchang? Mr Mutko, he said, ""received help from other state officials"" including ""Vladimir Putin's authorisation of a decree that required urine and blood samples carried by foreign anti-doping inspectors to be approved"". Mr Mutko was also directly implicated in the McLaren report,an independent investigation looking into whether the Russia state backed doping in sport. Russia has repeatedly denied running a state-sponsored doping programme. This video can not be played IOC president: An 'unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympics' Mr Stepanov's testimony, made public in early December, led to Russia's ban from the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Russian athletes who can prove they are clean would be allowed to compete in the Games under a neutral flag. 'Letting clean Russians compete is right' Mr Mutko, one of Russia's deputy prime ministers, said that he would step down ""so that our organisations are not disturbed during the legal investigation"". He said he was appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Curran to make Boxing Day Test debut,"Curran is the son of former Zimbabwe, Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire all-rounder Kevin Curran Australia v England, fourth Ashes Test Venue:Melbourne Cricket GroundDates:26-30 December (23:30 GMT, 25-29 Dec) Coverage:Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Radio 4 LW, online, tablets, mobiles and BBC Sport app. Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app Surrey pace bowler Tom Curran will make his England Test debut against Australia on Boxing Day. The 22-year-old replacesthe injured Craig Overtonfor the fourth Ashes Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. ""He's a feisty character and he gets the ball to move around a bit,"" said England captain Joe Root. ""He's always in the contest. At no point will he hide away from any challenge. If times become hard he will give it everything."" Lehmann to step down as Australia coach after 2019 Ashes Ashes fixtures and results Get Ashes alerts sent to your phone The void left by Overton, who has a fractured rib, could have been filled by fellow fast bowlers Jake Ball or Mark Wood. There was also theoption to hand a debut to 20-year-old leg-spinner Mason Crane,but that would have meant changing the balance of the attack. England have decided against making further changes, despite having already lost the Ashes, with Australia holding an unassailable 3-0 lead. ""This is the best side to win on this surface,"" said Root. ""Other guys are looking for form, and looking to turn things round, and they have an opportunity to do that this week. ""It's a great opportunity on such a big stage. It's an Ashes Test, with so much to play for."" Australia have also been forced into a change as Mitchell Starc's heel problem has resulted in a recall for fellow paceman Jackson Bird. Tom Curran (left) played alongside brother Sam for England Lions against South Africa A during the summer Born in Cape Town, Curran is the son of former Zimbabwe, Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire all-rounder Kevin. Spotted by former Surrey captain Ian Greig, the brother of ex-England skipper Tony, Curran moved to England to attend Wellington School in 2012. Soon after, his father collapsed whilst jogging anddied at the age of 53. Curran remained at Wellington and made his Surrey debut in 2013, qualifying to play for England on residency grounds in 2015. His younger brother Sam, a 19-year-old all-rounder, is also a Surrey regular, while a third brother, 21-year-old Ben, is a batsman who has played for four county second XIs and MCC Young Cricketers. Tom Curran, capped in three Twenty20 internationals and a single one-day internationals, was added to the Ashes squad following an injury to Steven Finn, who himself made the trip to Australia after Ben Stokes was made unavailable. In the tour game against a Cricket Australia XI before the third Test, he served notice of his batting talent by making an unbeaten 77. His bowling is lively, without being express, and contains the variety of a youngster reared on limited-overs cricket. ""He's skilful and a real competitor,"" added Root. ""It's a great chance for him - what a great occasion to start playing Test cricket. ""He never shies away from a challenge. It gives us a chance to see what he can provide at this level."" The build-up to the fourth Test has again involved the trading of opinions, both from within and outside the respective teams. Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said that Root acted like a ""little boy""in the aftermath of his side's third Test defeat in Perth. ""He's entitled to his opinion,"" Root told BBC Sport. ""Obviously I think that is a load of rubbish. ""He doesn't see how we go about things behind the scenes, or how I go about things up close and personal. It's important I go about my things in my own way."" Meanwhile, England seamer James Anderson said onhis BBC Tailenders podcastthat Australia's pace attack has ""problems"" beyond their first-choice trio of Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins. In response, Starc saidhe hopes that his replacement Bird ""sticks it up"" Englandin Melbourne. And Aussie captain Steve Smith said of Anderson's comments: ""That's rubbish, to be honest. ""Does he know that much about Australian domestic cricket? I'm not sure. I know there's plenty of guys who could come in and really do a job for us."" This video can not be played How England lost the Ashes After losing 5-0 in 2013-14, England are looking to avoid a second consecutive whitewash in Australia and a third in 11 years. The tourists are also on a run of eight successive Test losses down under, having never previously lost nine on the trot. In addition, they are on a losing sequence of seven Tests away from home, dating back to the trip to India at the end of 2016. ""It's been bitterly disappointing that we haven't been able to get a win yet,"" Root told BBC Sport. ""The mindset and desire within the team is for us to go and do that. ""We won't be happy until we leave this trip with a win under our belts. We won't be changing the way we go about things in terms of effort or energy. ""We won't be tailing off and we'll trying to turn those strong positions into winning ones.""

What's a royal Christmas like?,"Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancee, will spend Christmas with her future in-laws, it has been confirmed. Ms Markle will join the Royal Family at Sandringham,the Queen's private estate in Norfolk. But what can she expect when rubbing shoulders with the royals at Christmas time? In keeping with their German heritage, the Royal Family start their festive celebrations on Christmas Eve - and this also means that on Christmas Day, the focus is firmly on church and duty, namely the Queen's Speech. They meet on Christmas Eve in the White Drawing Room at Sandringham, the Queen's residence in Norfolk, to exchange presents and finish decorating their 20ft tree. There they enjoy a tea of scones, sandwiches and cakes before retiring to dress for a formal dinner. Celebrations continue until late and in the morning, and each royal wakes to a stocking of small gifts and fruit at the end of their beds. Royal historian Kate Williams told the BBC: ""It's quite set, it's quite formal. It's looked pretty much the same since the Queen's youth, since the 50s. ""You arrive when told to arrive... There are quite a lot of different dresses required - change for church, change for dinner."" This video can not be played The Queen missed the 2016 Christmas service due to a cold On Christmas morning, the royals head to a service at St Mary Magdalene Church in the village of Sandringham - all being well, everyone will make it, but last year theQueen missed out because of a heavy cold. After the service, they usually spend some time meeting well-wishers gathered outside the chapel, before returning to the estate for a traditional turkey lunch. Then, like millions up and down the country, the family settle down to watch television. We all know someone who appears to have everything, but the Queen has several palaces to her name. Luckily for her family, she is said to prefer practical gifts over anything extravagant. Last Christmas, the Duchess of Cambridge expressed her anxiety about what to buy her grandmother-in-law. ""I thought 'I'll make her something,'"" she said, ""which could have gone horribly wrong."" ""But I decided to make my granny's recipe of chutney. ""I was slightly worried about it, but I noticed the next day that it was on the table."" It's very rare for a fiancÃ©e to spend Christmas with the Royal Family, Kate Williams points out. ""What that shows is firstly how serious Harry is about herâ¦ but also how determined she is to make her life in Britain now,"" she says. It'll certainly be a very different Christmas for Ms Markle, with a couple of unusual traditions in particular. Before gifts are given on Christmas Eve, they are placed on a white linen-covered trestle table, with cards marking exactly where each person's should go. Asteroid to be checked for alien tech Netflix defends A Christmas Prince tweet 'You are being programmed' - ex-Facebook VP And at the dinner, Ms Markle will be separated from Prince Harry when, sometime after 10pm, the Queen signals for the corgis to be led out and the ladies to adjourn, leaving the Duke of Edinburgh to serve port or brandy to the men. Finally, like the rest of the country Ms Markle will relax on Christmas afternoon by watching the Queen's Speech. Unlike the rest of the country, though, she'll be watching it with the Queen herself.

Putin foe barred from Russian election,"Mr Navalny was seen as the only candidate with a chance of challenging President Putin Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been formally barred from competing in next year's presidential election. The Central Electoral Commission has said Mr Navalny was ineligible because of a corruption conviction which he says is politically motivated. He has urged his supporters to boycott the March vote. Mr Navalny, 41, was widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging President Vladimir Putin. ""We're declaring a strike by voters. The procedure that we're invited to take part is not an election,"" Mr Navalny said after the decision, adding that he would lead protests across the country. Known for his anti-corruption campaign and protests against Mr Putin, Mr Navalny was given a five-year suspended sentence in a retrial earlier this year on embezzlement charges. Navalny: Russia's vociferous opposition leader The commission's head, Ella Pamfilova, said her institution was simply applying the law which disqualifies Mr Navalny. Twelve of the 13 members rejected his application as candidate, with one member abstaining citing a conflict of interest. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny talks to the BBC's Hardtalk programme in January Reacting to the widely expected decision, Mr Navalny said the case was intended to block him from ""speaking the truth"" about the situation in Russia, and that barring him from running would deny millions of Russians their vote. ""Only Putin and the candidates that he personally chose, ones who don't pose the slightest threat to him, are taking part [in the vote],"" he added. He said he would launch an appeal in Russia's Constitutional Court. Mr Navalny said on Sunday he had gathered the 500 signatures needed to secure his candidacy, hoping that this would pressure the election commission into allowing him to run. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow Alexei Navalny is far from the only opposition politician in Russia. But the anti-corruption campaigner is currently the most popular and best known. For months he's been travelling the country to meet voters, stage rallies and protests. He's been trying to force the authorities to let him run for president by demonstrating his widespread support. There was some speculation that the Kremlin might consider that, to ignite interest in an insipid race and boost Vladimir Putin's legitimacy. But it would also give Alexei Navalny a nationwide TV platform to criticise Mr Putin directly. Now he's been barred, Nr Navalny is mobilising his support network to campaign for a mass boycott, to slash turnout and cut into Mr Putin's mandate. He also plans street protests. But the electoral commission chief on Monday pointed to other critical politicians permitted on to the presidential ballot and shrugged off Mr Navalny's talk of ""millions of supporters"". For now, it looks like the Kremlin has calculated that blocking him from the race is a risk it can manage. Mr Navalny was first sentenced in 2013 accused of embezzling timber worth 16m roubles ($500,000; Â£330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor. The verdict was quashed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which said he was not given a fair hearing.A retrial earlier this yeargave him the exact same sentence. Mr Putin is seeking a fourth term that would see him become the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. He still retains a massive approval rating and is almost certain to ease to victory in the election.

Guatemala to move embassy to Jerusalem,"This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Guatemala is to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, becoming the first country after the US to vow to do so. It was one of only nine to vote againsta UN resolution which in effect repudiated the US' recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Israel's PM thanked Guatemala's president, but Palestinians branded the decision ""shameful and illegal"". Donald Trump's controversial declaration on Jerusalemhas been widely spurned around the world. The status of the city is one of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Arab conflict. Israel considers the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians seek East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for Palestinian state. President Jimmy Morales made the announcement on Facebook,external, noting the ""excellent relations"" between Guatemala and Israel. He did not say when the move would happen. There has been a wave of Israeli-Palestinian clashes since Donald Trump's declaration Guatemala, along with 12 other countries, had their embassies in Jerusalem until 1980, when they moved them to Tel Aviv after Israel annexed East Jerusalem, in a move not recognised internationally. All other countries still have their embassies in Tel Aviv. Guatemala and Israel have a long history of political, economic and military ties. The Central American country is also a major recipient of US aid - something which Donald Trump threatened to cut to states that voted in favour of the UN resolution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked President Morales,external, saying more countries would follow suit. ""It is only the beginning and it is important,"" he wrote on Facebook. On Twitter, the US embassy in Guatemala said (in Spanish) it ""applauded the historic decision"" by Mr Morales. However, the Palestinian foreign ministry said the decision was ""a shameful and illegal act"" that violated the UN resolution. Last week, UN members decisively backed a resolution that said any decisions regarding the status of the Jerusalem were ""null and void"" and must be cancelled. The non-binding vote was approved by 128 states, with 35 abstaining. Another 21 countries did not turn up for the vote. How did your country vote? Aside from the US and Israel, Guatemala was joined by Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo in voting against the resolution. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state. This video can not be played Israeli PM Netanyahu: 'I'll be your Christmas tour guide' Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.

""My mother is particularly pleased to get the photo back as it was an original. ""There was actually no water damage - the frame had disintegrated but the photo remained intact. It looks perfect."" Another potential clue was a stamp on the back with the photographer's name The picture shows Mr Horrod's mother and father at a friend's wedding in Cambridgeshire and is a particularly fond memory of hers. ""Mum is always telling stories about why she remembers it,"" he said. ""There were a few photos that she liked to take everywhere with her to keep them safe, and that was one of them."" Ms Creasey, a teacher who lives in Chesterton, Cambridge, has been rowing for eight years but said she had never come across such an interesting object in the water before. ""I'm really interested in old photos and social history, and I thought I'd share the photo on a Facebook page called Cambridge in the Good old Days 1960s,"" she said. ""Less than an hour after I'd shared it, someone recognised the man in it as a former colleague of hers.

Anger as Peru president pardons ex-leader,"Fujimori was informed in hospital of the pardon by his son Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has pardoned former leader Alberto Fujimori on health grounds in a move that has prompted angry protests. Fujimori, 79, who is serving 25 years for human rights abuses and corruption, was moved from prison to hospital because of health problems on Saturday. Mr Kuczynski denied pardoning him as part of a deal with his party last week to avoid his own impeachment. Police in the capital Lima clashed with protesters after the news emerged. Two members of President Kuczynski's party in the Peruvian Congress, Vicente Zeballos and Alberto de Belaunde, resigned in protest at the pardon. Meanwhile, supporters of the man who led Peru from 1990 to 2000 celebrated outside the city hospital where he was being treated. He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels but his critics considered him a corrupt dictator. His son Kenji tweeted video of himself breaking the news of the pardon to his father in his hospital bed and wishing him a Merry Christmas. Allow Twitter content?

A statement from President Kuczynski's office said he had decided to grant a ""humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori and seven other people in similar condition"", without naming the others. Doctors, the statement added, had ""determined that Mr Fujimori suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable illness and that prison conditions represent a grave risk to his life"". Fujimori was transferred from his cell to a clinic suffering from low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, doctors said. Kenji Fujimori said earlier that his father would probably not go home for several days. The conservative Popular Force (FP) party, led by the former president's daughter Keiko Fujimori, controls Congress and on Thursday tried to impeach President Kuczynski over a corruption scandal. However, her brother Kenji split the FP vote, allowing the president to stay in power and prompting the accusation that Fujimori's release had been promised in exchange. ""To save his own skin he [President Kuczynski] cut a deal with Fujimori's supporters,"" said leftist politician Veronika Mendoza, labelling the president's decision as treason. Mr Kuczynski denied the claim. In 2007, he was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power, but two years later was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office. He was convicted of authorising killings carried out by death squads. Police reportedly fired tear gas at dozens of protesters who turned out on Sunday evening to protest at news of the pardon, waving pictures of victims of the counter-insurgency campaign. ""We believe the pardon was carried out in an illegal manner,"" one unnamed protester told Reuters. ""The medical report that supposedly sanctioned this was a fraud. The reality is that this sadly was a political agreement between the Fujimorists and the current government."" Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, tweeted:  ""I regret Fujimori's humanitarian pardon. ""Instead of reaffirming that in a state of law there is no special treatment for anyone, the idea that his liberation was a vulgar political negotiation in exchange for Pedro Pablo Kuczynski maintaining power will remain forever.""

Despite their differences, both Keiko and Kenjo welcomed the pardon.

Pope makes Christmas plea for migrants,"Many migrants, the pontiff said, were being forced to flee from leaders who ""see no problem in shedding innocent blood"" Pope Francis has urged Roman Catholics not to ignore the plight of millions of migrants ""driven from their land"", during Christmas Eve Mass. The pontiff compared them to Mary and Joseph, recounting the Biblical story of how they travelled from Nazareth to Bethlehem but found no place to stay. He has made defence of migrants around the world a major theme of his papacy. The Pope is set to give his traditional ""Urbi et Orbi"" (""to the city and to the world"") Christmas address on Monday. ""So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,"" he told worshippers who gathered in St Peter's Basilica on 24 December. ""We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away but, driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones."" This video can not be played Church of the Nativity hosts pilgrims on Christmas Eve Pope Francis, the leader of roughly 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, is himself the grandson of Italian migrants. He said many of today's refugees were fleeing from leaders who ""see no problem in shedding innocent blood"". There are more than 22 million refugees worldwide. The latest cross-border influx involves the Rohingya fleeing violence in Myanmar. The Pope visited Myanmar last month and later met members of the Muslim minority who had sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh. The Pope stressed that faith demanded that foreigners be welcomed everywhere. Nuns watch a Christmas Eve procession at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem Christians celebrated Christmas morning Mass at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, built on the site where tradition says Mary gave birth to Jesus. There were fewer pilgrims than usual in the West Bank town this year.

Pope calls for 'peace for Jerusalem',"This video can not be played Pope Francis urged people to ""see Jesus"" in the oppressed Pope Francis has used his traditional Christmas Day message to call for ""peace for Jerusalem"" and dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. Acknowledging ""growing tensions"" between them, he urged a ""negotiated solution... that would allow the peaceful co-existence of two states"". US President Donald Trump recently announced that America recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The controversial move drew international condemnation. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Last week, UN members decisively backed a non-binding resolution that said any decisions regarding the status of Jerusalem were ""null and void"" and must be cancelled. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as their future capital, and all countries currently keep their embassies in Tel Aviv. The Roman Catholic leader gave his Urbi et Orbi speech, which in Latin means ""To the city and world"", in Saint Peter's Square. What makes Jerusalem so holy? Profile: Pope Francis Guatemala to move embassy to Jerusalem US plays hardball at UN over Jerusalem vote ""On this festive day let us ask the lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land,"" he told the crowd. ""Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached, one that would allow the peaceful co-existence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognised borders."" The pontiff's speech touched on other pressing international issues,external, from the migration crisis to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, from Venezuela to North Korea. Guatemala has said it plans to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, following Mr Trump's announcement. It joined the US and Israel, and Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo, in voting against the UN resolution. However, 128 countries backed the resolution while others abstained. Jerusalem is home to sites sacred to Judaism and Islam, and because of its role in the life of Jesus, the city is also one of the holiest places for Christians. The city's status goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. This video can not be played Israeli PM Netanyahu: 'I'll be your Christmas tour guide' Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.

Car rammed into German party's HQA man crashed into the entrance of the SPD's headquarters in Berlin on Christmas Eve.1h36 minutes agoEurope,"The driver crashed into the entranceway of the Social Democratic Party's Berlin headquarters A man rammed a car into the headquarters of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Berlin on Christmas Eve, police have said. The crash happened at around midnight local time (23:00 GMT). The driver, a 58-year-old man, was believed to be the only person injured. The driver told police he had intended to kill himself, Berlin police said. Officers found petrol canisters and lighter fluid inside the car, according to local reports. Investigators were treating the incident as a possible arson attempt and also revealed that the man had earlier left a bag containing gas canisters in front of the headquarters of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the Christian Democrat CDU, a few minutes' drive away. There was no indication that the man, who was slightly injured in the crash, was an extremist, Berlin media said. It was unclear whether the Social Democrats had been holding a function inside the building, known as the Willy Brandt House, at the time. Although a fire broke out, the building's sprinkler system put it out. The SPD governed in a ""grand coalition"" with Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats between 2013 and 2017, but its leaders vowed to end the alliance in September, when the party got its worst results since 1949. Chancellor Merkel has since been unable to form a majority government with other parties, andthe SPD has agreed to ""open-ended"" talks on a possible new coalition.

Rail station hosts homeless for Christmas,"This video can not be played Guests were given goodie bags filled with essentials It's no ordinary commuter Monday at Euston Station in London. The last train left at 23:00 on Sunday and the passengers are home - but the concourse is busy with people sitting down to a Christmas Day feast. An arrivals board reads: ""Special notice: Network Rail invites you to Euston Station. Merry Christmas!"" For the first time, the transport hub has become a homeless shelter for 200 people - as one of many public spaces that normally lie empty on Christmas. Some 45 volunteers have worked overnight to transform the station ready for a banquet of smoked salmon, soup, a roast, and Christmas pudding. Next to barred ticket terminals and a shut WH Smith, Boots and Paperchase, tables and chairs are decorated with red poinsettias. Sharon has come to Euston for some company on Christmas Day One of today's guests, Sharon, says she has worn her best dress for the occasion. ""My support worker Christine told me about this a couple of weeks ago,"" she says. ""I knew I didn't have anything to do. I would be at home on my own and at times you're lonely, especially at Christmas."" Sharon, who moved to London from the US two decades ago, says she had to give up work as a retail manager because of a leg injury, but hopes to return next year. ""I'm on the mend, I'll definitely be dancing today!"" Joe Hendry, Euston's station manager, initially dismissed the idea About 120,000 people pass through Euston every day, making it Britain's fifth-busiest train station, according toticket sales data.,external But today is more relaxed; cheers erupt as a pianist plays Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. It's a novelty for those who normally work at Euston, including station manager Joe Hendry. ""I initially didn't think it would be possible,"" he says. ""But turning up to work today at 06:30 this morning and seeing everyone here - it's wonderful. ""We have a big local homeless population here, so I've seen some familiar faces.""

Jay, originally from Cork, moves from place to place in the area, and is currently living in an abandoned solicitors' office. ""If I wasn't here I'd be in the office - there's 20 of us - we would try and have a good time,"" he says. Jay squats in local properties, and says he would otherwise be unable to afford a Christmas dinner ""We got tickets for today - it's nice to have something to do, we have bare cooking facilities and don't have much money for nice food."" But word has spread. Outside the station, people - many clutching blankets and shopping bags - are trying to get entry to the dinner, which is ticket-only and tightly guarded by Euston's security staff.

""Every year the festival uses fallow ground that would otherwise be unused - in a similar way, we thought about how we can use our empty stations,"" he says. Steve's used to working over Christmas - and has a shift on Boxing Day - but says today is different.

Cardinal warns of 'conflict in the air',"The Archbishop of Canterbury has used his Christmas Day sermon to focus on terrorist atrocities and deceitfulness of ""populist leaders"" in 2017. Preaching to worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Rev Justin Welby compared the Holy Family to modern-day refugees. He also contrasted Jesus with ""populist leaders that deceive"" their people. His Catholic counterpart, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, called for a rejection of ""radical individualism"" in society. Preaching at the Sung Eucharist service, the Archbishop said that the nature of power meant those who have it, seek to hold on to it. He said: ""In 2017 we have seen around the world tyrannical leaders that enslave their peoples, populist leaders that deceive them, corrupt leaders that rob them, even simply democratic, well-intentioned leaders of many parties and countries who are normal, fallible human beings."" He condemned terrorist atrocities and those who claimed that terror was ""the path to freedom in God"". Like the Popethe Archbishop drew parallels between the Nativity story and the migrant crisis. He said: ""[The Holy Family] flee as refugees, like over 60 million people today. ""Yet their story is the beginning of ours, it is an invitation to lives of freedom, found through God's freely offered love."" In his midnight homily, the Roman Catholic Church's most senior cleric in England and Wales warned of ""radical individualism"" in society  and said there was ""conflict in the air, not dialogue"". Cardinal Nichols added he hoped Christmas would bring ""green shoots of hope"". Speaking to the BBC before the Christmas midnight Mass in Westminster Cathedral, London, Cardinal Nichols said: ""In social media there's a barrage of views and once a statement or claim is made there's immediately a counterclaim, and the mode of exchange is conflict."" Cardinal Nichols was critical of social media He added that society needs ""to get over that notion that faith in God and reason are somehow opposed"". He said ""the heart has reasons that the mind doesn't always understand"". When asked about the part that religion plays in conflicts, he maintained faith was not the primary reason for unrest in places like the Middle East. ""Even the conflict in Northern Ireland; reading of it it that it was essentially about religious faith, is an inadequate rather superficial meaning. ""Most conflicts are about power and  territories and borders and wealth,"" the cardinal said. ""Often religious identity is in there in the mix but I don't think for the most part it is the key issue.""

Car rammed into German party's HQ,"The driver crashed into the entranceway of the Social Democratic Party's Berlin headquarters A man rammed a car into the headquarters of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Berlin on Christmas Eve, police have said. The crash happened at around midnight local time (23:00 GMT). The driver, a 58-year-old man, was believed to be the only person injured. The driver told police he had intended to kill himself, Berlin police said. Officers found petrol canisters and lighter fluid inside the car, according to local reports. Investigators were treating the incident as a possible arson attempt and also revealed that the man had earlier left a bag containing gas canisters in front of the headquarters of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the Christian Democrat CDU, a few minutes' drive away. There was no indication that the man, who was slightly injured in the crash, was an extremist, Berlin media said. It was unclear whether the Social Democrats had been holding a function inside the building, known as the Willy Brandt House, at the time. Although a fire broke out, the building's sprinkler system put it out. The SPD governed in a ""grand coalition"" with Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats between 2013 and 2017, but its leaders vowed to end the alliance in September, when the party got its worst results since 1949. Chancellor Merkel has since been unable to form a majority government with other parties, andthe SPD has agreed to ""open-ended"" talks on a possible new coalition.

Pope in migrant plea at Christmas Eve Mass,"Many migrants, the pontiff said, were being forced to flee from leaders who ""see no problem in shedding innocent blood"" Pope Francis has urged Roman Catholics not to ignore the plight of millions of migrants ""driven from their land"", during Christmas Eve Mass. The pontiff compared them to Mary and Joseph, recounting the Biblical story of how they travelled from Nazareth to Bethlehem but found no place to stay. He has made defence of migrants around the world a major theme of his papacy. The Pope is set to give his traditional ""Urbi et Orbi"" (""to the city and to the world"") Christmas address on Monday. ""So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,"" he told worshippers who gathered in St Peter's Basilica on 24 December. ""We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away but, driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones."" This video can not be played Church of the Nativity hosts pilgrims on Christmas Eve Pope Francis, the leader of roughly 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, is himself the grandson of Italian migrants. He said many of today's refugees were fleeing from leaders who ""see no problem in shedding innocent blood"". There are more than 22 million refugees worldwide. The latest cross-border influx involves the Rohingya fleeing violence in Myanmar. The Pope visited Myanmar last month and later met members of the Muslim minority who had sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh. The Pope stressed that faith demanded that foreigners be welcomed everywhere. Nuns watch a Christmas Eve procession at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem Christians celebrated Christmas morning Mass at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, built on the site where tradition says Mary gave birth to Jesus. There were fewer pilgrims than usual in the West Bank town this year. The town has seen clashes in recent weeks between Palestinian protesters and the Israeli army, after President Donald Trump's contentious decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. What makes Jerusalem so holy?

Jailed Peruvian ex-president is pardoned,"Fujimori was informed in hospital of the pardon by his son Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has pardoned former leader Alberto Fujimori on health grounds in a move that has prompted angry protests. Fujimori, 79, who is serving 25 years for human rights abuses and corruption, was moved from prison to hospital because of health problems on Saturday. Mr Kuczynski denied pardoning him as part of a deal with his party last week to avoid his own impeachment. Police in the capital Lima clashed with protesters after the news emerged. Two members of President Kuczynski's party in the Peruvian Congress, Vicente Zeballos and Alberto de Belaunde, resigned in protest at the pardon. Meanwhile, supporters of the man who led Peru from 1990 to 2000 celebrated outside the city hospital where he was being treated. He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels but his critics considered him a corrupt dictator. His son Kenji tweeted video of himself breaking the news of the pardon to his father in his hospital bed and wishing him a Merry Christmas. Allow Twitter content?

A statement from President Kuczynski's office said he had decided to grant a ""humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori and seven other people in similar condition"", without naming the others. Doctors, the statement added, had ""determined that Mr Fujimori suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable illness and that prison conditions represent a grave risk to his life"". Fujimori was transferred from his cell to a clinic suffering from low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, doctors said. Kenji Fujimori said earlier that his father would probably not go home for several days. The conservative Popular Force (FP) party, led by the former president's daughter Keiko Fujimori, controls Congress and on Thursday tried to impeach President Kuczynski over a corruption scandal. However, her brother Kenji split the FP vote, allowing the president to stay in power and prompting the accusation that Fujimori's release had been promised in exchange. ""To save his own skin he [President Kuczynski] cut a deal with Fujimori's supporters,"" said leftist politician Veronika Mendoza, labelling the president's decision as treason. Mr Kuczynski denied the claim. In 2007, he was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power, but two years later was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office. He was convicted of authorising killings carried out by death squads. Police reportedly fired tear gas at dozens of protesters who turned out on Sunday evening to protest at news of the pardon, waving pictures of victims of the counter-insurgency campaign. ""We believe the pardon was carried out in an illegal manner,"" one unnamed protester told Reuters. ""The medical report that supposedly sanctioned this was a fraud. The reality is that this sadly was a political agreement between the Fujimorists and the current government."" Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, tweeted:  ""I regret Fujimori's humanitarian pardon. ""Instead of reaffirming that in a state of law there is no special treatment for anyone, the idea that his liberation was a vulgar political negotiation in exchange for Pedro Pablo Kuczynski maintaining power will remain forever.""

Despite their differences, both Keiko and Kenjo welcomed the pardon. Keiko Fujimori also went to the hospital to visit her father ""On behalf of the Fujimori family, I would like to thank President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for the noble and magnanimous gesture of giving my father Alberto the humanitarian pardon,"" Kenjo tweeted.

Burglary victim reunited with photo,"The photo found floating in the River Cam by a rower on the water showed a smartly-dressed couple A woman who had a precious photo of her late husband stolen in a distraction burglary has been reunited with it. Susan Horrod, 70, had her handbag containing the photo stolen from her home in Milton, Cambridge. Rower Stephanie Creasey spotted a piece of cardboard floating in the River Cam and fished it out, seeing it was a 1960s photo of a glamorous couple. A Facebook post found the owner and the photo was returned, with Mrs Horrod's family describing it as ""amazing"". Mrs Horrod had her handbag containing the photo stolen from her home in Milton, Cambridge ""It's amazing to have it back in such good condition,"" said Mrs Horrod's son Martin, 42, also from Milton. ""My mother is particularly pleased to get the photo back as it was an original. ""There was actually no water damage - the frame had disintegrated but the photo remained intact. It looks perfect."" Another potential clue was a stamp on the back with the photographer's name The picture shows Mr Horrod's mother and father at a friend's wedding in Cambridgeshire and is a particularly fond memory of hers. ""Mum is always telling stories about why she remembers it,"" he said. ""There were a few photos that she liked to take everywhere with her to keep them safe, and that was one of them."" Ms Creasey, a teacher who lives in Chesterton, Cambridge, has been rowing for eight years but said she had never come across such an interesting object in the water before. ""I'm really interested in old photos and social history, and I thought I'd share the photo on a Facebook page called Cambridge in the Good old Days 1960s,"" she said. ""Less than an hour after I'd shared it, someone recognised the man in it as a former colleague of hers.

Wagamama apologises after sickness threat,"Restaurant chain Wagamama has apologised after a manager warned workers they face disciplinary action for calling in sick over Christmas. A note on a rota at one of its London branches said it was the responsibility of ill staff to find colleagues to cover shifts. Wagamama said the manager ""feared team member shortages"" and ""regrettably decided to take this highly unusual approach"", which is not company policy. A union posted the rota on Facebook. A note beneath the rota states: ""No calling in sick! may I remind you that if you are unable to come in for your shift it is your responsibility [underlined] to find someone to cover your shift (as per contract and handbook). ""Calling in sick during the next 2 weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken"". Wagamama insisted the rule was ""strictly not company policy"", and said it was an ""isolated incident"" at its North Finchley restaurant. A spokesman for the Unite Hospitality union said: ""To threaten workers with disciplinary action for being sick is not just morally reprehensible, it may be unlawful under the Health and Safety Act and Equality Act as it discriminates against those with long-term physical or mental health conditions."" The pan-Asian chain, which has been owned by the London-based private equity firm Duke Street Capital since 2011, has more than 100 branches across the UK. A Wagamama spokesperson said: ""Following reports of a notice posted in our North Finchley restaurant we can confirm this was an isolated incident and is strictly not company employment policy. ""The manager involved feared team member shortages over the festive period and regrettably decided to take this highly unusual approach. ""As a company we treat all our team with the greatest respect and understand and appreciate the hard work they all do. We sincerely apologise for what has happened and wish all our team members and customers a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."" The person who brought the rota to Unite Hospitality's attention is a friend of someone who works at Wagamama in North Finchley. ""They sent me that picture,"" he told the BBC.

Will Catalonia become independent?,"Carles Puigdemont rallies separatists via videolink from Brussels Catalonia's independence movement is back in the headlines after Spain's Supreme Court jailed nine separatist leaders, prompting days of protests. The crisis first flared in October 2017, when a banned independence referendum was met with a heavy police crackdown. Madrid imposed direct rule on the region shortly after. It is the country's biggest political crisis since democracy was restored in 1975, after the death of military dictator General Francisco Franco. Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years. Before the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under Gen Franco. Catalan crisis in 300 words Could Catalonia make a success of independence? When Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again underthe 1978 constitution,externaland prospered as part of the new, democratic Spain. A 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a ""nation"", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010. Many Catalans feels they would be better off as an independent nation The 2008 financial crash and Spanish public spending cuts fuelled local resentment and separatism. There is a widespread feeling that the central government takes much more in taxes than it gives back. But the complexity of budget transfers makes it hard to judge exactly how much more Catalans contribute than they get back from investment in services, such as schools and hospitals. Following a symbolic referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election. Catalonia's pro-independence leaders then went ahead with a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also declared illegal by Spain's constitutional court. Organisers said 90% of voters backed a split. But turnout was only 43% amid a boycott by unionists. In a febrile atmosphere the separatist majority in the Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October. Using the Article 155 emergency powers, Madrid dissolved parliament, sacked its leaders and called a snap election for 21 December. Separatists won a slim majority. The following May,Catalonia's parliament swore in Quim Torra as their new president, after Madrid blocked several other candidates. Mr Torra vowed to continue fighting for independence. The sight of Spanish national police beating voters, and politicians being jailed, revived disturbing memories, for some, of the Franco dictatorship. This video can not be played Catalan protests: Watch dramatic street battles in Barcelona on Wednesday Carles Puigdemont - then Catalan president - fled abroad with several other leaders. Many who remained were arrested and charged with treason. Spain's Supreme Court finally sentenced nine of the arrested Catalan leaders in October, sparking the latest unrest. Former vice presidentOriol Junqueras was handed a 13-year prison sentencefor sedition and misuse of public funds. The other eight receive sentences of between 12 and 9 years. Demonstrators took to the streets in fury and have repeatedly clashed with police in some of the worst street violence to hit Spain in decades. If the separatists do ever manage to split away, it would be hard for Catalonia to win recognition internationally. New states mostly emerge from situations where ethnic groups have been victims of genocide or other major human rights abuses. Kosovo was a huge humanitarian crisis for Europe - even so, many countries refuse to recognise it as independent. Catalonia has its own language and distinctive traditions, and a population nearly as big as Switzerland's (7.5 million). It is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, making up 16% of the national population and accounting for almost 19% of Spanish GDP. It's also a vital part of the Spanish state, locked in since the 15th Century.

Generations of people from poorer parts of Spain have moved there for work, forming strong family bonds with regions such as Andalusia. During this crisis, the Catalan economy has suffered. Thousands of businesses, including major banks and energy firms, have moved their headquarters out of the region. The EU has treated the crisis as an internal matter for Spain, deaf to the separatists' pleas for support. However, there have been warnings that the issue is damaging Spain's democratic credentials. In 2017 the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compiles an influential annual democracy ranking, said Spain risked being downgraded from a ""full democracy"" to a ""flawed"" one over its handling of the situation.

Catalan politics as divided as ever,"Pro-independence parties can one again form a majority in parliament The voters of Catalonia went to the polls for the fourth time in four years on Thursday and once again produced a result which demonstrates how deeply divided their society has become. The result provoked an outpouring of joyous relief from supporters of parties who want independence from Spain. They just about hung on to their narrow overall majority in the parliament although the number of seats under their control fell from 72 to 70. They say this was a victory won under duress. The leader of one separatist party, Oriol Junqueras, was in solitary confinement in a Spanish prison when he was re-elected. The head of another - the deposed former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont - was in self-imposed exile political in Brussels from where he told his supporters: ""The Spanish state has been defeated, the independence movement has won. This is a majority that wants a referendum."" But Catalonia's political landscape remains crowded and complicated and it is hard to see a way forward through it. Seven parties will be represented in the new parliament, none of them with more than a quarter of the overall vote. The largest of them, Ciudadanos (Citizens), is a unionist movement - in other words it's as determined to keep Catalonia's links with Spain as its rivals are to break them. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Catalonia snap election: What you need to know The party leader, InÃ©s Arrimadas, said: ""We'll see how a coalition can be formed. We have a very unjust law in Catalonia so that the pro-independence parties can have a majority (in parliament) that they don't have on the street."" Unionists argue that the voting system is biased against them because the pro-independence parties have strong support in small towns and in villages, where it takes fewer votes to win a seat than it does in Barcelona, where a majority favours staying with Spain. But the reality is it's very hard to see how Ms Arrimadas has any realistic chance of forming a government when the numbers are stacked against her - however narrowly. InÃ©s Arrimadas's Citizens party won the biggest number of seats but will struggle to form a government At the party's ""victory"" rally in the centre of Barcelona, one of her supporters, Natalia Ferrer told me she thought Ciudadanos had done well enough to make it impossible for its rivals to push for immediate independence. As she put it: ""I am so happy that we have shown to the rest of Europe and the rest of the world that not everyone in Catalonia is against Spain... there are a lot of people here who want to be part of Spain."" And there, of course, is the problem. One lesson from Thursday's election is that if you keep asking the same people more or less the same question then you'll keep getting, more or less, the same answer. And here is a further layer of complexity, in case this didn't seem complicated enough. The real loser in this latest Catalonian election was a man who wasn't even standing, the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Could Catalonia make a success of independence? Muslim woman seeks seat in Catalonia Catalonia region profile He is an unwavering opponent of the separatist movement and it was his decision to impose direct rule from Madrid after October's illegal referendum. Spain has an independent judiciary, of course, but it's also on Mr Rajoy's watch that opposition leaders from Catalonia have been sent to prison - and could yet face 30-year jail sentences for rebellion and sedition. This video can not be played A look at the key players in Catalonia's regional election It was Mariano Rajoy's decision to call these latest elections and it seems clear that he was gambling that the constitutional crisis of the past few months would have eroded the support for independence. That gamble has failed and now he has to decide how to deal with jailed or exiled leaders who have demonstrated again that they have a popular mandate. He is the man who would presumably have claimed a share of the victory if unionists here had won and on that basis, his is the defeat.

"Jailed Peruvian ex-president is pardonedAlberto Fujimori, 79, is being released by current President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on health grounds.9m10 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean","Fujimori was informed in hospital of the pardon by his son Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has pardoned former leader Alberto Fujimori on health grounds in a move that has prompted angry protests. Fujimori, 79, who is serving 25 years for human rights abuses and corruption, was moved from prison to hospital because of health problems on Saturday. Mr Kuczynski denied pardoning him as part of a deal with his party last week to avoid his own impeachment. Police in the capital Lima clashed with protesters after the news emerged. Two members of President Kuczynski's party in the Peruvian Congress, Vicente Zeballos and Alberto de Belaunde, resigned in protest at the pardon. Meanwhile, supporters of the man who led Peru from 1990 to 2000 celebrated outside the city hospital where he was being treated. He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels but his critics considered him a corrupt dictator. His son Kenji tweeted video of himself breaking the news of the pardon to his father in his hospital bed and wishing him a Merry Christmas. Allow Twitter content?

A statement from President Kuczynski's office said he had decided to grant a ""humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori and seven other people in similar condition"", without naming the others. Doctors, the statement added, had ""determined that Mr Fujimori suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable illness and that prison conditions represent a grave risk to his life"". Fujimori was transferred from his cell to a clinic suffering from low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, doctors said. Kenji Fujimori said earlier that his father would probably not go home for several days. The conservative Popular Force (FP) party, led by the former president's daughter Keiko Fujimori, controls Congress and on Thursday tried to impeach President Kuczynski over a corruption scandal. However, her brother Kenji split the FP vote, allowing the president to stay in power and prompting the accusation that Fujimori's release had been promised in exchange. ""To save his own skin he [President Kuczynski] cut a deal with Fujimori's supporters,"" said leftist politician Veronika Mendoza, labelling the president's decision as treason. Mr Kuczynski denied the claim. In 2007, he was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power, but two years later was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office. He was convicted of authorising killings carried out by death squads. Police reportedly fired tear gas at dozens of protesters who turned out on Sunday evening to protest at news of the pardon, waving pictures of victims of the counter-insurgency campaign. ""We believe the pardon was carried out in an illegal manner,"" one unnamed protester told Reuters. ""The medical report that supposedly sanctioned this was a fraud. The reality is that this sadly was a political agreement between the Fujimorists and the current government."" Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, tweeted:  ""I regret Fujimori's humanitarian pardon. ""Instead of reaffirming that in a state of law there is no special treatment for anyone, the idea that his liberation was a vulgar political negotiation in exchange for Pedro Pablo Kuczynski maintaining power will remain forever.""

"Putin foe 'nominated to run' in electionAlexei Navalny says he has enough nominations to challenge Vladimir Putin, but is officially barred.7h7 hours agoEurope","This video can not be played Mr Navalny's supporters gathered in a huge tent on the outskirts of Moscow Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny says he has gathered enough nominations to challenge Vladimir Putin in March's presidential election. His supporters met in 20 cities across the country to secure the signatures. Mr Navalny is still unlikely to run as election officials ruled him ineligible because of a corruption conviction which he says is politically motivated. Mr Navalny spoke at the Moscow gathering, branding Mr Putin a ""bad president"". He told his supporters in a marquee on a snowy riverbank that he would call a boycott of the election if he were not allowed to stand. Mr Navalny is widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging the president, who is seeking a fourth term that would see him become the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. Russian socialite and TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak is standing in the electionbut some  - including Mr Navalny - regard her as a ""Kremlin stooge"". Alexei Navalny barred from Russia presidential poll Navalny wins European human rights payout Putin to run again for Russian president Profile: Alexei Navalny Separately on Sunday,  an opposition rally called by activist Ilya Yashin was held in the north-west of the capital. Dozens attended the rally, which was streamed live on Facebook by Radio Liberty, chanting ""Russia will be free"" and ""Putin is a thief"". Police declared it ""illegal and provocative"" and vowed to act in ""strict accordance with the law"". However, no-one was detained. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow This meeting in a giant tent on a snowy Moscow riverbank has secured Alexei Navalny well over the 500 signatures he needs to be nominated as candidate. His supporters queued from early morning, cheering and chanting Mr Navalny's name as the finally tally was announced. The anti-corruption campaigner then appeared on stage with his wife and children to a blast of music, giving it all a touch of the American campaign rally.  There was even a burst of red, white and blue confetti. On stage, Alexei Navalny told the crowd that Vladimir Putin does not have the mass support he claims. He insists on the right to run against him, to prove that. His strategy is to try to force the authorities to register him. So if his candidacy is now blocked, despite today's nomination meeting, he's vowed to go on fighting - calling for strikes, an election boycott and street protests. Mr Navalny, 41, needed 500 nominations to secure his nomination. He later tweeted that he had secured the signatures, saying: ""I have become an official candidate nominated by activist groups of voters. Many thanks to those who have taken part in this campaign in all corners of our country. You are the best."" He will hope securing the signatures will pressure the election commission into allowing him to run. The commission's head, Ella Pamfilova, said earlier in the month that because of Mr Navalny's conviction he would be unable to stand and suggested he tried running again in 2028. However, more recently she has said that the commission will examine the candidacy of every presidential hopeful who follows the necessary procedure. Mr Navalny said Mr Putin had during his 18 years in power taken ""from poor people oil, gas and metal worth trillions of dollars, sold it abroad, rewarded those people by turning them from poor to destitute"".

A High Street abduction," Child abduction is very rare - and when other children are responsible it can be particularly hard to comprehend. So when police in Newcastle upon Tyne were told that a missing toddler was last seen talking to two teenage girls, one notorious case from the 1990s immediately came to mind. As the kidnappers crossed the city, police used hundreds of CCTV cameras in a desperate hunt for the missing girl. This is the inside story of what happened. 16:55 - 13 April 2016Northumbria Police Southern Control The 101 non-emergency call, taken by handler Kate McCafferty, seemed routine. “Hello, I'm one of the managers at Primark in Northumberland Street in the middle of Newcastle,” the caller began. “We've got a lost child in store, three years old, but it's over 20 minutes now, and we've had the staff scouring the place and we just can't find her.” The caller, Thomas Clay, was calm but a little concerned. Staff at the busy store are used to dealing with lost children. It can happen several times a day, and the children always turn up within a few minutes, hiding under the clothes displays or wandering around the store. McCafferty was typing away as Clay spoke, creating the police log. “The little girl's mother says the last time she saw her she was standing with two schoolgirls that the mother estimates to be approximately 13 years old. But we haven't seen the schoolgirls either.” “Were these girls talking to her?” asked McCafferty. “She was playing with them, the lady says.” “Right...” said McCafferty. It was two minutes 23 seconds into the phone call. On the recording of the call, all that can be heard is 15 seconds of typing as McCafferty updates her log. But, as she later explains, that mention of the two teenagers sparked an immediate change in the police response. It was the point at which she decided the call was a “grade one response” - the highest priority for the police. Across the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, a huge emergency response was about to get under way for Northumbria Police. 55 minutes earlierNorthumberland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne It had been an ordinary day for Deborah and her daughter Rose [not their real names], who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Deborah, a college student, had been in the centre of Newcastle to see her supervisor about an assignment. She had taken her daughter with her and, by late afternoon, Rose was starting to feel hungry. They visited a cafe on Northumberland Street to grab a bite to eat. Rose, who was two years and nine months old, was still feeling a little fractious. So, at about 16:00, Deborah led her across the road to Primark, a major fashion discount chain, to buy her some clothes. Deborah had hoped it would cheer Rose up. But as she browsed the rails in the second-floor children's clothing section, Rose was pulling against the restraints of her pushchair. So Deborah let her out. “I just went to get a few clothes for her,” she says. “[Rose] was running to-and-fro and playing. I could hear her laughing hysterically and calling out to me.” Deborah was more relaxed now that her daughter was able to let off some steam. At last she could give some thought as to what she might buy. But almost half an hour after entering the store, Deborah was stopped cold by the eerie absence of her daughter's voice. Suddenly I couldn't hear her. I couldn't hear her voice. I couldn't hear her laugh. I couldn't hear her calling out to me. I just started panicking.” Suddenly I couldn't hear her. I couldn't hear her voice. I couldn't hear her laugh. I couldn't hear her calling out to me. I just started panicking.” “And then I remembered those two girls who were paying serious attention to her. My mind went straight back to them.” The girls had seemed like any other shoppers in Primark, sifting through the clothes rails. They were aged about 13, the mother thought, and wearing their school uniforms. It was the after-school rush and the store was busy. “They stopped by to say how cute she was,” recalls Deborah. “I said 'thank you'. [Rose] was running around, playing with them. But I really didn't give it a second thought.” The girls had offered Rose a sweet and although Deborah had at first refused, she relented after her daughter became upset. “So I said, 'OK, just give her one'.” Now, with Rose nowhere in sight, Deborah was starting to panic. She wondered if she had followed the teenagers somewhere else in the store. Deborah sought help from a staff member, and swiftly other staff joined the search. They tried to reassure her that it was not unusual for children to go missing, and that they always turned up. But with the minutes ticking by, Deborah was feeling increasingly anxious. “After five or 10 minutes, I just knew she wasn't in the store. If she was, she would have been crying loudly 'I want my mum'. If the girls were with her they would have brought her back then.” Literally my world stopped. I could not think straight. I could not stop feeling bad. I could not stop feeling guilty.” Literally my world stopped. I could not think straight. I could not stop feeling bad. I could not stop feeling guilty.” “I was beating myself up. How? How could it have happened? How could my child disappear right under my nose? How? And I have no idea of how she left. Who did she leave with? “It's the worst feeling anyone can go through. It's every parent's worst nightmare.” PC Mick Miller, one of several officers who had been dispatched to Primark in response to the 101 call, had made his way to the shop's CCTV room.  PC Mick Miller  He immediately set about locating video of the missing girl. His priority was to work out whether Rose had left the store, so he focused on the surveillance feed covering the main entrance and exit. It took about 15 minutes to find the evidence he had been looking for. “I remember the exact time on the tape,” he says, referring to the 16:29 time stamp of Rose leaving the store. It was the moment everything about the search changed. Police were now sure they were no longer dealing with a missing child - they had a child abduction on their hands. This was now a critical incident. Miller called in the disturbing evidence on his radio, detailing what the teenage girls had been wearing and the fact that one of them was “holding hands with the missing girl”. This image, which police have not released to the public, of a trusting toddler unwittingly being led away from the safety of parental care, has a chilling resonance. It is chilling for several reasons - including how commonplace it must have looked to any passers-by. Two older girls leading a toddler. How could anyone have known that the girl was being abducted? And then there's the uncanny similarity between this image and that of another child abduction - a notorious crime that is seared into the consciousness of the country. It is a grainy image from 1993 that shows a toddler named James Bulger being led away to his death by two young boys.  CCTV image of James Bulger's abduction - 23 Feb 1993(image: PA)  Just as the Bulger image shows young James being spirited away while clasping the hand of one of his killers, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, so the Primark image shows one of the schoolgirls holding Rose's hand. Both images appear to show older children acting in a caring and protective way to a vulnerable youngster. But their intentions couldn't have been be more different. It was the Bulger image that had sprung into Kate McCafferty's head when she had taken the 101 call from the Primark store assistant. Viewing the footage in the store, PC Mick Miller's mind also jumped back 23 years. “I'm 44 years old. I'm old enough to remember the Jamie Bulger case,” he says, before summoning his thoughts about the day of the Primark abduction. I remember making the radio transmission, and there was a split second of silence when everyone digested what had just been said. Everyone's worst fears had been realised.” I remember making the radio transmission, and there was a split second of silence when everyone digested what had just been said. Everyone's worst fears had been realised.” Miller had no time to lose. He immediately snapped a picture of the CCTV image with his phablet and sent it to the control room, for wider circulation around the force.  Northumbria Police office with a ""phablet""  The image sent a shockwave through the police control room where Insp Steve Byrne, in operational charge of city centre policing that afternoon, was based. Immediately, he knew he had to deploy every available police resource. “They'd left the store. They'd been in close proximity to the mother. For me that's certainly something much more sinister,” Byrne explains, describing the thoughts that had raced through his head that day. “The girls would have passed a number of staff members. If they'd had genuine concern for the child they could have alerted the staff.”  Insp Steve Byrne  Within minutes - at just before 17:20 - there was an eyewitness sighting from a member of the public. Rose had been spotted earlier with the teenage girls, further along Northumberland Street. But time was slipping away. It was now more than 45 minutes since the girls had left Primark. PC Mick Miller CCTV image of James Bulger's abduction - 23 Feb 1993(image: PA) PC Mick Miller with a ""phablet"" Insp Steve Byrne All police officers are trained in the principles of the “golden hour”. In any major criminal investigation officers think of the first hour as being a critical window in which to secure evidence, crime scenes, locate witnesses, find missing people and track down suspects while they are still relatively close by. As time goes on it gets harder to do these things. In an abduction case, the golden hour is even more critical - with every passing minute the risk to the abductee increases.  CCTV camera feeds  For Byrne, who was now in charge of the search, the clock was ticking loudly. “First and foremost in the golden hour it's the recovery of the child - the preservation of life. That's what it's all about. But secondly it's about bringing offenders to justice.” With the schoolgirl abductors three quarters of an hour in front, police had some serious catching up to do.  Insp Steve Byrne  Byrne's strategy was to “flood the city centre with officers”. The aim was to put a cordon around the area, which hopefully would contain Rose and the two teenage girls. And while Deborah was deeply distressed by her daughter's disappearance - one witness later described seeing her banging her head against a wall - police needed information from her. She was able to describe the two teenagers and confirm sightings on CCTV. And, by luck, she had taken photos of Rose while travelling into the city on the bus earlier that afternoon. There was now a detailed record of her appearance and what she had been wearing. The police were pulling out all the stops, yet Deborah still felt helpless. As a parent, you just feel the police are not doing enough. You just feel you want to get out there to look for her yourself.” As a parent, you just feel the police are not doing enough. You just feel you want to get out there to look for her yourself.” A cordon was put in place around the northern end of Northumberland Street. Officers swamped the precinct around Primark, questioning members of the public and searching other shops and the bus station a few hundred metres away. But while Byrne had effectively secured the area, he was painfully aware of a vulnerability in the police seal - a Metro station. Haymarket station is only a couple of minutes' walk from Primark. With the Tyneside Metro providing rapid access to the Northumberland coast and to the airport, the teenagers could, by now, have travelled far beyond the city centre. Byrne could see a tiny search area rapidly growing to one that was more than 200 sq miles. And no-one has the resources to cordon off an entire city. “We were playing catch up,” says Byrne. “[Forty-five minutes] is an extremely long time and at that point we were extremely concerned for the welfare of that young child.” But had anyone been closely observing the girls' behaviour that day, they would have realised Rose's teenage abductors hadn't acted on a whim. They had been building up to this kidnapping for hours at least - honing their tactics and even trying, though failing, to spirit away another young girl. CCTV camera feeds Insp Steve Byrne Platform at Haymarket station Later, when the police pieced together what had happened that day, they were able to reconstruct almost every move the teenagers had made, using thousands of hours of CCTV from across the city. McDonald's on Northumberland Street The girls, who were aged 13 and 14, are sisters - but they cannot be identified because of a court order. Although they were wearing school uniform, they had not been to school that day, 13 April 2016. They had truanted and surveillance cameras recorded them boarding a Metro train at 08:22, heading for the city centre. They had spent almost all day at Primark, popping in and out on occasion to shops such as Boots and McDonald's. In Boots they had stolen dummies - a significant act, say police, because it suggests that the abduction was carefully planned. But more worryingly, CCTV recordings in Primark show that they had attempted to abduct another two-year-old out shopping with her mother, about three hours earlier. What happened turned out to be rather like a dress rehearsal. Both teenagers had played with the little girl, and complimented the mother on her daughter, saying that she was beautiful. Later her mother glanced up from the clothes she had been looking at and realised her daughter was missing. CCTV shows the 13-year-old leading this little girl away by the hand, while the older teenager deliberately misdirects the mother, claiming her daughter had gone in a different direction. As it happened, the mother ignored the false advice and eventually found her daughter - who by this time was with both girls near the lifts leading down to the ground floor. The mother assumed the girls had found her child wandering, thanked them, and later left the store. Det Sgt Stu Liddell The teenagers had clearly showed a degree of persistence and planning, says Det Sgt Stu Liddell, although their tactics were naive. “It was a very juvenile plan, in that they did not have a focus on CCTV and 'how could we get caught here'? But I have no doubt that their purpose, from getting on the train, to travelling into the city centre, was to take a child.” Once they had led Rose out of the store, their persistence didn't let up. As they ushered her through the rush hour crowds on Northumberland Street, they were challenged by passers-by, who asked them if the little girl with them was lost. Some members of the public had clearly reacted to seeing Rose, who is black, in the company of two teenage white girls. In each case the teenagers deceived well-meaning strangers into thinking everything was OK. But all this was learned in the aftermath of the event, with the benefit of hindsight. In the melee which followed Rose's disappearance, the rapid use of CCTV had not only proved that she had indeed been abducted, it was to be the vital tool for tracking the kidnappers, and predicting where they would go next. 17:20 Newcastle Civic Centre Tracking the girls on CCTV After radioing in the sighting of the suspects by a council worker, PC Marie Chapman, along with two other officers, made a bee-line for Newcastle City Council's CCTV nerve centre. Their urgent task was to use video footage to find out where the teenagers had been going with the child. It's a darkened room with a wall of monitor screens showing images from hundreds of cameras placed around the city centre and on the Metro train system. Racks of computer servers make a constant whir as they record the multiple video feeds. Tracking the girls on CCTV PC Marie Chapman Chapman, who later recalled a palpable sense of tension and urgency in the room, and the other officers, enlisted the help of a CCTV operator. Their aim was to track Rose and her abductors' getaway route by piecing together snippets of video from the hundreds of feeds, and all in double-quick time. “He had three of us shouting, we need to check this - we need to check that. Hold on a minute. Can you go back? That's them. Right we've got them, so we need to concentrate on this particular area. Tracking the girls on CCTV “Obviously the main thing is to try to get the child back as quickly as possible. As officers, we're still human beings, and we panic, and we're trying to get it done as quickly as possible. The radio is going, and everyone is shouting up, and everyone wants the information straight away. “It was panic stations, if I'm honest,” Chapman recalls. More than an hour after the girls left Primark, police radio recordings captured the moment officers spotted the teenagers on CCTV. Police officers at Haymarket station The CCTV images showed them walking into Haymarket Station, with the toddler, at 16:34. Further film showed them travelling down the escalator, on the platform, and getting on a train. After apparently dragging the little girl, the CCTV showed one of them picking her up and carrying her down the escalator, to wait for a northbound train. The city centre cordon had been breached at its weakest point. Senior officers started dispatching police to every Metro station on the northbound line. But the CCTV evidence confirmed that with every passing minute, the teenagers were getting further and further away. Later, passengers who had seen the teenagers on the train, described them giving the little girl sweets and Coca Cola, and telling her “don't worry, we'll get you to your mummy”. But what the girls were really doing was putting as much distance between Rose and her mother as they could. Insp Steve Byrne, who was still steering the operation, describes hearing at the time a report about Rose being dragged and carried, and how this set alarm bells ringing even louder for his officers: It was extremely worrying. I was standing in the office with two other sergeants. Looking at their faces you could see the horror.” It was extremely worrying. I was standing in the office with two other sergeants. Looking at their faces you could see the horror.” Finally, one of the sergeants gave voice to the dread that everyone had, until then, been keeping to themselves - James Bulger. “As soon as I heard that the child was being carried in a direction away from the store, away from her mother, [Bulger is] what sprung to mind, yes,” says Byrne. “For a uniformed inspector, or for another officer on duty at that time, I think most of us felt that way. It's an incident that you don't think you'll ever encounter, and hope you won't ever. But there we were, faced with just that.” 17:20 Newcastle Civic Centre After radioing in the sighting of the suspects by a council worker, PC Marie Chapman, along with two other officers, made a bee-line for Newcastle City Council's CCTV nerve centre.

PC Graham Dodds was working a late shift in the North Tyneside area of Northumbria Police - known to officers as Delta 3. He was a few miles north-east of the city centre, and so was not involved in the rapidly escalating response to the kidnapping. Instead of going straight out on patrol, he had begun his shift at his desk, dealing with paperwork. At 17:35 - 66 minutes after the abduction - he was handed a missing person report. It was a routine one about two teenage girls who had been reported missing from school earlier in the day. “I was literally just reading it. I was at the stage where I'd just read the description of the girls, read the circumstances - that they had left home, hadn't turned in at school, had been reported as missing - and I was just busy working my way through it to build a big picture.” Sitting on the desk was his radio. Experienced officers like Dodds are used to multitasking, dealing with the job in hand while keeping half an ear out for the two-way radio. The radio was buzzing with updates on the child missing from Primark. “As soon as [I heard] the description of the two girls who were with the young girl - approximately 13 years old, wearing school uniforms - straight away I thought, hang on, this sounds like my two girls,” says Dodds. It was just too much of a coincidence, to hear about these two young schoolgirls. Not to sound too cliched about it, but I just had this sixth sense that it's got to be them.” It was just too much of a coincidence, to hear about these two young schoolgirls. Not to sound too cliched about it, but I just had this sixth sense that it's got to be them.” Dodds phoned the control room - he couldn't get through on the saturated radio channel - and told them about his suspicion that the two teenagers were the same missing schoolgirls. Seventy-eight minutes after the abduction from Primark, an operator relayed Dodds' crucial piece of intelligence over the police radio. Officers were immediately dispatched to the teenage girls' home. Now police had potential names for the two teenage kidnap suspects. Further inquiries would be needed to confirm it, but at last they had a vital lead. Dodds was liaising with another officer who'd been sent to the teenage sisters' home. Their mother confirmed that they'd not been home since leaving that morning, and that they matched the description of the two wanted girls. “It's gone from having two unknown females, to now having two names to them,” says Dodds. “Now you're able to look into the background of them. To use the information you have in front of you to try to find out where they're going to hopefully go.” Dodds went on to the force computer system to see what intelligence they had on the girls. They'd not been in trouble with the police before, so there was little information recorded. But within a few minutes of combing through records he found one intriguing note on the system, entered by a social worker. It referred to an earlier example of truanting from school and set out how the sisters liked to hang around in a particular park in a leafy suburb north of Newcastle city centre. “I was thinking, I'm 99.9% sure that it's the two girls,” says Dodds. Now able to get back on the police radio, he passed on the details of his hunch. Officers were dispatched to Gosforth Central Park. Every minute of Rose's absence was another minute the abductors had to put distance between themselves and the search. If police couldn't close that widening gap it would become ever harder to rescue the child and catch the suspects. Insp Steve Byrne admits it felt events might had been in danger of overtaking them. He made a phone call to his boss. “I remember the very words I used. I said we're very close to the end of the golden hour, and in fact we're over the 60 minutes from the time the child went missing. “Past experience tells me - once you get past that time, things get a lot more difficult.” PC Graham Dodds Aerial view of Gosforth Aerial view of Gosforth Aerial view of Gosforth - showing the girls' possible route Aerial view of Gosforth - showing the girls' possible route Yet, just when it seemed the odds of finding the girls were lengthening, there was a lucky break.

I said we're very close to the end of the golden hour, and in fact we're over the 60 minutes from the time the child went missing. “Past experience tells me - once you get past that time, things get a lot more difficult.” In retrospect, the time advantage the suspects had achieved over the police was chilling. A full 12 minutes before even that first 101 call from the Primark manager, the teenage girls and their victim were stepping off the Metro at South Gosforth station - more than two miles away. They walked, via side streets, to a shopping centre next to the park. It was 17:00 - just five minutes after police had received the initial alert. In the city centre, officers were dashing to Primark. Soon they would be locking down the city centre and beginning their hunt for the teenage abductors. Their targets though were now in an area with comparatively little CCTV. Rose must have calmed down somewhat by this point because witnesses described the girls swinging her between them in a playful way, and asking her if she wanted to go to the park. They tried to get into a children's soft play centre, but it was shut to the public. At 17:10 - abduction plus 41 minutes - the teenagers wandered into the South Gosforth Sainsbury's and stole a baby bottle and some milk, presumably to keep little Rose happy and quiet. Then they headed to Gosforth Central Park. While frantic investigations were under way in the city centre, the abductors stayed in the park. Bizarrely - considering the seriousness of their offence - they passed time with the toddler by playing on the swings and trying to keep her entertained. They showed no sign of having a particular plan in mind. By 17:50 the girls were getting ready to leave the park. A couple of streets away, Police Community Support Officer Shaun Cowan was making a routine visit to a local resident when he heard the call on his radio about the possible location of the teenagers. It was just around the corner. While the most senior officers on Northumbria Police were frantically trying to trace Rose and the girls who took her, it fell to a young officer on the lowest rung of the police ladder, to try to bring the emergency to a close. Cowan arrived at the park an hour-and-a-half after the abduction. “I was thinking straight away if I had a young child with me I'd probably be in the play-park, with the swings and slides and such like, but they weren't there. “But past the play-park, and through the trees, I could see the two girls and the missing child, walking across a green area.” They were heading for the exit. With about 100m between Cowan and the girls, he was worried they might slip away. He used his radio to report the sighting. “As I did that, the girls looked in my direction, saw me, and I got the impression they were going to run towards the exit at that point.” So I just ran directly towards them, shouting, 'Stop! Stop where you are!'” So I just ran directly towards them, shouting, 'Stop! Stop where you are!'” The girls froze in their tracks, just short of the park exit. Cowan believes had he arrived 30 seconds later, they would have been gone - a perfect example of why the golden hour response time was so crucial. As he approached, he was weighing up exactly what to do.“Do you grab a hold of the two offenders? Do you grab a hold of the missing child?” Without being asked, the teenagers tried to explain away their situation. But it was a highly confused account. “They said this little girl followed them from the city centre on the Metro system. I asked them if they knew who the girl was. They replied 'no'. I asked if they knew who the parent of the child was and again they said 'no'. “But then they said they were going to return the child back to the parent, and I said, 'well how are you going to do that if you don't know who the child is and who the parent is?'” He took the sisters' arms, while Rose stood alongside them, looking calm and relatively unharmed, and waited for back-up from other officers. Insp Steve Byrne clearly recalls the delight among his officers, who had been co-ordinating the operation. His instructions to Cowan were direct and straightforward: The child goes nowhere, and neither do the girls. They're to be detained and arrested for child abduction.” The child goes nowhere, and neither do the girls. They're to be detained and arrested for child abduction.” Looking back at that swift end to the drama, his mood is sanguine. “Did we get a lucky break? Yeah, but you make your own luck. And I think that was achieved through good policing.” Standing in the park as he held the teenage sisters, Cowan waited a matter of “seconds” before back-up arrived. “They were arrested in the park straight away. The little girl seemed fine. Unharmed. She wasn't upset. She didn't seem distressed or anything at all.” Back at Primark, Rose's mother Deborah was in a side room when she heard a commotion next door. “You'd think the police would be all professional and macho, but I heard a cheer in the other room before someone came in with a big smile on his face and said, oh she's been found!” I think everyone there could identify with me. By this point it was like she was 'our child', not 'your child'. It was amazing.” I think everyone there could identify with me. By this point it was like she was 'our child', not 'your child'. It was amazing.” Rose had not only been found alive but also apparently unharmed and oblivious of the huge hunt to find her. It was a matter of minutes before she was delivered back into her mother's arms. “It was just like I'd given birth to her again. Holding my child again, seeing she's good, she's OK. All she could say was that she went to the park. I knew she was a bit shaken. She was quite clingy. But she was OK. She was OK.” But the feeling of relief would not eclipse the deep unease that had set in during the desperate and frantic hunt for Rose, and had only grown the more police found out about the sisters' actions and motives. Their clear-headed planning. Their tactics for befriending young children and the eerie echoes of the James Bulger abduction. Their ploy for wrong-footing the mother of the first child they had tried to abduct. And the speed at which they had whisked Rose away from the city centre. After the crime, came the questions. As Deborah clung to her newly returned daughter, she noticed another example of the abductors' twisted behaviour. “[Rose] looked very different. Her hair bobbles had been pulled out, and her hairstyle changed.” Her hair had been pulled back into a single bun. Previously it was in braids. “It was then it dawned on me how serious the whole thing was. Even until then I was just attributing it to teenagers being naughty. But this shook me. It was a moment which had me re-evaluating the whole thing and thinking, what were they up to? “Even when I try to do her hair very gently, it's a struggle. I don't think she would have enjoyed it in any way. “I was really, really worried at that stage,” remembers Deborah with a shudder. Child abduction is rare in the UK. Child abduction by other children is so rare that figures are not recorded. It is no surprise that so many of the police officers involved in Rose's disappearance immediately thought of the James Bulger case. Despite the passage of almost 24 years, it remains a notorious case, and its seriousness has fortunately never been repeated. A study of UK Police statistics by PACT (Parents and Abducted Children Together) found that in 2011/12 there were 592 recorded cases of child abduction. But Pact estimated that only 50 children a year are abducted by strangers - and the vast majority of these abductions are stopped within moments, often by members of the public who happen to be there. Investigators from Northumbria Police have spent a great deal of time trying to find out the motive of Rose's abductors. They were not helped by the fact the girls refused to answer questions during police interviews, and would only supply written statements which were easily disproved. It was “quite a chaotic home”, says Det Ch Insp Shelley Hudson, who prepared the case for prosecution. “They only seemed to have each other as friends. They spent a lot of time together, which is quite unusual because most children that age have quite a large circle of friends.” Det Ch Insp Shelley Hudson Investigators looked at all the computers and phones in the home. They interviewed family, friends and teachers. “But we still don't know why,” says Hudson. Those searches did, however, throw up some deeply troubling results. A Samsung tablet given to the 13-year-old girl as a Christmas present in 2015 betrayed an alarming history of internet searches. Sites visited included those with graphic sexual content relating to rape and kidnap. “It wasn't the sort of normal sexual contact that you'd expect a teenager to be looking at,” says Hudson. When the case came to court a graphic list of subjects the girls searched for was described. It included forced sex and slavery, girls collected, trained and tormented for auction, and children being abducted, dragged into a van and raped. Detectives were extremely alarmed by the evidence. “A hypothesis could be that they were actively going out to kidnap a child with the intention of sexually abusing that child,” says Hudson. “That's certainly one line of inquiry we followed.” Investigators had to account for the fact other people in the house could have been using the tablet. They focused on the exact times the pornographic sites were visited, which itself revealed an extraordinary pattern of behaviour. Not only did this pattern make it unlikely someone else had been using the tablet, it also suggested a worrying mindset. One moment a girl would be using the tablet computer to research a topic for her school homework. The next search, moments later, was about rape and kidnap, followed immediately by another search concerning the school project. “It really is very unusual, very bizarre,” says Hudson, “but then to kidnap a child is as bizarre. Whatever was going on was incredibly worrying.” The findings were enough to charge the girls not only with kidnap, but also with intent to commit a serious sexual assault. However, after review by the Crown Prosecution Service, the evidence for the latter was not considered strong enough to secure a conviction. Police were sure Rose had not been sexually assaulted. The teenage girls pleaded guilty to kidnap, and the sexual offence was withdrawn. They were each sentenced to three-and-a-half years detention in July 2016. The judge, Mr Justice Globe, said he was convinced that they had intended to seriously harm the little girl. “It is not possible to state with any certainty who was going to cause the harm or exactly what that harm would have been except to come to the conclusion that it would have mirrored some aspect of the physical or sexual violence and/or exploitation that was found on the tablet,” he said. “In my judgement it was the true reason why she was taken.” The police investigation had only uncovered one other hint to the girls' motives - some, limited, evidence that the 13-year-old had been in contact with a man, using an online chatroom. It seems the girl had alerted a teacher at her school to the fact a man had asked her to send photos to him. The teacher took some screen grabs of the chat session, and it is clear that the conversation was of a sexual nature. But then the trail ran cold. There was no evidence the man was involved in encouraging the kidnapping. The school is said to have alerted the girl's mother, and the tablet computer, along with the teenagers' phones, were confiscated. The chatroom exchange was at least two months before the abduction in April and by the time the police seized the tablet, the app it had been on had been deleted and all records of the chat wiped. The teenagers refused to explain any of their online activities to the police, but claimed to others that the man in the chatroom was called Nazzer, and that he had put them up to the abduction. Police were not convinced. They examined thousands of hours of CCTV, but saw no evidence of anyone suspicious being present during the kidnapping. The sisters' only explanation for their actions came in the form of a written statement, which repeats claims the little girl followed them and that they intended to return her to her mother - says Det Sgt Stu Liddell: We are not dealing with two angelic young schoolgirls. They were devious, manipulative and proficient in lies.” We are not dealing with two angelic young schoolgirls. They were devious, manipulative and proficient in lies.” Looking back on the traumatic afternoon several months later, Rose's mother says she forgives the teenage girls and feels pity for them. “I think everybody asks themselves that question why? Their parents must ask why? Their classmates must ask why? The judge asked why? But unfortunately that is one answer which has not been given.” The High Street Abduction: Download or listen to Andrew Bomford’s reports for BBC Radio 4’s PM programme.

How the smartphone became so smart,"On 9 January 2007, one of the most influential entrepreneurs on the planet announced something new - a product that was to become the most profitable in history. It was, of course, the iPhone. There are many ways in which the iPhone has defined the modern economy. There is the sheer profitability of the thing, of course: there are only two or three companies in the world that make as much money as Apple does from the iPhone alone. Apple may not have sold the first smartphone, but the iPhone represented a quantum leap compared with earlier models, and its version became an object of desire for most of humanity. There's the way the iPhone transformed other markets - software, music, and advertising. But those are just the obvious facts about the iPhone. And when you delve more deeply, the tale is a surprising one. We give credit to Steve Jobs and other leading figures in Apple - his early partner Steve Wozniak, his successor Tim Cook, his visionary designer Sir Jony Ive - but some of the most important actors in this story have been forgotten. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources andlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Ask yourself: what actually makes an iPhone an iPhone? It's partly the cool design, the user interface, the attention to detail in the way the software works and the hardware feels. But underneath the charming surface of the iPhone are some critical elements that made it, and all the other smartphones, possible. The economist Mariana Mazzucato has made a list of 12 key technologies that make smartphones work: 1) tiny microprocessors, 2) memory chips, 3) solid state hard drives, 4) liquid crystal displays and 5) lithium-based batteries. That's the hardware. Then there are the networks and the software. So 6) Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithms - clever bits of maths that make it possible to swiftly turn analogue signals such as sound, visible light and radio waves into digital signals that a computer can handle. At 7) - and you might have heard of this one - the internet. A smartphone isn't a smartphone without the internet. At 8) HTTP and HTML, the languages and protocols that turned the hard-to-use internet into the easy-to-access World Wide Web. 9) Cellular networks. Otherwise your smartphone not only isn't smart, it's not even a phone. 10) Global Positioning Systems or GPS. 11) The touchscreen. 12) Siri, the voice-activated artificial intelligence agent. Apple's designer Sir Jony Ive has been widely lauded for his contribution to the iPhone's success All of these technologies are important components of what makes an iPhone, or any smartphone, actually work. Some of them are not just important, but indispensable. But when Mariana Mazzucato assembled this list of technologies, and reviewed their history, she found something striking. The foundational figure in the development of the iPhone wasn't Steve Jobs. It was Uncle Sam. Every single one of these 12 key technologies was supported in significant ways by governments - often the American government. A few of these cases are famous. Many people know, for example, that the World Wide Web owes its existence to the work of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was a software engineer employed at Cern, the particle physics research centre in Geneva that is funded by governments across Europe. And the internet itself started as Arpanet - an unprecedented network of computers funded by the US Department of Defense in the early 1960s. GPS, of course, was a pure military technology, developed during the Cold War and opened up to civilian use only in the 1980s. Other examples are less famous, though scarcely less important. Smartphones have all benefited from government investment in technology The Fast-Fourier-Transform is a family of algorithms that have made it possible to move from a world where the telephone, the television and the gramophone worked on analogue signals, to a world where everything is digitised and can therefore be dealt with by computers such as the iPhone. The most common such algorithm was developed from a flash of insight from the great American mathematician John Tukey. What was Tukey working on at the time? You've guessed it: a military application. Specifically, he was on President Kennedy's Scientific Advisory committee in 1963, trying to figure out how to detect when the Soviet Union was testing nuclear weapons. Smartphones wouldn't be smartphones without their touchscreens - but the inventor of the touchscreen was an engineer named EA Johnson, whose initial research was carried out while Johnson was employed by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, a stuffily-named agency of the British government. The work was further developed at Cern - those guys again. Eventually multi-touch technology was commercialised by researchers at the University of Delaware in the United States - Wayne Westerman and John Elias, who sold their company to Apple itself. Touchscreen technology has gone on to drive the development of tablet computers Yet even at that late stage in the game, governments played their part: Wayne Westerman's research fellowship was funded by the US National Science Foundation and the CIA. Then there's the girl with the silicon voice, Siri. Back in the year 2000, seven years before the first iPhone, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, Darpa, commissioned the Stanford Research Institute to develop a kind of proto-Siri, a virtual office assistant that might help military personnel to do their jobs. Twenty universities were brought into the project, furiously working on all the different technologies necessary to make a voice-activated virtual assistant a reality. Seven years later, the research was commercialised as a start-up, Siri Incorporated- and it was only in 2010 that Apple stepped in to acquire the results for an undisclosed sum. Increasingly sophisticated lithium-ion batteries have been essential for smartphone growth As for hard drives, lithium-ion batteries, liquid crystal displays and semiconductors themselves - there are similar stories to be told. In each case, there was scientific brilliance and plenty of private sector entrepreneurship. But there were also wads of cash thrown at the problem by government agencies - usually US government agencies, and for that matter, usually some arm of the US military. Silicon Valley itself owes a great debt to Fairchild Semiconductor - the company that developed the first commercially practical integrated circuits. And Fairchild Semiconductor, in its early days, depended on military procurement. Of course, the US military didn't make the iPhone. Cern did not create Facebook or Google. These technologies, that so many people rely on today, were honed and commercialised by the private sector. But it was government funding and government risk-taking that made all these things possible. That's a thought to hold on to as we ponder the technological challenges ahead in fields such energy and biotechnology. Steve Jobs was a genius, there's no denying that. One of his remarkable side projects was the animation studio Pixar - which changed the world of film when it released the digitally animated film, Toy Story. Even without the touchscreen and the internet and the Fast-Fourier-Transform, Steve Jobs might well have created something wonderful. But it would not have been a world-shaking technology like the iPhone. More likely it would, like Woody and Buzz, have been an utterly charming toy.

"Trump's Scottish golf resort to lose tax reliefThe US president's golf resort in South Ayrshire had previously received business rates relief of more than Â£100,000.11h11 hours agoScotland politics","Donald Trump's Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire is now above the cut-off point for tax relief A Scottish golf resort owned by US President Donald Trump will no longer qualify for a controversial tax break. A change in the Scottish government's recent budget will remove Trump Turnberry in South Ayrshire from a business rates relief scheme. The Sunday Herald revealed,externalthe resort is now above the cut-off point with a rateable value of Â£1,650,000. Scotland's finance secretary Derek Mackay introduced measures in February to help hospitality businesses. The move was in response to growing pressure to intervene to help struggling restaurants and hotels cope with the first revaluation of the rateable value of businesses since 2010. Mr Mackay faced calls to reform the transitional business rates relief scheme afterit emerged in August that Trump Turnberry had benefited by Â£109,530 for 2017/18. In response to a wider review of the business rates system, Mr Mackay announced in September that the transitional scheme would continue next year for ""all but the very largest hospitality properties"". Documents published alongside the draft Scottish budget earlier this month state it will only apply for hospitality properties with a rateable value up to Â£1.5m. According to the Scottish Assessors Association website, Trump Turnberry is now above the cut-off point with a rateable value of Â£1,650,000. Mr Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 but stepped away from the family business empire after being elected US president. His other Scottish golf course, on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, did not qualify for relief because it is defined as a golf course rather than a hotel.

Profile: Alexei Navalny,"Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny was long the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin. The 47-year-old blogger had survived poisoning attempts and years in some of Russia's most notorious jails, after his group had exposed corruption at almost every level of the Russian state - frequently targeting President Putin himself. Even from behind bars, unable to challenge the president at the ballot box, his voice had retained power. But in February 2024, it fell silent. According to the prison service, he had gone for a walk when he lost consciousness and died. Navalny was often asked: Do you fear for your life? Navalnyâs life in 'Polar Wolf' remote penal colony In the immediate aftermath, the Kremlin simply said that it was aware of his death, and the president had been informed. Across the world, however, there was shock and anger, as tributes were paid to a man who some said gave his life standing up to Russia's all-powerful leader. Alexei Navalny was born in 1976, in a village just to the west of Moscow. He grew up in Obninsk, a town 100km (62 miles) south-west of Moscow, eventually graduating in law at Moscow's Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in 1998. But it was another decade before he began his rise as a force in Russian politics, making his name as a grassroots anti-corruption campaigner. His blog took aim at alleged malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations. One of his tactics was to become a minority shareholder in major oil companies, banks and ministries, and to ask awkward questions about holes in state finances. His consistent message was a simple one: that Mr Putin's party was full of ""crooks and thieves"". UKRAINECAST:Navalny: What next for Russia? He accused the president of ""sucking the blood out of Russia"" through a ""feudal state"" concentrating power in the Kremlin. That patronage system, he claimed, was like tsarist Russia. It helped that Navalny spoke the street language of younger Russians, and used it to powerful effect on social media. His Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) made detailed claims about official corruption. Then, in 2011, he would lead large street protests against President Putin. Navalny's wife Yulia, pictured with him in 2015, was at most court cases to support him For the rest of his life, he would be in and out of jail, while his organisations would be banned as ""extremist"". In 2017, he was barred from standing in the general election. At the time, he was widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging President Putin. He would also survive several suspected - and one confirmed - attempts on his life. The first time Navalny suspected he had been poisoned, he was in prison serving a sentence for calling for unauthorised protests. Then 43, he was taken to hospital with a swollen face, eye problems and rashes on his body. At the time, reports suggested it was an allergic reaction - something he and his doctor were quick to question. Officially, he was diagnosed with ""contact dermatitis"". Navalny - who had previously suffered chemical burns to an eye after been targeted with antiseptic green dye in 2017 - later wrote that the doctors who treated him acted ""like they had something to hide"". But it was the second alleged poisoning a year later which really caught the attention of the international media. In August 2020, Navalny collapsed on a flight over Siberia and was rushed to hospital in Omsk. That emergency landing saved his life. A German-based charity persuaded Russian officials to allow him to be airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life In September, the German government revealed that tests carried out by the military found ""unequivocal proof of a chemical nerve warfare agent of the Novichok group,external"". The Kremlin denied any involvement and rejected the Novichok finding. The EU then imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre, accusing them of direct involvement in the poisoning. Russiaretaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions. Novichok was the chemical weapon which nearly killed former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England, in March 2018. A local woman later died from contact with Novichok. Mr Putin admitted that the state was keeping Navalny under surveillance - it was justified, he alleged, because US spies were helping the blogger. Navalny - pictured with his family - was taken to Berlin for treatment after the Novichok poisoning in 2020 Recovered, Navalny returned to Moscow on 17 January 2021 and was immediately detained, as he knew he would be. He said on Instagram that he felt he had never left - so there was no choice but to return. He would never be free again, despite his supporters staging mass protests across Russia. Police responded to the protests with force, detaining thousands for attending the unauthorised rallies. The arrests did not deter his team from their mission. A video of""Putin's palace"" on YouTube,externalwas quickly published, focusing on a vast luxury Black Sea palace, allegedly gifted to Mr Putin by rich associates. The video has been viewed well over 100 million times. The Kremlin dismissed it as a ""pseudo-investigation"" and Mr Putin called it ""boring"", denying the claims. Later billionaire businessman Arkady Rotenberg, one of Mr Putin's closest friends, said it was his own palace. Putin: Russia's action man president The court case which followed allowed Navalny to make public his allegations against President Putin, in what was now an intensely personal battle: he accused the president of ordering state agents to poison him - and repeated that in court. ""His main gripe with me is that he'll go down in history as a poisoner,"" Navalny told the court scornfully. ""We had Alexander the Liberator, Yaroslav the Wise, and we will have Vladimir the Underpants Poisoner."" Underpants had become a social media meme in Russia after Navalny carried out a telephone sting in December 2020 on a Russian FSB state security agent, who revealed that Novichok, a highly toxic Russian chemical weapon, had been smeared on Navalny's underwear. But while it highlighted once more the Kremlin's alleged attempts on his life, it did not stop the court finding him guilty. On 2 February 2021, a Moscow court jailed Navalny for violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for fraud - a case which he said had been politically motivated in the first place. Meanwhile, he and his anti-corruption team - all banned from standing in parliamentary elections - were still fighting the Kremlin, this time creating a ""smart voting"" app that encouraged voters to back candidates who had a chance of defeating Mr Putin's United Russia party in September 2021. This video can not be played Hundreds of protesters in Moscow were detained by police But Navalny was not a simple hero, battling against a powerful regime. He has been accused of xenophobia. In videos dating back to 2007, he is seen appearing to compare ethnic conflict to tooth decay and likened immigrants to cockroaches. He also said the Crimea peninsula ""de facto belongs to Russia"", despite international condemnation of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory. The comments led - controversially - to Amnesty International revoking his status as a ""prisoner of conscience"" in February 2021, before conceding it had been subjected to an ""orchestrated campaign"" to ""delist"" him and then reversing its decision. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Kremlin critic Navalny recalls near-death torment Meanwhile, the Russian government continued to punish Navalny. In March 2022, his sentence was increased by nine-years after he was found guilty on new charges of embezzlement and contempt of court. He was moved to a new penal colony at Melekhovo, around 250km (150 miles) east of Moscow. In June 2022, his allies raised the alarm after they discovered he was no longer in that prison. Federal prison authorities later admitted he had been moved to a penal colony with a tough reputation, the IK-6 prison, more than 155 miles (249km) east of Moscow, where he said he was repeatedly placed in solitary confinement. His last sentence, handed down by judges in August 2023 and which extended his jail term to 19 years, saw him moved to a maximum security penal colony usually reserved for Russia's most dangerous criminals. This video can not be played Watch: Navalny jokes in court a day before his death His harsh treatment reflected the fact that Mr Putin and his regime feared the influence that Navalny's campaigns had been gaining, Prof Nina Khrushcheva, the great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and international affairs experts, told the BBC at the time. ""Putin doesn't even mention his name, anybody in the Kremlin can't his mention name,"" she said, drawing a comparison with the fictional Harry Potter character Voldemort - who is also referred to as ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"". ""Navalny is a threat to Putin's personal power, Putin's personal reputation of himself. And Putin doesn't really treat his enemies lightly and Navalny unfortunately took this - as they say in Russian - this ticket to be Putin's personal enemy."" Yet despite the confinement of his last years, Navalny became one of the leading domestic voices against the war in Ukraine. During a court appearance in May 2022, he accused Mr Putin of starting a ""stupid war"" with ""no purpose or meaning"". And in September, he accused Russian elites of having a ""bloodthirsty obsession with Ukraine"" in an article for the Washington Post. His foundation also continued to oppose the government throughout his imprisonment, speaking out against the mobilisation of some 300,000 civilians to fight in Ukraine and pledging to be a ""partisan underground"" movement inside Russia. Navalny told the BBC that the best thing Western states could do for justice in Russia was to crack down on ""dirty money"". ""I want people involved in corruption and persecution of activists to be barred from entering these countries, to be denied visas."" The news of his death on 16 February was immediately greeted by a wave of tributes from around the world. He had made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" in his fight ""for the values of freedom and democracy"", said the European Union Council president Charles Michel, while French foreign minister StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© said he had ""paid with his life for his resistance to a system of oppression"". However, exactly how - or why - he died has yet to be established. He leaves behind his wife, Yulia, and two children. According to his team, they had not been informed directly of his death when it broke in newspapers across the world. ""I don't know whether or not to believe the news, the terrible news"", Yulia Navlanaya said at the Munich Security Conference, hours after news of her husband's death broke. ""You all know this - we can't believe Putin and Putin's government. They're always lying,"" she added. ""But if this is true, I want Putin and all of his entourage, Putin's friends and his government to know that they will be held accountable for what they have done to our country, to my family and to my husband."" She left the stage to a standing ovation.
