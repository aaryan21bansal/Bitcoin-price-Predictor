Pound recovers as cabinet backs plan,"The pound has rallied after the Prime Minister announced she had the backing of the cabinet for her Brexit withdrawal plan. It followed a volatile day's trading while the outcome of Theresa May's five-hour meeting with cabinet colleagues remained unclear. The pound reached $1.30 following the announcement, having fallen to $1.28 in mid-afternoon. It then fell back slightly against both the dollar and the euro. Against the euro the pound had recovered to reach â¬1.15 before dipping back towards its opening value of â¬1.14. Cabinet backs draft agreement Brexit deal: does this mean everything is decided? Market commentator Russ Mould at AJ Bell said investors were ""using the pound as their lightning rod"" to express worry and satisfaction about how the negotiations were progressing. ""For the last 18 months the Brexit talks haven't really gone anywhere and people had begun to fear no deal,"" he said. The pound is still more than 10% below where it was before the referendum over leaving the EU 2016, but it has rallied from deeper lows ""as markets have begun to express optimism that some kind of deal can be struck"", he added. Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC Business Correspondent Business secretary Greg Clark and the Chancellor Philip Hammond thanked business leaders tonight for helping to highlight the economic damage a no-deal scenario might do to the economy. That prospect helped focus minds among cabinet ministers at the marathon and fractious meeting, according to sources present. ""When evidence and facts met hopes and aspirations, the evidence and facts won"" said one minister. One attendee described the backstop arrangement - the fallback position if a trade deal is not secured by December 2020 -  as unsatisfactory, as it might result in unwelcome additional checks and oversight of goods travelling between the UK and Europe. People around the table have become much more familiar with advanced manufacturing supply chains, a minister pointed out. But the possibility the transition period could be extended beyond 2020 helped offset that concern. However ministers said they don't expect firms to alter their preparations for a no-deal outcome in March, given the challenge of getting the deal through parliament. Business bodies welcomed the agreement, with the Confederation of British Industry describing it as ""an important step forward"" towards a negotiated Brexit. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, said: ""It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal."" ""Securing a transition period has long been firms' top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest."" The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said agreement on the draft was a ""milestone"" but said business still needed clarity and precision on the specific terms of trade they will face. Dr Adam Marshall, BCC director general, said businesses would need to look carefully at the ""real-world"" implications of the agreement. He said the agreement could represent ""the end of the beginning - but not yet the beginning of the end"" of uncertainty.

Barnier: Agreement a 'decisive' step,"Mr Barnier (L) formally hands the agreement to European Council head Donald Tusk The EU says much work still needs to be done on Brexit, despite agreeing a draft withdrawal document with the UK. ""We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,"" chief negotiator Michel Barnier said. The EU has set out a series of meetings leading to one on 25 November where it plans to approve the Brexit agreement. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has won the backing of her cabinet but faces a tough task getting the agreement approved by Parliament. LIVE: Follow the Brexit story Brexit: A guide to where we are Watch: What is Brexit? A sign of that came on Thursday morning when Mr Barnier's UK counterpart,Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, resignedsaying he could not ""in good conscience"" support the agreement. He was one of four ministers to quit. Mrs May later defended the deal in the House of Commons, telling MPs it delivered on the Brexit referendum and provided for an orderly withdrawal. Mr Barnier was speaking on Thursday morning alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk as the chief negotiator formally handed overthe 585-page draft withdrawal agreement.,external Mr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an ""ambitious new partnership"". Mr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had ""secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole"". He laid out the timetable for the days ahead. EU member states will analyse the document and at the end of the week national envoys will share their assessments A political declaration on future ties between the EU and the UK will be agreed by Tuesday and members will have 48 hours to evaluate it The EU Council will then meet on 25 November to finalise the agreement ""if nothing extraordinary happens"", Mr Tusk said. The leaders of the 27 EU nations must approve the deal Mr Tusk said: ""Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control."" Addressing the UK, he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us."" Pound dives after Brexit resignations Mr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019. If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out. A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. The draft withdrawal agreement covers so-called ""divorce"" issues as the UK prepares to leave the EU. It includes a ""financial settlement"" from the UK, thought to be about Â£39bn (â¬45bn; $50bn). Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Barnier addressed one of the major concerns of the divorce, the Irish ""hard border"" issue. He said that to avoid the need for physical checks on goods or infrastructure at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU would work with the UK to agree a trade deal. However if talks fail, the so-called ""backstop"" measure would be used. Q&A: Irish border backstop EU fears UK politics will scupper the deal Guide: Brexit and immigration Both sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements. Please upgrade your browser ""If we are not ready by 2020, we can extend the provision so we have more time, and if we are still not there with the future agreement after this, the backstop agreement would kick in,"" he said. ""There will be a UK-wide single customs territory which Northern Ireland will remain in, and Northern Ireland will remain aligned to the rules of a single market essential for avoiding a border including on agriculture policy."" The draft withdrawal agreement states that the transition period may be extended by mutual consent. What does the transition period mean? Mr Barnier said that any extension would by a one-off, ""by a limited period and by joint agreement"". During the transition, the UK will be out of the EU. It will have no voting rights but will continue to abide by the majority of its rules. There are also special protocols in place for Gibraltar and Cyprus to enable people there ""to continue to live as they do today"", Mr Barnier added. Spain has longstanding claims to the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and the deal sets out bilateral co-operation on customs, policing, trade, taxation and citizens' rights. The UK has sovereign military bases in Cyprus. EU law will continue to apply at the bases, with the deal securing the rights of the 11,000 Cypriot civilians working there. Analysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler The EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time. I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage. Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons. Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest. Read more from Katya German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday welcomed the draft agreement, saying: ""I am very happy that, after lengthy and not always easy negotiations, a proposal could be reached."" The European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of ""intense negotiations"" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that ""there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'"". French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was ""good news for the French economy"" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules. Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, ""decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement"". Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was ""very pleased"", adding: ""The result is a good one."" Brexit debate dominates Sunday interviews What is Brexit? VideoWhat is Brexit?

A guide to where we are with Brexit,"This video can not be played Brexit: May under pressure over deal Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, althoughtwo ministers resigned in protest at it.They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest. If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament. There are two documents. Adraft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal,externalfrom the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: Commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members A 21-month transition period after the UK's departure, to allow time for trade talks The UK would continue to follow all EU rules during this period in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term changes A ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" A ""backstop"" arrangement to keep the Irish border unmanned if trade talks don't come up with a way of avoiding that happening More on how what the draft agreement reveals The other document isa 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU,external, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: Plans for a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"" ""Ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement Commitment to respect the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, services and money around the EU A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK A reference to allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals after Brexit An exit from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Determination to use technology to replace the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - but no guarantee A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law Continued participation in EU programmes in areas like science, culture, education, overseas development and space, including ""a fair and appropriate financial contribution"" Continued co-operation on defence and security More on what's in the political declaration This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that ""widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected ""by a significant margin"". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to ""ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"" and has ""democratic legitimacy"". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Leaving the EU without a deal Having another vote in Parliament - Mrs May will get three weeks to make a second attempt Another EU referendum (this can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it) A general election - Labour's preferred option but it would need a no-confidence vote in the PM Theresa May is removed by her own MPs and a new leader tries to renegotiate a deal with the EU - Tory MPs say they are close to having enough signatures to trigger a confidence vote in her Some of these options would involve delaying the official Brexit date of 29 March by a few months to allow time to renegotiate a deal, if the EU agrees to that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has alsofloated the idea of Labour forming a minority governmentwithout a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.

"Marie Antoinette pearl fetches record $36mThe sale in Geneva is one of the most important royal jewellery auctions ever, says Sotheby's.Europe","The star of the auction was Marie Antoinette's Pearl, a natural pearl and diamond pendant A pearl and diamond pendant that belonged to ill-fated French Queen Marie Antoinette has been sold for $36m (Â£28m) in what Sotheby's auction house says is a world record for a pearl. The star lot at Sotheby's Geneva show was bought after a fierce bidding war. It had been valued at about $2m. It was part of amajor collection of jewellery sold by Italy's royal Bourbon-Parma house,external. Some of the jewels had not been seen in public for 200 years. The previous record for the most expensive pearl jewel was a necklace once owned by the late Dame Elizabeth Taylor. It was sold for $11.8m at Christie's auction house in 2011. Sotheby's called Wednesday's auction in Geneva ""one of the most important royal jewellery collections ever to appear on the market"". The French queen's jewels are part of a larger collection auctioned by Italy's Bourbon-Parma family Deputy Chair Daniela Mascetti said: ""This extraordinary group of jewels offers a captivating insight into the lives of its owners going back hundreds of years."" But she noted the ""inherent beauty of the pieces themselves; the precious gems they are adorned with and the exceptional craftsmanship they display are stunning in their own right"". Marie Antoinette's pendant sits here on a 119-natural-pearl necklace Other auctioned items include the natural pearl and diamond necklace, a pair of pearl and diamond earrings, and a monogram ring with a lock of her hair. One of the other items up for sale is a diamond ring bearing the initials MA for Marie Antoinette and containing a lock of her hair There were also pieces from King Charles X, the Archdukes of Austria and the Dukes of Parma, including a diamond tiara. The whole collection was sold for more than Â£53m. Marie Antoinette was an Austrian princess before her marriage to France's King Louis XVI. Her extravagant lifestyle turned her into a hate figure in the years leading up to the French Revolution, when many French people could barely afford to feed their families. She smuggled out her jewellery to her family in Austria before her failed attempt to flee France with Louis XVI and their children. She was guillotined in 1793 at the age of 37.

Government backtracks on gaming machines,"This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? The maximum bet on fixed-odds betting terminals will be cut from April after the government bowed to pressure. Ministers had been facing a parliamentary defeat, with several Tory MPs joining opposition politicians to table amendments to the finance bill. The chancellor said in the Budget the maximum bet would be reduced from Â£100 to Â£2 from October. But that led to accusations of a delay - with sports minister Tracey Crouch resigning in protest. Several former ministers - including Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Justine Greening - tabled amendments designed to force the government to make the change from April. Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops in 1999, and offer computerised games at the touch of a button. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The government has listened and will now implement the reduction in April 2019."" Mr Wright added that a planned increase in Remote Gaming Duty, paid by online gaming firms, would be brought forward to April to cover the negative impact on the public finances. Ms Crouch said shewelcomed the decision,externaland was pleased that ""common sense"" had prevailed. Tracey Crouch resigned over the FOBTs issue Asked if she would like to return to Government, Ms Crouch said: ""There isn't a vacancy. That's been filled. So, I will just get on and do what I'm going to do."" The government had earlier said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe. High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines Pro-betting MPs more persuasive - Crouch 16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms Theresa May had earlier been asked at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday about the timing by Conservative ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith. He said: ""I was enormously proud of my government for agreeing to lower the stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to Â£2 because they have caused endless harm, terrible damage to families and it was the right decision. ""Since then, there has been a hiatus about the date at which this would start."" Mrs May answered: ""I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue. I know gambling addiction can devastate lives."" By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check FOBTs were introduced into betting shops in 1999.Since then, the number has grown to 33,468,externalin Great Britain. Data from the Gambling Commission shows that the profit generated by FOBTs grew from Â£1.05bn in 2009 to Â£1.83bn last year - that's a rise of 74%. Last year, betting shops made Â£3.2bn from a combination of FOBTs and traditional ""over-the-counter"" bets. As a proportion of profits, FOBTs made up 57% of the total - up from 38% in 2008-09. That suggests that bookies are becoming increasingly reliant on them as a source of profit. FOBTs have been under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm. The machines have been called the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems. The government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a ""call for evidence"" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players. Investors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms have climbed, with Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC Holdings 8% higher and William Hill shares up 2.23%. After the government brought forward the FOBT deadline, it meant GVC Holdings was spared a major cash payment to former Ladbrokes shareholders, analysts said. Tom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said it had taken ""the resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed-odds betting terminals"". He added it was ""a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction"".

Cruise to be replaced as Jack Reacher,"Tom Cruise: Not to scale Action hero Jack Reacher is to get a reboot for the small screen with a new actor in the lead role after creator Lee Child admitted Tom Cruise, who played him in two films, is too short. In Child's books, Reacher is described as 6ft 5in tall with hands the size of dinner plates. Cruise is 5ft 7in. ""Cruise, for all his talent, didn't have that physicality,"" Child told BBC Radio Manchester's Mike Sweeney. The author said a deal was signed last week to make a new streaming show. Readers had complained about Cruise's suitability to play the imposing former major in the US military police since his casting was announced in 2011. ""I really enjoyed working with Cruise. He's a really, really nice guy. We had a lot of fun,"" Child told the station. ""But ultimately the readers are right. The size of Reacher is really, really important and it's a big component of who he is. Lee Child heaped praise on Cruise's talent and work rate ""The idea is that when Reacher walks into a room, you're all a little nervous just for that first minute. And Cruise, for all his talent, didn't have that physicality. ""So what I've decided to do is - there won't be any more movies with Tom Cruise. Instead we're going to take it to Netflix or something like that. Long form streaming television, with a completely new actor. ""And I want all those readers who were upset about Tom Cruise to help me out - participate in choosing the right actor for the TV series. We're rebooting and starting over and we're going to try and find the perfect guy."" The first Jack Reacher film, directed and adapted by Christopher McQuarrie, debuted in 2012. Cruise got mostly positive reviews and it made $218m (Â£167m) at box offices around the world. But the decision to abandon the film franchise and move to the small screen could have as much to do with the reception for the 2016 sequel as Cruise's stature. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back grossed $162m (Â£124m) and received mixed reviews. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"TK Maxx and Amazon selling real fur as fauxBBC Watchdog Live finds retailers selling rabbit, fox and raccoon dog fur to unsuspecting shoppers.UK","A handbag from TK Maxx was made from fox fur, while shoes bought from the store online contained raccoon dog fur Shops including Amazon and TK Maxx have been selling faux fur clothes and bags which are actually made from rabbit, fox and raccoon dog fur, a BBC Watchdog Live investigation has found. Widespread concern over animal cruelty has led to real fur very nearly disappearing from most UK high streets. Both TK Maxx and Amazon said the products were no longer available. TK Maxx said it does not knowingly buy real fur and an error was made. It has offered refunds to anyone affected. Watchdog Live presenter Steph McGovern visited a branch of TK Maxx - which has had a no-fur policy for 15 years - and bought a handbag made from fox fur. And a pair of shoes purchased on the store's website featured fluffy bobbles which were made from raccoon dog fur. Meanwhile, two bobble hats sold by Amazon and described as ""faux fur"" were made with raccoon dog fur. Rabbit fur was also found in a jumper purchased at an AX Paris outlet store and in fluffy bobbles on a pair of shoes bought from fashion label Missy Empire. Fur farming is banned in the UK, but it is not illegal to import fur from abroad The ""fake fur"" on this grey jumper's star, bought from an AX Paris outlet shop, was made from rabbit The tests were carried out by textile analysis expert Dr Phil Greaves. He told the programme: ""All animal fibres have particular structural features. ""And it's the actual nature and characteristic of these which determines the species of origin. ""These fibres are very distinctive once under the microscope."" How to spot the difference between real and fake fur Real animal fur sold as fake in London markets The tests came after shopper Chloe Salvi, from Edinburgh, said she was concerned about a bobble hat that she had bought on eBay. It had been described as fake fur. ""As soon as I touched it I felt something wasn't right,"" she said. ""I've got a cat, and it reminds me of when I cuddle her. It wasn't the way a faux fur pom-pom should feel."" Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern with Chloe and her real fur hat Raccoon dogs are wild animals native to southern and eastern Asia Tests later revealed it had been made from raccoon dog. ""I can't help thinking about what animal this has been taken off, just for me to have a pom-pom on a hat,"" she said. eBay does not have a no-fur policy, but the website says it expects sellers to describe products accurately. The online auction website has asked the seller to amend or remove the listing and apologised for any distress caused to Chloe. Though fur farming is banned in the UK, it is not illegal to import fur from other countries. Earlier this year,a committee of MPs recommendeda consultation on banning sales of real fur. It said the current labelling of fur products was ""not fit for purpose"". Call for debate on banning sales of real fur Why my real fur sells 'like hotcakes' Claire Bass, the executive director of Humane Society International in the UK, said she would like to see a change in the law over imports, because of the conditions in which many animals are kept. She said: ""Retailers need to be do more to give consumers the confidence they need to buy fake fur and not be worrying that it might actually be fox, rabbit or mink."" This video can not be played Critics and supporters of the fur trade speak out TK Maxx told Watchdog Live: ""Our buyers understand that we do not knowingly purchase items containing real fur. ""Despite our robust processes, an error can occasionally occur. As soon as this is brought to our attention we remove the item from sale and review the journey of that product. ""Any customer who has purchased such an item can return it to any TK Maxx store for a full refund with our most sincere apologies."" In response to the investigation, Amazon told Watchdog Live: ""All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines, and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. ""The products in question are no longer available."" AX Paris, which has a fur-free policy, said the jumper was in an isolated product line and not branded with AX Paris. It said investigations are ongoing. Missy Empire, which is also anti-fur, said it was ""dismayed"" to find its product contained fur and it was no longer available. It apologised to customers and said it is running further checks on other faux fur items. Watchdog Live is on BBC One on Wednesday 14 November at 20:00 GMT. How to tell whether fur is real or fake.

Trump 'lacked decency' in Macron attack,"Mr Macron and Mr Trump had appeared to smooth over their differences at the weekend US President Donald Trump's tweets mocking his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron were inappropriate and showed a lack of ""common decency"", France says. On Tuesday, Mr Trump attacked Mr Macron over nationalism, plans for a European army and the French leader's ratings. ""We were marking the murder of 130 of our people,"" French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said, referring to the 2015 Paris attacks. It follows Mr Trump's awkward Armistice Day visit to Paris over the weekend. Mr Griveaux said13 November was a date for France to mark the tragic incidents of three years ago in Paris and Saint-Denis, when co-ordinated suicide bombings and mass shootings killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more. ""So I will reply in English: 'common decency' would have been the appropriate thing,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. Did the French army mock Donald Trump? Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat White House defends Trump WW1 no-show In a series of earlier tweets, Mr Trump launched an attack on Mr Macron over his ""very low approval rating"" and issued a gibe at France's defeat and occupation by Nazi Germany in World War Two.

Mr Trump also attacked his counterpart over nationalism and took exception toMr Macron's vision for a ""true European army"", which the French president said was necessary to enable Europe ""to defend itself better alone"". Speaking to reporters during a visit to a French warship after Mr Trump's comments, Mr Macron said what matters is ""what we do with the US army"". ""We are going to carry out very concrete operations with the Americans,"" he said, citing the ""perfect co-ordination and excellent execution"" ofa joint operation with the US and UK in Syria last April. Later, during a television interview, the French president added that the country could not wholly rely on the US for its security. ""The United States is our historic ally, it will continue to be,"" Mr Macron said. ""But to be allied is not to be a vassal."" President Trump recently met with President Macron on a visit to France The pair's comments come after a meeting in Paris on Saturday in which the two appeared to smooth over their differences and agreed that Europe needed to pay more towards its defence costs. Mr Trump was in France as part of Armistice Day commemorations marking 100 years since the end of World War One. During his visit, the US president was widely criticised for failing to visit the Aisne-Marne American cemetery, which the White House later said was down to visibility being too poor for his helicopter and Mr Trump not wanting to disrupt the Paris traffic with his motorcade. The French army appeared to poke fun at Mr Trump over the decision, tweeting an image of an officer crawling under barbed wire in wet weather with the words: ""There's rain, but it's no problem.""

California fire town needs 'total rebuild',"Senior officials have been touring the fire-ravaged northern Californian town of Paradise The director of the US emergency agency says a California town ravaged by wildfire will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. So far 56 people have been found dead in the Camp Fire that hit the town, but 130 more remain missing. About 9,400 firefighters are currently battling wildfires across the state. At a news briefing on Thursday, the director of California's fire service said ""firefighters are making good progress"" to contain the blazes, even as new fires continue to pop up. ""We continue to engage in the fire fight. We continue to keep our eye on the ball,"" Chief Ken Pimlott said. He added that over 242,000 acres have burned across the state so far and nearly 11,000 buildings have been destroyed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday, rescuers found the remains of eight more victims  - all in and around Paradise. Crews have contained 35% of the Camp Fire in northern California, which has become the deadliest conflagration in state history. Before and after snapshots Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires They do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. Cadaver dogs and forensic experts are scouring the town Butte County officials have released a list of 103 people they believe are still missing,external- most of whom are elderly. So far 7,600 residences are known to have been destroyed by the fire, as well as hundreds of commercial properties. Governor Brown, who was touring the area on Wednesday, described it as looking like a ""war zone"". ""Paradise had done a lot of pre-planning for just this kind of an emergency but the fire of course was unprecedented, overwhelming and so a lot of people got caught,"" he said. This video can not be played California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. A number of fires continue to burn and officials at Thursday's press conference warned the risk of more is far from over. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, who has been touring the damage called it ""unsustainable"" for such fires to become a yearly occurrence. ""We're a great nation, this not a Republican Democrat issue, this is an American and we should address it as such."" This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them Governor Jerry Brown said the solution will involve addressing climate change. ""We have to get on the side of nature, not just fight it,"" said the Democratic governor. Meanwhile, officials said ""good progress"" was being made on the Woolsey Fire that has damaged beach resorts, including the rich-and-famous haunt of Malibu. 'Three minutes separated me from death' Animals caught in wildfire destruction The photos not from the California fires Officials confirmed on Wednesday morning that a third victim from that fire had been discovered - meaning 59 people are now known to have died across the state. Actor Gerard Butler and singer Miley Cyrus are among the celebrities known to have suffered damage The Woolsey Fire is still burning across more than 98,000 acres but is 57% contained, the state fire service tweeted. Some areas affected are now considered safe, and the Los Angeles County police say they will now allow some people back into the city of Calabasas. The smaller Hill Fire, is 94% contained in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. Police have lifted evacuation orders for residents of Lake Sherwood and Hidden Valley. A new wind-driven fire began menacing San Bernardino County homes on Tuesday - but that has been being largely contained by local officials. Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric, causing their stock price to plunge by over 31% which amounts to market value of about $16bn. On Monday, the California Public Utilities Commissions (CPUC) announced investigations into PG&E and another electric company, Southern California Edison (SCE). SCE had reported issues with transmission lines near the start of the Hill and Woolsey Fires in southern California. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Speaking on Wednesday, Governor Brown said a range of factors were behind worsening fires in the state. ""It's not one thing, its people, it's how people live, its where they live, and it's the changing climate, the drought, the diminishing moisture and the truth is â¦ we're going to have more difficulties,"" he said.

Before and after,"Some residents who fled the town have described it as ""apocalyptic"" The town of Paradise in Butte County in northern California has been engulfed by the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. Thousands of the town's structures were completely destroyed in just a matter of hours as the blaze, named the Camp Fire, tore through the area. Before and after images across the community show the extent of its destruction. The wooded community, set close to the Sierra Nevada mountains, was particularly popular among retirees. The Ridgewood Mobile Home Park was among the areas almost completely flattened by the fire. The scenic park, which had 97 plots, was built decades ago Reports say some of its elderly residents remain missing The town's mayor has estimated that 80-90% of the town's neighbourhoods were destroyed in the fire. Some residents took to social media to share what little was left of their own homes upon their return. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Impossible to outrun,"Harmful smoke, fuelled by strong winds, has been spreading across California As firefighters work endlessly to control California's raging fires, experts warn of long-term damage from wildfire smoke that could affect millions - and potentially even those on the east coast. The fires have burned through over 200,000 acres, blanketing parts of California with clouds of thick smoke. So what are the biggest impacts of wildfires and why is the western US state so susceptible to such deadly blazes? Wildfire smoke is comprised of water vapour, carbon monoxide and dioxide, chemicals and very small particulates. Strong winds can carry harmful pollutants for hundreds of miles, and at current levels, the plumes can cause breathing difficulties even in healthy individuals. Those with pre-existing chronic conditions like asthma or heart disease, as well as children, pregnant women and the elderly are most susceptible to negative health effects, according to the National Institutes of Health. Yohannes Tesfaigzi, a senior scientist at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in New Mexico, says for those with susceptible lungs, even very low levels of smoke exposure can result in an emergency room visit, and lasting long-term effects. This video can not be played Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise ""The particulates generated by wildfires are very fine, therefore they can penetrate to the lung and they're not really filtered out,"" Mr Tesfaigzi says. He says when wildfires occur in California, particulate levels in the air increase threefold in New Mexico, several states away. A study by Georgia Tech during last year's wildfire season even detected particles at high altitudes on the US east coast.The smoke from 2017's massive blazes had been swept across the country along the jet stream,external. ""These are levels that we would not smell. If you're actually smelling the fire, you're talking much higher levels,"" Mr Tesfaigzi adds. Five myths about wildfires In pictures: Wildfires ravage California Winds whip California's deadliest wildfire The types of vegetation burning can affect exactly how harmful the plumes are.Smoke from pine trees, for example, may be carcinogenic,externaland eucalyptus is particularly toxic to humans. One study by researchers from several US universities,external, including Yale and Harvard, estimates that more than 82 million people in the western US will suffer ""significant"" health consequences from wildfire smoke in the next 20 years. Masks can help mitigate some of the dangers, but only certain kinds can keep out all the toxins, and some California communities are already experiencing a mask shortage,Kaiser Health reported,external. According to Mr Tesfaigzi, it is unclear what the lasting impacts of wildfire smoke are on healthy individuals, as those studies are still ongoing. Satellite imagery showed plumes of smoke from the Camp Fire stretching across portions of Northern California Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service, told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. This video can not be played Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service,external, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. Determining the cause of a wildfire can be a painstaking process. Investigators search for a fire's point of origin by looking at how the fire spread - at the start, flames grow outward in a circle unless wind or terrain affects it otherwise,according to National Wildfire Coordinating Group's handbook,external. From there, officials comb through the area to determine if the blaze was of natural or human origin, looking for pieces of evidence like lightning scars on trees, campfire kindling, or cigarette butts. Cal Fire firefighters have been fighting the Camp Fire for days According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Why can't California control the wildfires? Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres,according to the National Interagency Fire Center,external, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""When fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot Some of the hyper-wealthy may never see any damage in the first place. This week,TMZ first reported,externalthat Kim Kardashian and Kanye West had a team of private firefighters protecting their cul-de-sac from the Woolsey Fire. These firefighters for hire are usually affiliated with insurance companieslike AIG and Chubb,external, which have special wildfire protection units. According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics,external, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called theFair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan,external. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency. Drone footage shows Paradise devastation.

Helicopter 'did not respond' to pilot's turn,"This video can not be played The widely shared footage shows the helicopter taking off The helicopter that crashed outside Leicester City's stadium, killing five people, did not respond to the pilot's command, initial findings show. Club chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others died when the aircraft came down after a match on 27 October. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the helicopter started to turn right ""contrary to the pilot's left pedal command"". It added the cause of the apparent loss of control is still being investigated. Widely shared video footage, taken inside the stadium, shows the AgustaWestland AW169 climbing normally for about 40 seconds, before it pauses and goes into a downward spin. Safety checks have been ordered on helicopters of a similar design to the one involved in the crash, and an investigation of the tail rotor control system is being ""carried out as a priority"". (L-R): Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Izabela Roza Lechowicz and Eric Swaffer were killed in the crash In a Special Bulletin, the AAIB said the helicopter embarked on its first flight of the day from Fairoaks Airport in Surrey with the pilot and one passenger on board. It later landed at London Heliport in Battersea where three more passengers boarded. The aircraft then flew to the Belvoir Drive Training Ground in Leicester and those on board went to the King Power Stadium. The pilot and one passenger then went back to the training ground and flew the aircraft back to the stadium. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Fans in '5,000-1' helicopter tribute walk Helicopter checks after Leicester crash Five people in total - Mr Vichai, two members of his staff, Kaveporn Punpare and Nusara Suknamai, pilot Eric Swaffer and passenger Izabela Roza Lechowicz - then boarded the aircraft which was due to fly to Stansted Airport. After taking off, the helicopter ""entered an increasing right yaw contrary to the pilot's left pedal command"". Yaw is the rotation of a vehicle to the left or right. It reached an estimated height of 430ft (121.9m) before it descended and crashed in an ""approximately upright position"". The AAIB also said it had no evidence to suggest interference or the involvement of a drone at this stage. The wreckage from the crash has been taken to a facility in Farnborough, Hampshire. An inquest heard there was ""minimal chance"" for anyone on board the helicopter to survive. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

Government backtracks on gaming machinesIt comes after MPs called for the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to be cut from April.BusinessComments,"This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? The maximum bet on fixed-odds betting terminals will be cut from April after the government bowed to pressure. Ministers had been facing a parliamentary defeat, with several Tory MPs joining opposition politicians to table amendments to the finance bill. The chancellor said in the Budget the maximum bet would be reduced from Â£100 to Â£2 from October. But that led to accusations of a delay - with sports minister Tracey Crouch resigning in protest. Several former ministers - including Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Justine Greening - tabled amendments designed to force the government to make the change from April. Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops in 1999, and offer computerised games at the touch of a button. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The government has listened and will now implement the reduction in April 2019."" Mr Wright added that a planned increase in Remote Gaming Duty, paid by online gaming firms, would be brought forward to April to cover the negative impact on the public finances. Ms Crouch said shewelcomed the decision,externaland was pleased that ""common sense"" had prevailed. Tracey Crouch resigned over the FOBTs issue Asked if she would like to return to Government, Ms Crouch said: ""There isn't a vacancy. That's been filled. So, I will just get on and do what I'm going to do."" The government had earlier said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe. High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines Pro-betting MPs more persuasive - Crouch 16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms Theresa May had earlier been asked at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday about the timing by Conservative ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith. He said: ""I was enormously proud of my government for agreeing to lower the stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to Â£2 because they have caused endless harm, terrible damage to families and it was the right decision. ""Since then, there has been a hiatus about the date at which this would start."" Mrs May answered: ""I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue. I know gambling addiction can devastate lives."" By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check FOBTs were introduced into betting shops in 1999.Since then, the number has grown to 33,468,externalin Great Britain. Data from the Gambling Commission shows that the profit generated by FOBTs grew from Â£1.05bn in 2009 to Â£1.83bn last year - that's a rise of 74%. Last year, betting shops made Â£3.2bn from a combination of FOBTs and traditional ""over-the-counter"" bets. As a proportion of profits, FOBTs made up 57% of the total - up from 38% in 2008-09. That suggests that bookies are becoming increasingly reliant on them as a source of profit. FOBTs have been under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm. The machines have been called the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems. The government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a ""call for evidence"" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players. Investors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms have climbed, with Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC Holdings 8% higher and William Hill shares up 2.23%. After the government brought forward the FOBT deadline, it meant GVC Holdings was spared a major cash payment to former Ladbrokes shareholders, analysts said. Tom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said it had taken ""the resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed-odds betting terminals"". He added it was ""a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction"".

Arena bomber's brother 'extradited soon',"Fayez Al Sarraj said the delay in Hashem Abedi's extradition was due to the legal process The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi will be extradited to the UK by the end of the year, according to Libya's prime minister. Hashem Abedi was arrested in the country shortly after the 2017 suicide attack that killed 22 people. Fayez Al Sarraj told the BBC that Libya was ""fully co-operating"" with British authorities and denied that there were any delays on the country's part. The Home Office said it would not be commenting at this stage. Mr Fayez al-Sarraj said it was ""only a matter of time"" before Libyan officials working with British authorities finalised the move. He added: ""Sometimes it takes a long time, even in other countries. So the case needs time, and as a country we are following up, and working with the British Embassy. ""We are fully co-operating because we understand the suffering of the families of the victims of this terrorist attack."" Fayez Al Sarraj said Libya was ""fully co-operating"" with British authorities Both brothers travelled to Libya in April, before Salman Abedi returned alone, carrying out the attack at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said in November last year it had been granted a warrant for the arrest of Hashem, Salman's younger sibling. The force said it was still awaiting the outcome of the Crown Prosecution Service's request for his extradition from Libya. What we know about Manchester bomber Salman Abedi GMP said: ""The extradition proceedings are in progress... [and] as proceedings are ongoing, it is essential that we respect the Libyan legal process and therefore we cannot provide any further detail at this time."" The arrest warrant relates to the ""murder of 22 people, the attempted murder of others who were injured and conspiracy to cause an explosion,"" police said previously. The then 20-year-old was arrested in Tripoliby members of the Rada Special Deterrence Force a day after the attack. Salman Abedi was born in Manchester on New Year's Eve 1994 Twenty-two people died in the bombing in May 2017 while a total of 112 needed hospital treatment after the attack, with 64 suffering ""very serious"" injuries. Physical injuries include paralysis, loss of limbs, internal injuries and very serious facial injuries. Many have had complicated plastic surgery. Security Minister Ben Wallace previously said authorities were ""determined to do everything in our power to ensure that those suspected of being responsible for the Manchester attack are brought to justice in the UK"".

Planet found circling neighbouring star,"Artwork: Barnard's Star b is thought to be quite cold Astronomers have discovered a planet around one of the closest stars to our Sun. Nearby planets like this are likely to be prime targets in the search for signatures of life, using the next generation of telescopes. The planet's mass is thought to be 3.2 times that of our own, placing it in a category of world known as a ""super-Earth"". It orbits Barnard's star, which sits ""just"" six light-years away. The star is an extremely faint ""red dwarf"" that's about 3% as bright as the Sun. The research is published in the journal Nature.,external Co-author Guillem Anglada EscudÃ© said the newly discovered world was ""possibly a mostly rocky planet with a massive atmosphere. It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface"". Dr Anglada EscudÃ©, from Queen Mary University of London, added: ""The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane."" The planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth afterProxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016. The planet orbits past a boundary called the ""snow line"", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface. On distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life. Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere The researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect ""wobbles"" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. These wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red. Earth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star Where should we look for aliens? Could Nasa's next big thing detect alien life? ""This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,"" Dr Anglada EscudÃ© told me. The team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands. It's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star. The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun ""We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,"" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer. ""We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing ""ghost signals"". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious."" When the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology. ""The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,"" said Dr Anglada EscudÃ©. ""If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere."" Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet This is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star. However, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding. ""The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,"" said Guillem Anglada EscudÃ©. However, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth. ""The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,"" said Anglada EscudÃ©. In a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery ""gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail"". He added: ""Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric dataÂ - precision measurements of stellar positionsÂ - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s."" The star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.

TK Maxx and Amazon selling real fur as faux,"A handbag from TK Maxx was made from fox fur, while shoes bought from the store online contained raccoon dog fur Shops including Amazon and TK Maxx have been selling faux fur clothes and bags which are actually made from rabbit, fox and raccoon dog fur, a BBC Watchdog Live investigation has found. Widespread concern over animal cruelty has led to real fur very nearly disappearing from most UK high streets. Both TK Maxx and Amazon said the products were no longer available. TK Maxx said it does not knowingly buy real fur and an error was made. It has offered refunds to anyone affected. Watchdog Live presenter Steph McGovern visited a branch of TK Maxx - which has had a no-fur policy for 15 years - and bought a handbag made from fox fur. And a pair of shoes purchased on the store's website featured fluffy bobbles which were made from raccoon dog fur. Meanwhile, two bobble hats sold by Amazon and described as ""faux fur"" were made with raccoon dog fur. Rabbit fur was also found in a jumper purchased at an AX Paris outlet store and in fluffy bobbles on a pair of shoes bought from fashion label Missy Empire. Fur farming is banned in the UK, but it is not illegal to import fur from abroad The ""fake fur"" on this grey jumper's star, bought from an AX Paris outlet shop, was made from rabbit The tests were carried out by textile analysis expert Dr Phil Greaves. He told the programme: ""All animal fibres have particular structural features. ""And it's the actual nature and characteristic of these which determines the species of origin. ""These fibres are very distinctive once under the microscope."" How to spot the difference between real and fake fur Real animal fur sold as fake in London markets The tests came after shopper Chloe Salvi, from Edinburgh, said she was concerned about a bobble hat that she had bought on eBay. It had been described as fake fur. ""As soon as I touched it I felt something wasn't right,"" she said. ""I've got a cat, and it reminds me of when I cuddle her. It wasn't the way a faux fur pom-pom should feel."" Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern with Chloe and her real fur hat Raccoon dogs are wild animals native to southern and eastern Asia Tests later revealed it had been made from raccoon dog. ""I can't help thinking about what animal this has been taken off, just for me to have a pom-pom on a hat,"" she said. eBay does not have a no-fur policy, but the website says it expects sellers to describe products accurately. The online auction website has asked the seller to amend or remove the listing and apologised for any distress caused to Chloe. Though fur farming is banned in the UK, it is not illegal to import fur from other countries. Earlier this year,a committee of MPs recommendeda consultation on banning sales of real fur. It said the current labelling of fur products was ""not fit for purpose"". Call for debate on banning sales of real fur Why my real fur sells 'like hotcakes' Claire Bass, the executive director of Humane Society International in the UK, said she would like to see a change in the law over imports, because of the conditions in which many animals are kept. She said: ""Retailers need to be do more to give consumers the confidence they need to buy fake fur and not be worrying that it might actually be fox, rabbit or mink."" This video can not be played Critics and supporters of the fur trade speak out TK Maxx told Watchdog Live: ""Our buyers understand that we do not knowingly purchase items containing real fur. ""Despite our robust processes, an error can occasionally occur. As soon as this is brought to our attention we remove the item from sale and review the journey of that product. ""Any customer who has purchased such an item can return it to any TK Maxx store for a full refund with our most sincere apologies."" In response to the investigation, Amazon told Watchdog Live: ""All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines, and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. ""The products in question are no longer available."" AX Paris, which has a fur-free policy, said the jumper was in an isolated product line and not branded with AX Paris. It said investigations are ongoing. Missy Empire, which is also anti-fur, said it was ""dismayed"" to find its product contained fur and it was no longer available. It apologised to customers and said it is running further checks on other faux fur items. Watchdog Live is on BBC One on Wednesday 14 November at 20:00 GMT. How to tell whether fur is real or fake.

Apple Stores to employ trafficking victims,"Apple's own staff will not be told who the human trafficking victims are Apple has announced a programme to help human trafficking victims get behind-the-scenes jobs at its stores. The technology company has teamed up with an NGO that will help the victims pass interviews for caretaker and landscaping posts among other roles. The individuals will not be identified to Apple and will be employed by its suppliers rather than directly. But it intends to monitor the initiative. The announcement coincides with the company winning the Stop Slavery Award. The prize was given by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and accepted by Apple's retail chief Angela Ahrendts in London. It recognises companies that are at the forefront of efforts to combat forced labour in supply chains. Judges praised the Apple's ""extremely robust"" audit programme and the fact it had ""openly shared its learnings with the public"". Unilever's chief executive, Paul Polman, was also presented with an award in recognition of the work he had done. But one campaign group described the decision to honour Apple as ""a joke"". ""Apple may be doing more compared to other companies but that is because it has the resources to do so,"" said Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch. ""However, Apple isn't doing enough, as forced labour persists in its suppliers' factories in China."" Apple's trafficking victims scheme is already under way, although the BBC understands only a handful of people have been employed as consequence so far. The UN's International Organization for Migration is the NGO involved. Angela Ahrendts accepted the Stop Slavery Award at a London ceremony Although the effort is currently limited to jobs with third-party contractors, in time it may be extended to include front-of-house retail staff employed by Apple itself. ""Though we have only just started, we see huge opportunity to be a beacon of hope for trafficking survivors integrating them into our retail team,"" Ms Ahrendts said in her acceptance speech. ""These efforts are just a part of a broader set of initiatives to eliminate modern slavery from every part of our company, in every part of the world."" In the UK,the Co-operative Group has run a similar schemesince 2017. Other examples of Apple's efforts include a ban on contractors withholding their workers' passports or otherwise forcing staff to work until they have paid off a debt. Ms Ahrendts said audits carried out to check for workers being wrongfully charged recruitment fees to secure their posts had resulted in it making suppliers return over $30m (Â£23m) to more than 35,000 people over the past decade. Contractors found guilty of the practice are banned if they do not make the repayments and put on probation for a year if they do. Ms Ahrendts also mentioned Apple's efforts to source materials used in its devices more responsibly from the Congo and elsewhere. The US company was stung in 2016when a report by Amnesty International identified it as one of several technology companies failing to checkif cobalt used in their batteries had been mined by children. Apple has since mapped its cobalt supply chain and made public the smelters involved. In addition, it is working with two NGOs to educate mining communities about the dangers involved in using children and the opportunities for other types of work. Apple has said there is ""no excuse"" for under-age workers to be involved in its supply chain Amnesty has since acknowledged that Apple isnow behaving better than many of its competitors,externalbut said Wednesday evening's award should not be viewed as a sign the company was doing enough. ""While it shouldn't be necessary to reward companies for taking steps to stop slavery in their business, we should recognise that some companies, such as Apple, are doing more than others to be transparent about how they are tackling slavery in the supply chain,"" said Peter Frankental, Amnesty UK's business and human rights programme director. ""It could go further though. And whilst it's commendable that Apple is investigating its cobalt supply chain, it's still failing to disclose all the human rights risks and abuses it finds.""

Crossbow death 'shocked people to core',"Sana Muhammad died in hospital on Monday The death of a pregnant woman who was killed in a crossbow attack in her own home has ""shocked people to the core"", an MP has said. Sana Muhammad, 35, died on Monday after the attack in Ilford, east London, but her unborn son was delivered safely. Ilford North MP Wes Streeting said in Parliament her death had left people in shock ""up and down the country"". Prime Minister Theresa May said laws around crossbows would be reviewed after Mrs Muhammad's death. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 50, of no fixed address, has been charged with Mrs Muhammad's murder and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Thursday. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Streeting said: ""I know I will speak for every member of this House in expressing our deepest condolences to the family and our best wishes to the baby for a speedy recovery. ""Given these weapons, like the crossbow, used to kill my constituent are readily for sale online, can I urge the Prime Minister to urgently and seriously look at expanding the Offensive Weapons Bill so that we can toughen the scope of the laws governing the sale, the possession and the use of these deadly weapons."" Mrs May responded by saying crossbows were ""subject to strict controls"", but the government would ""consider the risk to public safety and whether further measures are needed"". The Met Police said the newborn baby remains in hospital in a ""stable condition"" Offers of help for Mrs Muhammad's family, including a pledge to cover funeral costs, have flooded in from the community. Redbridge Council leader Jas Athwal said the authority would support the family for ""as long as it is needed"". Nearly Â£3,000 has also been raised through a Go Fund Me page, which described the death of Mrs Muhammad as ""unimaginable"". Pregnant woman killed with crossbow London homicides: The victims of 2018 Mohamed Omer from the Gardens of Peace cemetery and funeral company said: ""The entire Muslim community and the entire Redbridge community is in absolute shock as to what has happened. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family. ""In order to help them cope, we are making the family of Sana Muhammad know that they need to not worry about funeral costs as we will be covering them."" Police said the victim and the suspect were known to each other Mrs Muhammad was attacked in front of her five other children in the family home on Applegarth Road, her husband Imtiaz Muhammadtold the Evening Standard,external. She was taken to hospital with an abdominal wound and pronounced dead at 11:00 GMT, less than four hours after the attack. However her son was delivered by Caesarean section and ""remains in a stable condition in a critical care unit"", police said. Councillor Athwal said he had asked for an ""urgent meeting"" with the borough commander ""to discuss safety"" in the Redbridge area.

Outcry over teen's underwear in rape trial,"Irish MP Ruth Coppinger brandished lacy underwear in parliament to raise awareness of the controversy A series of protests over sexual consent have been taking place in Ireland, a week after a man was acquitted of raping a 17-year-old. In the trial, the defence lawyer told the jury: ""You have to look at the way she was dressed. She was wearing a thong with a lace front."" The 27-year-old man was found not guilty of rape shortly afterwards. The controversy led one Irish MP to hold up a lace thong in parliament to highlight ""routine victim-blaming"". Ruth Coppinger produced the blue lacy underwear in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) from her sleeve on Tuesday. ""It might seem embarrassing to show a pair of thongs here... how do you think a rape victim or a woman feels at the incongruous setting of her underwear being shown in a court?"" The case, in which the man was cleared of rape, was originally reported by the Irish Examiner newspaper,externalon 6 November. The accused maintained that the sexual contact between him and the girl, which took place in a laneway in Cork, had been consensual. Details of the closing argument presented by his senior counsel Elizabeth O'Connell, however, attracted widespread attention and prompted a series of online protest movements. ""Does the evidence out-rule the possibility that she was attracted to the defendant and was open to meeting someone and being with someone?"" she asked, according to the Examiner's report. ""You have to look at the way she was dressed. She was wearing a thong with a lace front."" Irish schools to teach sexual consent France to set age of sexual consent at 15 The day after publication of that court report,the head of Dublin's Rape Crisis Centre criticised the barrister's remarks,external. Although she did not question the verdict, she called for reform of a legal system in which she said such suggestions were frequently made. Amid increasing media attention, Irish social media users expressed outrage at the remarks in court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Under the hashtag #ThisIsNotConsent, Irish women posted photographs of their underwear in all shapes, colours, and materials to protest the use of such techniques in court. Many pointed to other countries which have tighter controls on what can be introduced in rape trials, and in what manner the jury can consider them. After producing lacy underwear in Ireland's national parliament, Ms Coppinger told one supporter that compulsory training should be introduced for both judges and jurors. Allow Twitter content?

The controversy surrounding the trial was reminiscent of an outcry over intimate details made public in the trial of two high-profile rugby players, who were cleared of rape in Northern Ireland earlier this year. The revelations caused controversy on both sides of the border. Rugby rape trial - a #MeToo moment? Lunchtime protests calling for an end to ""victim-blaming in the courts"" took place in a number of Irish cities on Wednesday, organised by Socialist feminist group Rosa.

LiveCabinet backs draft Brexit agreement,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sky News Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable says former Prime Minister David Cameron ""opened a can of worms"" that can't easily be closed when he called the referendum in 2016. Sir Cable said the whole issue of Europe was divisive and the ""least damaging"" way forward now would be to go back to the people, put the question before them and come to a ""clear decision"". The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so."" He said she had shown courage and character but that does not avoid the fact she made a terrible decision to set a series of red lines that could not be met.  Allow Twitter content?

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Cabinet backs draft Brexit agreement,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she believes with her ""head and her heart"" that it is in the best interests of the UK The cabinet has backed a draft withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU, Theresa May has said. The prime minister was speaking after what she said was a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" in a five-hour cabinet meeting. She said it was a ""decisive step"" in the progress of Brexit, and would allow the agreement to be finalised. The EU's chief negotiator said it was in both sides' interests. But leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg described it as a ""rotten deal"". As it happened: Reaction to May securing cabinet backing Analysis: What happened and what's next? Volatile UK politics could bin Brexit deal,  worries EU A guide to where we are with Brexit Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the cabinet was ""certainly not unanimous"", with nine ministers speaking out against the deal. Allow Twitter content?

In her statement outside Downing Street, Mrs May said the agreed package was ""the result of thousands of hours of hard negotiation with EU officials"". She believed that ""this decisive choice is in the best interests of the entire UK"", adding: ""When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear. ""This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union; or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all."" The 585-page draft withdrawal agreement hasnow been published,,externalalongside a shorter statement setting out what the UK and EU's future relations will look like. The withdrawal agreement covers so-called ""divorce"" issues. It includes a commitment to protect the rights of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living in the EU to continue living, working and studying. There is also a planned 21-month transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and a ""financial settlement"" from the UK, thought to be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. The most contentious part of the negotiations is a ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event this is not settled by a UK-EU trade deal. Please upgrade your browser Both sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements. Speaking at a press conference, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said if this is not possible by July 2020, the transition period could be extended - and if it is still not settled by the end of the transition, the backstop would ""kick in"". This would involve a joint UK-EU ""single customs territory"", so customs checks are not needed on the border. Northern Ireland would stay aligned to the EU single market rules that are ""essential for the avoidance of a hard border"", Mr Barnier added, saying the backstop plan was based on the UK's proposal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he did not think the agreement was in the national interest because it ""doesn't meet the needs of all parts of Britain"". Labour would reveal during Thursday morning's Commons statement whether it will vote against the agreement, he said. Some Tory MPs are angry, claiming it could mean the UK is tied to EU rules for years to come. Earlier a senior Conservative told the BBC there could be a move to a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May, perhaps as soon as Thursday, Meanwhile Mr Rees-Mogg, who has written to MPs urging them to oppose the proposals, told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""a pretty rotten deal"", keeping the UK in the EU's customs union and ""splitting up"" the UK. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? Despite winning the backing of her cabinet, the prime minister faces a battle to get the completed deal through Parliament. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which gives the government the support it needs to win key votes - has joined opposition parties in criticising it. Pound recovers as cabinet backs plan Barnier: Brexit draft agreement a 'decisive' step Senior DUP figures spent an hour in Theresa May's office after the publication of the draft text. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards.""

Theresa May is sure to face some hostile questioning when she faces MPs' questions on Thursday. Meanwhile, the EU has said ""decisive progress"" has now been made in the negotiations. This was the test required before it would call a special summit to agree the withdrawal plans, possibly later this month. After that, the government faces a crunch vote in Parliament where MPs will be asked to approve the plans. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - at which point, if the withdrawal agreement has been ratified, the transition period begins.

Trump 'lacked decency' in Macron attackThe US president's derisive tweets came on the anniversary of the deadly Paris terror attacks.,"Mr Macron and Mr Trump had appeared to smooth over their differences at the weekend US President Donald Trump's tweets mocking his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron were inappropriate and showed a lack of ""common decency"", France says. On Tuesday, Mr Trump attacked Mr Macron over nationalism, plans for a European army and the French leader's ratings. ""We were marking the murder of 130 of our people,"" French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said, referring to the 2015 Paris attacks. It follows Mr Trump's awkward Armistice Day visit to Paris over the weekend. Mr Griveaux said13 November was a date for France to mark the tragic incidents of three years ago in Paris and Saint-Denis, when co-ordinated suicide bombings and mass shootings killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more. ""So I will reply in English: 'common decency' would have been the appropriate thing,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. Did the French army mock Donald Trump? Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat White House defends Trump WW1 no-show In a series of earlier tweets, Mr Trump launched an attack on Mr Macron over his ""very low approval rating"" and issued a gibe at France's defeat and occupation by Nazi Germany in World War Two.

Mr Trump also attacked his counterpart over nationalism and took exception toMr Macron's vision for a ""true European army"", which the French president said was necessary to enable Europe ""to defend itself better alone"". Speaking to reporters during a visit to a French warship after Mr Trump's comments, Mr Macron said what matters is ""what we do with the US army"". ""We are going to carry out very concrete operations with the Americans,"" he said, citing the ""perfect co-ordination and excellent execution"" ofa joint operation with the US and UK in Syria last April. Later, during a television interview, the French president added that the country could not wholly rely on the US for its security. ""The United States is our historic ally, it will continue to be,"" Mr Macron said. ""But to be allied is not to be a vassal."" President Trump recently met with President Macron on a visit to France The pair's comments come after a meeting in Paris on Saturday in which the two appeared to smooth over their differences and agreed that Europe needed to pay more towards its defence costs. Mr Trump was in France as part of Armistice Day commemorations marking 100 years since the end of World War One. During his visit, the US president was widely criticised for failing to visit the Aisne-Marne American cemetery, which the White House later said was down to visibility being too poor for his helicopter and Mr Trump not wanting to disrupt the Paris traffic with his motorcade. The French army appeared to poke fun at Mr Trump over the decision, tweeting an image of an officer crawling under barbed wire in wet weather with the words: ""There's rain, but it's no problem.""

Apple Stores to employ trafficking victimsThe technology company's retail chief reveals the initiative as she is given the Stop Slavery Award.Technology,"Apple's own staff will not be told who the human trafficking victims are Apple has announced a programme to help human trafficking victims get behind-the-scenes jobs at its stores. The technology company has teamed up with an NGO that will help the victims pass interviews for caretaker and landscaping posts among other roles. The individuals will not be identified to Apple and will be employed by its suppliers rather than directly. But it intends to monitor the initiative. The announcement coincides with the company winning the Stop Slavery Award. The prize was given by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and accepted by Apple's retail chief Angela Ahrendts in London. It recognises companies that are at the forefront of efforts to combat forced labour in supply chains. Judges praised the Apple's ""extremely robust"" audit programme and the fact it had ""openly shared its learnings with the public"". Unilever's chief executive, Paul Polman, was also presented with an award in recognition of the work he had done. But one campaign group described the decision to honour Apple as ""a joke"". ""Apple may be doing more compared to other companies but that is because it has the resources to do so,"" said Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch. ""However, Apple isn't doing enough, as forced labour persists in its suppliers' factories in China."" Apple's trafficking victims scheme is already under way, although the BBC understands only a handful of people have been employed as consequence so far. The UN's International Organization for Migration is the NGO involved. Angela Ahrendts accepted the Stop Slavery Award at a London ceremony Although the effort is currently limited to jobs with third-party contractors, in time it may be extended to include front-of-house retail staff employed by Apple itself. ""Though we have only just started, we see huge opportunity to be a beacon of hope for trafficking survivors integrating them into our retail team,"" Ms Ahrendts said in her acceptance speech. ""These efforts are just a part of a broader set of initiatives to eliminate modern slavery from every part of our company, in every part of the world."" In the UK,the Co-operative Group has run a similar schemesince 2017. Other examples of Apple's efforts include a ban on contractors withholding their workers' passports or otherwise forcing staff to work until they have paid off a debt. Ms Ahrendts said audits carried out to check for workers being wrongfully charged recruitment fees to secure their posts had resulted in it making suppliers return over $30m (Â£23m) to more than 35,000 people over the past decade. Contractors found guilty of the practice are banned if they do not make the repayments and put on probation for a year if they do. Ms Ahrendts also mentioned Apple's efforts to source materials used in its devices more responsibly from the Congo and elsewhere. The US company was stung in 2016when a report by Amnesty International identified it as one of several technology companies failing to checkif cobalt used in their batteries had been mined by children. Apple has since mapped its cobalt supply chain and made public the smelters involved. In addition, it is working with two NGOs to educate mining communities about the dangers involved in using children and the opportunities for other types of work. Apple has said there is ""no excuse"" for under-age workers to be involved in its supply chain Amnesty has since acknowledged that Apple isnow behaving better than many of its competitors,externalbut said Wednesday evening's award should not be viewed as a sign the company was doing enough. ""While it shouldn't be necessary to reward companies for taking steps to stop slavery in their business, we should recognise that some companies, such as Apple, are doing more than others to be transparent about how they are tackling slavery in the supply chain,"" said Peter Frankental, Amnesty UK's business and human rights programme director. ""It could go further though. And whilst it's commendable that Apple is investigating its cobalt supply chain, it's still failing to disclose all the human rights risks and abuses it finds.""

Oxford Union criticised for Bannon inviteEx-White House adviser Steven Bannon's scheduled visit on Friday is met with anger from students.Oxford,"Steve Bannon spoke at the European Broadcasting Union's News Xchange conference in Edinburgh The Oxford Union has been criticised for inviting Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon to speak to its members. The former White House adviser's scheduled visit on Friday has been met with anger on social media, with protests planned by students. Oxford Students Stand Up To Racism said the union was ""giving credibility to racism and fascism"". The union president said it was a chance to ""critically question"" him. Mr Bannon was one of President Trump's closest aides until he quit the White House last year. He took part in the News Xchange conference in Edinburgh earlier, where a 56-year-old demonstrator was arrested and charged with threatening and abusive behaviour. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pulled out of the conference over his ""far-right views"". About 100 protesters gathered outside the conference in Edinburgh On Facebook, the Oxford Students Stand Up To Racism group described Mr Bannon as ""the white supremacists' link to Donald Trump's White House"". ""The Oxford Union is once again giving a platform to a far right speaker, and by doing so legitimising racism,"" it said. The Hope Not Hate campaigntweeted,externalthat Mr Bannon was ""whipping up hate and division"". ""This might be a game to those running the Oxford Union, but this invite only serves to further Bannon's cause,"" it added. BBC chief defends Steve Bannon invitation Man arrested at Steve Bannon protest BBC boss hits back at Twitter critics Union president Stephen Horvath said it was an opportunity for members to ""hear from an individual who has been at the centre of the rise in right-wing populism, as well as to critically question and debate the ideas and rhetoric of Mr Bannon"". He added: ""It is only through listening to the opinions of others that we can fully understand those opinions.

Ex-UBS trader Kweku Adoboli deported,"Kweku Adoboli has not lived in Ghana since he was four and came to the UK 26 years ago Kweku Adoboli, the former UBS trader convicted of fraud, has been deported to Ghana, despite a long campaign to keep him in Britain. His lawyer confirmed he was flown out of Heathrow Airport this evening after being detained in Scotland on Monday. Adoboli, aged 38 and who has lived in the UK for 26 years, was said to be in a distressed state before he left. The Home Office declined to comment on the reports. Mr Adoboli's local MP, Hannah Bardell, told the BBC he would be flown to Casablanca and then on to Ghana. Adoboli: Deportation process 'is racism' MPs support for threatened fraud trader The MP, who has campaigned to stop the deportation, spoke to him on the phone before his departure and said he was ""struggling not to break down"". ""This is a travesty of justice. Kweku has been here since he was 12 and he would have been entitled to British citizenship,"" she said. ""No one is saying he hasn't committed a crime, but he has been rehabilitated and is being punished twice."" Nick Hopewell-Smith, one of the lawyers acting on behalf of Adoboli, said: ""We are deeply upset about the manner in which he was whisked away, because there was no chance to say goodbye. ""His friends and all his supporters will keep campaigning to bring him home because this is his home. ""He supports Leeds United. He's a Yorkshireman. He is being sent to a place where he hasn't lived since he was four."" Adoboli served four years of a seven-year sentence for a Â£1.4bn fraud and was released in 2015. He was born in Ghana but left when he was four and has lived in the UK since he was 12. He is leaving behind his partner Alice, with whom he had been living in Livingston, West Lothian. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes had said that all foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years' imprisonment are subject to automatic deportation, unless there are compelling reasons for them to remain. Adoboli was expected to be put on a charter flight in September, but a judge awarded a last-minute reprieve while his case was reviewed. Since then, more than 74,000 people have signed a petition against Adoboli's deportation, with more than 130 members of the UK and Scottish parliaments signing a letter asking Home Secretary Sajid Javid to intervene. Ms Bardell said Adoboli's team would now explore further legal means of securing his return, but said doing so could prove difficult from overseas. Adoboli was found guilty of booking fictitious trades to cover up big losses during the financial crisis between 2008 and 2011. He pleaded not guilty, saying his senior managers knew what he was doing and encouraged him to take risks. Ex-UBS trader Adoboli detained again Deportation 'is racism' says ex-trader.

A brief guide to where we are,"This video can not be played Brexit: May under pressure over deal Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, althoughtwo ministers resigned in protest at it.They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest. If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament. There are two documents. Adraft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal,externalfrom the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: Commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members A 21-month transition period after the UK's departure, to allow time for trade talks The UK would continue to follow all EU rules during this period in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term changes A ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" A ""backstop"" arrangement to keep the Irish border unmanned if trade talks don't come up with a way of avoiding that happening More on how what the draft agreement reveals The other document isa 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU,external, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: Plans for a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"" ""Ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement Commitment to respect the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, services and money around the EU A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK A reference to allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals after Brexit An exit from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Determination to use technology to replace the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - but no guarantee A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law Continued participation in EU programmes in areas like science, culture, education, overseas development and space, including ""a fair and appropriate financial contribution"" Continued co-operation on defence and security More on what's in the political declaration This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that ""widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected ""by a significant margin"". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to ""ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"" and has ""democratic legitimacy"". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Leaving the EU without a deal Having another vote in Parliament - Mrs May will get three weeks to make a second attempt Another EU referendum (this can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it) A general election - Labour's preferred option but it would need a no-confidence vote in the PM Theresa May is removed by her own MPs and a new leader tries to renegotiate a deal with the EU - Tory MPs say they are close to having enough signatures to trigger a confidence vote in her Some of these options would involve delaying the official Brexit date of 29 March by a few months to allow time to renegotiate a deal, if the EU agrees to that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has alsofloated the idea of Labour forming a minority governmentwithout a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.

May seeks cabinet backing over Brexit,"A crucial cabinet meeting where Theresa May's most senior ministers debated the draft EU withdrawal agreement has ended. The meeting inside 10 Downing Street lasted for five hours. The prime minister is expected to make a statement shortly, with the EU due to publish the withdrawal documents if it gets the green light from London. Some Tory MPs and opposition parties have already criticised what the agreement is thought to contain.

A senior Conservative told the BBC there could be a move to a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May, perhaps as soon as Thursday, although this has not been confirmed. Sources said many Brexiteer MPs were likely to submit letters to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for her to go. If 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) do this it would trigger a vote of no confidence. Meanwhile Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which supports Mrs May's government in key votes - warned of ""consequences"" if there is a deal that ""breaks up the United Kingdom"". Penny Mordaunt said nothing as she arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday The BBC's Norman Smith said the prime minister would seek to head off the threat of any resignations by telling her cabinet ministers that while not perfect, the agreement was as good as it can get. Downing Street, he added, were pointing to what they view as significant wins, including no separate customs border for Northern Ireland and an arbitration mechanism to ensure the UK can exit the proposed ""backstop"" customs plan. Just ahead of the cabinet meeting, all 13 Scottish Tory MPs, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell,signed a letter to the prime ministersaying they would not support a Brexit deal that prevents the UK from negotiating its own fishing quotas. Access and quotas ""cannot be included in the Future Economic Partnership"" and the UK must leave the Common Fisheries Policy at the end of 2020, they added. The draft withdrawal agreement addresses the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations that involves not having a physical border. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No deal: When planning doesn't cut it This has proven the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. The backstop within the agreed draft is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. However, some Brexiteers fear this will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years. The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. If the cabinet signs it off, the EU Commission is expected later to publish the details of the 500-page draft withdrawal agreement as well as the much shorter declaration on future economic and security relations. Ambassadors from the remaining 27 EU member states will discuss the possibility of organising an emergency summit later this month to sign off on it. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has signalled the summit could take place on 25 November. If this happens, the government will then face a battle to win Parliament's backing, in a vote the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December. Please upgrade your browser With some Tories vowing to vote against it and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which Mrs May relies on to win key Commons votes - also expressing concern, it is not clear which way the vote will go. Brexiteer Conservative MPs were first to criticise the agreement, based on leaks of it, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Peter Bone said the reported agreement would not ""deliver"" on what people voted for and risked ""losing the support of many Tory MPs and millions of voters across the country"". But Mrs May, who is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, said the agreement would leave the UK free to do its own trade deals while the customs union ""backstop"" would be temporary. And Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" the deal would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Pienaar: May's big gamble This video can not be played MPs react to reports about the draft text of a Brexit agreement Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson described the reported agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop as ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"", and said he would vote against it. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Newsnight he was so unhappy with the agreement he was considering calling on Mrs May to quit as PM. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today that from ""what we have heard... this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom and that is not something we can support"". And the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK was heading towards a Brexit that would ""cost jobs"" and urged MPs to ""think about your constituents' interests, think about jobs, think about prosperity"". But one of Mrs May's allies, former first secretary of state Damian Green, criticised ""hyperbole"" from people who had not read the document. And former Conservative leader Lord Hague urged the cabinet to ""stick together"" - saying the draft agreement contained a ""lot of compromises"" but would allow the UK to regain control of immigration, fishing and farming. By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler What's so striking about this draft Brexit deal the UK media and politicians are all abuzz about, is the marked lack of excitement and/or hysteria in EU circles. Contrary to the UK narrative, this is not viewed in Brussels as the back-against-the-wall, make-or-break moment. There's still some time to keep negotiating. EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the ""i""s, nor all the ""t""s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed. The thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board.

Brexit deal 'bad for Scotland',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""This, from what I know of it, is not a good deal for Scotland."" Nicola Sturgeon has claimed that the draft Brexit agreement between the UK and EU would be bad for Scotland as her party pledged to oppose the deal. Scotland's first minister said the proposals would take Scotland out of the single market while Northern Ireland in effect stays in. This would have a ""devastating"" impact on jobs and investment in Scotland, she insisted. Mrs May has won cabinet backing for the deal after a five-hour meeting. But her Brexit deal proposals, which have now beenpublished,,externalare facing strong opposition from senior Brexiteers and some Remain supporters. Cabinet backs draft agreement Scots Tories warn over Brexit fishing deal Live Updates: Brexit negotiations latest A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Theresa May said there had been a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" by cabinet members on the draft agreement. Speaking outside Number 10, she said: ""I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement was the best that could be negotiated and it was for the cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks."" But Ms Sturgeon said it was obvious that the prime minister could ""barely unite her cabinet on this deal"" and that she would struggle to get a majority for it in the House of Commons. ""In these circumstances it is more important than ever that we are not faced with a false choice between a bad deal and no deal,"" she said. ""No one should be effectively blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire. ""This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards. ""If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament then the UK government must return to the negotiating table to secure a better one. ""Our bottom line - short of continued EU membership - is continued, permanent membership of the single market and customs union."" Ms Sturgeon later tweeted that she had received a phone call from Mrs May and had pointed out that the draft document makes no mention of Scotland. Allow Twitter content?

The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May's minority Conservative government, has warned that the dealcould lead to the break-up of the United Kingdomif it is accepted by MPs. The major sticking point in the negotiations between the UK and EU has been over the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic if the EU and UK fail to agree a deal on future trading relations. The prime minister managed to persuade her cabinet to back the proposals on Wednesday afternoon The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said the draft agreement involved Northern Ireland staying aligned to the EU single market rules that are ""essential for the avoidance of a hard border"". Sources told the BBC last month that Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her son, and Scottish Secretary David Mundellcould quit their rolesif a Brexit deal introduced different arrangements for Northern Ireland. Mr Mundell, who denied at the time that he had threatened to quit, said after Wednesday's cabinet meeting he was content to move on to the next stage on the basis that ""arrangements for Northern Ireland will not undermine the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK"". Before the cabinet meeting started, a letter from Mr Mundell and other Scottish Tory MPs was hand delivered to No 10warning against any backsliding on fishing rightsfor the UK after Brexit. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Reality Check: When is the crunch time? Brian Taylor: doing the maths on the meaningful vote The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has already confirmed that his party's 35 MPs would oppose the Brexit agreement in its current form. But Ms Sturgeon, the SNP leader, said rejecting the current proposals in the House of Commons would not make a no-deal Brexit inevitable. Instead, she insisted it would open the possibility for getting ""better options like full single market and customs union membership back on the table"". Please upgrade your browser And she said it would also allow those arguing for another referendum to be held on the Brexit terms - including the SNP - to make their case. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We must be striving for what is right for the country and my job is to strive for what is right for Scotland, not accepting bad deals. ""It is ironic is it not that the last two years the prime minister has told us no deal is better than a bad deal, and now she is arguing that we have got to accept a bad deal for fear of no deal. That is a false choice."" Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said the UK government and EU had negotiated a plan to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. He added: ""This shouldn't be about creating a new border between us and England. ""Nicola Sturgeon has spent months talking up the merits of the EU single market. She needs to explain why it is in Scotland's interests to fracture the UK internal market, as she seems to want to do. Scottish Secretary David Mundell (right) has warned rejecting the agreement could lead to an ""appalling"" no-deal outcome On Tuesday, Mr Blackford joined Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem Sir Vince Cable and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts in writing to the prime minister to seek assurances that MPs would be given a ""meaningful vote"" on the Brexit agreement. This would mean that amendments to be proposals can be tabled and voted on. Their joint letter stated: ""Recent interventions from government ministers have suggested that you and your government may seek to limit or constrain the process on the final vote, in an attempt to muzzle parliament.

Both parties held the discussions at the prime minister's office in the House of Commons. The meeting, which lasted around an hour, took place after the text ofthe draft withdrawal agreement,externalhad already been published. Earlier, Mr Wilson said: ""I think people will be appalled at her words."" The party's ten MPs prop up the Conservative government under the confidence-and-supply arrangement, signed in June 2017. Sinn FÃ©in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said she had an ""initial conversation"" with Mrs May, and that she would ""resume conversation"" with TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney on Thursday. Speaking earlier outside No 10 Downing Street, the prime minister said there had been a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" during a five-hour cabinet meeting. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar welcomed the draft agreement, stating that it ""protects the fundamental"" aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. He said the backstop was ""now fully spelt out"". ""Additional rules on goods will apply to Northern Ireland to ensure that there is no need for a border between north and south,"" he said in Dublin. ""We have also agreed a review mechanism for the backstop if a better solution is found. It [a decision to make changes to the backstop] can only be taken jointly by the UK and EU."" This video can not be played Irish prime minister Varadkar says he is pleased with draft Brexit deal Earlier on Wednesday, Mrs Foster said that she will ""not be led by the Irish government"" when coming to a view on the UK-EU draft Brexit text. She was speaking after the taoiseach said unionists should be assured that the text would not negatively impact the integrity of the UK. May in cabinet showdown over Brexit deal Brexit text 'agreed' in talks breakthrough Irish Brexit border a ""fictitious problem"" Mrs Foster had told reporters in the Commons, ahead of the text's publication: ""We're talking in a bit of a vacuum, we really do need to see that text."" ""We are concerned about the narrative that has built up around the prime minister's proposal,"" she added. ""We will make our own judgements, and we will certainly not be led by the Irish government who have been aggressive in all of this."" Mrs Foster said if Theresa May reneged on commitments she had made, there would be ""consequences"". The 585-pagedraft withdrawal agreement has now been published,external, alongside a shorter statement setting out what the UK and EU's future relations will look like. The detail relating to Northern Ireland starts on page 302. It addresses the Northern Ireland backstop - the insurance policy arrangement that aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations. The backstop within the agreed draft would avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. This has proven to be the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said agreement on the backstop would protect the Good Friday Agreement and respect the integrity of the UK as a whole. He said the backstop would only kick in if there was no better solution by the end of the transition period in 2020 and is ""not meant to be used"". This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? On Wednesday morning, Mr Varadkar appeared in DÃ¡il Ãireann (Irish parliament) to answer questions from opposition parties. He said he believed what the draft text included would not ""negatively impact"" the integrity of the UK. He said he recognised that ""for the unionist community this is quite a difficult time"". ""I know many unionists may be feeling vulnerable, isolated and many may be quite worried about what may be agreed in the coming days,"" he added. ""I want to say to them - the Good Friday Agreement will be protected - it includes a recognition of the fact we respect the territorial integrity of the UK and the principle of consent, that there will be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of people say so."" He said he was happy to have that written into any agreement as a legal guarantee. Mr Varadkar held a special meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the text with his cabinet. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""the big problem"" would be getting the draft deal ""through parliament"". ""The only people who are precipitating the break-up of the United Kingdom are the DUP,"" he added. ""It (the union) isn't under threat and I think talking that up has created a threat in itself,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Leader Robin Swann said it was ""absolutely crucial that we have had time to analyse all the documentation"". ""If the words in the draft withdrawal agreement confirm the speculation, this has been a monumental error of judgement on behalf of the DUP which will have a devastating long-term impact,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said people needed ""to be incredibly responsible"". ""Dramatising this as a constitutional question is extremely worrying and dangerous and indeed irresponsible and it's not just the DUP who are doing it, you have people like Boris Johnson last night doing it, talking about Dublin control,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens, who all campaigned to remain in the EU, are now expected to meet Mr Varadkar in Dublin on Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley pictured entering Downing Street for the special cabinet meeting to discuss the Brexit draft deal Both the UK and EU are committed to ensuring physical checks at the Irish border will not be reintroduced. But if a solution cannot be found as part of a wider deal, the EU insisted on a legally binding ""backstop"". Until Tuesday, EU and UK negotiators had each come up with their own proposals for the Northern Ireland backstop, but had been unable to agree on a way forward.

A senior Conservative told the BBC there could be a move to a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May, perhaps as soon as Thursday, although this has not been confirmed. Sources said many Brexiteer MPs were likely to submit letters to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for her to go. If 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) do this it would trigger a vote of no confidence. Meanwhile Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which supports Mrs May's government in key votes - warned of ""consequences"" if there is a deal that ""breaks up the United Kingdom"". Penny Mordaunt said nothing as she arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday The BBC's Norman Smith said the prime minister would seek to head off the threat of any resignations by telling her cabinet ministers that while not perfect, the agreement was as good as it can get. Downing Street, he added, were pointing to what they view as significant wins, including no separate customs border for Northern Ireland and an arbitration mechanism to ensure the UK can exit the proposed ""backstop"" customs plan. Just ahead of the cabinet meeting, all 13 Scottish Tory MPs, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell,signed a letter to the prime ministersaying they would not support a Brexit deal that prevents the UK from negotiating its own fishing quotas. Access and quotas ""cannot be included in the Future Economic Partnership"" and the UK must leave the Common Fisheries Policy at the end of 2020, they added. The draft withdrawal agreement addresses the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations that involves not having a physical border. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No deal: When planning doesn't cut it This has proven the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. The backstop within the agreed draft is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. However, some Brexiteers fear this will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years. The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. If the cabinet signs it off, the EU Commission is expected later to publish the details of the 500-page draft withdrawal agreement as well as the much shorter declaration on future economic and security relations. Ambassadors from the remaining 27 EU member states will discuss the possibility of organising an emergency summit later this month to sign off on it. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has signalled the summit could take place on 25 November. If this happens, the government will then face a battle to win Parliament's backing, in a vote the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December. Please upgrade your browser With some Tories vowing to vote against it and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which Mrs May relies on to win key Commons votes - also expressing concern, it is not clear which way the vote will go. Brexiteer Conservative MPs were first to criticise the agreement, based on leaks of it, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Peter Bone said the reported agreement would not ""deliver"" on what people voted for and risked ""losing the support of many Tory MPs and millions of voters across the country"". But Mrs May, who is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, said the agreement would leave the UK free to do its own trade deals while the customs union ""backstop"" would be temporary. And Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" the deal would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Pienaar: May's big gamble This video can not be played MPs react to reports about the draft text of a Brexit agreement Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson described the reported agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop as ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"", and said he would vote against it. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Newsnight he was so unhappy with the agreement he was considering calling on Mrs May to quit as PM. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today that from ""what we have heard... this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom and that is not something we can support"". And the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK was heading towards a Brexit that would ""cost jobs"" and urged MPs to ""think about your constituents' interests, think about jobs, think about prosperity"". But one of Mrs May's allies, former first secretary of state Damian Green, criticised ""hyperbole"" from people who had not read the document. And former Conservative leader Lord Hague urged the cabinet to ""stick together"" - saying the draft agreement contained a ""lot of compromises"" but would allow the UK to regain control of immigration, fishing and farming. By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler What's so striking about this draft Brexit deal the UK media and politicians are all abuzz about, is the marked lack of excitement and/or hysteria in EU circles. Contrary to the UK narrative, this is not viewed in Brussels as the back-against-the-wall, make-or-break moment. There's still some time to keep negotiating. EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the ""i""s, nor all the ""t""s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed. The thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board.

Cervical screening hit by 'appalling' blunder,"More than 40,000 women in England have not received information regarding cervical cancer screening after a failure to send out letters by the NHS. The errors were made between January and June. Around 4,000 of them were results of tests, the remainder were letters inviting them for screening or reminding them they were due. Between 150 and 200 of the test results that were not sent out were abnormal results. But it is thought their intended recipients should have received at least one notification from their GP or screening clinic - as women with abnormal results should be sent letters from two or three sources. 'What I wish people knew about my diabetes' Millions of women miss out on smear tests NHS England are checking this has happened and that abnormal results are being followed up properly with further testing. So far it has contacted nearly half of this group and says no harm has been caused. This video can not be played What happens during a smear test? The service is provided for NHS England by Capita. Around 4.5 million women aged 25 to 64 receive invitations for screening each year. Those aged 25 to 49 are offered screening every three years, with the older age groups invited every five years. The news comes just months after it emerged 174,000 women had not been invited for breast cancer screening after mistakes went undetected for years. Capita was not involved in that service. In comparison with the breast screening mistake, this problem has been spotted much more quickly. All those who did not receive an invite letter or reminder have been written to. It is believed 10,000 of them have already been tested. A spokesman for Capita said the company ""apologises"" for the mistake. He said the correct process for ""uploading, organising and checking"" had not been followed and appropriate disciplinary action was being taken. The senior manager responsible for the contract has left the company. NHS England said there was no current evidence any woman had been harmed and the priority now was to ensure everyone affected was contacted. But Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said the situation was ""frankly appalling"". ""We know that, because of the nature of this procedure, many patients are already reluctant to attend these appointments, and therefore reminder letters are crucial. ""Incidents like this, therefore, will hardly inspire confidence in the system and risk even fewer women getting checked,"" he said. Dr Vautrey said Capita's handling of the service had been ""nothing short of shambolic"" and called for the firm to be stripped of the contract.

Kuenssberg: What next?,"What do they do now? The cabinet is not going to like the draft agreement that they'll have to decide on. Many of them probably won't like it one little bit. Number 10 says tonight that they have managed to remove the idea of a ""backstop to the backstop"". But there is, in the agreement, the potential for a different regime for Northern Ireland. Sources close to the process admit privately that they haven't managed to remove the controversy. Brexit text agreed in talks breakthrough How could they when for months, the difficulties of the conundrums have been plain for all to see. Northern Ireland will, according to one insider familiar with the contents, under the backstop essentially be in the single market and therefore under the rules of the EU courts and the Commission. The DUP's fury is already obvious tonight and that's even before they have seen that detail. But it's suggested that the final draft is worse for them than the speculation that had already made them fume. Having come this far however, it doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. The eruption of immediate resistance from Brexiteers on Tuesday night was an immediate display of how hard it might be. And Tories tempted by another referendum may be swayed by the enthusiasm the small number of their colleagues who are campaigning for one seem to be gaining. So if the final vote in Parliament were tomorrow it's extremely hard to see how the government would win the day. But so much could happen between now and then. Government ministers and whips will do everything they can to change the dynamic. To make the deal look like a sensible but definite triumph, to paint the alternatives as too scary to contemplate. And frankly, when it comes to it, many MPs who might be tempted to rebel just would dearly love the whole thing to be done. So it's just not possible yet to make the final judgement that some members of the cabinet fear tonight - that the deal as it stands just won't get the numbers in Parliament. We cannot put ourselves yet into the Parliamentary moment that will come in a few weeks' time. In putting the agreement in front of her cabinet, Theresa May plainly believes that forging ahead with a plan that won't please everyone is a risk worth taking. Her colleagues will decide at 2pm on Wednesday if she will have that chance.

Adler: EU gives May space,"Will Theresa May have something to smile about after Wednesday's cabinet meeting? What's so striking about this draft Brexit deal the UK media and politicians are all abuzz about, is the marked lack of excitement and/or hysteria in EU circles. Contrary to the UK narrative, this is not viewed in Brussels as the back-against-the-wall, make-or-break moment. There's still some time to keep negotiating. EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the ""i""s, nor all the ""t""s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed. The thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board. Kuenssberg: Agreement is in Downing Street's grasp A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Pienaar: May's big gamble As I've mentioned before, the EU is clearly more relaxed about timing - as long as a deal is signed before March - than Theresa May at this stage. You get the feeling that the current sense of pressure and urgency is designed to help the UK prime minister at home. Storm clouds surrounded her once again last weekend, with cabinet minister Jo Johnson resigning and mutterings of potential mutiny from Brexiteer and Remainer conservative MPs, never mind the Labour Party and the DUP plotting over the eventual Brexit parliamentary vote. Brexit opponents have recently staged a series of rallies across Britain It looked (once again) like the whole thing could unravel on the UK side. Brussels has repeatedly told Mrs May that - as long as they could agree on the details of a deal amongst themselves - the EU would help her present it however she wished in order to help her sell the package back home. I think now is one of those moments, which would explain why Brussels kept so silent on Tuesday night - such a politically sensitive night in the UK. One of my high-level EU contacts even sent me an emoji with a closed zip instead of a mouth - to indicate that he couldn't talk. These are hours for Downing Street to spin. This is not to say that the EU is completely chilled about the appearance of a draft Brexit deal - played down to me by a Brussels contact as a ""mutual understanding"" between EU and UK negotiators. That's a reminder that this is a technical draft - not yet a political agreement. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? While all eyes on Wednesday will be on Number 10 Downing Street and the reaction of the UK cabinet, the governments of all 27 EU countries and the European parliament also want to get their eyes and their mitts on all 500 pages of the document ASAP. Of key interest to them: the compromise wording over the backstop, that insurance policy for the Irish border. They, and Ireland in particular, will be relieved to see something Brexiteers will not like at all - that the EU will decide alongside the UK if and when the backstop arrangements need to kick in and also when they can be terminated and superseded by a new EU-UK trade deal. They will also note that the all-UK customs union with the EU outlined as part of the backstop will be deeper with Northern Ireland than with the rest of the UK. This will be hard for the DUP to swallow. More important to EU heavyweights France and Germany - and others that trade closely with the UK like Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands - will be to examine the small print of the backstop customs union to ensure the UK would have no competitive advantage over them. I've spoken to diplomats who worry the European Commission was in such a hurry to get this draft Brexit deal document ready to Theresa May's timetable, that the priorities of some EU member states may have been overlooked. France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain for example won't be happy that fishing rights in UK waters do not seem to appear in the text. European capitals want a minimum of seven to 10 days to pore over the draft with a fine-tooth comb. So, could there still be a special Brexit deal summit called this month as Theresa May so hopes? It's not impossible - 25 November is being spoken about as a potential date. Later on Wednesday as the UK cabinet meets in London, the 27 EU ambassadors will gather in Brussels. To be discussed: the draft Brexit deal, the possibility of a November summit and - as a clear indication of the current uncertainty - ongoing contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.

PM seeks backing over BrexitThe prime minister is expected to make a statement after the meeting ends.,"A crucial cabinet meeting where Theresa May's most senior ministers debated the draft EU withdrawal agreement has ended. The meeting inside 10 Downing Street lasted for five hours. The prime minister is expected to make a statement shortly, with the EU due to publish the withdrawal documents if it gets the green light from London. Some Tory MPs and opposition parties have already criticised what the agreement is thought to contain. Earlier Mrs May said it would allow the UK government to take back control of borders, laws and money. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the UK would be stuck in an ""indefinite half-way house without any real say"" over the rules. Live updates: Brexit negotiations latest A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Brexit text no threat to NI, says Irish PM Brexit deal bad for Scotland - Sturgeon Criticism of the draft agreement has focused on ways to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. Some Conservative Brexiteers are angry, claiming it could mean the UK is tied to EU rules for years to come. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A senior Conservative told the BBC there could be a move to a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May, perhaps as soon as Thursday, although this has not been confirmed. Sources said many Brexiteer MPs were likely to submit letters to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for her to go. If 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) do this it would trigger a vote of no confidence. Meanwhile Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which supports Mrs May's government in key votes - warned of ""consequences"" if there is a deal that ""breaks up the United Kingdom"". Penny Mordaunt said nothing as she arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday The BBC's Norman Smith said the prime minister would seek to head off the threat of any resignations by telling her cabinet ministers that while not perfect, the agreement was as good as it can get. Downing Street, he added, were pointing to what they view as significant wins, including no separate customs border for Northern Ireland and an arbitration mechanism to ensure the UK can exit the proposed ""backstop"" customs plan. Just ahead of the cabinet meeting, all 13 Scottish Tory MPs, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell,signed a letter to the prime ministersaying they would not support a Brexit deal that prevents the UK from negotiating its own fishing quotas. Access and quotas ""cannot be included in the Future Economic Partnership"" and the UK must leave the Common Fisheries Policy at the end of 2020, they added. The draft withdrawal agreement addresses the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations that involves not having a physical border. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No deal: When planning doesn't cut it This has proven the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. The backstop within the agreed draft is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. However, some Brexiteers fear this will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years. The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. If the cabinet signs it off, the EU Commission is expected later to publish the details of the 500-page draft withdrawal agreement as well as the much shorter declaration on future economic and security relations. Ambassadors from the remaining 27 EU member states will discuss the possibility of organising an emergency summit later this month to sign off on it. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has signalled the summit could take place on 25 November. If this happens, the government will then face a battle to win Parliament's backing, in a vote the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December. Please upgrade your browser With some Tories vowing to vote against it and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which Mrs May relies on to win key Commons votes - also expressing concern, it is not clear which way the vote will go. Brexiteer Conservative MPs were first to criticise the agreement, based on leaks of it, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Peter Bone said the reported agreement would not ""deliver"" on what people voted for and risked ""losing the support of many Tory MPs and millions of voters across the country"". But Mrs May, who is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, said the agreement would leave the UK free to do its own trade deals while the customs union ""backstop"" would be temporary. And Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" the deal would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Pienaar: May's big gamble This video can not be played MPs react to reports about the draft text of a Brexit agreement Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson described the reported agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop as ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"", and said he would vote against it. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Newsnight he was so unhappy with the agreement he was considering calling on Mrs May to quit as PM. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today that from ""what we have heard... this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom and that is not something we can support"". And the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK was heading towards a Brexit that would ""cost jobs"" and urged MPs to ""think about your constituents' interests, think about jobs, think about prosperity"". But one of Mrs May's allies, former first secretary of state Damian Green, criticised ""hyperbole"" from people who had not read the document. And former Conservative leader Lord Hague urged the cabinet to ""stick together"" - saying the draft agreement contained a ""lot of compromises"" but would allow the UK to regain control of immigration, fishing and farming. By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler What's so striking about this draft Brexit deal the UK media and politicians are all abuzz about, is the marked lack of excitement and/or hysteria in EU circles. Contrary to the UK narrative, this is not viewed in Brussels as the back-against-the-wall, make-or-break moment. There's still some time to keep negotiating. EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the ""i""s, nor all the ""t""s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed. The thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board.

Beverley Sister Babs dies aged 91,"The Beverley Sisters - Teddie, Joy and Babs - in 1958 Babs Beverley, one of the twins in the Beverley Sisters, has died aged 91. Her death, along with that of her older sister Joy in 2015, leaves Teddie Beverley as the sole surviving member of the vocal harmony trio. Born Babette Chinery in 1927, Babs was brought up with her siblings in Bethnal Green, east London. The group were one of the most popular acts of the 1950s and '60s, enjoying chart success with such records as I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. Their other hits included Little Drummer Boy, Bye Bye Love and the Irving Berlin standard Sisters. They had their own BBC TV show in the 1950s and were made MBEs in 2006. The Beverley Sisters at the National Portrait Gallery in 2006 The group effectively retired after Joy married Billy Wright, then captain of the England football team, in 1958. But they reunited in the 1980s and entered the Guinness Book of Records in 2002 as the world's longest surviving vocal group without a line-up change. Agent Johnny Mans said Babs was diagnosed with cancer in 2013 and had been living in a care home in Brighton. ""She still looked as gorgeous as ever,"" he told BBC News. ""She will be sadly missed because they were legends in their own lifetime and people will still remember them."" Firm favourites of the late Queen Mother, Britain's answer to the Andrews Sisters were inseparable, dressed alike and had identical blonde hairdos. The girls shared a bed until they were teenagers and often finished each other's sentences - making it even harder to tell them apart. The sisters, pictured here in 1966, always wore identical clothing Born to George and Victoria Beverley, aka music hall duo Coram and Mills, the sisters initially had modest ambitions. They all trained as typists and Babs had hopes of becoming a policewoman. But that all changed when they secured a contract to become ""Bonnie Babies"" in an advertising campaign for bedtime drink Ovaltine. With support from bandleader Glenn Miller, they became professional singers, renowned for their close harmonies and glamorous lifestyles. After the war, the siblings were given their own TV show, initially called Three Little Girls In View and later retitled Those Beverley Sisters. It ran for seven years. In 1951, the trio signed a recording contract with Columbia Records that helped them become the highest paid female act in the UK. Babs married Scottish dentist James Mitchell in 1963 but the marriage did not last. She died on 28 October leaving no children,according to the Telegraph,external.

Feted Zimbabwe women rangers denied UK visas,"This video can not be played Zimbabwe women's anti-poaching group protecting elephants The UK's decision to deny visas for two pioneering female anti-poaching rangers to attend an awards ceremony has been criticised by organisers. Zimbabwean Nyaradzo Hoto risks her life every day to protect elephants from ivory poachers in an all-female anti-poaching unit. She and a colleague were due to accept an award for the team on 3 November. But Ms Hoto's trip, her first outside Zimbabwe, was called off after visitor visa applications were rejected. ""I haven't told my daughter yet. I don't want to disappoint her, she was so proud of me,"" the 26-year-old whispers down the phone. ""It would have been my first time on a plane. She said 'I wish you good luck Mummy!'"" Nyaradzo Hoto comes ""from a tough background"" Zimbabwe International Women Awards (Ziwa) created the Founder's Award specifically to honour the unit known as Akashinga, which means the brave ones in Shona.

Like many Akashinga women, Ms Hoto is a domestic abuse survivor. She says her daughter Tariro tells her how proud she is now that her mum protects wildlife. ""I'm someone from a tough background, so I'm working hard to fill in the potholes of my life,"" the star ranger, who featured in a BBC short documentary, explains. ""I couldn't understand the rejection, it's not fair."" Akashinga women are trained to be armed soldiers, patrolling and protecting an area in the Lower Zambezi Valley, an ecosystem which is home to some 11,000 elephants.

""Women in rural Africa are often the most oppressed demographic. They're given the least amount of opportunity, it's very hard for them to rise up and acquire property and status."" The group of British women who founded Ziwa say they were gutted when Ms Hoto and Ms Chigumbura were denied their visas. ""The awards are there to change the narrative of African women,"" Rhoda Molife, one of the founders of Ziwa and a former doctor in the UK's National Health Service, told the BBC.

"'Daddy, donÃ¢ÂÂt worry, itÃ¢ÂÂs just us two now'","This video can not be played Rachael Bland's husband on how their son has reacted to his mum's death. The husband of BBC presenter Rachael Bland has told how their three-year-old son Freddie reassured him in the days after her death from breast cancer. The 40-year-old BBC Radio 5 Live broadcaster, who co-hosted podcast You, Me and the Big C, died in September. In his first interview since her death, Steve Bland said on one occasion he started crying because he was upset he had lost his temper with his son. His son told him: ""Daddy, don't worry, it's just us two now. It'll be OK."" Speaking to Lauren Mahon and Deborah James, the co-presenters of the award-winning podcast about living with cancer, Mr Bland said neither he nor his wife realised ""just how tough"" her final days would be. He said the days leading up to, and following her death, had been ""nothing like you imagine"", as he had not realised what would happen physically as she ""was getting more and more sick"". It is the first You, Me and the Big C podcast since Rachael died ""I didn't feel like anyone really actually explained how hard and how demanding that last four or five days were going to be,"" he said. ""I might be wrong but I just feel that if Rachael had known how hard it was going to be she might have wanted to go into a hospice or something else. I just don't know that either of us understood just how tough those last days were going to be - how demanding on her it was, only having me looking after her, and how demanding it was on me."" The podcast, released on Wednesday, is the first recorded since her death. He said it was difficult reconciling the Rachael being shown in the ""media storm"" after her death with the person he knew - although it had been comforting too. ""It was very hard because my Rachael wasn't the Rachael who did the podcast, wasn't the Rachael on the TV, wasn't the Rachael on the radio,"" he said. ""My Rachael was the one who sat next to me on the sofa watching crappy TV. You know, who shouted to get a glass of wine or whatever."" Steve Bland said there had been ""plenty of challenges"" since his wife's death He said he found it quite hard in the day or two after his wife died ""to remember what she sounded like just normally...,and even what she looked like just sitting next to me on the sofa"". ""It was probably three or four days when it had died down a little bit and the storm had subsided somewhat that those memories started coming back and it was a bit of a crash."" He admitted there were times he had lost his temper with his son where he wouldn't have done normally - leading to the conversation with Freddie where he was told it would be OK. Rachael Bland (centre) with her podcast co-hosts Deborah James and Lauren Mahon ""I shouted at him because he was being a right pain, (I was) trying to get him dressed. I started crying because it really upset me that I'd shouted at him,"" he explained. ""And he just turned to me and he said, 'Daddy, are you crying because of Mummy?' and I said 'Yes'. And he said, 'Daddy, don't worry, it's just us two now. It'll be OK'."" He said Freddie was ""a bit young really to understand even on a very base level what's happened"", but added: ""He's just full of energy, full of joy, full of life, keeping us busy - he's fantastic. You can't look at him without seeing Rachael either so it's a little bit of her all the time just next to me."" Asked how he is coping since his wife died, Mr Bland said: ""I'm OK. Good days and bad days, as you can imagine. Plenty of challenges. You don't really know how you're going to be when something like this happens.""

Hope for mountain gorilla and fin whale,"Mountain gorilla: From critically endangered to endangered Conservation efforts appear to be paying off for some of the world's most charismatic animals, according to new assessments for the extinction Red List. Prospects look better for the mountain gorilla, after years of conservation measures, including anti-poaching and veterinary patrols. And numbers of two large whales are recovering, following hunting bans. However, other flora and fauna is declining. Species getting closer to extinction include several types of fish, a globally important timber tree, and one of the world's largest and smelliest flowers. The fin whale, western gray whale, mountain gorilla and Rothschild's giraffe are among the animals where numbers are rising. The latest assessments by theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN,externalcome as governments convene in Egypt for theConvention on Biological Diversity.,external What other animals are at risk? IUCN Director General, Inger Andersen, said the recoveries we are seeing illustrate the power of conservation action. ""These conservation successes are proof that the ambitious, collaborative efforts of governments, business and civil society could turn back the tide of species loss,"" she said. Almost 100,000 plants and animals have now been evaluated for extinction threats by the IUCN. Of these, around a quarter are on the edge of extinction. The ""winners"" in the new Red List include: There were around 600 mountain gorillas left in the wild in 2008; but numbers have now risen to over 1,000 after intensive conservation efforts. These include anti-poaching patrols and vets trained to give care to gorillas in the wild. The gorilla is restricted to protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Threats remain, including poaching, civil unrest and diseases passed on by humans. But while mountain gorillas are increasing in number, the great ape remains endangered. Dr Liz Williamson of the IUCN primate specialist group said conservation action must continue. ""Coordinated efforts through a regional action plan and fully implementing IUCN Best Practice guidelines for great ape tourism and disease prevention, which recommend limiting numbers of tourists and preventing any close contact with humans, are critical to ensuring a future for the mountain gorilla,"" she said. Fin whale: From endangered to vulnerable Populations of this large whale - one of the biggest in the ocean - are on the rise, and have roughly doubled since the 1970s.  There are now estimated to be 100,000 adults. This whale too is reaping the benefits of bans on commercial whaling. Numbers are starting to rise, albeit more slowly. However, this success could be derailed by threats from oil and gas development and commercial fisheries. Western Gray Whale: From critically endangered to endangered Randall Reeves of the IUCN cetacean specialist group said it is a relief to see populations of both whales on the rise, but conservation efforts must continue. He told BBC News: ""Large whales are, for the most part, doing pretty well - they show that if you stop killing them, they can recover. Not all populations of large whales are recovering - some of them were brought so low that they still may disappear."" The ""losers"" in the new Red List include: Blooming 'corpse flower': Endangered in the wild Nicknamed the corpse flower, one of the world's largest and smelliest flowers has been assessed for the first time. It is found in the wild only on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. Only about 1,000 plants remain in the wild. It is under threat from logging and the clearing of forest for oil palm plantations. Illegal logging is threatening the survival of this globally important timber tree, found in West and Central Africa. Pterocarpus erinaceus: A type of African rosewood used in the timber trade Fifty-four fish species from two important fisheries are threatened by unsustainable fishing. They include Malawi's most economically valuable fish, the chambo, and more than 100 types of grouper, a fish found widely around the world. Follow Helen on Twitter,external.

""Given these weapons, like the crossbow, used to kill my constituent are readily for sale online, can I urge the Prime Minister to urgently and seriously look at expanding the Offensive Weapons Bill so that we can toughen the scope of the laws governing the sale, the possession and the use of these deadly weapons."" Mrs May responded by saying crossbows were ""subject to strict controls"", but the government would ""consider the risk to public safety and whether further measures are needed"". The Met Police said the newborn baby remains in hospital in a ""stable condition"" Offers of help for Mrs Muhammad's family, including a pledge to cover funeral costs, have flooded in from the community.

"'Daddy, donât worry, itâs just us two now'","This video can not be played Rachael Bland's husband on how their son has reacted to his mum's death. The husband of BBC presenter Rachael Bland has told how their three-year-old son Freddie reassured him in the days after her death from breast cancer. The 40-year-old BBC Radio 5 Live broadcaster, who co-hosted podcast You, Me and the Big C, died in September. In his first interview since her death, Steve Bland said on one occasion he started crying because he was upset he had lost his temper with his son. His son told him: ""Daddy, don't worry, it's just us two now. It'll be OK."" Speaking to Lauren Mahon and Deborah James, the co-presenters of the award-winning podcast about living with cancer, Mr Bland said neither he nor his wife realised ""just how tough"" her final days would be. He said the days leading up to, and following her death, had been ""nothing like you imagine"", as he had not realised what would happen physically as she ""was getting more and more sick"". It is the first You, Me and the Big C podcast since Rachael died ""I didn't feel like anyone really actually explained how hard and how demanding that last four or five days were going to be,"" he said. ""I might be wrong but I just feel that if Rachael had known how hard it was going to be she might have wanted to go into a hospice or something else. I just don't know that either of us understood just how tough those last days were going to be - how demanding on her it was, only having me looking after her, and how demanding it was on me."" The podcast, released on Wednesday, is the first recorded since her death. He said it was difficult reconciling the Rachael being shown in the ""media storm"" after her death with the person he knew - although it had been comforting too. ""It was very hard because my Rachael wasn't the Rachael who did the podcast, wasn't the Rachael on the TV, wasn't the Rachael on the radio,"" he said. ""My Rachael was the one who sat next to me on the sofa watching crappy TV. You know, who shouted to get a glass of wine or whatever."" Steve Bland said there had been ""plenty of challenges"" since his wife's death He said he found it quite hard in the day or two after his wife died ""to remember what she sounded like just normally...,and even what she looked like just sitting next to me on the sofa"". ""It was probably three or four days when it had died down a little bit and the storm had subsided somewhat that those memories started coming back and it was a bit of a crash."" He admitted there were times he had lost his temper with his son where he wouldn't have done normally - leading to the conversation with Freddie where he was told it would be OK. Rachael Bland (centre) with her podcast co-hosts Deborah James and Lauren Mahon ""I shouted at him because he was being a right pain, (I was) trying to get him dressed. I started crying because it really upset me that I'd shouted at him,"" he explained. ""And he just turned to me and he said, 'Daddy, are you crying because of Mummy?' and I said 'Yes'. And he said, 'Daddy, don't worry, it's just us two now. It'll be OK'."" He said Freddie was ""a bit young really to understand even on a very base level what's happened"", but added: ""He's just full of energy, full of joy, full of life, keeping us busy - he's fantastic. You can't look at him without seeing Rachael either so it's a little bit of her all the time just next to me."" Asked how he is coping since his wife died, Mr Bland said: ""I'm OK. Good days and bad days, as you can imagine. Plenty of challenges. You don't really know how you're going to be when something like this happens.""

Brexit deal bad for Scotland - Sturgeon,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""This, from what I know of it, is not a good deal for Scotland."" Nicola Sturgeon has claimed that the draft Brexit agreement between the UK and EU would be bad for Scotland as her party pledged to oppose the deal. Scotland's first minister said the proposals would take Scotland out of the single market while Northern Ireland in effect stays in. This would have a ""devastating"" impact on jobs and investment in Scotland, she insisted. Mrs May has won cabinet backing for the deal after a five-hour meeting. But her Brexit deal proposals, which have now beenpublished,,externalare facing strong opposition from senior Brexiteers and some Remain supporters. Cabinet backs draft agreement Scots Tories warn over Brexit fishing deal Live Updates: Brexit negotiations latest A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Theresa May said there had been a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" by cabinet members on the draft agreement. Speaking outside Number 10, she said: ""I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement was the best that could be negotiated and it was for the cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks."" But Ms Sturgeon said it was obvious that the prime minister could ""barely unite her cabinet on this deal"" and that she would struggle to get a majority for it in the House of Commons. ""In these circumstances it is more important than ever that we are not faced with a false choice between a bad deal and no deal,"" she said. ""No one should be effectively blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire. ""This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards. ""If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament then the UK government must return to the negotiating table to secure a better one. ""Our bottom line - short of continued EU membership - is continued, permanent membership of the single market and customs union."" Ms Sturgeon later tweeted that she had received a phone call from Mrs May and had pointed out that the draft document makes no mention of Scotland. Allow Twitter content?

The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May's minority Conservative government, has warned that the dealcould lead to the break-up of the United Kingdomif it is accepted by MPs. The major sticking point in the negotiations between the UK and EU has been over the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic if the EU and UK fail to agree a deal on future trading relations. The prime minister managed to persuade her cabinet to back the proposals on Wednesday afternoon The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said the draft agreement involved Northern Ireland staying aligned to the EU single market rules that are ""essential for the avoidance of a hard border"". Sources told the BBC last month that Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her son, and Scottish Secretary David Mundellcould quit their rolesif a Brexit deal introduced different arrangements for Northern Ireland. Mr Mundell, who denied at the time that he had threatened to quit, said after Wednesday's cabinet meeting he was content to move on to the next stage on the basis that ""arrangements for Northern Ireland will not undermine the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK"". Before the cabinet meeting started, a letter from Mr Mundell and other Scottish Tory MPs was hand delivered to No 10warning against any backsliding on fishing rightsfor the UK after Brexit. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Reality Check: When is the crunch time? Brian Taylor: doing the maths on the meaningful vote The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has already confirmed that his party's 35 MPs would oppose the Brexit agreement in its current form. But Ms Sturgeon, the SNP leader, said rejecting the current proposals in the House of Commons would not make a no-deal Brexit inevitable. Instead, she insisted it would open the possibility for getting ""better options like full single market and customs union membership back on the table"". Please upgrade your browser And she said it would also allow those arguing for another referendum to be held on the Brexit terms - including the SNP - to make their case. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We must be striving for what is right for the country and my job is to strive for what is right for Scotland, not accepting bad deals. ""It is ironic is it not that the last two years the prime minister has told us no deal is better than a bad deal, and now she is arguing that we have got to accept a bad deal for fear of no deal. That is a false choice."" Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said the UK government and EU had negotiated a plan to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. He added: ""This shouldn't be about creating a new border between us and England. ""Nicola Sturgeon has spent months talking up the merits of the EU single market. She needs to explain why it is in Scotland's interests to fracture the UK internal market, as she seems to want to do. Scottish Secretary David Mundell (right) has warned rejecting the agreement could lead to an ""appalling"" no-deal outcome On Tuesday, Mr Blackford joined Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem Sir Vince Cable and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts in writing to the prime minister to seek assurances that MPs would be given a ""meaningful vote"" on the Brexit agreement. This would mean that amendments to be proposals can be tabled and voted on. Their joint letter stated: ""Recent interventions from government ministers have suggested that you and your government may seek to limit or constrain the process on the final vote, in an attempt to muzzle parliament. ""We want to be clear that this would be wholly unacceptable.""

"Thai gate graffiti Briton spared jail termLee Furlong, from Liverpool, faced up to ten years in a Thai jail for defacing the landmark.Liverpool","The graffiti was scrawled on the Tha Phae Gate in the city of Chiang Mai A British tourist who spray-painted his name on a Thai landmark has been spared jail. Lee Furlong admitted defacing Tha Phae Gate in the city of Chiang Mai, police said, an offence which could have seen him imprisoned for 10 years. But the 23-year-old from Liverpool was instead fined 200,000 Thai baht (Â£4,700). Mr Furlong admitted to the crime, and claimed he was a ""little bit drunk"" at the time, police said. The BBC understands Mr Furlong is free to return to the UK. Thai media published a video which showed a man spraying what appeared to be ""Scouser Lee"" on the gate. A Canadian woman, Brittney Schneider, was also freed after she allegedly sprayed her first initial on the gate, police added. Brittney Schneider and Lee Furlong were taken back to the scene by police Supt Teerasak Sriprasert, a local police chief in Chiang Mai, said last month that Furlong and Schneider would face ""no more than 10 years' jail [and/or] a fine of no more than a million baht (about Â£23,400)"". But he said that judges overseeing the trial this week ""agreed to give them a chance and gave them a two-year parole instead"", along with the reduced fine. The structure that was defaced by Furlong and Schneider is one of five historical gates in the city, and parts of it date back to the 13th Century. Thai media reported that CCTV from a nearby cafe showed four people approaching the gate in the early hours of 18 October. Two of them approached the wall, and one began to spray it. Furlong and Schneider were arrested shortly after at their guesthouse, and taken on a re-enactment, according to Thai police. The other two people shown in the video were not arrested. Chiang Mai is Thailand's fourth-largest city and tourists can visit the historic walled parts of the city.

Red carpets cancelled after wildfires,"Red carpets at Hollywood screenings of new films starring Nicole Kidman and Viola Davis have been cancelled as wildfires rage in California. Stars were expected to step out before screenings of movies including Davis's Widows and Kidman's Destroyer at the American Film Institute's AFI Fest. But the glitzy red carpet walks were called off out of respect to those affected by the fires. The official death toll has risen to 48, with dozens of people missing. Annapurna Pictures, which is distributing Destroyer, said the film-makers, cast and crew ""express their deepest condolences to the victims and those who have been affected and are extremely grateful to all who have risked their lives in responding"". 20th Century Fox also cancelled its event for Widows, directed by Oscar-winner Steve McQueen.

Lion Air fiancÃÂ©e in wedding photos alone,"Intan Syari says she's fulfilling her partner's last wish An Indonesian woman whose fiancÃ© was on a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea has gone ahead with her wedding pictures alone. Intan Syari and Rio Nanda Pratama were due to get married on 11 November. But Mr Pratama died as he was coming home for the wedding whenLion Air flight JT 610 crashed on 29 October shortly after taking off from Jakarta. Ms Syari said she wanted to fulfil his last wish, and posed for photos wearing her white gown and wedding ring. ""Even though I feel grief that I cannot describe, I still have to smile for you,"" the young woman wrote on Instagram. ""I cannot be sad but should be strong like you always told me to be."" She said that before he'd left for the flight, Mr Pratama had joked that should he not return in time she should take the pictures and send them to him. The plane was carrying 189 people from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang; there were no survivors of the crash and the fuselage of the Boeing 737 has not been found yet. The couple had chosen the gown together In earlier posts on her Instagram page, Ms Syari wrote that she'd known her fiancÃ©e for 13 years, describing him as her ""first love"". Social media identifies mystery crash couple Images from the Lion Air plane crash How could a brand new plane crash? The photographer who took the pictures also posted some of them online, explaining the story behind them. The couple had known each other since middle school, she wrote, and explained how they had decided on the clothes for the wedding and the photoshoot just a few weeks before the crash. Mr Pratama was identified by his fingerprints on 6 November - his funeral was held two days later. The couple's wedding planner, Sheila Pebriana, said Ms Syari told her of her fiancÃ©'s wishes on the day of the funeral. ""He told her that in case he didn't come home, Intan should continue with the plan,"" Ms Pebriana told BBC Indonesian's Famega Syavira. ""We tried to talk and make jokes, like it's just a normal day. But we tried so hard not to talk about the wedding, or about Rio. If any of us felt sad we hid our tears from Intan."" She said Ms Syari had been very strong and had kept her tears in. ""But then she video-called Rio's mom. After that Intan couldn't hold them in any more. She said: 'We were supposed to do this together, there's supposed to be Rio here.' And she cried - all of us cried too."" Rio Nanda Pratama and Intan Syari had known each other for 13 years Mr Pratama, a medical doctor, had been required to attend a seminar in Jakarta and had joked about what his fiancÃ©e would do if he was delayed.

UK inflation holds steady at 2.4%,"The price of milk has fallen, as has that of other dairy items The UK inflation rate remained steady at 2.4% in October, confounding analyst expectations of a rise to 2.5%. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figure included falls in food and clothing costs, but rising utility bills and petrol prices, said the ONS. The inflation figure comes a day after data showed thatwages were rising by 3.2%- the fastest pace in nearly a decade. Core inflation also held steady at 1.9% in October. That figure strips out the out the effects of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices. Inflation hit a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, as the inflationary effect of sterling's decline after the June 2016 Brexit vote hit its peak. However, it is still above the Bank of England's 2% target. The ONS's head of inflation, Michael Hardie, said: ""Prices paid by consumers continued to rise at a steady rate, with falls in food and clothing offset by rising utility bills and petrol, as crude [oil] prices continued to rise."" The Bank of England expects inflation will drift lower, but expects to have to raise interest rates in coming years to keep inflation at or near its target figure. Food prices cooled off. The cost of oils and fats dropped by 6.3% compared with the previous month, while milk, cheese and eggs prices were down 1.4%. Overall food and non-alcoholic drink prices dropped by 0.2% in October. Clothing and footwear also dipped by 0.5%. But gas and electricity prices both jumped by 2%, while liquid fuels soared by 7.2%. Looking at the latest date, for manufacturers, the cost of raw materials was 10% higher than in October 2017. And manufacturers increased the prices they charged by 3.3% year-on-year compared with 3.1% the previous month. The ONS said house prices in September rose by an annual 3.5% against 3.1% in August. But prices in London fell for a third month running, down by 0.3%. Analysis by economics correspondent Andy Verity There may not have been a change in the inflation rate, but there has been a change in expectations regarding when interest rates are likely to rise. In the City, the betting now is that the next upward move by the Bank of England is more likely than not to come as early as next May. That would take the official rate to the giddy heights of 1%. But is by no means obvious that rates will have to rise soon to tame inflation. If you strip out volatile items like food and fuel, so-called ""core inflation"" remains subdued at 1.9%. Even though wages are rising more strongly, there's little sign that prices are rising to compensate for those higher costs - rather, competition is holding prices down. Then again, the Bank of England has made no secret of its desire to ""normalise"" rates, so the markets may be right. According to Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: ""Brexit is still the elephant in the room when it comes to the future path of inflation, and consequently of monetary policy. ""That's because the pound now waxes and wanes with the Brexit negotiations, and that has a big impact on how much UK consumers pay for imported goods.

Lion Air fiancÃ©e in wedding photos alone,"Intan Syari says she's fulfilling her partner's last wish An Indonesian woman whose fiancÃ© was on a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea has gone ahead with her wedding pictures alone. Intan Syari and Rio Nanda Pratama were due to get married on 11 November. But Mr Pratama died as he was coming home for the wedding whenLion Air flight JT 610 crashed on 29 October shortly after taking off from Jakarta. Ms Syari said she wanted to fulfil his last wish, and posed for photos wearing her white gown and wedding ring. ""Even though I feel grief that I cannot describe, I still have to smile for you,"" the young woman wrote on Instagram. ""I cannot be sad but should be strong like you always told me to be."" She said that before he'd left for the flight, Mr Pratama had joked that should he not return in time she should take the pictures and send them to him. The plane was carrying 189 people from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang; there were no survivors of the crash and the fuselage of the Boeing 737 has not been found yet. The couple had chosen the gown together In earlier posts on her Instagram page, Ms Syari wrote that she'd known her fiancÃ©e for 13 years, describing him as her ""first love"". Social media identifies mystery crash couple Images from the Lion Air plane crash How could a brand new plane crash? The photographer who took the pictures also posted some of them online, explaining the story behind them. The couple had known each other since middle school, she wrote, and explained how they had decided on the clothes for the wedding and the photoshoot just a few weeks before the crash. Mr Pratama was identified by his fingerprints on 6 November - his funeral was held two days later. The couple's wedding planner, Sheila Pebriana, said Ms Syari told her of her fiancÃ©'s wishes on the day of the funeral. ""He told her that in case he didn't come home, Intan should continue with the plan,"" Ms Pebriana told BBC Indonesian's Famega Syavira. ""We tried to talk and make jokes, like it's just a normal day. But we tried so hard not to talk about the wedding, or about Rio. If any of us felt sad we hid our tears from Intan."" She said Ms Syari had been very strong and had kept her tears in. ""But then she video-called Rio's mom. After that Intan couldn't hold them in any more. She said: 'We were supposed to do this together, there's supposed to be Rio here.' And she cried - all of us cried too."" Rio Nanda Pratama and Intan Syari had known each other for 13 years Mr Pratama, a medical doctor, had been required to attend a seminar in Jakarta and had joked about what his fiancÃ©e would do if he was delayed. ""If I don't return by 11 November, you should still wear your wedding gown that I chose for you,"" the photographer quotes him as saying on her Instagram account.

'Life-changing' diabetes tech for thousands,"The glucose monitoring device works via a sensor attached to the skin, allowing people to check their blood sugar levels Wearable glucose monitors will be made available to tens of thousands more people with type 1 diabetes from April 2019, NHS England has announced. Its decision comes after an investigation found patients in some areas of the country were being denied access to the device. It reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and helps people with diabetes to manage their condition. Diabetes charities called the change of policy a huge step forward. In England, around 300,000 people have type 1 diabetes. 'What I wish people knew about my diabetes' The Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system, used by Prime Minister Theresa May, who has the autoimmune condition, was made available on the NHS last November. The prime minister's Freestyle Libre could be seen on her arm when she and her husband attended a dinner with President Trump in July But recent researchsuggested only 3-5% of type 1 patients in England had access to the monitors on the NHS, when 20-25% were eligible. This was because some local clinical commissioning groups decided not to prioritise funding of the devices. NHS England said the device would now be funded to allow access throughout the country in all 195 clinical commissioning groups, benefiting a target of about a quarter of people with type 1 diabetes. The glucose monitoring device uses a tiny sensor inserted under the skin of the arm which is connected to a small transmitter patch on the surface of the skin. The sensor reads blood sugar levels from fluid just beneath the skin and transmits them wirelessly to a display on a portable reader held near the sensor. The technology reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and can make it much easier for people with diabetes to manage their condition. BBC journalist Lauren Turner has had type 1 diabetes for 14 years and has tried using a flash glucose monitor. ""I've used the Libre and compared to pricking my fingers (which I do about eight to 10 times a day), it's revolutionary,"" she says. ""I'm now waiting to find out when I can get it on prescription. ""It doesn't work for everyone - some prefer to use other systems, like continuous glucose monitors. ""But for me, what's most helpful is seeing the last eight hours of data, in the form of a graph. ""You also get an arrow showing whether your levels are going up or down or staying roughly the same. ""That's a world away from just getting a number on your monitor when you finger prick, with no clue as to what the bigger picture is. ""I find it more convenient too, as you can scan over the top of clothes - it's like swiping a contactless bank card. ""And then there's the fact my poor finger tips, which bear the scars of thousands of pricks from over the years, get a break. ""Another surprising benefit is that you can easily spot other people with diabetes - making you feel you're not alone dealing with this lifelong condition."" Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said the announcement would be ""welcome news to the many thousands of people with type 1 diabetes whose lives will now be changed for the better by access to flash glucose monitoring"". Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said digital health and technology would be at the heart of NHS England's long-term plan. ""NHS England is taking important action so that regardless of where you live, if you're a patient with type 1 diabetes you can reap the benefits of this life-improving technology."" Karen Addington, chief executive of type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, said: ""This should end the inequality of people being refused access to this life-changing type 1 diabetes technology depending on where they happen to live."" But she said training should be provided to make sure all healthcare professionals knew how to support people using the device. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Rolling out these monitors will not only make life more convenient, it will save the NHS time and resources by preventing people becoming ill in the first place. ""I want to see innovations like these become commonplace in our healthcare system so millions of people across the country stay out of hospital and can get on with their lives.""

Cervical screening hit by NHS blunder,"More than 40,000 women in England have not received information regarding cervical cancer screening after a failure to send out letters by the NHS. The errors were made between January and June. Around 4,000 of them were results of tests, the remainder were letters inviting them for screening or reminding them they were due. Between 150 and 200 of the test results that were not sent out were abnormal results. But it is thought their intended recipients should have received at least one notification from their GP or screening clinic - as women with abnormal results should be sent letters from two or three sources. 'What I wish people knew about my diabetes' Millions of women miss out on smear tests NHS England are checking this has happened and that abnormal results are being followed up properly with further testing. So far it has contacted nearly half of this group and says no harm has been caused. This video can not be played What happens during a smear test? The service is provided for NHS England by Capita. Around 4.5 million women aged 25 to 64 receive invitations for screening each year. Those aged 25 to 49 are offered screening every three years, with the older age groups invited every five years. The news comes just months after it emerged 174,000 women had not been invited for breast cancer screening after mistakes went undetected for years. Capita was not involved in that service. In comparison with the breast screening mistake, this problem has been spotted much more quickly. All those who did not receive an invite letter or reminder have been written to. It is believed 10,000 of them have already been tested. A spokesman for Capita said the company ""apologises"" for the mistake. He said the correct process for ""uploading, organising and checking"" had not been followed and appropriate disciplinary action was being taken. The senior manager responsible for the contract has left the company. NHS England said there was no current evidence any woman had been harmed and the priority now was to ensure everyone affected was contacted. But Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said the situation was ""frankly appalling"". ""We know that, because of the nature of this procedure, many patients are already reluctant to attend these appointments, and therefore reminder letters are crucial. ""Incidents like this, therefore, will hardly inspire confidence in the system and risk even fewer women getting checked,"" he said. Dr Vautrey said Capita's handling of the service had been ""nothing short of shambolic"" and called for the firm to be stripped of the contract.

Jokanovic makes way with the Cottagers sitting bottom of the Premier League table with five points from 12 matches. Italian Ranieri, 67, has been given a ""multi-year"" contract by the Londoners. ""Making a change without having the right answer or succession plan was not an option,"" said Fulham chairman Shahid Khan. ""So having someone of Claudio's calibre ready to accept our challenge was comforting but, most of all, essential. ""Claudio is risk-free and ready-made for the Premier League, and particularly so for what we need at this moment at Fulham. ""His recent body of work with Leicester City is literally legendary, and then you look at Claudio's experience with Chelsea and big clubs throughout Europe, and it's pretty evident we are welcoming an extraordinary football man to Fulham Football Club."" Can dignified Ranieri repeat Leicester magic and lift the clouds over Fulham? Claudio Ranieri? Really? How social media reacted to the Italian's appointment Khan said he and his son Tony Khan, the club's vice chairman and director of football operations, spoke with a number of potential candidates over the past week. ""It is an honour to accept Mr Khan's invitation and opportunity to lead Fulham, a fantastic club with tradition and history,"" said Ranieri, who spent last season in charge of French club Nantes. ""The objective at Fulham should never be to merely survive in the Premier League. We must at all times be a difficult opponent and should expect to succeed. ""This Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table."" Ranieri's first game in charge will see Fulham host Southampton at Craven Cottage on Saturday, 24 November. ""I know this team is very capable of better performances, which we will work on straight away as we prepare for Southampton at the Cottage,"" he added. Claudio Ranieri led Leicester City to the Premier League title in 2015-16 at odds of 5000/1 Despite vast experience with clubs such as Valencia, Juventus, Inter Milan, Roma and Monaco, Ranieri joined Leicester City in 2015 on the back of a failed spell as Greece boss, including losing to European minnows the Faroe Islands during Euro 2016 qualifying. The Italian had earned the nickname 'The Tinkerman' during his previous spell in England in charge of Chelsea, where he guided the Blues to second in the Premier League as well as reaching the Champions League semi-finals. More than a decade later, his Leicester side started the 2015-16 season as 5,000-1 outsiders to win the Premier League and were among the favourites for relegation. But the Foxes delivered one the greatest sporting shocks of all time as they clinched the club's first top-flight English title, described by many as a ""miracle"". The fairytale could not continue, however, with Ranieri sacked the following campaign - just ninth months after delivering the title. Jokanovic, who joined the club in December 2015, led Fulham to promotion via the play-offs last season. But they have so far registered just one win on their return to the Premier League after four seasons in the Championship. ""I wasn't anticipating having to make this announcement related to Slavisa and wish the circumstances were such that I didn't have to, but our path this season has led me to make what I know is the correct decision, at the right time, for our players, the club and our supporters,"" added Khan. ""Slavisa will always have my appreciation and respect for everything he did to return Fulham to top-flight football. ""I am hoping everyone in the Fulham family shares my heartfelt sentiments for Slavisa and joins me in wishing him success and good fortune, wherever his next stop may be."" Phil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football writer Fulham's owner Shahid Khan delivered combative public support for manager Slavisa Jokanovic in his programme notes for the home game against Bournemouth less than three weeks ago, telling fans ""don't believe anything"" in reports he faced the sack. Times change. Quickly. Fulham were beaten 3-0 by The Cherries, then lost at fellow strugglers Huddersfield Town, and Sunday's defeat at Liverpool was the last straw. The man who guided The Cottagers to promotion was gone. Khan reacted as Fulham lay bottom of the Premier League, after a summer investment of Â£100m only resulted in an imbalanced side where few new faces had made an impact, a loss of the attacking impetus that was their trademark and the worst defensive record in the division. The fear of relegation always overrules sentiment. So it is welcome back to the Premier League for ever-popular Claudio Ranieri, whose title-winning deeds at Leicester City will be remembered forever. This time he must work fast to turn a serious situation around with his brand of personal charm but more importantly his tactical acumen, starting with shoring up that porous defence. It will be no easy task for 'The Tinkerman'.

Berketex collapse: The brides without a dress,"Vicky Morgan had paid Â£1,400 of the Â£2,000 price tag ""Disgusted and desperately disappointed,"" is how Vicky Morgan sums up her feelings about bridal chain Berketex Bride's collapse. Its Leicester shop was the only wedding shop she'd been to after she fell in love with the first dress she tried on. She had already paid off Â£1,400 of the Â£2,000 price tag for the dress for her wedding day next July. Now the 29-year-old is one of about 300 brides left without a dress for their big day due to the chain's collapse. ""I fell in love with that dress. It was the one for me,"" she says. Vicky says she booked a measuring appointment for December last Monday when she said shop staff reassured her everything was OK despite the Newcastle branch closing. A week laterthe entire chain, which had 15 branchesin total, had ceased trading. Berketex Bride in adminstration The company advice line said because her dress was in process rather than finished it was unlikely she would be able to collect it. ""My only option now is to start looking for a new dress,"" she says. Vicky is not the only one who's been left disappointed. Elizabeth Rowson's mum had paid Â£899 for her dress Elizabeth Rowson had been told last month by Berketex that her local Birmingham store was closing, and instead she'd have to go to a different store for her fittings. ""I initially asked for my money back and was told my dress had already been ordered so if we cancelled the money would be lost."" She had ordered the dress at the National Wedding Show in February and her mum had paid the Â£899 fee in full by credit card as well as an additional Â£65 re-measuring fee. ""It was a really, really lovely dress."" Elizabeth has already started looking for other dresses ahead of her wedding in August, but is upset that she has to. ""I could have done without this. I thought I had already got the one. I feel really let down."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""It's all been totally stressful - it's meant to be the best day of your life,"" she says. The Newcastle branch where she had ordered her dress shut down last month and she was told her dress would be re-directed. ""With less than six months until my wedding I now need to find an off-the-peg dress. ""Thankfully I found a lovely dress store owner not too far from me who I'm going to see tomorrow, she's also offered discounts to all affected,"" she says. Holly managed to get her dress before the shop ceased trading But not everyone has lost out. Holly, who is getting married in June, managed to collect her dress from the Edinburgh store last Thursday. She asked for her dress to be delivered urgently after she saw comments on Facebook suggesting the firm was in trouble. But she says the experience wasn't the way she'd wanted it to be. ""No one could come with me so I didn't get to collect it with my bridesmaids or have the shop teach me how to dress me in it on the day, or how to sort the bustle for the evening. ""I don't know what I'm going to do about alterations and fittings, but I'm so lucky and relieved I managed to get my dress in time and I've only lost out on about Â£20, not Â£1,000.""

""We mourn the lives of those lost and we pray for the victims and there were more victims than anybody would ever think possible,"" he said. Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation 'Three minutes separated me from death' By Dave Lee, BBC News, Paradise, northern California It's five days since the Camp Fire destroyed this town. Power lines are strewn across the streets, cars melted into their driveways. A California license plate in the ashes of Paradise There are clues to the panic that must have swept through what was a charming town. A garden table, with food-serving tongs at the ready - both now fused together by the extreme heat. In nearby Chico, on the site of a fairground, impressive emergency planning is in action: last night's shift of firefighters sleep in a warehouse, while today's get their briefings. But being prepared for the worst doesn't make it any less traumatic. This is a county in shock - at lives, homes and livelihoods lost. And the knowledge that, in California, this will happen again. Convoys of fire engines could be seen rumbling through the charred ruins of the town on Tuesday, Reuters news agency reports, as crews headed out to fight the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. Workers used chainsaws to clear downed power lines and other obstacles from the streets. Animals caught in wildfire destruction The photos not from the California fires Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly At least 6,607 residences have been destroyed in the county along with 1,032 commercial and other structures. ""Thirty percent [containment] is kind of where we're getting close to rounding the corner,"" said Cal Fire spokeswoman Erica Bain. This video can not be played Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes ""When we're in the 30s and 40s, they're getting a good handle on it. By the end of this week I'd like to see that number up to 40, maybe 45."" Another Cal Fire representative, Scott McLean, said firefighters were now more optimistic because of changing weather conditions. Officials warn that finding human remains could take weeks. It was expected that 150 search-and-recovery personnel would arrive on Tuesday to reinforce 13 coroner-led recovery teams in the fire zone, Reuters reports. Three portable morgue teams have been requested from the US military along with a ""disaster mortuary"" crew, cadaver dog units to locate human remains and three groups of forensic anthropologists. Many victims in Paradise are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would have found evacuating more difficult. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal.""

DUP 'could not back draft deal',"East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson reacted angrily to the government's Brexit text The DUP has described the government's Brexit text as a ""poor deal"" after Prime Minister Theresa Mayannounced the cabinet had voted to support it. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson reacted angrily to the news saying it was ""a deal she (Mrs May) said she would never accept"". DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds met the prime minister on Wednesday night. Mrs Foster described the meeting as ""frank"" on a Twitter post. Allow Twitter content?

Both parties held the discussions at the prime minister's office in the House of Commons. The meeting, which lasted around an hour, took place after the text ofthe draft withdrawal agreement,externalhad already been published. Earlier, Mr Wilson said: ""I think people will be appalled at her words."" The party's ten MPs prop up the Conservative government under the confidence-and-supply arrangement, signed in June 2017. Sinn FÃ©in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said she had an ""initial conversation"" with Mrs May, and that she would ""resume conversation"" with TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney on Thursday. Speaking earlier outside No 10 Downing Street, the prime minister said there had been a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" during a five-hour cabinet meeting. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar welcomed the draft agreement, stating that it ""protects the fundamental"" aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. He said the backstop was ""now fully spelt out"". ""Additional rules on goods will apply to Northern Ireland to ensure that there is no need for a border between north and south,"" he said in Dublin. ""We have also agreed a review mechanism for the backstop if a better solution is found. It [a decision to make changes to the backstop] can only be taken jointly by the UK and EU."" This video can not be played Irish prime minister Varadkar says he is pleased with draft Brexit deal Earlier on Wednesday, Mrs Foster said that she will ""not be led by the Irish government"" when coming to a view on the UK-EU draft Brexit text. She was speaking after the taoiseach said unionists should be assured that the text would not negatively impact the integrity of the UK. May in cabinet showdown over Brexit deal Brexit text 'agreed' in talks breakthrough Irish Brexit border a ""fictitious problem"" Mrs Foster had told reporters in the Commons, ahead of the text's publication: ""We're talking in a bit of a vacuum, we really do need to see that text."" ""We are concerned about the narrative that has built up around the prime minister's proposal,"" she added. ""We will make our own judgements, and we will certainly not be led by the Irish government who have been aggressive in all of this."" Mrs Foster said if Theresa May reneged on commitments she had made, there would be ""consequences"". The 585-pagedraft withdrawal agreement has now been published,external, alongside a shorter statement setting out what the UK and EU's future relations will look like. The detail relating to Northern Ireland starts on page 302. It addresses the Northern Ireland backstop - the insurance policy arrangement that aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations. The backstop within the agreed draft would avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. This has proven to be the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said agreement on the backstop would protect the Good Friday Agreement and respect the integrity of the UK as a whole. He said the backstop would only kick in if there was no better solution by the end of the transition period in 2020 and is ""not meant to be used"". This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? On Wednesday morning, Mr Varadkar appeared in DÃ¡il Ãireann (Irish parliament) to answer questions from opposition parties. He said he believed what the draft text included would not ""negatively impact"" the integrity of the UK. He said he recognised that ""for the unionist community this is quite a difficult time"". ""I know many unionists may be feeling vulnerable, isolated and many may be quite worried about what may be agreed in the coming days,"" he added. ""I want to say to them - the Good Friday Agreement will be protected - it includes a recognition of the fact we respect the territorial integrity of the UK and the principle of consent, that there will be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of people say so."" He said he was happy to have that written into any agreement as a legal guarantee. Mr Varadkar held a special meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the text with his cabinet. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""the big problem"" would be getting the draft deal ""through parliament"". ""The only people who are precipitating the break-up of the United Kingdom are the DUP,"" he added. ""It (the union) isn't under threat and I think talking that up has created a threat in itself,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Leader Robin Swann said it was ""absolutely crucial that we have had time to analyse all the documentation"". ""If the words in the draft withdrawal agreement confirm the speculation, this has been a monumental error of judgement on behalf of the DUP which will have a devastating long-term impact,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said people needed ""to be incredibly responsible"". ""Dramatising this as a constitutional question is extremely worrying and dangerous and indeed irresponsible and it's not just the DUP who are doing it, you have people like Boris Johnson last night doing it, talking about Dublin control,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens, who all campaigned to remain in the EU, are now expected to meet Mr Varadkar in Dublin on Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley pictured entering Downing Street for the special cabinet meeting to discuss the Brexit draft deal Both the UK and EU are committed to ensuring physical checks at the Irish border will not be reintroduced. But if a solution cannot be found as part of a wider deal, the EU insisted on a legally binding ""backstop"". Until Tuesday, EU and UK negotiators had each come up with their own proposals for the Northern Ireland backstop, but had been unable to agree on a way forward. Focus remains on Downing Street where Theresa May is holding a special meeting of her cabinet to set out the details of the proposed text.

The Prince of Wales made the comments in the latest edition of Country Life, which he edited to mark his birthday. He also told the magazine about his fondness for red squirrels and how he lets them run around his home.

Flybe up for sale after profit warning,"Flybe has put itself up for sale, just weeks after issuing a profit warning. The Exeter-based regional airline's board confirmed it was ""in discussions with a number of strategic operators about a potential sale of the company"". Flybe said it was also reviewing other ""strategic options"", including cutting more flights in the face of challenges. A spokesman for the airline said there was no threat to tickets and flights that had already been purchased as a result of the review. Last month,the airline warnedfull-year losses would be Â£22m, blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs. Flybe shares sink on profit warning Flybe promises overhaul after Â£20m loss Latest results, published on Wednesday, show that pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 September fell by 54% to Â£7.4m, on revenues down by 2.4% to Â£419.2m. The airline's shares have fallen by almost 75% since September. The Exeter-based airline is now valued at about Â£25m, far below the Â£215m it was valued at when it floated on the stock exchange in 2010. However, following the announcement of the review, shares leapt by 37%. Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, told the BBC Flybe had ""suffered from weaker consumer demand, which is typical for operators of regional airports and have also blamed Brexit uncertainty and a weaker pound unsurprisingly"". He says that ""the usual suspects"" are in the frame as potential buyers of the regional airline. ""I saw a hint of Stobart Group, the owner of Southend Airport, as a possible rescuer. BA, historically of course, had a share [in Flybe] and sold it. So we are looking for more details."" Stobart Group and BA-owner IAG refused to comment. In a series of tweets the British Airline Pilots' Association said Flybe's 2,300 ""talented, committed"" staff in the UK would be ""very worried to hear... that their company is up for sale"". Balpa said it believed Flybe was ""fundamentally a sound airline"" and that it would scrutinise any offers for the firm to ensure jobs were protected. It also said it expected to be consulted by Flybe and potential bidders over any future plans they had for the airline and its employees. Allow Twitter content?

Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe. It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from a costly IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs. Last month, Flybe's chief executive, Christine Ourmieres-Widener, said it was reviewing ""further capacity and cost-saving measures"". ""Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs,"" she said at the time. Flybe says its decision to put itself up for sale is due to the ""current challenges"" it faces - higher fuel prices, uncertain demand and a weaker pound. In truth, those problems are just the icing on the cake. The sale is in reality the culmination of a series of management missteps over the last decade as the company struggled to find a profitable niche. It was squeezed from below by smaller, more nimble rivals, and from above by the likes of EasyJet and Ryanair. Flybe has tried new aircraft - Embraer jets that eventually had to be got rid of at immense cost - and new routes - forays away from its regional base to Heathrow and London City airports -  without ever finding the magic formula that would let it survive as an independent airline. All the while, cash has flowed out the door. Today's half-year results show a net outflow of more than Â£30m, leaving the company with just Â£52.4m in cash reserves. The accounts show that credit card acquirers, vital trade partners for airlines, are asking for more security. They also reveal departures of senior management: Vincent Hodder, head of strategy, and Peter Hauptvogel, the chief information officer, have recently left. All these management mistakes have been funded by Flybe's long-suffering shareholders. It floated in 2010 at 295p a share and raised Â£150m from investors in 2014. The shares currently trade at 11p.

Baby death review cases rise to 215,"The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust says it is co-operating fully with the review More than 200 families have raised concerns about maternity care at a hospital trust being investigated over a cluster of deaths and injuries. The government-ordered review into Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH) has now widened for a third time after initially focusing on 23 cases. The trust said 215 families have questioned the care they received. Health Secretary Matt Hancockput the trust in special measuresless than a week ago amid patient safety concerns. In August the scope of the review into alleged maternity failings between 1998 and 2017 was expanded to look at 40 cases. Soon after it was further broadened to take in 100. Baby death review: What do we know? It is understood not all the new cases relate to death and serious harm and some fall outside the scope of the review. Kate Stanton-Davies, pictured with her mother Rhiannon, was born at Ludlow Community Hospital Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton, whose daughterKate Stanton-Davies died in March 2009 hours after birth, said they were ""unsurprised"" by the number of families who have raised concerns. ""We were in no doubt that the review would find further cases because the cases we identified were in the public domain at the time when we asked Jeremy Hunt to launch an inquiry,"" Ms Davies said. ""We are unsurprised by the recent news as we have known for so long what is underlying all this is a trust that has refused to learn."" Latest news from the West Midlands Staff 'afraid to question care' at trust 'Doctors ignored me - my girls are gone' Ms Davies said she disagreed with the trust that the issue was ""a legacy problem"". ""Cases are continuing, problems are continuing and the trust is continuing to defend and deny what has been going on. ""But we do find some comfort in that the review is continuing to show what we knew all along. ""We are grateful to Jeremy Hunt and to Donna Ockenden and her team for listening to us on this. This is all in Kate's name, this is her legacy. ""This all should have stopped in 2009 but we have had to fight and we will continue to fight until it stops."" The trust was already reporting to the Care Quality Commission because of concerns about maternity and emergency services at its two sites - The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and The Princess Royal in Telford. Dr Kathy McLean, from NHS Improvement which is overseeing the review, said: ""Every possible case has and will be taken into account as part of the investigation, to help ensure that lessons are learnt."" The trust said it was co-operating fully with the review, which is being led by midwife Donna Ockenden. By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was placed in special measures last week This is now shaping up to be one of the biggest crises in maternity care in the history of the NHS. The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust told BBC News that 215 families had now come forward questioning maternity care, many are alleging significant errors. Of the 91 who've submitted their concerns directly to the trust, 36 said their babies had died and 22 alleged their children had suffered permanent harm. While not every family who has come forward with questions about the care they received will have been failed, long standing problems at the trust, including an inability to hire enough staff and a culture that failed to place much, if any, emphasis on learning from incidents, continues to see more families come forward. Many see the Ockenden Review as their final chance to answer the questions they've long harboured. The trust have tried to paint this all as a legacy problem, but some of the deaths now being investigated happened as recently as last December. And concerns about current maternity care, as well as A&E services and a loss of trust by regulators in the management's ability to improve care, all contributed to the trust being placed in special measures last week.

Thousands to get diabetes monitors,"The glucose monitoring device works via a sensor attached to the skin, allowing people to check their blood sugar levels Wearable glucose monitors will be made available to tens of thousands more people with type 1 diabetes from April 2019, NHS England has announced. Its decision comes after an investigation found patients in some areas of the country were being denied access to the device. It reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and helps people with diabetes to manage their condition. Diabetes charities called the change of policy a huge step forward. In England, around 300,000 people have type 1 diabetes. 'What I wish people knew about my diabetes' The Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system, used by Prime Minister Theresa May, who has the autoimmune condition, was made available on the NHS last November. The prime minister's Freestyle Libre could be seen on her arm when she and her husband attended a dinner with President Trump in July But recent researchsuggested only 3-5% of type 1 patients in England had access to the monitors on the NHS, when 20-25% were eligible. This was because some local clinical commissioning groups decided not to prioritise funding of the devices. NHS England said the device would now be funded to allow access throughout the country in all 195 clinical commissioning groups, benefiting a target of about a quarter of people with type 1 diabetes. The glucose monitoring device uses a tiny sensor inserted under the skin of the arm which is connected to a small transmitter patch on the surface of the skin. The sensor reads blood sugar levels from fluid just beneath the skin and transmits them wirelessly to a display on a portable reader held near the sensor. The technology reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and can make it much easier for people with diabetes to manage their condition. BBC journalist Lauren Turner has had type 1 diabetes for 14 years and has tried using a flash glucose monitor. ""I've used the Libre and compared to pricking my fingers (which I do about eight to 10 times a day), it's revolutionary,"" she says. ""I'm now waiting to find out when I can get it on prescription. ""It doesn't work for everyone - some prefer to use other systems, like continuous glucose monitors. ""But for me, what's most helpful is seeing the last eight hours of data, in the form of a graph. ""You also get an arrow showing whether your levels are going up or down or staying roughly the same. ""That's a world away from just getting a number on your monitor when you finger prick, with no clue as to what the bigger picture is. ""I find it more convenient too, as you can scan over the top of clothes - it's like swiping a contactless bank card. ""And then there's the fact my poor finger tips, which bear the scars of thousands of pricks from over the years, get a break. ""Another surprising benefit is that you can easily spot other people with diabetes - making you feel you're not alone dealing with this lifelong condition."" Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said the announcement would be ""welcome news to the many thousands of people with type 1 diabetes whose lives will now be changed for the better by access to flash glucose monitoring"". Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said digital health and technology would be at the heart of NHS England's long-term plan. ""NHS England is taking important action so that regardless of where you live, if you're a patient with type 1 diabetes you can reap the benefits of this life-improving technology."" Karen Addington, chief executive of type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, said: ""This should end the inequality of people being refused access to this life-changing type 1 diabetes technology depending on where they happen to live."" But she said training should be provided to make sure all healthcare professionals knew how to support people using the device. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Rolling out these monitors will not only make life more convenient, it will save the NHS time and resources by preventing people becoming ill in the first place. ""I want to see innovations like these become commonplace in our healthcare system so millions of people across the country stay out of hospital and can get on with their lives.""

DUP 'could not back draft Brexit deal',"East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson reacted angrily to the government's Brexit text The DUP has described the government's Brexit text as a ""poor deal"" after Prime Minister Theresa Mayannounced the cabinet had voted to support it. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson reacted angrily to the news saying it was ""a deal she (Mrs May) said she would never accept"". DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds met the prime minister on Wednesday night. Mrs Foster described the meeting as ""frank"" on a Twitter post. Allow Twitter content?

Both parties held the discussions at the prime minister's office in the House of Commons. The meeting, which lasted around an hour, took place after the text ofthe draft withdrawal agreement,externalhad already been published. Earlier, Mr Wilson said: ""I think people will be appalled at her words."" The party's ten MPs prop up the Conservative government under the confidence-and-supply arrangement, signed in June 2017. Sinn FÃ©in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said she had an ""initial conversation"" with Mrs May, and that she would ""resume conversation"" with TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney on Thursday. Speaking earlier outside No 10 Downing Street, the prime minister said there had been a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" during a five-hour cabinet meeting. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar welcomed the draft agreement, stating that it ""protects the fundamental"" aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. He said the backstop was ""now fully spelt out"". ""Additional rules on goods will apply to Northern Ireland to ensure that there is no need for a border between north and south,"" he said in Dublin. ""We have also agreed a review mechanism for the backstop if a better solution is found. It [a decision to make changes to the backstop] can only be taken jointly by the UK and EU."" This video can not be played Irish prime minister Varadkar says he is pleased with draft Brexit deal Earlier on Wednesday, Mrs Foster said that she will ""not be led by the Irish government"" when coming to a view on the UK-EU draft Brexit text. She was speaking after the taoiseach said unionists should be assured that the text would not negatively impact the integrity of the UK. May in cabinet showdown over Brexit deal Brexit text 'agreed' in talks breakthrough Irish Brexit border a ""fictitious problem"" Mrs Foster had told reporters in the Commons, ahead of the text's publication: ""We're talking in a bit of a vacuum, we really do need to see that text."" ""We are concerned about the narrative that has built up around the prime minister's proposal,"" she added. ""We will make our own judgements, and we will certainly not be led by the Irish government who have been aggressive in all of this."" Mrs Foster said if Theresa May reneged on commitments she had made, there would be ""consequences"". The 585-pagedraft withdrawal agreement has now been published,external, alongside a shorter statement setting out what the UK and EU's future relations will look like. The detail relating to Northern Ireland starts on page 302. It addresses the Northern Ireland backstop - the insurance policy arrangement that aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations. The backstop within the agreed draft would avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. This has proven to be the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said agreement on the backstop would protect the Good Friday Agreement and respect the integrity of the UK as a whole. He said the backstop would only kick in if there was no better solution by the end of the transition period in 2020 and is ""not meant to be used"". This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? On Wednesday morning, Mr Varadkar appeared in DÃ¡il Ãireann (Irish parliament) to answer questions from opposition parties. He said he believed what the draft text included would not ""negatively impact"" the integrity of the UK. He said he recognised that ""for the unionist community this is quite a difficult time"". ""I know many unionists may be feeling vulnerable, isolated and many may be quite worried about what may be agreed in the coming days,"" he added. ""I want to say to them - the Good Friday Agreement will be protected - it includes a recognition of the fact we respect the territorial integrity of the UK and the principle of consent, that there will be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of people say so."" He said he was happy to have that written into any agreement as a legal guarantee. Mr Varadkar held a special meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the text with his cabinet. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""the big problem"" would be getting the draft deal ""through parliament"". ""The only people who are precipitating the break-up of the United Kingdom are the DUP,"" he added. ""It (the union) isn't under threat and I think talking that up has created a threat in itself,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Leader Robin Swann said it was ""absolutely crucial that we have had time to analyse all the documentation"". ""If the words in the draft withdrawal agreement confirm the speculation, this has been a monumental error of judgement on behalf of the DUP which will have a devastating long-term impact,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said people needed ""to be incredibly responsible"". ""Dramatising this as a constitutional question is extremely worrying and dangerous and indeed irresponsible and it's not just the DUP who are doing it, you have people like Boris Johnson last night doing it, talking about Dublin control,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens, who all campaigned to remain in the EU, are now expected to meet Mr Varadkar in Dublin on Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley pictured entering Downing Street for the special cabinet meeting to discuss the Brexit draft deal Both the UK and EU are committed to ensuring physical checks at the Irish border will not be reintroduced. But if a solution cannot be found as part of a wider deal, the EU insisted on a legally binding ""backstop"".

Diabetes monitors to be funded in England,"The glucose monitoring device works via a sensor attached to the skin, allowing people to check their blood sugar levels Wearable glucose monitors will be made available to tens of thousands more people with type 1 diabetes from April 2019, NHS England has announced. Its decision comes after an investigation found patients in some areas of the country were being denied access to the device. It reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and helps people with diabetes to manage their condition. Diabetes charities called the change of policy a huge step forward. In England, around 300,000 people have type 1 diabetes. 'What I wish people knew about my diabetes' The Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system, used by Prime Minister Theresa May, who has the autoimmune condition, was made available on the NHS last November. The prime minister's Freestyle Libre could be seen on her arm when she and her husband attended a dinner with President Trump in July But recent researchsuggested only 3-5% of type 1 patients in England had access to the monitors on the NHS, when 20-25% were eligible. This was because some local clinical commissioning groups decided not to prioritise funding of the devices. NHS England said the device would now be funded to allow access throughout the country in all 195 clinical commissioning groups, benefiting a target of about a quarter of people with type 1 diabetes. The glucose monitoring device uses a tiny sensor inserted under the skin of the arm which is connected to a small transmitter patch on the surface of the skin. The sensor reads blood sugar levels from fluid just beneath the skin and transmits them wirelessly to a display on a portable reader held near the sensor. The technology reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and can make it much easier for people with diabetes to manage their condition. BBC journalist Lauren Turner has had type 1 diabetes for 14 years and has tried using a flash glucose monitor. ""I've used the Libre and compared to pricking my fingers (which I do about eight to 10 times a day), it's revolutionary,"" she says. ""I'm now waiting to find out when I can get it on prescription. ""It doesn't work for everyone - some prefer to use other systems, like continuous glucose monitors. ""But for me, what's most helpful is seeing the last eight hours of data, in the form of a graph. ""You also get an arrow showing whether your levels are going up or down or staying roughly the same. ""That's a world away from just getting a number on your monitor when you finger prick, with no clue as to what the bigger picture is. ""I find it more convenient too, as you can scan over the top of clothes - it's like swiping a contactless bank card. ""And then there's the fact my poor finger tips, which bear the scars of thousands of pricks from over the years, get a break. ""Another surprising benefit is that you can easily spot other people with diabetes - making you feel you're not alone dealing with this lifelong condition."" Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said the announcement would be ""welcome news to the many thousands of people with type 1 diabetes whose lives will now be changed for the better by access to flash glucose monitoring"". Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said digital health and technology would be at the heart of NHS England's long-term plan. ""NHS England is taking important action so that regardless of where you live, if you're a patient with type 1 diabetes you can reap the benefits of this life-improving technology."" Karen Addington, chief executive of type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, said: ""This should end the inequality of people being refused access to this life-changing type 1 diabetes technology depending on where they happen to live."" But she said training should be provided to make sure all healthcare professionals knew how to support people using the device. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Rolling out these monitors will not only make life more convenient, it will save the NHS time and resources by preventing people becoming ill in the first place.

"Melania calls for White House aide's firingThe first lady's office says the aide ""no longer deserves the honour"" of serving the White House.US & Canada","Mira Ricardel (left) and Melania Trump (right) US First Lady Melania Trump has called for a top national security aide to President Donald Trump to be fired. The first lady feuded with Mira Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, during her tour of Africa in October, US media report. ""It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House,"" her spokeswoman said. The White House and the National Security Council has yet to comment. The statement came as US media reported that Mr Trump was considering a shake up in the White House West Wing, and may be considering removing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. As deputy national security adviser, Mrs Ricardel has served under National Security Advisor John Bolton on the powerful National Security Council for the past seven months. In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour Mrs Ricardel (right) attended a Diwali candle lighting with Mr Trump moments before the first lady's condemnation According to US media reports, Mrs Trump and Mrs Ricardel fell out during the first lady's trip to Africa last month and quarrelled over seating arrangements on her plane. During her trip there, Mrs Trump told ABC in a rare interview that there are people in the White House who she does not trust. She said she gives the president ""my honest advice and honest opinions and then he does what he wants to do"". Analysis byAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The long knives are out at the White House. Behind-the-scenes machinations and off-the-record backstabbing are nothing new in this administration, of course. Practically since inauguration various factions have been vying for political supremacy in the West Wing. What's different this time around is that the office of First Lady Melania Trump decided to attack a member of the White House staff on the record and in no uncertain terms. Presidential spouses do have a long history of involving themselves in White House staffing issues. Nancy Reagan, for instance,had an ongoing feud with Chief of Staff Donald Regan.,externalHillary Clinton frequently sparred with White House aides. It's the kind of thing that never spills quite so openly into view, however. With the mid-term elections now in the rear-view mirror, the situation in the Trump White House appears to be coming to a head. The biggest face-off appears to be between two key power centres, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Advisor John Bolton. Everything else, including the situation with Mrs Trump, is cascading from that. It's a situation that seems difficult to sustain. These are the small tremors of a staffing earthquake to come. The Wall Street Journal had earlier on Tuesday reported that Mrs Trump's team believed Mrs Ricardel was behind some of the ""negative stories"" about Mrs Trump and her staff. The newspaper also reported that she repeatedly clashed with US Secretary of Defense James Mattis over ""staffing decisions and policy differences"". Mrs Trump's statement, released through her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, came hours after she issued a separate statement denying reports of clashes with Mr Kelly, her husband's chief of staff. ""Mrs Trump has a very positive relationship with Chief Kelly and there have never been any issues between the two,"" Mrs Grisham said. As the news broke, Mr Trump posted a photo on Twitter of Mrs Ricardel accompanying him at a Diwali ceremony. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

LiveBrexit negotiations latest13 minutes ago13 minutes ago EU 27's agenda for crunch dayEU 27's agenda for crunch day15 minutes ago Wednesday's papersWednesday's papers16 minutes ago Blair: Refusal to back second vote 'gut-wrenching'Blair: Refusal to back second vote 'gut-wrenching'Live Brexit negotiations latest  13 minutes ago,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Cable said the whole issue of Europe was divisive and the ""least damaging"" way forward now would be to go back to the people, put the question before them and come to a ""clear decision"". The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so."" He said she had shown courage and character but that does not avoid the fact she made a terrible decision to set a series of red lines that could not be met.  Allow Twitter content?

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Pregnant woman killed with crossbowSana Muhammad's baby was born shortly after she was fatally attacked in her east London home.London,"Sana Muhammad died in hospital on Monday A man has been charged with the murder of a pregnant woman who was shot through the stomach with a crossbow. Sana Muhammad, 35, was eight months pregnant but her baby survived after an emergency Caesarean section,the Evening Standard reported,external. The Met Police said the baby was in a ""stable condition"" in hospital after the attack in Ilford, east London, on Monday. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 50, is to appear at the Old Bailey on Thursday.

She said: ""I think about her a lot and her children and we can't accept right now what has happened. ""Yesterday morning there was lots of police, we did not know what happened, but everyone here is in shock."" BBC News correspondent Richard Lister The Met Police said the newborn baby is in a ""stable condition"" Two police cars remain parked on the kerb outside the home where Sana Muhammad was injured on Monday. A bouquet of flowers has been left propped up against a bin and a police officer is standing at the entrance to the family home.

EU gives May space to 'spin' draft deal,"Will Theresa May have something to smile about after Wednesday's cabinet meeting? What's so striking about this draft Brexit deal the UK media and politicians are all abuzz about, is the marked lack of excitement and/or hysteria in EU circles. Contrary to the UK narrative, this is not viewed in Brussels as the back-against-the-wall, make-or-break moment. There's still some time to keep negotiating. EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the ""i""s, nor all the ""t""s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed. The thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board. Kuenssberg: Agreement is in Downing Street's grasp A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Pienaar: May's big gamble As I've mentioned before, the EU is clearly more relaxed about timing - as long as a deal is signed before March - than Theresa May at this stage. You get the feeling that the current sense of pressure and urgency is designed to help the UK prime minister at home. Storm clouds surrounded her once again last weekend, with cabinet minister Jo Johnson resigning and mutterings of potential mutiny from Brexiteer and Remainer conservative MPs, never mind the Labour Party and the DUP plotting over the eventual Brexit parliamentary vote. Brexit opponents have recently staged a series of rallies across Britain It looked (once again) like the whole thing could unravel on the UK side. Brussels has repeatedly told Mrs May that - as long as they could agree on the details of a deal amongst themselves - the EU would help her present it however she wished in order to help her sell the package back home. I think now is one of those moments, which would explain why Brussels kept so silent on Tuesday night - such a politically sensitive night in the UK. One of my high-level EU contacts even sent me an emoji with a closed zip instead of a mouth - to indicate that he couldn't talk. These are hours for Downing Street to spin. This is not to say that the EU is completely chilled about the appearance of a draft Brexit deal - played down to me by a Brussels contact as a ""mutual understanding"" between EU and UK negotiators. That's a reminder that this is a technical draft - not yet a political agreement. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? While all eyes on Wednesday will be on Number 10 Downing Street and the reaction of the UK cabinet, the governments of all 27 EU countries and the European parliament also want to get their eyes and their mitts on all 500 pages of the document ASAP. Of key interest to them: the compromise wording over the backstop, that insurance policy for the Irish border. They, and Ireland in particular, will be relieved to see something Brexiteers will not like at all - that the EU will decide alongside the UK if and when the backstop arrangements need to kick in and also when they can be terminated and superseded by a new EU-UK trade deal. They will also note that the all-UK customs union with the EU outlined as part of the backstop will be deeper with Northern Ireland than with the rest of the UK. This will be hard for the DUP to swallow. More important to EU heavyweights France and Germany - and others that trade closely with the UK like Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands - will be to examine the small print of the backstop customs union to ensure the UK would have no competitive advantage over them. I've spoken to diplomats who worry the European Commission was in such a hurry to get this draft Brexit deal document ready to Theresa May's timetable, that the priorities of some EU member states may have been overlooked. France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain for example won't be happy that fishing rights in UK waters do not seem to appear in the text. European capitals want a minimum of seven to 10 days to pore over the draft with a fine-tooth comb. So, could there still be a special Brexit deal summit called this month as Theresa May so hopes? It's not impossible - 25 November is being spoken about as a potential date. Later on Wednesday as the UK cabinet meets in London, the 27 EU ambassadors will gather in Brussels. To be discussed: the draft Brexit deal, the possibility of a November summit and - as a clear indication of the current uncertainty - ongoing contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.

Lilly Singh to take a break from YouTubeThe popular comedian says she is suffering from burnout after eight years on the platform.,"Lilly Singh has gone from videos of tying turbans to global stardom on YouTube in a few years YouTuber Lilly Singh, also known as Superwoman, has announced she is taking a break from the video platform. The Canadian-born content creator is stepping away from YouTube after eight years for her mental health. She promised fans she will ""be back happier and healthier"" after her time off. A prolific and popular YouTuber, Ms Singh has over 14 million subscribers on her channels and is among the platform's highest earning stars. 'Superwoman' Lilly Singh at UN General Assembly The rise and rise of Lilly Singh ""I am mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted,"" she said,externalin a video posted on Monday night. The comedian and actress said she was struggling with burnout after posting nonstop videos since 2010. Ms Singh said she is not ""particularly proud"" with some of recent content and needs time to reflect the kinds of videos she wants to create. YouTuber Lilly Singh generously gives fans cash for rent, exams and food ""The thing about YouTube is, in all of its glory, it kind of is a machine and it makes creators believe that we have to pump out content consistently even at the cost of our health and our life and our mental happiness,"" she said. Ms Singh said she is not permanently leaving the platform and  is not sure of how long she will be away. ""I'm not making any rules. This might be a one week break, this might be a one month break - I have no idea,"" she said. The 30-year-old comedian and actress began her YouTube channel in 2010. Much of her content early on focused on her Indian heritage and her ethnic background but she soon expanded her subject matter, including filming daily behind-the-scenes vlogs. By 2013, her character had built a solid fan base predominantly among South Asian teenage girls living in the US, Canada, UK and Australia. In 2016, Ms Singh earned Â£5.7m ($7.4m) making her the third highest paid YouTuber in the world, according to Forbes magazine. Her career has since grown beyond YouTube. She released a self-help book last year, made a movie, and has done philanthropic work. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit text agreed in talks breakthrough,"Ministers were being briefed individually on the draft agreement UK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement after months of negotiations. A cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week. A special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing. The PM has been meeting ministers in Downing Street for one-to-one talks on the draft agreement. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the agreement contained a UK-wide customs ""backstop"" aimed at preventing new border checks in Northern Ireland. There is no additional Northern Ireland-only backstop - but sources wouldn't be drawn on any specific arrangements for Northern Ireland on rules and regulation within the UK-wide one, she added. This ""backstop"" has proved to the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. Laura Kuenssberg: Agreement is in Downing Street's grasp Katya Adler: EU gives May space to 'spin' draft deal A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Pienaar: May's big gamble Thepound surged against the dollar and the eurofollowing the negotiations breakthrough - but analysts warned it could be short-lived, with the cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans. The EU said it would ""take stock"" on Wednesday, while the Irish government said negotiations were ""ongoing and have not concluded"". Leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, immediately criticised what has been reported to be in the draft agreement, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which gives Theresa May vital support in key votes, said it would be a ""very, very hard sell"". But Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" it would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called for ""a little bit of calm"" before the cabinet gives its verdict on Wednesday. Both the UK and EU hope to be able to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the deal. The details of the draft agreement have not been published, so we don't know the small print yet. But it is made up of a withdrawal agreement - said to run to 500 pages - alongside a statement about what the UK and EU's future relationship will look like. The withdrawal agreement includes how to guarantee there will not be physical border checks reintroduced in Northern Ireland - the major sticking point in recent weeks. Some Brexiteers fear the likely arrangement will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years to come in order to maintain a frictionless border. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? Bisto owner plans Brexit stockpile The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. No 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to ""consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps"". Before they do so, they will be able to read relevant ""documentation"". By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said the plan would see the UK remain in the customs union and ""large parts"" of the single market. He told the BBC it was ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"" and he would vote against it. Mr Rees-Mogg warned of the UK becoming a ""vassal state"" with Northern Ireland ""being ruled from Dublin"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""given the shambolic nature of the negotiations, this is unlikely to be the good deal for the country."" Pro-EU Conservative MP Justine Greening said the agreement would leave the UK with less influence and undermine its credibility. Speaking at a rally calling for another EU referendum to be held, she said: ""Even if some people in my party can't see this is a bad deal, everyone else around this entire planet can."" At the rally, former minister Jo Johnson was interviewed by Match of the Day host Gary Lineker Former Transport Minister Jo Johnson told the audience at a packed Westminster Hall that cabinet ministers were ""looking deep into their consciences"" about whether to support the deal. Mr Johnson, who quit his ministerial role last week over Brexit policy, added: ""The whips are going to tighten the thumbscrews on all our colleagues across Parliament in all parties probably, so it is very hard to predict."" BBC Europe editor Katya Adler Brussels is keeping schtum this evening. This doesn't mean that nothing's going on. Those in the know simply prefer to keep quiet at this sensitive stage. It seems what is being described to me as a ""mutual understanding"" has indeed been reached on a technical level between EU and UK Brexit negotiators. This is not yet a deal. All eyes are now on the UK cabinet. If ministers reject the draft, then it's back to the drawing board. If they approve it, then the 27 EU ambassadors scheduled to meet tomorrow may be told by the European Commission that decisive progress has been made in negotiations, meaning a Brexit summit could be convened with Theresa May, possibly in less than two weeks' time. First though, all 27 EU countries and the European Parliament will want to pore over the text. And that won't be with an uncritical eye. Meanwhile, following pressure from all sides of the Commons, ministers have agreed to provide MPs with a legal assessment of the implications for the UK of the Irish backstop and other controversial aspects of any deal.

May faces cabinet showdown over Brexit deal,"A crucial cabinet meeting where Theresa May's most senior ministers debated the draft EU withdrawal agreement has ended. The meeting inside 10 Downing Street lasted for five hours. The prime minister is expected to make a statement shortly, with the EU due to publish the withdrawal documents if it gets the green light from London. Some Tory MPs and opposition parties have already criticised what the agreement is thought to contain. Earlier Mrs May said it would allow the UK government to take back control of borders, laws and money. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the UK would be stuck in an ""indefinite half-way house without any real say"" over the rules. Live updates: Brexit negotiations latest A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Brexit text no threat to NI, says Irish PM Brexit deal bad for Scotland - Sturgeon Criticism of the draft agreement has focused on ways to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. Some Conservative Brexiteers are angry, claiming it could mean the UK is tied to EU rules for years to come. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A senior Conservative told the BBC there could be a move to a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May, perhaps as soon as Thursday, although this has not been confirmed. Sources said many Brexiteer MPs were likely to submit letters to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for her to go. If 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) do this it would trigger a vote of no confidence. Meanwhile Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which supports Mrs May's government in key votes - warned of ""consequences"" if there is a deal that ""breaks up the United Kingdom"". Penny Mordaunt said nothing as she arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday The BBC's Norman Smith said the prime minister would seek to head off the threat of any resignations by telling her cabinet ministers that while not perfect, the agreement was as good as it can get. Downing Street, he added, were pointing to what they view as significant wins, including no separate customs border for Northern Ireland and an arbitration mechanism to ensure the UK can exit the proposed ""backstop"" customs plan. Just ahead of the cabinet meeting, all 13 Scottish Tory MPs, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell,signed a letter to the prime ministersaying they would not support a Brexit deal that prevents the UK from negotiating its own fishing quotas. Access and quotas ""cannot be included in the Future Economic Partnership"" and the UK must leave the Common Fisheries Policy at the end of 2020, they added. The draft withdrawal agreement addresses the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations that involves not having a physical border. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No deal: When planning doesn't cut it This has proven the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. The backstop within the agreed draft is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. However, some Brexiteers fear this will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years. The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. If the cabinet signs it off, the EU Commission is expected later to publish the details of the 500-page draft withdrawal agreement as well as the much shorter declaration on future economic and security relations. Ambassadors from the remaining 27 EU member states will discuss the possibility of organising an emergency summit later this month to sign off on it. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has signalled the summit could take place on 25 November. If this happens, the government will then face a battle to win Parliament's backing, in a vote the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December. Please upgrade your browser With some Tories vowing to vote against it and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which Mrs May relies on to win key Commons votes - also expressing concern, it is not clear which way the vote will go. Brexiteer Conservative MPs were first to criticise the agreement, based on leaks of it, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Peter Bone said the reported agreement would not ""deliver"" on what people voted for and risked ""losing the support of many Tory MPs and millions of voters across the country"". But Mrs May, who is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, said the agreement would leave the UK free to do its own trade deals while the customs union ""backstop"" would be temporary. And Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" the deal would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Pienaar: May's big gamble This video can not be played MPs react to reports about the draft text of a Brexit agreement Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson described the reported agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop as ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"", and said he would vote against it. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Newsnight he was so unhappy with the agreement he was considering calling on Mrs May to quit as PM. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today that from ""what we have heard... this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom and that is not something we can support"". And the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK was heading towards a Brexit that would ""cost jobs"" and urged MPs to ""think about your constituents' interests, think about jobs, think about prosperity"". But one of Mrs May's allies, former first secretary of state Damian Green, criticised ""hyperbole"" from people who had not read the document. And former Conservative leader Lord Hague urged the cabinet to ""stick together"" - saying the draft agreement contained a ""lot of compromises"" but would allow the UK to regain control of immigration, fishing and farming. By BBC Europe editor Katya Adler What's so striking about this draft Brexit deal the UK media and politicians are all abuzz about, is the marked lack of excitement and/or hysteria in EU circles. Contrary to the UK narrative, this is not viewed in Brussels as the back-against-the-wall, make-or-break moment. There's still some time to keep negotiating. EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the ""i""s, nor all the ""t""s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed. The thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board.

Kuenssberg: What will cabinet do next?,"What do they do now? The cabinet is not going to like the draft agreement that they'll have to decide on. Many of them probably won't like it one little bit. Number 10 says tonight that they have managed to remove the idea of a ""backstop to the backstop"". But there is, in the agreement, the potential for a different regime for Northern Ireland. Sources close to the process admit privately that they haven't managed to remove the controversy. Brexit text agreed in talks breakthrough How could they when for months, the difficulties of the conundrums have been plain for all to see. Northern Ireland will, according to one insider familiar with the contents, under the backstop essentially be in the single market and therefore under the rules of the EU courts and the Commission. The DUP's fury is already obvious tonight and that's even before they have seen that detail. But it's suggested that the final draft is worse for them than the speculation that had already made them fume. Having come this far however, it doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. The eruption of immediate resistance from Brexiteers on Tuesday night was an immediate display of how hard it might be. And Tories tempted by another referendum may be swayed by the enthusiasm the small number of their colleagues who are campaigning for one seem to be gaining. So if the final vote in Parliament were tomorrow it's extremely hard to see how the government would win the day. But so much could happen between now and then. Government ministers and whips will do everything they can to change the dynamic. To make the deal look like a sensible but definite triumph, to paint the alternatives as too scary to contemplate. And frankly, when it comes to it, many MPs who might be tempted to rebel just would dearly love the whole thing to be done. So it's just not possible yet to make the final judgement that some members of the cabinet fear tonight - that the deal as it stands just won't get the numbers in Parliament. We cannot put ourselves yet into the Parliamentary moment that will come in a few weeks' time. In putting the agreement in front of her cabinet, Theresa May plainly believes that forging ahead with a plan that won't please everyone is a risk worth taking. Her colleagues will decide at 2pm on Wednesday if she will have that chance.

Border officer smuggled drugs and gunsSimon Pellett and two accomplices were caught with heroin and cocaine worth ÃÂ£3.4m and 10 guns.England,"(L-R) Simon Pellett, David Baker and Alex Howard will be sentenced on Friday A corrupt UK border officer has been found guilty of attempting to smuggle firearms and drugs into the country. Simon Pellett, from Dover, was on duty when he was arrested by French officers in October last year. Jurors at Isleworth Crown Court heard he was caught with holdalls containing eight pistols, two revolvers, ammunition, and heroin and cocaine with a combined street value of Â£3.4m. Pellett, 37, will be sentenced on Friday alongside two accomplices. Det Ch Insp Sam Cailes, from the Met Police, described it as a ""significant haul of weapons"". She said: ""You would rarely see a haul of weapons this large. You've got a mixture of firearms here, with Class A drugs. ""It's very unusual to have all of those commodities together in one seizure."" These items were loaded on to an unmarked Border Force van driven by Simon Pellett The arrests were made following a joint investigation involving the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and French police. The NCA had placed a listening device in the work van Pellett collected from his office in Folkestone before he got on a Channel Tunnel shuttle service. He was recorded making arrangements to meet other members of the crime group in Loon Plage, between Calais and Dunkirk. Pellett met Alex Howard, 35, from Sittingbourne, and David Baker, 55, from Eltham, for a handover in a supermarket car park. The two men had just placed three holdalls in the back of his van when French officers moved in to arrest them. The firearms included self-loading and machine pistols, revolvers and silencers. There was also ammunition for a submachine gun. French police discovered the drugs and weapons after a joint investigation with the National Crime Agency and Met Police A spokesman for the NCA said investigators believe Pellett would have been paid about Â£20,000 for the smuggling run. All three men were extradited from France back to the UK for trial. On Monday, Pellett and Baker were found guilty of attempting to import firearms, heroin and cocaine. Pellett was also found guilty of misconduct in a public office. On Tuesday morning, Howard was found guilty of drug importation charges but cleared of the firearms charge.
