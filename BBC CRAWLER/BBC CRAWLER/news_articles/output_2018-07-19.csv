No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes',"Only 9% of crimes end with suspects being charged or summonsed in England and Wales,Home Office figures suggest.,external In the 12 months to March, 443,000 crimes resulted in a charge or summons out of 4.6 million offences - the lowest detection rate since 2015. Data also shows police closed nearly half (48%) of all cases because no suspect could be identified. It comes as new figures show the number of homicides has increased for the fourth year running. The Home Office statistics on crime outcomes are published at the same time as quarterly crime figures and the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime. The changing picture of how successfully police are catching criminals comes against a backdrop of rising crime. Overall, crimes recorded by police went up 11% in the year to March,figures published by the Office for National Statistics suggested.,external The Home Office said that along with a growing caseload, there was evidence to suggest that more recorded crimes were in the most challenging offence types to investigate. It gives the example of sexual offences - up 24% on last year - giving officers a bigger workload and becoming more complex. Rape cases take an average of 129 days to solve compared with, for example, two days for theft or criminal damage. The Home Office figures show a continuing downward trend since 2015 in the proportion of cases police have resolved, falling from 15 to 9%. They also showed a fall in the number of cautions and penalty notices served to adults and young people - from about 112,00 in the 12 months to March 2017 down to 88,000 a year later. ChÃ© Donald, of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said the new figures were proof that policing in the UK was ""on the critical list"". ""We are sleepwalking into a nightmare,"" he said. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. Other notable findings from the Home Office include: Insexual offencecases, only 5% resulted in someone being charged or summonsed That figure falls to 3% forrapecases. In about a third (34%) of rape cases, the victim did not want to take the case to its conclusion In all, one in five cases went unresolved because the victim did not support action, usually meaning they did not want to go through the courts Three quarters oftheftcases were closed with no suspect identified This was also the case in more than half (57%) ofrobberies,includingmuggings By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw These figures paint a gloomy picture. Not only are police recording more crimes - but they're solving fewer of them. That's partly because proportionately more of the offences they have to deal with are complex and difficult to investigate, such as rape. But it may also be a reflection of the decline in police officer numbers since 2010, down by a further 738 according to the latest workforce data, and the national shortage of detectives, as the Inspectorate of Constabulary has highlighted. The consequences are serious: victims not getting the justice they deserve, public confidence in the criminal justice system damaged and more offenders avoiding detection - and free to commit further crimes. It threatens to become a vicious circle of crime. Meanwhile, the latest figures for recorded offences showed homicides in England and Wales were up 12% in the 12 months to the end of March, from 627 to 701. Homicide covers cases of murder, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and infanticide, but these figures exclude terror attacks. Reality Check: How do weapons appear on England's streets Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said homicide remained rare and tended to take place in London and other cities. The start of 2018 was characterised by what appeared to be regular killings on the streets of London. Between January and March,the BBC recorded46 killings in the city - some from gunshot wounds but most from stabbings. Among those killed were a handful of teenagers. The data also showed: Knife crimeup 16% Robberyoffences, includingmuggings,up 30% - 77,103 cases were recorded in the 12 months to March. In February,the BBC reportedthat the ""rich pickings"" on Oxford Street in London's West End had made it a hotspot for robberies and ride-by moped thefts Vehicle-related theftsup 12% - it is the second year for vehicle-related theft numbers to rise and is backed up by the separate Crime Survey which showed an increase of 17% Publishing the data, the ONS said: ""Over recent decades, we've seen a fall in overall levels of crime, a trend that now looks to be stabilising."" Caroline Youell, of the ONS, said the latest figures showed a ""fairly stable"" picture in England and Wales for most crime types. ""It is too early to say if this is a change to the long-term declining trend,"" she added. ""There have been increases in some lower-volume 'high-harm' offences such as homicide and knife crime, consistent with rises over the past three years. ""However, the latest rise in gun crime is much smaller than previously seen. ""We have also seen continued increases in some theft offences such as vehicle-related theft and burglary, while computer viruses have fallen.""

Trump invites Putin to visit US,"This video can not be played ""That's going to be special"" - US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats learns of the Putin visit while at an event President Donald Trump has invited Russian leader Vladimir Putin to visit the US, in a move that drew startled laughter from a US intelligence chief. ""That's going to be special!"" said Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, when he was told about the invitation during a live interview. The political fallout is continuing from Mr Trump's first summit with Mr Putin in Finland on Monday. Democrats are demanding the notes from the two leaders' private talks. Your toolkit to help understand the story Trump's 'most serious mistake' ""Until we know what happened at that two-hour meeting in Helsinki, the president should have no more one-on-one interactions with Putin,"" said Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, in a statement.

The Republican president's 18 months in office have been dogged by investigations into whether any of his aides colluded with alleged Russian attempts to sway the 2016 election in his favour. Mr Trump and Mr Putin have poured scorn on the claims. In a CNBC interview televised on Friday, Mr Trump said he and Mr Putin ""get along well"", even if they did not always see eye to eye. ""It wasn't always conciliatory in that meeting,"" Mr Trump said. ""We discussed lots of great things for both countries, frankly."" He did not offer further details. Mr Trump also vowed to be the Russian leader's ""worst nightmare"" if their relationship ever turns sour, and said former President Barack Obama had been Mr Putin's ""total patsy"". By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump has tweeted that the summit with Mr Putin was a ""great success"" and people at ""higher ends of intelligence"" loved his Helsinki news conference. As if to underline that point, plans are already under way for a sequel - this time in Washington DC. Never mind that the White House has spent three days trying to clean up the political fallout from the summit amid bipartisan criticism, or that the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in 2016 continues apace. This video can not be played Trump says he ""misspoke"" at Putin summit, but is it too late? Anthony Zurcher explains Mr Trump may have been encouraged by recent opinion polling showing that while the public at large is uneasy with Mr Trump's Russia policies, his Republican base - by a sizeable majority - is fine with his performance. The president campaigned on closer ties with Russia, a goal that had been thwarted during his first year in office. With his base still behind him, Mr Trump appears ready to press on with his efforts. Mr Putin, in power in Russia since 2000, last visited the US in 2015, when he met President Barack Obama, Mr Trump's predecessor, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York to discuss the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Mr Putin said he would meet the US ""halfway"" over access to indictees On Thursday, White House press secretarySarah Sanders tweeted,externalthat discussions about a visit by Mr Putin to Washington DC this autumn were already under way. Russia's ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, could not confirm whether an invitation had already been issued. He told the BBC: ""The problem is there's so much talk today, so much fake news, so much distortion, about what happened at this summit. ""Such negativity for some reason - I don't understand why the Western media think it's bad that two presidents are meeting. What's bad about it?"" The announcement of a second summit appeared to come as a surprise to Mr Trump's director of national intelligence. ""Say that again,"" Mr Coats said when an NBC News presenter broke the news to him during a live interview at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. He said he did not yet know what Mr Trump and Mr Putin had discussed during their meeting, at which only the pair and their interpreters were present. The White House is said to be furious about the director of national intelligence's remarks. ""Coats has gone rogue,"" one senior official told the Washington Post. At the post-summit news conference in Helsinki, Mr Putin offered access to 12 Russians indicted in absentia by the US authorities for allegedly hacking Democratic Party computers, on condition Moscow authorities could question 12 Americans over other matters. Mr Trump first praised the suggestion as an ""incredible offer"", but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders later said the president disagreed with it. No extradition treaty exists between the two countries. Mr Putin singled out US-born financier Bill Browder, accusing him of massive tax fraud, which he denies. Mr Browder was instrumental in the US imposing sanctions in 2012 on top Russian officials accused of corruption inthe Magnitsky affair. ""I'm thankful that Donald Trump has no intention of handing me over to Vladimir Putin to have me killed in a Russian prison,"" Mr Browder told the BBC on Thursday. One of the other Americans on Russia's list was a former US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul. This video can not be played Russian ambassadors react to Trump remarks at Helsinki summit The idea of allowing Russia to quiz US citizens sparked outrage and the US Senate voted 98-0 against it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was ""not going to happen"". Mr McFaul tweeted his gratitude to senators. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

London v New York murder rate,"Police in Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where a 17-year old girl was shot dead in a drive-by attack Claim:London has overtaken New York for murders for the first time in modern history after a surge in knife crime across the capital. Verdict:A selective use of statistics from the start of 2018 appears to bear this out - but the reality is that New York still appears to be more violent than London. Criminologists and police chiefs love studying the differences and similarities in violence between big cities because the huge amounts of data can give clues as to what works best to keep people safe. There has been no end of comparisons down the decades of London and New York because, on the face of things, the cities are broadly comparable. They're both cosmopolitan ""world cities"" with broadly similar populations of more than 8 million people. They also have big gaps between rich and poor inhabitants. But there has always been one significant difference: the crime rate. So this weekend'sreport,externalin the Sunday Times, which could be interpreted as suggesting that London was now more dangerous than New York, needs some unpicking. And, as you may have come to expect from BBC Reality Check, the truth is a little more complex. New York police have opened 50 murder files so far this year - this compares with 48 in London According to the newspaper, London overtook New York's ""murder rate"" in February ""as the capital endured a dramatic surge in knife crime"". That is true. The New York Police Department dealt with 11 homicides in February - while London's Metropolitan Police opened investigations into 15 deaths. And in March, there were 22 killings in London and one fewer on the other side of the Atlantic. But that grim month-by-month tally is not quite the whole story. The one thing that's always true about statistics is that there will be blips - sudden rises or falls in the data. These two high months for London could ultimately turn out to be outliers. We don't yet know. But older data shows why we should be cautious. In January, for example, the Met investigated eight murders in London. The NYPD looked into 18 killings. And that means that while Scotland Yard has opened 48 homicide inquiries so far this year, New York has in fact opened 50 murder files. Looking at 2017, the homicide rate per 100,000 population stood at 1.2 in London and 3.4 in New York. While the difference between the two cities has definitely narrowed - the trend is far from fixed. And even older figures are also quite revealing. In 2007, New York witnessed 496 homicides. That was three times more than in London. Last year, the American city suffered 292 killings and London 130. The rate of killings so far this year in London is higher than it was during the same period last year. The fatalities include five shootings and 31 stabbings. Nine of those killed were teenagers and crimes involving knives and sharp instruments across England and Wales are at their highest level since 2011. Why the rate is going up in London, so far this year, is unclear. There's a push for police to stop and search more suspects for weapons after a big fall in the use of the power since 2010. But New York police have also reduced their use of similar powers over the same period - and their murder rate has fallen. New York is definitely a much safer place than in 1990 when there were 2,262 murders. But it's not remotely clear yet that London is becoming more murderous than its American cousin.

Calls for interpreter to testify,"Marina Gross (left) was the only other American in the room with Mr Trump US opposition politicians are calling for Donald Trump's interpreter to testify before Congress about his summit talks with Vladimir Putin. The lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez, called for Marina Gross to be subpoenaed to appear at the committee. Controversy has raged over the summit, with Mr Trump having to correct his own words from the press conference. However, it would be highly unusual for an interpreter to be questioned. At their first bilateral summit, the two leaders met privately for two hours in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday with only their interpreters present. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit Russian praise for Putin after Trump summit Mr Trump went ahead with the meeting despite continuing investigations into alleged Russian state interference in the 2016 US presidential election, which he won. This video can not be played President Trump was bombarded by questions as reporters were asked to leave Confusion over Mr Trump's position took another turn when he appeared to reject suggestions that Russia might try again to influence American elections, prompting a hasty denial by the White House. Democrats argue that because she was the only other American official present in the room, Ms Gross can and should provide details of what the two presidents said to each other. ""We want the interpreter to come before the committee,"" Senator Menendez told MSNBC. ""We want to see the notes. We're going to have a massive effort to try to get to what happened."" Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell said the ""concessions"" Mr Trump had made in public to Mr Putin meant ""Congress and the American public deserve to know the details of their private conversation"". If Ms Gross declined to appear before the committee, she should be subpoenaed, he wrote. ""We need public testimony by the only American present at this meeting to ensure Trump did not further undermine our intelligence or law enforcement communities,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would consider the calls to summon her but questioned the idea. ""They're not policy people,"" he told reporters, as quoted by AFP news agency. ""They are in some cases contract folks. In the future, would any notes even be allowed to be taken if you started doing this kind of thing?"" He also pointed out that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Helsinki with Mr Trump, would be questioned by the committee next week. In Russia, Konstantin Kosachev, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, said  the idea of questioning an interpreter set a dangerous precedent that threatened the ""whole idea of diplomacy"", the Associated Press reports. Gamal Helal, an Arabic interpreter and senior adviser to four US presidents and seven secretaries of state, told CNN he could not remember such a situation. ""It would be a horrible precedent if a president wasn't free to talk one-on-one with a head of state..."" he said. ""If he [Mr Trump] spoke in English, there would be no other way for Congress to know what he said, except to ask the president himself. Or Putin.""

PM to say Brexit plan will deliver for NI,"This video can not be played Theresa May was speaking during a visit to Northern Ireland on Friday The European Union must ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals regarding the Irish border, Theresa May has said. The prime minister made the remarks in Belfast on Friday, during a two-day visit to Northern Ireland. The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in Brexit talks so far. The UK and EU have agreed that there should be no hard border in Ireland, but are at odds over how to achieve it. IMF: Ireland faces hit from 'no deal' Brexit Leadsom: Chequers plan is 'final offer' Barnier questions May's Brexit plan Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The backstop solution is effectively an insurance policy -  to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if appropriate customs arrangements cannot be agreed by the EU and UK in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020. The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. However, the UK said that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea. On Friday, Mrs May again repeated her opposition to that, saying: ""The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal 'third country' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". She also said both sides in the negotiation  ""share a determination never to see a hard border in Northern Ireland"". ""And no technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet, or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border"". However,EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has questioned Mrs May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU,saying it could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. Michel Barnier has asked the UK for clarification on its Brexit White Paper He saidthe UK's Brexit White Paper, published on 12 July, opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"". Mr Barnier questioned whether plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical. Earlier this week, the government backed anamendment to its Customs Billthat would make it illegal for Northern Ireland to be outside the UK's customs territory. Mrs May said the EU's backstop proposal would be a breach of the Belfast Agreement - and that her plan, agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers earlier this month, was the best way forward.

""What I've said to the EU is that the legal text they've produced is not acceptable, that's why we proposed an alternative to that,"" she said. She said there now needed to be a renewed focus on EU-UK negotiations with ""increased pace and intensity"". The prime minister also met several of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the visit was ""anything but reassuring"". Arlene Foster called on the EU to show more flexibility in the negotiations around the border ""In fact it's now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,"" Mrs McDonald said. However, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, defended the prime minister. ""What she has done is set out her agenda, that's very important. She talked about working together to find solutions, and the need to work collaboratively,"" she said. Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the government was committed to getting a legal text for a backstop. Earlier, the Irish TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney tweeted that if the UK did not accept the EU wording on a backstop in the draft withdrawal agreement, they would have to propose an  alternative that would deliver the same result.

Reacting to his comments, Mrs Bradley said while the EU had put forward a legal text, ""we do not accept it"". ""We've put forward a counter proposal and we're now working on how we get a backstop that we are committed to delivering but it has to be a backstop that respects the integrity of the whole UK and does not put a border in the Irish sea."" The PSNI and GardaÃ­ (Irish police) stand exactly on the border in Belleek, County Fermanagh, ahead of Theresa May's visit The Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, told the BBC Labour had always been ""very clear"" that the UK should be part of the customs union. EU and UK negotiators have been meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the border issue. Irish PM steps up Brexit preparations Brexit: All you need to know What do the EU's 'no deal' preparations say? The PM and the DUP leader visited Belleek Pottery near the Irish border on Thursday Friday's speech in Northern Ireland marks the prime minister's first major attempt to sell the Chequers agreement since it was reached by her cabinet earlier this month. She is due to tour other parts of the UK over the summer in an attempt to persuade businesses and citizens of its benefits. Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit. The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards. But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching. The Republic of Ireland will remain within the EU and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"". Mrs May also addressed the impasse at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without a government for 18 months, after power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. She added that until devolution is restored, the government would fulfil its responsibilities but warned interventions from Westminster were ""no substitute"" in the long-term.

Liverpool sign Brazil keeper Alisson,"Alisson played in all of Brazil's matches at the World Cup in Russia Liverpool have made Roma's Alisson the world's most expensive goalkeeper by signing him on a six-year deal. The Reds have not revealed how much they have paid for the Brazil number one but Roma said the deal is worth up to Â£66.8m (72.5m euros). ""In terms of my life and my career, it's a huge step for me being part of this club and this family,"" said the 25-year-old. He has been at Roma for two years, playing 37 Serie A games in 2017-18. Why Alisson is the 'keeper of the future' Roma defend decision to sell Alisson to Liverpool Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he has signed ""a real personality"". ""At one point in the last few weeks it came up, the opportunity to sign one of the world's best goalkeepers,"" he added. ""The owners were quite excited, so we did it. ""He has nothing to do with the price, we have nothing to do with the price. It's the market, that's how it is and we will not think a lot about it. ""He needs to adapt to the English Premier League. The league is different, the refs are different, the goalkeeper's life is different in the Premier League. ""We got him here because of his existing strengths, which is in all goalkeeper departments the highest level."" Alisson said the move was a ""dream come true"" and revealed Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah, who he used to play with at Roma, had sent him a message before he completed the move to Anfield. ""Yesterday, he sent me a message saying: 'Hey, what are you waiting for?' As the negotiations were at an advanced stage, I replied to him straight away saying: 'Calm down, I'm on my way!' ""I'm really happy to have the opportunity to play alongside him again. As well as being a great player, he is a huge character and a great person - which is the most important thing."" Alisson is Liverpool's fourth major signing since they finished the 2017-18 season fourth in the Premier League and were beaten by Real Madrid in the Champions League final. Brazil midfielder Fabinho, 24, has joined from Monaco in a deal which could beworth more than Â£40m,while Guinea midfielder Naby Keita, 23, has moved to the Merseyside club from German side RB Leipzig in aÂ£48m deal. Liverpool have also signed Switzerland forward Xherdan Shaqiri, 26, from Stoke City after triggering hisÂ£13m release clause.

Ryanair pilot strikes set to go ahead,"Ryanair is to cancel 16 flights to and from the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday, affecting 2,500 passengers, because of a strike by pilots. The action, by Ireland-based pilots. has already led to two 24-hour strikes, with 4,000 passengers being affected by flight cancellations on Friday. The pilots' union said that talks on Wednesday between the two sides did not lead to any ""material change"". The union is in dispute with Ryanair over pay and conditions. The pilots' concerns are centred on Ryanair's proposals on seniority, as well as procedures for the allocation of base transfers, promotions and annual leave. Late on Thursday, Ryanair tweeted a copy of a letter from its chief people officer Eddie Wilson to the national secretary of the FÃ³rsa trade union, which includes Irish Airline Pilots' Association .

In it Mr Wilson said that following Wednesday's meeting between the airline and the union ""nothing has progressed"". ""It is unacceptable that 24 hours later we have had no response from FÃ³rsa, and find ourselves with a threatened third day of strike action next Tuesday."" On Friday, Ryanair tweeted that this strike action meant it would cancel 16 of more than 290 Irish flights on Tuesday, 24 July. The carrier added that all 2,500 passengers affected had been notified by email or text message, and would be ""readily re-accommodated (or refunded)"" on other Ryanair flights over the next seven days.

Ninety-nine percent of the airline's directly-employed Republic of Ireland-based pilots voted in favour of action, but Ryanair said that they make up just 25% of its Irish flight crew. Most pilots flying for Ryanair are self-employed, which is why the airline is able to continue most flights. Separately, Ryanair cabin crew are also due to go on strike on 25 and 26 July. The airline has cancelled up to 600 flights over what it calls the cabin crew's ""unjustified"" action. Almost 50,000 customers flying from airports in Belgium, Portugal and Spain were affected, but earlier the airline tweeted that more than 85% of them had been ""re-accommodated"" on alternative flights or had applied for full refunds.

Mystery black sarcophagus opened in Egypt,"Experts wore face masks to open the sarcophagus, which released a terrible smell Three weeks ago, archaeologists in Egypt found a massive black granite sarcophagus in Alexandria, untouched for 2,000 years - and fleet-footed rumour quickly got to work. Could it contain the remains of ancient Macedonian leader Alexander the Great, or (less appealingly) a deadly curse? According to experts who have now unsealed it, it's a no to both. Instead, it revealed three skeletons and red-brown sewage water, which gave off an unbearable stench. Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities had appointed a committee of archaeologists to open the relic, which was unearthed at a construction site. According to Egyptian news outlet El-Watan, they initially lifted the lid of the tomb by just 5cm (2 inches) before the pungent smell forced them from the inspection scene entirely. They later prised it open with help from Egyptian military engineers. ""We found the bones of three people, in what looks like a family burial... Unfortunately the mummies inside were not in the best condition and only the bones remain,"" said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. The tomb was found to contain three skeletons, believed to be those of ancient Egyptian army officers Addressing media fears that disturbing the tomb could trigger an implacable Pharaoh's curse, Mr Waziri declared:  ""We've opened it and, thank God, the world has not fallen into darkness. ""I was the first to put my whole head inside the sarcophagus... and here I stand before you ... I am fine."" Where does the legend of the mummy come from? Despite that, the site has now been cleared of people amid fears the sarcophagus could release lethal toxic fumes, Egypt's state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram says. Scientists have debunked the infamous ""Mummy's Curse"", but are there other threats in ancient tombs? Lord Carnarvon, financial backer of the excavation of Tutankhamun's burial site, died from an infected mosquito bite shortly after they opened the chamber in 1923. Since then, rumours have swirled that mould or bacteria survived in the sealed area and caused or contributed to his fate. But F DeWolfe Miller, professor of epidemiology at the University of Hawaii, told National Geographic that there's no real danger. ""We don't know of even a single case of either an archaeologist or a tourist experiencing any negative consequences [from bacteria or tomb moulds],""he told the magazine,external. Experts have said the three individuals in the Alexandria sarcophagus may have been soldiers in the time of the Pharaohs. The skull of one is said to show cracks which point to an arrow injury. Tomb of ancient priestess found in Egypt 'Message from afterlife' in Egypt tomb An alabaster bust, its features weathered beyond recognition, was also found with the tomb. The huge sarcophagus weighs almost 30 tonnes The structure is almost two metres (6.5ft) high and three metres long, and is the largest of its kind ever found intact. It weighs in at 27 tonnes (59,500lb), and is believed to date from the early Ptolemaic period, which began in 323 BC after the death of Alexander the Great. Archaeologists will now study the sarcophagus in depth to pinpoint when its occupants lived, and how they died.

Alternative cancer therapy survival risk,"Cancer patients who use alternative therapies may be more likely to shun conventional treatments and risk their chances of survival, research suggests. A study of 1,290 patients in the US found people who received such therapies often refused life-saving care such as chemotherapy or surgery. Fewer of them survived five years after starting treatment compared to those on standard care, researchers found. Experts urged patients not to ditch proven cancer medicines. 'Remarkable' therapy beats terminal breast cancer Cancer delays 'leave patients at risk' Researchers said the use of alternative therapies, which include certain diets, minerals and vitamin infusions, was growing in the US but there was limited research on how effective they are. Theirstudy, published in JAMA Oncology,external, looked at 258 patients who had used these therapies with at least one standard treatment, compared to 1,032 who only received conventional care. The study found a smaller proportion of those who received such treatment had survived five years after beginning treatment - 82.2% compared to 86.6%. Separately, they were found to be more than twice as likely to die at any point over the course of the nine-year study, as a result of either refusing or delaying standard treatment. Comparing people who received alternative therapies with those who did not, the report found: 34% refused chemotherapy compared to 3.2% 53% refused radiotherapy compared to 2.3% 7% refused surgery compared to 0.1% Experts said it was important not to replace conventional treatments with alternative therapies The paper's authors said it was likely the results for those who used alternative therapies would have been worse were it not for the fact that they were a group that had better cancer survival chances to begin with. As a group, they were more likely to be women, younger, more affluent and healthier, the study's authors noted. Although researchers linked the lower chances of survival to refusing or delaying standard treatments, lead author Dr Skyler Johnson, from Yale School of Medicine, told the BBC it was also possible some alternative therapies could interact with conventional treatments and make them less effective. The study did not include data on the exact therapies people used. But Dr Johnson said they were more likely to be alternative medicines - treatments that lack clear scientific evidence and are often used in place of conventional care - rather than complementary therapies like yoga or massage, which are usually used alongside standard treatments. ""The reality is despite the fact that many patients believe that these types of unproven therapies will improve their survival and possibly even improve their chances of a cure, there's really no evidence to support that claim..."" said Dr Johnson. ""Although they may be used to support patients experiencing symptoms from cancer treatment, it looks as though they are either being marketed or understood to be effective cancer treatments."" Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head information nurse, said complementary medicine might help improve wellbeing or quality of life for some patients. ""But it is important that patients considering them do not see them as an alternative to conventional treatments that have been shown though clinical trials to make a real difference to survival,"" he said. Prof Arnie Purushotham, director at King's Health Partners Comprehensive Cancer Centre, said there was a clear difference between alternative therapies and complementary treatments. ""The medical community is united in agreeing that alternate therapy is not an effective means of treating cancer patients. ""However, there is increasing evidence that complementary therapy like acupuncture, yoga and relaxation therapy may be beneficial in alleviating cancer patients' symptoms like pain and fatigue.""

Former GP 'hired hitman' over debt,"Dr Crichton admitted entering Mr Bolden's address on to a website but no money was paid A former GP tried to hire a hitman to murder a financial adviser who he blamed for ""ruining his life"", a court has heard. Dr David Crichton, 64, placed an order to kill Andrew Bolden on a secret website for contract killers, Winchester Crown Court was told. The former Bournemouth doctor denies attempting to solicit murder. He has also pleaded not guilty to three counts of sending Mr Bolden malicious communications. Simon Jones, prosecuting, said officers from the National Crime Agency had found Mr Bolden's name on a site on the 'dark web', which is not accessible to conventional browsers. The barrister said the site enabled hitmen to apply for contracts offered by customers, to carry out tasks ranging from arson to murder. Dr Crichton, of Cawdor Road, admitted he had entered Mr Bolden's details, including his Edinburgh address, on a 'dark web' site in February 2017, Mr Jones said. The former GP then selected an option labelled ""kill the bastard"", although no money was paid and the matter did not progress any further, the court was told. The defendant blamed the adviser for causing him a Â£300,000 loss and the breakdown of his marriage, the jury heard. Dr Crichton had previously waged a five-year ""campaign of harassment"", through numerous phone calls and emails to the adviser's firm, Brown Shipley, Mr Jones said. The ""vendetta"" escalated to the point where Dr Crichton threatened three times to take his own life, the court heard. The two texts and a phone call in February and March 2017 amounted to malicious threats to Mr Bolden, Mr Jones said. The barrister said investigations by financial authorities into the advice given to Dr Crichton had shown that Mr Bolden was not at fault for the tax penalty he later incurred. The trial continues.

Australia tycoon quits citing mental health,"James Packer won praise for publicly acknowledging mental health struggles Australian billionaire James Packer has quit 22 company directorships in recent weeks, in a retreat from business that began with his acknowledgement of mental health issues. The move follows a decision in March to resign from the board of Crown Resorts, in which he was a major shareholder. Mr Packer, 50, was among Australia's most high-profile businessmen, with an estimated worth of Â£2.3bn ($4.1bn). In 2016 he separated from singer Mariah Carey, breaking off their engagement. The split is believed to have contributed to a tumultuous period in the businessman's life, in which he was also caught up ina scandal involving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His private company, Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), said in a statement on Friday: ""The [company] changes are largely administrative in nature and reflect attempts to modernise and simplify the corporate structures."" Mr Packer's spokesman announced in March that he was dealing with mental health issues, a public statement for which he won praise from some business figures. ""This makes Packer a lonely figure in business, but at the same time a brave and important one,"" John Brogden, chairman of Australian crisis support service Lifeline,wrote in The Australian Financial Review,external. Business leaders are often reluctant to reveal mental health illnesses because of ""how that would be perceived by the markets or by their colleagues"", Mr Brogden said. Magnate's exit puts focus on mental health Mr Packer became one of Australia's richest people after his father, prominent media tycoon Kerry Packer, died in 2005. He sold the publishing and television empire he inherited to form casino firm Crown. He served on the boards of some of Australia's biggest companies, including the airline Qantas. He first stepped down from the board of Crown in 2015, before rejoining last year after the company exited its Macau and US investments, and switched its focus back to Australia. But he rejoined the board amid the fallout from thejailing of 16 Crown employees in China for illegally promoting gambling. He was also forced last year to abandon an attempt to break into the Las Vegas casino business, and he ended his partnership with producer Brett Ratner in RatPac Entertainment. He quit the board of CPH on 27 June. Corporate records show he resigned from 19 other directorships on the same day, and another two since.

Slower ocean current to boost warming,"The prospect of the Gulf Stream slowing down and even stopping altogether has worried many experts in recent years. Some believed that this would cause a rapid cooling around the world with resulting global chaos. But anew study,externalfinds the Gulf Stream go-slow will have a significant impact on planetary temperatures, but not in a chilled out way. The Gulf Stream is an ocean current that keeps the UK warmer than it would be given its latitude alone. Researchers say a slower current will carry less heat down to the deep oceans meaning more will enter the atmosphere. Worries over the fate of theAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,external(Amoc), of which the Gulf Stream is part, were graphically illustrated in the 2004 film, The Day After Tomorrow. It focused on a sudden collapse of the Amoc caused by global warming leading to a disastrous freezing and the dawning of a new ice age. So much for Hollywood - the reality according to the corresponding author of this new study is very different. ""The headlines have said that the Gulf Stream is collapsing and the Ice Age is coming sooner than scientists think,"" Prof Ka-Kit Tung from the University of Washington told BBC News. ""The answer from our work is no to both of them."" Baby snake fossil 'frozen in time' Are young people going cool on cars? Welcome to the Meghalayan Age Instead Prof Tung and his colleague, Xianyao Chen from the Ocean University of China, have reconstructed what's happened with the flow of the Amoc over the past 70 years. They found a natural pattern with declines, flat periods and increases over the decades. It's a powerful ocean current that is part of the Amoc and it flows from the Gulf of Mexico, around Florida and up along the east coast of the US, before crossing the Atlantic towards Ireland, the UK and Europe. For decades we've believed that the Gulf Stream and the Amoc were like a giant hot water bottle, keeping Europe and the Eastern US warm in the winter. It's believed that the impact was as much as 5C, keeping London and Western Europe far less cold than say parts of Canada which are at the same latitude. But this new study indicates that the Amoc plays a far more important role as a massive global heat distribution system than it does in keeping Europeans toasty. A colourised satellite image showing the Gulf Stream It works like this - The warm waters from tropical regions are carried up to the North Atlantic where the current sinks them deep into the oceans, with cooler waters then returning south in their stead. When the Amoc current moves faster, more of the heat that is trapped in our atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels is taken and stored up to 1,500m below the surface of the ocean. When it slows down, less heat is sequestered in the seas and so our land surface temperatures increase. When the Amoc was at a minimum between 1975 and 1998, more heat entered the atmosphere and global temperatures gradually went up. When the current started to accelerate from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, and sink more heat it coincided with a so-called slowdown in the pace of global warming. Now the authors say that the big decline is Amoc flow since 2004 means less heat going into the waters and more into the air, leading to higher global temperatures. And that is likely to continue. The flow of ocean currents around the world ""It is difficult to predict changes,"" said Prof Tung. ""But under the scenario that greenhouse gas forcing hasn't changed much, it would be comparable to the warming in that period of 1975-1998, if slightly lower, but it's comparable."" That's unlikely according to this study. ""We think that the decline of Amoc is reaching the minimum and if history repeats, we will think this one will last about two decades."" ""Where we have direct measurements, such as off the coast of Florida, the measurements there have flattened since 2011. In the northern Atlantic it is still declining."" While the waters of the North Atlantic will definitely cool as a result of changes in the flow, the experts says it's likely that the UK will see continued impacts of climate change over the next 20 years according to this study. ""The air temperatures globally will be warming and there's no barrier for that so there won't be much cooling in the UK, you will probably still see the normal global warming,"" said Prof Tung.

Poundworld to disappear from High Street,"Poundworld has announced the closure of its remaining 190 stores with the loss of 2,339 jobs. The discount goods retailer, which went into administration in June, said the stores would close by 10 August. In total the collapse of the chain, which had 335 stores, will result in the loss of 5,100 jobs. Administrators, Deloitte, said they would continue discussions with interested parties to try to sell the shops which were still open. However, the longer that process continues the less likely it is that a buyer will be found. Poundworld's head office and warehouse in Normanton in West Yorkshire are set to close on Friday, and 299 jobs will be lost there. Five things to do with empty retail space Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Six shops defying the High Street downturn The discount chain, founded in 1974, went into administration  in early June after struggling with tough competition on the High Street from rivals including Poundland and Poundstretcher. It was also hit by the fall in the value of the pound after the 2016 Brexit referendum, which has pushed up the price of imported goods. Poundworld is not the only casualty on the UK High Street this year. Squeezed consumer incomes, online competition, rising overheads and too many shops have put pressure on a string of retailers. Maplin and Toys R Us have both gone into administration. Other High Street names, including Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser, Carphone Warehouse, New Look and Carpetright, have announced significant store closures.

'Dangerous complacency' to HIV epidemic,"A ""dangerous complacency"" in the response to the global HIV pandemic is risking a resurgence of the disease, according to a report. Experts said a stalling of HIV funding in recent years was endangering efforts to control the illness. As things stand, the world is no longer on course to end the pandemic by 2030 - a target agreed by UN member states,say experts in The Lancet,external. They call for urgent changes in how the disease is treated and controlled. HIV vaccine shows promise in human trial HIV life expectancy now 'near normal' About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids. And there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. New cases of HIV/Aids have been falling in recent years. But the Lancet Commission said the fall was happening too slowly to reach the UNAids target of 500,000 new infections by 2020. While HIV rates were falling overall, they remained persistent in marginalised groups, younger people - particularly women - and in developing countries, all of whom were less likely to access treatment, the commission said. Experts said HIV funding had remained flat in recent years, at about Â£14.7bn - roughly Â£5.4bn short of the estimated amount needed to achieve the UNAids targets. Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International Aids Society and professor at University of Cape Town, South Africa, said: ""Despite the remarkable progress of the HIV response, the situation has stagnated in the past decade. ""Reinvigorating this work will be demanding - but the future health and wellbeing of millions of people require that we meet this challenge."" The Lancet Commission also called for more collaboration between health professionals and for HIV treatment to become better incorporated into other areas of healthcare. This would mean an end to HIV ""exceptionalism"", where specific funding and services have been provided for HIV alone, and could include combining HIV screening with screening for other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. In India, for example, if HIV testing and treatments were combined with those for syphilis among women sex workers and gay men it could reduce the number of new HIV cases at a national-level by 7% between 2018 and 2028, the report estimated. ""Health systems must be designed to meet the needs of the people they serve, including having the capacity to address multiple health problems simultaneously,"" Prof Chris Beyrer said. ""No-one can be left behind in our efforts to achieve sustainable health."" Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

Dairy Milk to offer low sugar version,"A staple of lunch boxes and peckish workers across the UK - Cadbury's Dairy Milk - will come in a low-sugar version from next year. The new bar will contain 30% less sugar, a bigger reduction than the government had requested. However, the full-sugar version will continue to be sold as usual. Last year, Public Health England (PHE) challenged the food industry to reduce sugar levels by a fifth by 2020, or reduce the size of unhealthy products. Will the soft drink sugar tax work? Child obesity plan targets sweets at checkouts Kit-Kat sees 10% sugar reduction Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, said it was committed to tackling obesity, including childhood obesity, in the UK. However, health campaigners said that Cadbury and other firms should go further. ""We're surprised Cadbury is offering a new lower sugar chocolate bar yet not reformulating the whole of its product range,"" said Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at Action on Sugar. She said confectionary makers should be forced to make their products with lower sugar and fat content. ""For those manufacturers who don't comply, a tax of 20% (minimum) should be added to all their sweet and chocolate confectionery,"" Ms Hashem said. School children examine a display showing how much sugar is in soft drinks and juices Earlier this year, the government introduced a sugar tax on soft drinks, but some have called for high-sugar foods to be taxed as well. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has argued in favour of mandatory controls on unhealthy food. Many drinks manufacturers, including AG Barr - which makes Irn Bru - and Britvic havereduced sugar levels since the tax came in in April. Britvic says that 94% of its drinks portfolio is sugar-tax exempt. The levy starts to take effect at 5g of sugar per 100ml. A spokesperson for Mondelez said the new bars would taste ""subtly different"" to the full-sugar version, but they would ""maintain the same taste profile"". The company has already introduced a 250 calorie cap on all small chocolate bars, and sells a Dairy Milk bar with 98 calories. Some BBC staff put the new lower sugar bar to the test. Were they able to tell the difference between this and the original? Here's what they said: Lovely - very similar. But for full aficionados of Dairy Milk the full sticky sweetness is missing I was rather surprised! It tasted almost identical.  Except it does leave an after taste (still tasting it now) that's not so pleasant! I'm struggling to describe what this is.  It's like that after taste from fake sugar productsâ¦. If that makes sense? It's less sweet (unsurprisingly). In standard Dairy Milk the sugar masks the fact that it's not actually very good chocolate. And in the reduced sugar version there's nowhere to hide. And if it's not lower calorie, what is the point? The low sugar chocolate bar tasted a tiny bit bitter, but it was still nice. You could taste a lot more of the coco bean because the taste wasn't being masked by sugar. It tastes really totally normal! Next year it also plans to reduce the amount of sugar in Wine Gums and Jelly Babies. Tam Fry chairman of the National Obesity Forum said he was very encouraged by such moves. He said that firms like Cadbury have ""seen the writing on the wall"" after thegovernment introduced a sugar levy on drinks earlier this year. ""There is a real push for confectionary manufacturers to reformulate their products so that we get the quantity of sugar down as far as possible,"" he said.

'I carried Grenfell girl down nine floors'Firefighter Harry Bettinson was still on probation at the time of the Grenfell Tower fire.UK,"A firefighter who was still on probation at the time of the Grenfell Tower disaster has told the inquiry how he rescued a young girl from the blaze. Harry Bettinson strapped an oxygen mask to the girl, thought to be four or five, and carried her down nine floors to safety as her mother followed. He said he became aware they were ""running out of time"" as he could see ""fireballs and flaming arrows"" outside. He was giving evidence at thepublic inquiry into the 2017 disaster. In a written statement, Mr Bettinson explained how he had waited with the pair inside a ninth floor flat while his colleagues went to get extra breathing equipment. He said: ""We put one of the new sets on the mum so she was wearing it on her back. ""Then got a spare mask set out and I hooked this up to my spare hose so the little girl would be breathing my air.

"Alternative cancer therapy survival riskCancer patients who receive complementary therapies are more likely to shun proven treatments, a study finds.Health","Cancer patients who use alternative therapies may be more likely to shun conventional treatments and risk their chances of survival, research suggests. A study of 1,290 patients in the US found people who received such therapies often refused life-saving care such as chemotherapy or surgery. Fewer of them survived five years after starting treatment compared to those on standard care, researchers found. Experts urged patients not to ditch proven cancer medicines. 'Remarkable' therapy beats terminal breast cancer Cancer delays 'leave patients at risk' Researchers said the use of alternative therapies, which include certain diets, minerals and vitamin infusions, was growing in the US but there was limited research on how effective they are. Theirstudy, published in JAMA Oncology,external, looked at 258 patients who had used these therapies with at least one standard treatment, compared to 1,032 who only received conventional care. The study found a smaller proportion of those who received such treatment had survived five years after beginning treatment - 82.2% compared to 86.6%. Separately, they were found to be more than twice as likely to die at any point over the course of the nine-year study, as a result of either refusing or delaying standard treatment. Comparing people who received alternative therapies with those who did not, the report found: 34% refused chemotherapy compared to 3.2% 53% refused radiotherapy compared to 2.3% 7% refused surgery compared to 0.1% Experts said it was important not to replace conventional treatments with alternative therapies The paper's authors said it was likely the results for those who used alternative therapies would have been worse were it not for the fact that they were a group that had better cancer survival chances to begin with. As a group, they were more likely to be women, younger, more affluent and healthier, the study's authors noted. Although researchers linked the lower chances of survival to refusing or delaying standard treatments, lead author Dr Skyler Johnson, from Yale School of Medicine, told the BBC it was also possible some alternative therapies could interact with conventional treatments and make them less effective. The study did not include data on the exact therapies people used. But Dr Johnson said they were more likely to be alternative medicines - treatments that lack clear scientific evidence and are often used in place of conventional care - rather than complementary therapies like yoga or massage, which are usually used alongside standard treatments. ""The reality is despite the fact that many patients believe that these types of unproven therapies will improve their survival and possibly even improve their chances of a cure, there's really no evidence to support that claim..."" said Dr Johnson. ""Although they may be used to support patients experiencing symptoms from cancer treatment, it looks as though they are either being marketed or understood to be effective cancer treatments."" Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head information nurse, said complementary medicine might help improve wellbeing or quality of life for some patients. ""But it is important that patients considering them do not see them as an alternative to conventional treatments that have been shown though clinical trials to make a real difference to survival,"" he said. Prof Arnie Purushotham, director at King's Health Partners Comprehensive Cancer Centre, said there was a clear difference between alternative therapies and complementary treatments. ""The medical community is united in agreeing that alternate therapy is not an effective means of treating cancer patients. ""However, there is increasing evidence that complementary therapy like acupuncture, yoga and relaxation therapy may be beneficial in alleviating cancer patients' symptoms like pain and fatigue.""

Plan to teach all children first aid,"School children in England will have to learn first aid under proposals put forward by the government. Draft legislation,externalsays primary school children will be taught basic first aid, such as dealing with head injuries and calling emergency services. Secondary school children will learn life-saving skills such as CPR and the purpose of defibrillators. The British Heart Foundation said the move would improve ""shockingly low survival rates from cardiac arrests"". Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wanted to give young people ""the tools they need to be ready to thrive when they leave school"". The plan was announced aspart of new guidelines on relationships and health education in schools. Parents set to lose right to veto sex education at age 15 Charities call for compulsory first aid training call The BHF said that fewer than one in 10 people survive cardiac arrests suffered outside of hospital, with 10,000 people in the UK dying each year as a result. Survival rates in countries that teach first aid in school are up to three times higher, the BHF said. Research by the British Red Cross, which also campaigns on the issue, found that 95% of British adults would not be able to provide aid in ""three of the most life-threatening first aid emergencies"". Mike Adamson, the charity's chief executive, said teaching children ""simple yet vital first aid skills"" would save lives. The government's decision comes after Lord Kerslake's inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017 found members of the public tried to help the injured and dying but lacked the requisite skills. The report into the blast, which killed 22 people, praised the public response. But the inquiry raised concerns that people on the scene were ""trying their very best in genuinely harrowing circumstances"" but ""did not appear familiar with first aid principles"". The draft legislation also outlinesplans to let 15-year-olds overrule their parents' wishes and opt-in to sex educationlessons they have previously been withdrawn from. Mr Hinds said children should be able to request sex education in at least one of the three terms before their 16th birthday. Until then, parents will retain the right to withdraw their children.

Windrush compensation 'could be capped',"Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced proposals for the Windrush compensation scheme on Thursday Compensation promised to the victims of the Windrush scandal could be capped under government proposals. Launching a 12-week consultation on a compensation scheme, the Home Office said a cap would ensure no-one got a ""disproportionately high payment"". But Labour said some victims had been left destitute and needed urgent help. Many migrants from Commonwealth countries were wrongly declared illegal immigrants, despite having been granted permission to settle in the UK. Who are the Windrush generation? Immigration removal targets 'to be axed' Sixty-three Windrush migrants 'removed' As a result some were threatened with deportation, the loss of their jobs, and others were denied benefits and healthcare on the NHS. Migrants from the Commonwealth Caribbean were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s. In May it was revealed that at least 63 members of the Windrush generation - named after the boat that brought the first Caribbean migrants to the UK - had been wrongfully removed since 2002. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Under the proposed compensation scheme, fees from unsuccessful immigration applications could be compensated. The refusal of benefits payments, denial of healthcare on the NHS, and issues with social housing would also be considered under the proposed scheme. But in its current form these payments would be capped to ""ensure that no individual receives a disproportionately high payment from the public purse"". The government has also suggested a ""minimum size of claim"" to avoid high costs on processing ""low value claims"". ""We believe that both these measures would help to avoid any excessively high payments and protect the taxpayer from processing very low value claims,"" the proposal said. The compensation scheme will also take into account stress, anxiety and depression that was caused to individuals uncertain of whether they would be allowed to live in the UK. Eligibility for compensation would mirror the Windrush Scheme, which was set up by the Home Office to help migrants establish their lawful status. This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Today marks an important milestone in our efforts to right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation - who have made such a massive contribution to the UK."" He added he hoped it would ""help to right the wrongs suffered by those of the Windrush generation who have faced difficulties and suffered losses as a result of measures that are in place to tackle illegal immigration"". The consultation will run for 12 weeks and people and those affected are encouraged to give their views. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Mr Javid and said victims ""cannot wait until October for a consultation to be concluded on the government's promised compensation scheme"". She added that victims had been left ""destitute"" by the scandal, and accused the government of ""dragging its feet"". Windrush: Who exactly was on board? What is Windrush Day?

New Brexit secretary to 'intensify' talks,"The UK's new Brexit secretary has offered to meet Michel Barnier throughout August to ""intensify"" talks and ""get some energy"" into them. Dominic Raab said his first meeting with the EU's chief negotiator in Brussels had been ""constructive"". He replaced David Davis, who quit in protest at Theresa May's trade policy. It comes as the IMF says some EU countries will suffer significant economic damage if the UK leaves without a trade deal. Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit. The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards. Cliff-edge Brexit fears back in boardrooms IMF: Ireland faces hit from 'no deal' Brexit Theresa May to visit NI to discuss Brexit Baptism of fire for UK's new Brexit minister But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching. The UK government is standing by its belief that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - and is set to issue advice to businesses on how to cope with that eventuality. Leo Varadkar has said his government is preparing for a no deal Brexit The European Commission hasissued a paper,externalinstructing other EU states to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Possible consequences, the paper says, include disruption to the aviation industry and goods from the UK being subject to custom checks. According to the IMF analysis, the organisation's first since the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, 0.7% of the EU workforce could lose their jobs and economic growth could fall by 1.5%. Ireland, which has the closest trade ties with the UK, would be the worst hit, according to the IMF report. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"". Mr Varadkar said that - even if there is a deal - Ireland will need 1,000 new customs officers and veterinary inspectors to deal with changes in trade rules with the UK. By BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made. Read Chris's full piece Speaking to MPs before setting off for Brussels, Mr Raab said he hoped Mr Barnier would ""fully support"" the proposals for post-Brexit trade with the EU in the government's White Paper. And addressing the press as he began his first meeting with Mr Barnier, the MP -  who was a leading figure in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU - vowed to get ""best deal for Britain"" and to tackle talks with ""renewed energy, vigour and vim"". Mr Barnier said it was a ""matter of urgency"" to agree on a ""backstop"" plan to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland if no deal is agreed - and said a ""close partnership"" on security was ""more important than ever given the geopolitical context"". Mr Raab's trip to Brussels comes with debate raging within the Conservative Party about what Brexit should look like. On Wednesday, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who also quit over the proposals presented to the cabinet at Chequers - used his resignation speech to accuse Theresa May of ""dithering"" over the UK's strategy for leaving the EU. ""It is not too late to save Brexit"", he said, calling for the government to ""change tack"". Former Remain supporters, on the other hand, were furious when the government changed its Customs Bill this week to comply with the demands of a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs. The EU says it will analyse the Chequers proposals, which were set out in full in a White Paper, before coming up with a response.

Overnight queue for breakfast club,"Parents brought folding chairs, magazines and snacks Dozens of parents queued up outside a Cardiff school from the early hours of the morning in a bid to secure their children a place at its breakfast club. Parents arrived at Ysgol y Berllan Deg prepared for a long wait with folding chairs, magazines and snacks. The school in the Llanedeyrn area of Cardiff has 100 breakfast club places which are in high demand and allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. Parent Leanne Taylor said she had been outside the school since 03:30 BST. ""This is my second year doing this... if I didn't get a place in breakfast club it would be impossible for me to continue in my job,"" she said. She said the morning build up of traffic on her daily commute meant a place was essential. ""If I drop my daughter off at eight I can get in by quarter past, half past,"" she said. ""If I dropped her off at nine I'm unlikely to start work until round 10 o'clock and I don't think my managers would be as understanding as they are right now."" Leanne Taylor queued up for a second year in a row for breakfast club The Welsh Government's free breakfast scheme,,externalwhich started in 2004, is designed to give children the opportunity of a breakfast at school every morning.

Theresa May visits Irish border,"DUP leader Arlene Foster accompanied the prime minister during her visit to Belleek, Fermanagh The prime minister has begun a two-day visit to Northern Ireland in Belleek, County Fermanagh. It is Theresa May's first appearance on the Irish border since the Brexit referendum. She is speaking to businesses along the border and talking to political leaders about the deadlock at Stormont. The government's White Paper on Brexit has promised to maintain a frictionless border on the island of Ireland. The sticking point in the EU-UK negotiations, so far, has been around the proposed customs backstop - an arrangement that will apply to the Irish border after Brexit, if a wider deal or technological solution cannot keep it as frictionless as it is now. Theresa May and Arlene Foster visiting Belleek Pottery in County Fermanagh During her visit, the prime minister is also due to speak to young people in Belfast about Northern Ireland's future. Mrs May said she looked forward to hearing from cross-border businesses about Brexit. ""I fully recognise how their livelihoods, families and friends rely on the ability to move freely across the border to trade, live and work on a daily basis,"" she said. ""That's why we have ruled out any kind of hard border. Daily journeys will continue to be seamless and there will be no checks or infrastructure at the border to get in the way of this."" It is Theresa May's first visit to the Irish border since the Brexit referendum DUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed the prime minister to Fermanagh, saying Mrs May will hear ""how people see both challenges and opportunities for their sectors as we leave the EU"". Mrs Foster said her party wants ""a sensible exit from the EU"" that works for the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""That must mean that our national parliament takes back control of our laws, borders and money and that there are no new internal barriers created inside the United Kingdom,"" she added.

Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI South West reporter There was a smattering of applause as Theresa May got out of her car at Belleek Pottery. All day, security had been building in the border village in anticipation of her arrival. She is meeting local business people to hear their concerns about what Brexit may mean in this village where the border crossings happen countless times every day. Postmistress and shop owner Michelle Gallagher said she hoped to give the PM a copy of the Belleek calendar for next year, which contains the details of all the local businesses. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said Mrs May's visit to the Irish border was long overdue. Speaking ahead of her arrival, Mrs O'Neill accused the prime minister of attempting to renege on the commitments she made in December. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said Theresa May will see dismay and alarm among those who live along the border ""Two years on from the Brexit Referendum and Theresa May has finally decided to make a visit to a border constituency. ""She will hear at first hand the catastrophic implications for our economy, our rights and our future. The fears that businesses have for their future survival.  The justified fears of individuals in relation to the diminution of their rights. ""She will hear the dismay and alarm that exists here in this community.""

Morrisons introduces weekly quiet hour,"This video can not be played BBC Breakfast's Tim Muffett goes shopping with Joanne Tang and her son Oscar, who has autism Supermarket chain Morrisons has introduced a weekly ""quieter hour"" for autistic shoppers who struggle with music and noise. Its 439 UK stores will dim lights, turn music off, avoid using the tannoy and turn check-out beeps down on Saturdays from 09:00 to 10:00. It is believed to be the first supermarket chain to roll out the scheme to all stores nationwide. The National Autistic Society says it is a ""step in the right direction"". The charity is encouraging retailers to take part in a nationwide ""autism hour"" in October. Toy shop The Entertainer holds ""quiet hours"" during the first hour of opening every Saturday, when staff turn off in-store music in the company's 145 UK stores to ""create a more welcoming environment for children with autism"". Asda said a number of its supermarkets across the country worked with local groups to run quiet hours on a regular basis. It added it was working with specialist charity groups to ensure its stores were inclusive for all. One of its stores in Manchesterfirst introduced the scheme in 2016. Tesco said it was not planning on rolling out the initiative nationwide, but store managers were welcome to introduce it if they felt it appropriate -as one store in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, did last year. And Sainsbury's said more than 600 of its stores took part in the National Autistic Society's Autism Hour in October last year and will be doing so again this year. In three of its Liverpool-based stores, where staff have received training, parents can request a number of store modifications when they begin their shopping trip, it added. Also, a relaxed shopping lane in its Prestwick store has been trialled and will now become a permanent fixture there. 'Autism Hour' helps cut shopping stress What is autism? The Morrisons scheme was introduced following a trial earlier this year in its Lincoln, Woking and Gainsborough stores. Angela Gray, Morrisons community champion at Woking, who has an autistic child herself said she'd found the changes made a ""real difference"". Stores will put signs up during the hour to let other customers know about the scheme and to highlight that it is meant to be a calm environment for shoppers. The movement of trolleys and baskets will also be reduced, it says. Charlotte King, whose three-year-old son Darcy is undergoing diagnosis for autism, said the initiative was ""amazing"", making it ""far less stressful"" for adults with autism and parents of children with the condition. ""I personally avoid taking him anywhere in shopping malls,"" said the mum-of-two, from Hartley-Wintney in Hampshire. ""It is the noise, the lights, it is tannoys. It is too much for him to take in. It looks like you are a bad parent with a naughty child. ""Parents will be more relaxed knowing there will be people there that understand and won't judge them, this will help reduce anxiety levels for everyone."" Mum-of-three Jody Worrell said the scheme was a ""great start"" but more could be done Jody Worrell, who has two teenagers with autism, called the scheme a ""great start"" but said there was more to the condition than just dealing with the sensory aspect. The mum-of-three, from Sittingbourne in Kent, said: ""My son is 16, he finds it incredibly difficult to go in to a shop. He said today it is too noisy and busy. ""His issue is having to pay - he finds it very difficult to interact with people."" She said it would be helpful if staff had training to educate them about the condition and they could then wear a badge saying ""autism friendly"". That would ""almost take the anxiety away"", she said. ""From my point of view that would be the next big step."" Julie Titmuss said big supermarkets are ""deafeningly dreadful"" Julie Titmuss, 61, from Colchester, Essex, was diagnosed with autism only two years ago after what she called a ""lifelong struggle"" to find out why she found certain situations difficult. ""I don't go to the big supermarkets. I can't even begin to tell you how deafeningly dreadful it is,"" she said. ""The trolleys all clashing, the sound of the tills, the volume of noise in there - you can't think straight."" She said the Morrisons scheme was commendable, but that an hour was not enough and that other retailers also needed to consider it. Leeds mum Tabitha Campbell Beattie, whose son Toby is on the autism spectrum, agrees that an hour is insufficient and that staff members should have training. ""If a supermarket has a quieter hour, that doesn't stop the supermarket being busy with long queues which can be an added stress,"" she said, saying she would like to see ""a time zone where disabled children, young adults and so on - not just with autism but other disabilities - should be allowed to shop without the normal public in the shops"". The National Autistic Society says there are 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in the UK, who ""see, hear and feel the world differently to other people, often in a more intense way"". A lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to other people, and how they experience the world around them About 700,000 people in the UK (more than one in 100) are on the autism spectrum Autism does not just affect children.

Zuckerberg in Holocaust denial row,"Mark Zuckerberg has said Holocaust deniers should be given a voice on Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has once again found himself at the centre of a row, after saying posts from Holocaust deniers should be allowed on Facebook. Inan interview,externalwith technology website Recode, Mr Zuckerberg said that he did not believe such people should be removed from the site. They were not, he said, ""intentionally"" getting their facts wrong. The comments caused a backlash and Mr Zuckerberg later issued a clarification. The original comments, given in a wide-ranging interview with Recode, were made in response to questions about what Facebook was doing to combat fake news and sites, such as InfoWars, that promoted conspiracy theories. In Myanmar, also known as Burma, Facebook has been accused by UN investigators of facilitating violence against Rohingya Muslims by allowing anti-Muslim hate speech and fake news. The social network has now said that it will begin removing misinformation that could lead to people being physically harmed. When asked about its policy on fake news, Mr Zuckerberg offered, without prompting, the example of Holocaust deniers. ""I'm Jewish and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened,"" he told reporter Kara Swisher. ""I find it deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong. ""Everyone gets things wrong and if we were taking down people's accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that."" The comments caused a storm of protest. Editor of anti-fascist magazine Searchlight Gerry Gable told the BBC: ""Zuckerberg could kill much of this dangerous material getting worldwide distribution - but he is a like a spoilt teenager."" ""Because of his financial powers, he just does a bit of tinkering without understanding how this material could inspire crazy people to firebomb synagogues, mosques or churches."" NBC News reporter Benjy Sarlin tweeted asking whether Mr Zuckerberg thought the debate over whether the Holocaust had happened was in ""good faith"". Allow Twitter content?

And Matt Ford, a reporter at The Atlantic, pointed out that Mr Zuckerberg had not even been asked about the Holocaust - ""he just said he'd keep it on Facebook on his own"". After the comments drew fire from many, Mr Zuckerberg issued a clarification. ""I enjoyed our conversation yesterday,"" he said in an email to the reporter, published on the Recode site. ""But there's one thing I want to clear up. I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive and I absolutely didn't intend to defend the intent of people who deny that."" Facebook has faced criticism over the way the platform can amplify false reports and has been engaged in an advertising campaign both on and offline declaring: ""Fake news is not your friend."" But it has faced questions about why it continues to allow sites such as InfoWars - which has called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax - to remain on the platform.

Tory chief whip under fire in pairing row,"Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith is under pressure to explain why an MP took part in crunch Brexit votes, despite an agreement not to. Mr Smith told Brandon Lewis to break a voting pact with a Lib Dem MP ""by accident"", sources have told the BBC. He has apologised to Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave and had a ""pairing"" agreement with Mr Lewis. The Labour Party has said he should resign for undermining trust in the pairing system. Government survives key Brexit trade vote Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote MPs from different parties due to vote on different sides in the Commons can have ""pairing"" deals to cancel each other out if they cannot take part in votes. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett has written to the acting Cabinet Secretary calling for an investigation into Theresa May and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom's statements to the Commons on the matter - saying they could breach the ministerial code. But Downing Street said Theresa May had full confidence in the chief whip and stood by her comments that the pairing agreement was broken in error. Mrs May, on a visit to the Irish border, told the Press Association: ""An honest mistake was made here and both the chief whip and Brandon Lewis have apologised to Jo Swinson.""

Mr Lewis, who is the Conservative Party chairman, said it was an ""honest mistake"" made in fast-moving circumstances, as the government tried to scrape together enough votes to get its Trade Bill passed on Tuesday. It won by six votes. But the Lib Dems have called on chief whip Mr Smith to explain himself after reports he told Mr Lewis and two other Tory MPs that they should go ahead and vote, despite being paired. Two of the MPs are reported to have refused to break their pairing arrangements. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told MPs: ""There were three pairs on Tuesday. I myself was one of them. I did not receive any call from anyone telling me to vote."" Labour MP Wes Streeting said Mr Smith should break with the convention preventing chief whips from making statements in the Commons to explain his actions to MPs. He said the Tory chief whip should resign ""if the trust in the pairing system has been abused in this way"". Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said the Conservatives' story was ""changing by the minute"", that Mrs May should apologise and both Mr Smith and Mr Lewis ""must now resign or be sacked"".

Conservative MPs Anna Soubry, Peter Bone and Heidi Allen also raised concerns. Mrs Allen said the chief whip had been ""unable to confirm to me that he did not give instructions to break pairs"" and she could ""only conclude MPs were told to break pairs on Tuesday"". ""I refuse to be tarnished by this behaviour so will not stand by and say nothing. Integrity and honesty are fundamental to our democracy. Anything less is unacceptable."" Tory sources have told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg that Mr Smith had considered ordering MPs to break short-term pairing arrangements - something that would have been highly unusual, although not unprecedented. The sources said he ""might"" have told some of them to do so, but none did, she added. He did not consider telling them to break long-term pairing agreements like the one Mr Smith had with Ms Swinson, the sources said, insisting that Mr Lewis was told to vote ""by accident"".

Burberry burns luxury goods worth millions,"Burberry, the upmarket British fashion label, destroyed unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth Â£28.6m last year to protect its brand. It takes the total value of goods it has destroyed over the past five years to more than Â£90m. Fashion firms including Burberry destroy unwanted items to prevent them being stolen or sold cheaply. Burberry said that the energy generated from burning its products was captured, making it environmentally friendly. ""Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.  On the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste,"" a spokesperson for the company said. The FTSE 100 company said last year was unusual as it had to destroy a large amount of perfume after signing a new deal with US firm Coty. As Coty would be making new stock, Burberry had to dispose of Â£10m worth of old products - largely perfume. Burberry plans to move further upmarket How Bailey put Burberry back in fashion Over the past few years, Burberry has been working hard to make its brand exclusive again after it went through a phase when counterfeiters were ""sticking the Burberry check on anything they could"", said Maria Malone, principal lecturer on the fashion business at Manchester Metropolitan University. Destroying unwanted products is part of that process, she said. ""The reason they are doing this is so that the market is not flooded with discounts. They don't want Burberry products to get into the hands of anyone who can sell them at a discount and devalue the brand,"" Ms Malone said. Burberry has been trying to make its brand more exclusive Burberry is not the only company having to deal with a surplus of luxury stock. Richemont, which owns the Cartier and Montblanc brands, has had to buy back â¬480m (Â£430m) worth of watches over the last two years. Analysts say some parts of those watches would be recycled - but much would be thrown away. Environmental campaigners are angry about the waste. ""Despite their high prices, Burberry shows no respect for their own products and the hard work and natural resources that are used to made them,"" said Lu Yen Roloff of Greenpeace. ""The growing amount of overstock points to overproduction, and instead of slowing down their production, they incinerate perfectly good clothes and products. ""It's a dirty secret of the fashion industry. Burberry is just the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. Tim Jackson, head of the British School of Fashion at the London campus of Glasgow Caledonian University, said luxury fashion firms such as Burberry faced a paradox. To satisfy shareholders, they have to keep expanding even if that risks ""diluting their identity and creating excess stock"", he said. ""There's no way they are ever going to solve this problem."" Last November, Burberry announced a revamp intended to ""re-energise"" its products over several years. That includes taking its brand further upmarket, closing stores that are not in ""strategic"" locations and creating a ""centre of excellence"" for luxury leather goods. It has also cut costs, which has helped boost profits. In Burberry's most recent financial year to 31 March, the company reported a 5% rise in profit to Â£413m, with sales little changed at Â£2.7bn.

Police 'identify Novichok suspects',"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned in March, but both survived Police are believed to have identified the suspected perpetrators of thepoisoning of a Russian ex-spyand his daughter in March, reports say. Several Russians were thought to be involved in the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, sources told the Press Association. They are believed to have been identified through CCTV, cross-checked with border entry data. Earlier this month,Dawn Sturgess, 44, diedafter being poisoned by Novichok. She and her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill on 30 June in Amesbury, Wiltshire. He remains seriously ill in hospital. Police believe the incident is linked to the poisoning of the Skripals, who were discovered slumped on a bench on 4 March. They have since been discharged from hospital. The UK government has blamed Russia, but the country's authorities deny any involvement. Global experts analyse UK 'Novichok' What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? The source with knowledge of the investigation told the Press Association: ""Investigators believe they have identified the suspected perpetrators of the Novichok attack through CCTV and have cross-checked this with records of people who entered the country around that time. ""They (the investigators) are sure they (the suspects) are Russian."" A source also said to have knowledge of the investigationtold CNN on Thursday that two suspects had been identified,externaland that the pair had left the UK after the attack. The suspects have not been named. Asked about the latest developments, the Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko told the BBC: ""Unfortunately, we don't have official statement of the British side. ""I want to hear that from the Scotland Yard or from the Foreign Office. A lot of versions that we hear in newspapers, they are not supported by the Foreign Office."" The prime minister's deputy official spokeswoman said: ""This is an ongoing complex investigation and I can't comment on the speculation around it. ""We need to make sure the police have the time and space to carry on with the investigation."" But, writing on Twitter, security minister Ben Wallace called the reports ""ill informed and wild speculation,external"". The Met Police, who is leading the investigation, and the Home Office have both declined to comment. The BBC has not been able to independently confirm the story. This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera considers how likely is it Russia poisoned the Skripals Philip Ingram, a former British Army intelligence officer and chemical weapons expert, said the latest development supported his perception that this was a ""professional attack"" designed to send a ""political message"" - adding that the poisoning happened two weeks before the Russian election. ""My view is that the primary reason behind it was to send a message out to dissenters - and Sergei Skripal was chosen because he was based in Salisbury and that gave the Russians plausible deniability by saying, oh it must have leaked from Porton Down, because it's just up the road,"" he said. Porton Down is a military research base near Salisbury. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley touched a contaminated item with their hands An inquest into the death of Ms Sturgesswas opened and adjournedon Thursday. Coroner David Ridley said the cause of death would not be given until further tests are completed. The victim's sister, Stephanie Burgess, said she had visited her hours before she died. In a statement read at the inquest, she said: ""I was informed that a decision had been made that the medical staff were going to turn off or reduce oxygen and this would likely result in Dawn's death. ""I then said my goodbyes to Dawn before leaving hospital."" Counter-terrorism detectives have revealed they found a small bottle containing Novichok at Mr Rowley's home in Muggleton Road, Amesbury. They are trying to establish where the container, thought to bea bottle of perfume, originated from, and how Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess first encountered it. On Wednesday, internationalchemical weapons experts completed their investigationsin Amesbury, where they sought to identify whether the substance that poisoned the couple was from the same batch used against the Skripals. Other operations are ongoing, with police divers seen going into a local river and officers searching a playground in Salisbury on their hands and knees. The risk to the public remains low, according to Public Health England. Mike Wade, deputy director for health protection in the South West, said: ""The advice remains - if you didn't drop it, then don't pick it up.""

Plan to teach all children first aidIt comes after an inquiry into the Manchester bombing found that many adults lacked life-saving skills.Family & Education,"School children in England will have to learn first aid under proposals put forward by the government. Draft legislation,externalsays primary school children will be taught basic first aid, such as dealing with head injuries and calling emergency services. Secondary school children will learn life-saving skills such as CPR and the purpose of defibrillators. The British Heart Foundation said the move would improve ""shockingly low survival rates from cardiac arrests"". Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wanted to give young people ""the tools they need to be ready to thrive when they leave school"". The plan was announced aspart of new guidelines on relationships and health education in schools. Parents set to lose right to veto sex education at age 15 Charities call for compulsory first aid training call The BHF said that fewer than one in 10 people survive cardiac arrests suffered outside of hospital, with 10,000 people in the UK dying each year as a result. Survival rates in countries that teach first aid in school are up to three times higher, the BHF said. Research by the British Red Cross, which also campaigns on the issue, found that 95% of British adults would not be able to provide aid in ""three of the most life-threatening first aid emergencies"". Mike Adamson, the charity's chief executive, said teaching children ""simple yet vital first aid skills"" would save lives. The government's decision comes after Lord Kerslake's inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017 found members of the public tried to help the injured and dying but lacked the requisite skills. The report into the blast, which killed 22 people, praised the public response. But the inquiry raised concerns that people on the scene were ""trying their very best in genuinely harrowing circumstances"" but ""did not appear familiar with first aid principles"". The draft legislation also outlinesplans to let 15-year-olds overrule their parents' wishes and opt-in to sex educationlessons they have previously been withdrawn from. Mr Hinds said children should be able to request sex education in at least one of the three terms before their 16th birthday. Until then, parents will retain the right to withdraw their children.

Parents may lose rights over sex ed at 15,"The government plans to let 15-year-olds overrule their parents' wishes and opt in to sex education lessons they have previously been withdrawn from. Education Secretary Damian Hinds says children should be able to request sex education in at least one of the three terms before their 16th birthday. Until then, parents will retain the right to withdraw their children. The plan was announced as part of newdraft guidelines,externalon the teaching of sex education in England's schools. These new, wider guidelines have been developed following concerns the existing guidance, last updated 18 years ago, does not cover topics such as: mental wellbeing consent keeping safe online physical health and fitness LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) issues The guidelines, to become compulsory from 2020, are now open to consultation. What should sex education lessons cover? In an oral statement to the Commons on Thursday, Mr Hinds said: ""We've previously committed to parents having a right to withdraw their children from the sex education part of RSE [relationships and sex education], but not from relationships education, in either primary or secondary school. ""A right for parents to withdraw their child up to 18 years of age is no longer compatible with English case law nor with the European Convention on Human Rights. ""It's also clear that allowing parents to withdraw their child up to age 16 would not allow the child to opt into sex education before the legal age of consent. ""I therefore propose to give parents the right to request their child be withdrawn from sex education delivered as part of RSE. ""And the draft guidance sets out that - unless there are exceptional circumstances - the parents' request should be granted until three terms before the pupil reaches 16. ""At that point, if the child wishes to have sex education, the head teacher should ensure they receive it in one of those three terms. ""This preserves the parental right, in most cases, but also balances it with the child's right to opt into sex education once they are competent to do so."" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said she welcomed the move but suggested children should be allowed to opt in confidentially in such circumstances. ""I welcome the statement that children have the right to decide that they want to receive sex and relationship education,"" she said. ""All children should be empowered to make healthy, informed decisions, to know that it's not wrong to be LGBT and not acceptable to experience gendered harassment or violence. ""But can he assure the House that pupils will be able to opt in confidentially if this is their choice?"" Responding to her comments, Mr Hinds said: ""We're not expecting large numbers of cases where this is true. ""The child would be able to access a term of sex education before reaching 16."" Mr Hinds also said health education would become a mandatory part of the curriculum for all primary and secondary schools from autumn 2020. Under the plans,  pupils will learn about mental health and developing skills such as confidence and resilience. It comes amid growingconcerns about mental health issuesamong young people. Classes will also cover physical health, such as the importance of exercise and healthy eating and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle as well as preventing health problems. Mr Hinds said: ""I want to make sure that our children are able to grow up to become happy and well rounded individuals who know how to deal with the challenges of the modern world. ""Part of this is making sure they are informed about how to keep themselves safe and healthy and have good relationships with others."" What should sex education lessons cover?

Ch Insp Tony Cole said: ""Our primary concern was the safe return of this young child and dozens of officers, including specialist resources, were drafted into the search, which I am so pleased has resulted in her safe return. ""We are still determined to trace the offenders who have put this mother through a 45-minute nightmare that she will never forget."" Police believe the car was driven in the direction of Solihull after it was taken. Officers are continuing to search for the grey Audi A3 S-line, registration BJ66 YLV.

Students deface poem by 'racist' Kipling,"Fatima Abid was among elected student leaders who chose to replace Rudyard Kipling's work with a Maya Angelou poem Students have defaced a mural featuring Rudyard Kipling's If in a stand against his ""racist"" work. The author's 1895 poem was painted on a wall of Manchester University's newly renovated union building. But student leaders erased the work, replacing it with a piece by Maya Angelou in a bid to reverse ""black and brown voices"" being written out of history. The union has apologised for failing to consult students on its choice of poem. Riddi Viswanathan, student union diversity officer, said elected members representing students felt Kipling was ""not in line with our values"", singling out his poem The White Man's Burden. ""It's important for us to represent the voices of black and brown students, which is why we felt Rudyard Kipling's poem was completely inappropriate,"" she said. But Jan Montefiore, professor emeritus of 20th Century literature at Kent University and author of a 2007 book on Kipling, said it was ""terribly crude and simplistic to dismiss Kipling as a racist"". The English writer Rudyard Kipling, whose work included If and The Jungle Book If was painted on the wall of the Leaders Lounge after being commissioned by permanent union staff as part of renovations to the building, which is named after South African anti-apartheid campaigner Steve Biko. The work was painted white on 13 July before being replaced with Angelou's Still I Rise, which was chosen by the union's executive committee, on 16 July. Sara Khan, liberation and access officer at the union, wrote on Facebook that Kipling's ""racist"" work supported the role of the British Empire and Angelou's poem was chosen as a ""reclamation of history by those who have been oppressed by the likes of Kipling for so many centuries"". Kipling was born in India in 1865 and worked as a journalist while he wrote many of his early works, which included The Jungle Book, published in 1894. In 1907, he became the first English-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. 'I had to make my kidnapper fall in love with me' Breastfeeding model causes stir on catwalk Las Vegas hotel sues shooting victims Prof Montefiore added: ""Certainly his politics were imperialist but that's only half of the story. ""He wrote some wonderful stuff and was a magical storyteller but he wasn't always writing uplifting poems."" Prof Montefiore said Kipling wrote The White Man's Burden in 1899, urging America to administer imperial practices in the Philippines and its sentiment was ""completely unacceptable now and fairly unacceptable then"". A spokesman for the students' union said: ""We understand that we made a mistake in our approach to a recent piece of artwork by failing to garner student opinion at the start of a new project."" The spokesman added it would introduce ""relevant and meaningful"" art across the building in the coming months and the painting of Angelou's work was ""a brilliant start to that initiative"".

Children 'attacked by sharks' in New York,"This video can not be played ""My leg was all bloody"" Two children have been injured in shark attacks off the coast of Long Island in New York in the first such incidents in the state for 70 years, officials say. A 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy were treated for puncture wounds in separate incidents miles apart along the bay of Fire Island on Wednesday. A tooth, described as being ""consistent with a large fish"", was extracted from the boy's leg and is being analysed. Shark attacks on humans are extremely rare in the US state of New York. The young girl, who was later named as Lola Pollina, said she was standing waist-deep in the cold water and described seeing a fin before returning to the beach to discover ""my leg was bloody"". ""I saw something, like, next to me, and I kind of felt pain, and looked and I saw a fin,"" she said, adding: ""We went to the lifeguards, we ran up to them and they kind of bandaged it.""

Four years for Nazi terror book teen,"Jack Coulson pleaded guilty to possessing a document for terrorist purposes A teenager who made a pipe bomb in his Nazi memorabilia-filled bedroom has been detained after admitting downloading a terrorist manual. Jack Coulson wasfound guilty in 2017 of constructing an explosive device and given a youth rehabilitation order. In a separate case on Monday, the 19-year-old admitted possessing a document or record for terror purposes. Coulson, of Mexborough, was sent to youth custody for four years and eight months. Yorkshire breaking news: Why Burberry destroyed Â£28m of their own products and ex-Emmerdale star injured in crash Police uncovered far-right and Nazi symbols in the teenager's bedroom Prosecutors said he had downloaded The Big Book Of Mischief to his phone between 4 and 19 January after allegedly boasting about wanting to kill a female MP. Leeds Crown Court heard how the 60-page manual provides information on the chemicals needed to build weapons, as well as practical advice on detonators, handguns and rockets. Investigators also found Coulson had researched Timothy McVeigh, the American terrorist who carried out the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing which led to the deaths of 168 people. Sentencing Coulson, Judge Marson QC said: ""Time and time again you were a given a chance in relation to the previous offence. ""Help was repeatedly given, but you continued to breach the order that was given to you. ""You are unable to address the very real problems which you have in relation to your right-wing views."" Coulson was sentenced to four years and eight months in a youth detention centre David Temkin, prosecuting, said Coulson had ""an active interest in far-right political views and violence"", and during a police interview described Adolf Hitler as his ""leader"". At his previous trial, jurors heard Coulson, who lived in Bradford at the time, had praised the killer of MP Jo Cox and was a member of the ""secretive neo-Nazi"" group National Action. Det Supt Simon Atkinson, of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said: ""While no evidence was found to suggest Coulson was planning to act on this information, the combination of this material and his ideology is very concerning.""

Teenager admits murder bid on refugee,"Shabaz Ali's family released pictures of him in hospital in Edinburgh after the attack An 18-year-old man has pleaded guilty to the racially-aggravated attempted murder of a Syrian refugee in Edinburgh. Sean Gorman stabbed Shabaz Ali, 25, on 3 May in Upper Gilmore Place. Mr Ali was stabbed six times, mainly in the chest, and suffered life-threatening injuries. The attack followed a row about noise Gorman was making in a hostel. The teenager will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 August. Mr Ali had fled to Scotland five years ago with his family and was working as a barber and staying in the hostel as he looked for a new home. Gorman had been visiting the hostel before the row broke out. Mr Ali called at the room after he heard noise was coming from and found Gorman inside. He said Gorman was saying ""Go back to your country."" Mr Ali told BBC Scotland: ""I pressed the button for security. ""He (Gorman) took the knife out and said 'I'm going to stab you.' Security did nothing. ""He said if you don't go to your room I will stab you but I was scared to go to my room because I thought he wanted to kill me in the room because there is no CCTV in the room. That's why I didn't go to my room and he started stabbing me."" Gorman was found later in Duff Street and arrested. A lock knife was recovered. Gorman today admitted racially-aggravated attempted murder as well as causing racially-aggravated alarm to another woman in the hostel. Shabaz Ali after his surgery Det Ch Insp Paul Grainger, of Police Scotland, said: ""Gorman's violence was extreme and left the victim with significant, life-threatening injuries. ""He showed utter disregard for the victim and another woman who was with him - made all the worse given the appalling racist language used. ""Whilst this attack happened within a private property, it gained a great deal of public and media interest and I'm pleased that Gorman has been brought to justice so quickly. ""Edinburgh is a vibrant place where people of different nationalities, faiths and backgrounds live together and the support shown by the local community for the victim and his family is far more indicative of the city's inclusivity than this one isolated incident."" Campaigners later set up an online appeal for donations ""to help Shabaz recover and rebuild his life"" with more than Â£12,000 raised. Mr Ali was stabbed in Upper Gilmore Place in Edinburgh Mr Ali's solicitor Aamer Anwar said a number of attacks on Syrian refugee communities were going unreported because people ""are too frightened to complain"". Mr Anwar said: ""The family are Syrian refugees from Kobane, Northern Syria, who fled death to live in Scotland five years ago. ""Shabaz lost nine members of his family after an attack on their city by Islamic State. This racist thug who plead guilty today had no regard for thelife of Shabaz Ali, who had done nothing wrong, he was a hardworking and quiet young man trying to rebuild his life after Syria. ""Many refugee families today are suffering racist abuse in Scotland and it's up to decent people to stand up for their rights and ensure that the culprits are dealt with and that the local authorities act sensitively to support and if necessary rehouse victims."" Kate Campbell, housing and economy convener at City of Edinburgh Council said the authority had been doing everything possible to support Mr Ali and his family during this ""terrible time"". She added: "" I would also stress that we take the safety of everyone placed in temporary accommodation very seriously.

New Brexit secretary holding Brussels talks,"The UK's new Brexit secretary has offered to meet Michel Barnier throughout August to ""intensify"" talks and ""get some energy"" into them. Dominic Raab said his first meeting with the EU's chief negotiator in Brussels had been ""constructive"". He replaced David Davis, who quit in protest at Theresa May's trade policy. It comes as the IMF says some EU countries will suffer significant economic damage if the UK leaves without a trade deal. Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit. The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards. Cliff-edge Brexit fears back in boardrooms IMF: Ireland faces hit from 'no deal' Brexit Theresa May to visit NI to discuss Brexit Baptism of fire for UK's new Brexit minister But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching. The UK government is standing by its belief that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - and is set to issue advice to businesses on how to cope with that eventuality. Leo Varadkar has said his government is preparing for a no deal Brexit The European Commission hasissued a paper,externalinstructing other EU states to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Possible consequences, the paper says, include disruption to the aviation industry and goods from the UK being subject to custom checks. According to the IMF analysis, the organisation's first since the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, 0.7% of the EU workforce could lose their jobs and economic growth could fall by 1.5%. Ireland, which has the closest trade ties with the UK, would be the worst hit, according to the IMF report. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"". Mr Varadkar said that - even if there is a deal - Ireland will need 1,000 new customs officers and veterinary inspectors to deal with changes in trade rules with the UK. By BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made. Read Chris's full piece Speaking to MPs before setting off for Brussels, Mr Raab said he hoped Mr Barnier would ""fully support"" the proposals for post-Brexit trade with the EU in the government's White Paper. And addressing the press as he began his first meeting with Mr Barnier, the MP -  who was a leading figure in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU - vowed to get ""best deal for Britain"" and to tackle talks with ""renewed energy, vigour and vim"". Mr Barnier said it was a ""matter of urgency"" to agree on a ""backstop"" plan to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland if no deal is agreed - and said a ""close partnership"" on security was ""more important than ever given the geopolitical context"". Mr Raab's trip to Brussels comes with debate raging within the Conservative Party about what Brexit should look like. On Wednesday, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who also quit over the proposals presented to the cabinet at Chequers - used his resignation speech to accuse Theresa May of ""dithering"" over the UK's strategy for leaving the EU. ""It is not too late to save Brexit"", he said, calling for the government to ""change tack"". Former Remain supporters, on the other hand, were furious when the government changed its Customs Bill this week to comply with the demands of a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs. The EU says it will analyse the Chequers proposals, which were set out in full in a White Paper, before coming up with a response.

BBC would be 'crazy' to appeal Sir Cliff case,"This video can not be played Lord Patten chaired the now-defunct BBC Trust until 2014 Former BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has said the corporation would be ""crazy"" to appeal against the ruling in the Sir Cliff Richard privacy case. Sir Cliff was awarded an initial Â£210,000 in damages aftera judge ruledthe BBC had infringed his privacy rights over its coverage of a police raid on his home in 2014. The BBC said journalists acted in good faith and it is considering an appeal. Former BBC chief Mark Thompson said an appeal would be in the public interest. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged over the historical child sex claim. Sir Cliff privacy case: Read the full judgement,external What has the reaction been? On Wednesday night, following the High Court ruling, Tory peer Lord Patten said the BBC should ""swallow hard, say they made a mistake, apologise as they have to Cliff Richard, move on and not to do it again"". He said he did not believe the incident showed ""BBC journalism at its best"". This video can not be played Sir Cliff v BBC: How did it get to this? Lord Patten chaired the BBC's now-defunct governing body, the BBC Trust, from 2011 until 2014, standing down four months before the coverage of the police investigation into Cliff Richard. During the interview with Newsnight, he said: ""I think that the decisions made by some very good people whom I much respect at the BBC were wrong. ""And I think it would be crazy for the BBC arguing that there is some principle of freedom of speech involved and to appeal this decision."" But former BBC director general Mark Thompson,speaking on The Media Show,said ""it would be very much in the public interest to appeal"" against the judgement. He said the BBC has ""got to think very carefully"" because ""it is public money"" but added it was an ""important point of public principle"" for everyone working in journalism in the UK. Mr Thompson said: ""Of course [the BBC] will be looking very closely at the potential cost and the likelihood of success, but how much is freedom of the press worth? In my book it is worth a lot."" Fans of Sir Cliff celebrated his win outside court In hisjudgement,,externalMr Justice Mann rejected the BBC's case that its reporting, which included footage of Sir Cliff's home filmed from a helicopter, was justified under rights of freedom of expression and of the press. He ruled that a suspect in a police investigation ""has a reasonable expectation of privacy"" and while Sir Cliff being investigated ""might be of interest to the gossip-monger"", there was not a ""genuine public interest"" case. Fran Unsworth, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, apologised to Sir Cliff but said the case marked a ""significant shift"" against press freedom and an ""important principle"" around the public's right to know was at stake. This video can not be played The BBC's director of news says there is ""an important principle at stake"" ""Even had the BBC not used helicopter shots or ran the story with less prominence, the judge would still have found that the story was unlawful; despite ruling that what we broadcast about the search was accurate,"" she said in a statement. And in an email to BBC staff, Ms Unsworth said she is ""keen that we learn lessons from the way we reported the story"", but said the principle at stake is one that affects all media organisations, not just the BBC. The BBC said it would look in depth at the 122-page judgement before deciding on whether or not to appeal. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman The judge found it was not merely the BBC's use of helicopter pictures which breached Sir Cliff's right to privacy. The simple naming of Sir Cliff as a suspect in the police investigation amounted to a breach of his privacy. It means, going forward, people who are suspects in police investigations, save in exceptional circumstances, are entitled to reasonably expect the matter is kept private and not covered by the media. That is why the BBC is broadening this out and saying, in effect, this is a dark day for news reporting. Looking at some of the police investigations covered in the past, the BBC points out that naming the suspects has sometimes resulted in additional complainants coming forward. After winning his case,Sir Cliff told ITVthat senior BBC managers ""have to carry the can"", adding: ""If heads roll then maybe it's because it was deserved."" Sir Cliff's close friend, broadcaster Gloria Hunniford, told Good Morning Britain the singer had told her: ""I don't think I'll ever be quite the same again."" She said: ""I agree - you can't get that out of your head, when you haven't slept properly for four years."" TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford said the ruling follows ""four tortuous years"" Conservative MP Nigel Evans, whohas argued for anonymity for suspects of sexual offences,told Radio 4's Today programme that the ruling ""reinforced what the law means which is that the police don't release the name of anybody who has had an allegation made against them"". Meanwhile, Andy Trotter, a former chief constable for British Transport Police who carried out an independent review into the disclosure of information by South Yorkshire Police to the BBC, said: ""Generally speaking, I see no reason for the public to know people have been arrested. ""They [the person arrested] carry the stigma of that arrest for a long time."" However, he said there ""may well be"" a public interest ""in very serious cases"" to release the name of someone who has been arrested. This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard's lawyer said the singer ""aimed to right a wrong"" Sir Cliff sued the BBC over broadcasts of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014. Police officers were investigating an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane in 1985 when he was a child. Sir Cliff was never arrested and in June 2016 prosecutors said he would face no charges. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force. On Wednesday, the judge awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages. The BBC must pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid, 35%. Emotional Sir Cliff speaks.

New Brexit secretary set for Brussels talks,"The UK's new Brexit secretary has offered to meet Michel Barnier throughout August to ""intensify"" talks and ""get some energy"" into them. Dominic Raab said his first meeting with the EU's chief negotiator in Brussels had been ""constructive"". He replaced David Davis, who quit in protest at Theresa May's trade policy. It comes as the IMF says some EU countries will suffer significant economic damage if the UK leaves without a trade deal. Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit. The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards. Cliff-edge Brexit fears back in boardrooms IMF: Ireland faces hit from 'no deal' Brexit Theresa May to visit NI to discuss Brexit Baptism of fire for UK's new Brexit minister But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching. The UK government is standing by its belief that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - and is set to issue advice to businesses on how to cope with that eventuality. Leo Varadkar has said his government is preparing for a no deal Brexit The European Commission hasissued a paper,externalinstructing other EU states to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Possible consequences, the paper says, include disruption to the aviation industry and goods from the UK being subject to custom checks. According to the IMF analysis, the organisation's first since the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, 0.7% of the EU workforce could lose their jobs and economic growth could fall by 1.5%. Ireland, which has the closest trade ties with the UK, would be the worst hit, according to the IMF report. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"". Mr Varadkar said that - even if there is a deal - Ireland will need 1,000 new customs officers and veterinary inspectors to deal with changes in trade rules with the UK. By BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made. Read Chris's full piece Speaking to MPs before setting off for Brussels, Mr Raab said he hoped Mr Barnier would ""fully support"" the proposals for post-Brexit trade with the EU in the government's White Paper. And addressing the press as he began his first meeting with Mr Barnier, the MP -  who was a leading figure in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU - vowed to get ""best deal for Britain"" and to tackle talks with ""renewed energy, vigour and vim"". Mr Barnier said it was a ""matter of urgency"" to agree on a ""backstop"" plan to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland if no deal is agreed - and said a ""close partnership"" on security was ""more important than ever given the geopolitical context"". Mr Raab's trip to Brussels comes with debate raging within the Conservative Party about what Brexit should look like. On Wednesday, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who also quit over the proposals presented to the cabinet at Chequers - used his resignation speech to accuse Theresa May of ""dithering"" over the UK's strategy for leaving the EU. ""It is not too late to save Brexit"", he said, calling for the government to ""change tack"". Former Remain supporters, on the other hand, were furious when the government changed its Customs Bill this week to comply with the demands of a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs. The EU says it will analyse the Chequers proposals, which were set out in full in a White Paper, before coming up with a response.

Pound dips below $1.30 as retail sales fall,"The pound has fallen under $1.30 after a surprise fall in retail sales in June, confounding expectations of an increase. The Office for National Statistics saidsales fell by 0.5% last month compared with May,external- below forecasts of a 0.2% rise. While the World Cup and hot weather helped food and drink sales, they also kept shoppers away from high streets. The weak figures cast doubt on whether interest rates will rise next month. Sterling is down almost 0.7% at $1.2980against the dollar - the lowest since September last year. The Bank of England had been expected to raise interest rates in August. But following the inflation figures released earlier this week, economists were divided on whether it would do so. Tom Stevens at Fidelity International, said: ""An August rate hike is in the balance. Whether or not one is delivered, the trajectory thereafter will be extremely shallow."" The ONS figures also showed that retail sales rose by 2.9% in the year to June, a slowdown from the 4.1% annual increase recorded in May and below forecasts of a 3.5%. rise. However, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the data would not ""undermine the [Bank of England] Monetary Policy Committee's judgement that the economy rebounded in the second quarter"". In the April-to-June quarter retail sales increased by  2.1% - the biggest quarterly rise since 2015. ONS senior statistician Rhian Murphy said: ""Retail sales grew strongly across the three months to June 2018 as the warm weather encouraged shoppers to buy food and drink for their BBQs. ""However, in June retail sales actually fell back slightly, with continued growth in food sales offset by declining spending in many other shops as consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave."" Football didn't come home but the World Cup boosted sales of food and drink Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: ""Some of the second-quarter's strength reflects temporary factors, such as a boost from the warm weather and the Royal Wedding celebrations. ""Crucially, though, the big constraint on spending - namely the squeeze on real wages from high inflation - has eased."" Economic data out earlier this week showed that whilewage growth has slowed to 2.7%, it remains above inflation. Ms Gregory said: ""While this week's unexpectedly-weak inflation figures have made the outlook for an interest rate rise in August rather less clear-cut, the recovery in the consumer sector supports our view that a hike is still more likely than not."" Between May and June, non-food sales fell by 1.1%, with demand for clothing down 0.8%. Mr Tombs added: ""Many households [had] already brought seasonal apparel when the weather also was unusually warm in April and May."" Food sales rose by 0.1% in June, which he said was a ""good result"" following substantial increases in April and May. ""The World Cup might have helped to support food sales, by encouraging people to stay in rather than eat out, though note that England's three knock-out games that led to huge TV audiences didn't happen until July,"" Mr Tombs added.

Macron aide caught beating protesters,"Mr Benalla was supposed to be an observer, officials said - but beat one protester at the scene French prosecutors are investigating a senior presidential aide who attacked protesters in Paris while wearing a police visor. Alexandre Benalla, an assistant to President Emmanuel Macron's chief of staff, was filmed targeting a woman and a man during May Day protests. He was caught on video by a student activist and left the scene once challenged on camera. He was identified from the video by French newspaper Le Monde. On Thursday, it emerged he was accompanied on the day by a reserve policeman and employee of Mr Macron's political party, Vincent Crase. France's Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said he had ordered an investigation by the country's national police inspectorate. ""These two people had no legal right to intervene,"" he said. The incident took place in a popular tourist spot at Place de la Contrescarpe in the fifth district of Paris, where about 100 people had gathered on 1 May. The original video, posted on social media by 21-year-old Taha Bouhafs, shows a man in a police helmet who is not in uniform joining CRS riot police after clashes erupted. Allow Twitter content?

He grabs a woman by the neck, charging her down the street, before both disappear off-camera. Shortly afterwards he returns to the scene, attacking another protester who had been carried a short distance by police before being left alone on the ground. The man in the helmet, since identified as Mr Benalla, can be seen grabbing the young protester around the neck, hitting him in the head and apparently stamping on his stomach when he falls to the ground. Mr Crase is also seen in the fray, holding on to the same protester on the ground before Mr Benalla grabs him. Riot police do not appear to intervene. Paris police hold 109 May Day rioters State sector reforms spark French strike Speaking to French radio on Thursday, activist Taha Bouhafs said that protesters had been ""quietly settled"" on the square before he recorded his video. ""The man on the ground was harmless and begged Benalla to stop,"" Mr Bouhafs said. ""There is no explanation for this outburst of violence."" A presidential spokesman said Mr Benalla had been given permission to attend the disturbance as an observer on his day off. Other photographs show him wearing a police armband. The ÃlysÃ©e palace later revealed that Vincent Crase, who was seen with Mr Benalla at the scene, had been given the same permission to attend. A reserve police officer, he started a private security company with Mr Banella, and French media report that the pair are close friends. Mr Crase has been suspended by En Marche. Mr Benalla's main duty is to arrange security for the president's engagements. Before he joined the presidential staff he had the role of head of security during Mr Macron's election campaign in 2017. Mr Macron and Mr Benalla in May 2017, when Mr Benalla was head of the candidate's security In that role, he was a constant companion to the future president, and archive photographs show the two men together at many high-profile public events. But Richard Ferrand, a senior member of Mr Macron's party, sought to downplay the importance of Mr Benalla's role. ""This is not a close aide, this is someone who was in charge particularly during the presidential campaign and then he joined the ElysÃ©e staff,"" he told French TV. President Macron, asked if he had confidence in his bodyguard on Wednesday night, pointed to a member of his entourage. ""My bodyguard's over there,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Formerly an employee of a private security firm, Mr Benalla had worked with other French politicians in the past - including leading Socialist Martine Aubry and Mr Macron's predecessor in the ElysÃ©e, FranÃ§ois Hollande. In 2012, he was hired as a driver for Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg. Mr Montebourg told Le Monde that Mr Benalla was fired for misconduct after causing a car accident in the minister's presence and wanting to flee the scene. ElysÃ©e palace spokesman Bruno Roger-Petit said Mr Benalla had been suspended for two weeks without pay from 4 to 19 May, a punishment described as the heaviest so far meted out to a head of mission working at the presidential office. He had also been moved out of his role of organising security for the president's visits. However, French TV reported that Mr Benalla had handled security for two key events this month, including the parade of the World Cup-winning France football team along the Champs-ElysÃ©es. Paris prosecutors announced on Thursday they were opening a preliminary investigation into the alleged assault by Mr Benalla. Possible charges include violence by a public official, pretending to be a policeman and the illegal use of police insignia. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb announced that an investigation into how police observers were supervised had been ordered - and to see if all rules had been followed in the case of Mr Benalla and Mr Crase. Prime Minister Edouard Phillippe added his voice to the widespread criticism, calling the incident ""particularly shocking"". He said the behaviour ""cast doubt on the integrity and exemplarity of our police"" - but added the case ""is now in the hands of justice"" after prosecutors announced their preliminary investigation.

Macron aide in probe for beating protester,"Mr Benalla was supposed to be an observer, officials said - but beat one protester at the scene French prosecutors are investigating a senior presidential aide who attacked protesters in Paris while wearing a police visor. Alexandre Benalla, an assistant to President Emmanuel Macron's chief of staff, was filmed targeting a woman and a man during May Day protests. He was caught on video by a student activist and left the scene once challenged on camera. He was identified from the video by French newspaper Le Monde. On Thursday, it emerged he was accompanied on the day by a reserve policeman and employee of Mr Macron's political party, Vincent Crase. France's Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said he had ordered an investigation by the country's national police inspectorate. ""These two people had no legal right to intervene,"" he said. The incident took place in a popular tourist spot at Place de la Contrescarpe in the fifth district of Paris, where about 100 people had gathered on 1 May. The original video, posted on social media by 21-year-old Taha Bouhafs, shows a man in a police helmet who is not in uniform joining CRS riot police after clashes erupted. Allow Twitter content?

He grabs a woman by the neck, charging her down the street, before both disappear off-camera. Shortly afterwards he returns to the scene, attacking another protester who had been carried a short distance by police before being left alone on the ground. The man in the helmet, since identified as Mr Benalla, can be seen grabbing the young protester around the neck, hitting him in the head and apparently stamping on his stomach when he falls to the ground. Mr Crase is also seen in the fray, holding on to the same protester on the ground before Mr Benalla grabs him. Riot police do not appear to intervene. Paris police hold 109 May Day rioters State sector reforms spark French strike Speaking to French radio on Thursday, activist Taha Bouhafs said that protesters had been ""quietly settled"" on the square before he recorded his video. ""The man on the ground was harmless and begged Benalla to stop,"" Mr Bouhafs said. ""There is no explanation for this outburst of violence."" A presidential spokesman said Mr Benalla had been given permission to attend the disturbance as an observer on his day off. Other photographs show him wearing a police armband. The ÃlysÃ©e palace later revealed that Vincent Crase, who was seen with Mr Benalla at the scene, had been given the same permission to attend. A reserve police officer, he started a private security company with Mr Banella, and French media report that the pair are close friends. Mr Crase has been suspended by En Marche. Mr Benalla's main duty is to arrange security for the president's engagements. Before he joined the presidential staff he had the role of head of security during Mr Macron's election campaign in 2017. Mr Macron and Mr Benalla in May 2017, when Mr Benalla was head of the candidate's security In that role, he was a constant companion to the future president, and archive photographs show the two men together at many high-profile public events. But Richard Ferrand, a senior member of Mr Macron's party, sought to downplay the importance of Mr Benalla's role. ""This is not a close aide, this is someone who was in charge particularly during the presidential campaign and then he joined the ElysÃ©e staff,"" he told French TV. President Macron, asked if he had confidence in his bodyguard on Wednesday night, pointed to a member of his entourage. ""My bodyguard's over there,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Formerly an employee of a private security firm, Mr Benalla had worked with other French politicians in the past - including leading Socialist Martine Aubry and Mr Macron's predecessor in the ElysÃ©e, FranÃ§ois Hollande. In 2012, he was hired as a driver for Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg. Mr Montebourg told Le Monde that Mr Benalla was fired for misconduct after causing a car accident in the minister's presence and wanting to flee the scene. ElysÃ©e palace spokesman Bruno Roger-Petit said Mr Benalla had been suspended for two weeks without pay from 4 to 19 May, a punishment described as the heaviest so far meted out to a head of mission working at the presidential office. He had also been moved out of his role of organising security for the president's visits. However, French TV reported that Mr Benalla had handled security for two key events this month, including the parade of the World Cup-winning France football team along the Champs-ElysÃ©es. Paris prosecutors announced on Thursday they were opening a preliminary investigation into the alleged assault by Mr Benalla. Possible charges include violence by a public official, pretending to be a policeman and the illegal use of police insignia. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb announced that an investigation into how police observers were supervised had been ordered - and to see if all rules had been followed in the case of Mr Benalla and Mr Crase. Prime Minister Edouard Phillippe added his voice to the widespread criticism, calling the incident ""particularly shocking"". He said the behaviour ""cast doubt on the integrity and exemplarity of our police"" - but added the case ""is now in the hands of justice"" after prosecutors announced their preliminary investigation.

Israel approves 'Jewish nation state' law,"This video can not be played Israeli Arab MPs protest and rip copies of the bill after Knesset passes nation state law Israel's parliament has passed a controversial law characterising the country as principally a Jewish state, fuelling anger among its Arab minority. The ""nation state"" law says Jews have a unique right to national self-determination there and puts Hebrew above Arabic as the official language. Arab MPs reacted furiously in parliament, with one waving a black flag and others ripping up the bill. Israel's prime minister praised the bill's passage as a ""defining moment"". ""A hundred and twenty-two years after [the founder of modern Zionism Theodore] Herzl made his vision known, with this law we determined the founding principle of our existence,"" Benjamin Netanyahu said. ""Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people, and respects the rights of all of its citizens."" However, the law risks further alienating Israel's large Arab minority, who have long felt discriminated against. Called The Basic Law: Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People, the legislation essentially defines Israel first and foremost as a Jewish state. Among its 11 provisions,it describes Israel as ""the national home of the Jewish people"",externaland says the right to exercise national self-determination there is ""unique to the Jewish people"". It also reiterates the status of Jerusalem under Israeli law, which defines the city - part of which is claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of a future state - as the ""complete and united... capital of Israel"". Israeli Arabs have long complained of discrimination Controversially, the law singles out Hebrew as the ""state's language"", effectively prioritising it above Arabic which has for decades been recognised as an official language alongside Hebrew. Israel at 70 - seven major moments Israel's Arab soldiers who fight for the Jewish state It ascribes Arabic ""special status"" and says its standing before the law came into effect will not be harmed. In one of its clauses, the law stresses the importance of ""development of Jewish settlement as a national value"", though it is unclear whether this also alludes to settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The question of Israel's status as a Jewish state is politically controversial and has long been debated. Before now, it has not been enshrined in law. Some Israeli Jewish politicians consider that the founding principles of Israel's creation, as a state for Jews in their ancient homeland, are under threat and could become less relevant, or obsolete, in the future. Benjamin Netanyahu says the Palestinians must recognise Israel as a Jewish state Fears over the high birth-rate of Israeli Arabs, as well as possible alternatives to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which could challenge Israel's Jewish majority, have spurred on calls to anchor the Jewishness of Israel in law. What are alternatives to a two-state solution? The bill has been under discussion since it was first introduced in 2011 and has undergone multiple amendments, with the final version watering down or dropping altogether sections regarded as discriminatory. Israel has no constitution but instead passed over time a series of Basic Laws which have constitutional status. The nation state law is the 14th such basic law. The issue of Israel as a Jewish state has become increasingly important in recent years and a key dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel country profile Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that the Palestinians must recognise Israel as a Jewish state in any final peace settlement. He argues that the Palestinians' refusal to do so is the biggest obstacle to peace, saying it demonstrates that the Palestinians do not genuinely recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas meanwhile has said he will never recognise Israel as a Jewish state, arguing that the Palestinians have long recognised the State of Israel and should not be expected to go further. It is important because it is hugely symbolic, and according to Israel's Arab minority, evidence that Israel is downgrading their status. Israeli Arabs, many of whom identify as or with Palestinians, comprise about 20% of the country's nine million-strong population. They have equal rights under the law but have long complained of being treated as second-class citizens and say they face discrimination and worse provision than Israeli Jews when it comes to services such as education, health and housing. Civil rights groups have denounced the law and some critics, including one Arab MP described it as apartheid - the state-sanctioned racial discrimination of black people during white-minority rule in South Africa. Israel is often accused by its fiercest critics of practising a system akin to apartheid against Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Israel vehemently rejects the allegation as a smear tactic used by those who reject its very right to exist.

99 million-year-old snake discovered,"The fossil gives an insight into how snakes became such successful creatures The fossil of a baby snake has been discovered entombed inside amber. The creature has been frozen in time for 99 million years. The snake lived in what is now Myanmar, during the age of the dinosaurs. Scientists say the snake fossil is ""unbelievably rare"". ""This is the very first baby snake fossil that we have ever found,"" Prof Michael Caldwell of the University of Alberta in Canada told BBC News. What the dawn snake of Myanmar may have looked like The baby snake lived in the forests of Myanmar during the Cretaceous period. It has been given the name,Xiaophis Myanmarensis, or dawn snake of Myanmar. A second amber fossil was discovered, which appears to contain part of the shed skin of another much larger snake. It is unclear whether this is a member of the same species. The skin of a second specimen was found The animal became stuck in tree sap, a sticky substance that can preserve skin, scales, fur, feathers or even whole creatures. ""It's the super-glue of the fossil record,"" said Prof Caldwell. ""Amber is totally unique - whatever it touches is frozen in time inside of the plastic-like resin."" Snakes:The oldest known snake fossils date from between 140 million and 167 million years ago, and come from the UK - Durlston Bay in Dorset to be exact.Eophis underwoodiwas small - possibly a youngster, and lived in a marshy or swampy environment. Lizard:A small lizard discovered in rocks from the Italian Alps was confirmed this year as the earliest example of its kind.Megachirella wachtlerilived in the Triassic Period, about 240 million years ago. The find suggested that the group lizards belong to had evolved earlier than previously thought Dinosaur:The earliest known dinosaur fossil dates to around the same time as the earliest lizard.Nyasasauruswas two to three metres in length and found in the Manda geological formation in Tanzania, East Africa but it's only known from a few bones, so little is understood about it, or its life history. The group it belonged to went on to dominate the Earth for 165 million years. Horse:The earliest mammal that resembles a horse is Eohippus, which was found at North American sites such as the Wind River Basin in Wyoming. It lived around 52 million years ago and was only about the size of a fox. However, true horses only appear around 20 million years ago, by which time they had evolved to be the size of small ponies. Human:It depends what you mean by human. But if we take that to apply to species under the biological grouping known asHomo, the oldest example is a jawbone fragment from the Afar Region of Ethiopia and dating to between 2.80 and 2.75 million years ago. The snake's body can be seen inside the chunk of amber, made up of 97 vertebrae plus attached ribs. Intriguingly, the snake's head is missing. The creature's bones were analysed inside a synchrotron, an extremely powerful source of X-rays, and compared with those of living snakes. Anatomical features suggest development of the backbone of snakes appears to have changed little in nearly 100 million years. Scientists say the snake may have survived for tens of millions of years in a primitive state, before going extinct. The snake is similar in size to living species, such as the Asian Pipe Snake Fragments of plants and insects found inside the amber confirm that the snake lived in forests. This has not been shown before for this time period, as the few other fossil snakes discovered come from rocks associated with rivers or the sea. Dr Ricardo PÃ©rez-de la Fuente of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who is not connected with the research team, said the find gives ""invaluable developmental and evolutionary data on ancient snakes"". The chunk of amber that contains the baby snake Myanmar is seen as a treasure trove of exciting fossil discoveries from the Cretaceous period, between 145 and 66 million years ago.

'Generation Sensible' in five charts,"Rebellions of young people have been recorded for decades, bucking trends and breaking the rules before entering the world of being a boring grown-up. But a new generation is coming through and truly shocking society. How? By becoming more sensible. For example, a survey conducted by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service showedteenagers are becoming less likely to have sex, preferring to spend time with their families and having romantic relationships online. These graphs show how under-25s are shunning vices that have been - perhaps unfairly - associated with their age group.

May announces new environment bill,"A bill to protect the environment has been announced by the prime minister. It will set out a legal framework for the governmentâs promise to leave the environment in a better state over the next 25 years. It has been greeted enthusiastically by green groups who feared that the governmentâs promises on environmental protection had no legal backing. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the bill would ""help to ensure Britain can be cleaner and greener"". Are young people going cool on cars? Fracking planning laws should be relaxed, say ministers WWFâs Tony Juniper said the announcement was âgreat news"". He tweeted Mrs May to say: âWe look forward to working with you on making this a world-leading step, one that our children and grandchildren will thank us for, and be proud of.

Amy Mount from Green Alliance described the bill as a âquite significant step forward"". She told the BBC: ""The bill will need to put new duties on the secretary of state to deliver on environmental objectives like clean air, recycling and species lossâ. However, others were unimpressed. Tom Burke from the think-tank e3g said anyone who trusted the government's proposals ""must be very naive"". He added: ""This government is the one that made 21 arbitrary changes to attack and undermine renewable energy."" Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth was also cautious. âThis could be an Act that really moves forward protection of nature,"" he said. âBut we donât know what the bill will include, what will be its foundations and when it will be delivered. âThe whole thing could be thrown into disarray if we get a no-deal Brexit, which will leave us out of the EU without having had the time to get new laws in place to replace EU laws. âWe simply wonât have the time to replace all EU legislation on vital issues like product standards (which impose energy-saving and pollution-saving targets) and chemicals legislation.â The announcement comes as a House of Lords sub-committee has warned that the government has no plan for laws on the chemicals industry if the UK leaves the EU without a new deal.

Where are guns coming from?,"Over the bank holiday weekend,a spate of shootingsacross England hit the headlines. They add to a picture of rising gun crime, after more than a decade of big decreases. Although gun-related offences have risen for the past four years, there were still less than half as many gun crimes in England and Wales last year as there were in the early 2000s. Guns are very tightly controlled in the UK. Those that end up on the black market often start off as legal guns - but become illegal because they are modified or their licence status changes. For example, a legal gun covered by a firearms licence could be stolen from a farm or firearms dealer. Murdered MP Jo Coxwas killed with a gun that had been stolen from someone who held it legally with a licence. Also, non-firing ceremonial guns or race-starting pistols can be modified to fire bullets. And decommissioned guns used in conflict can be reactivated - especially because the standards of ""deactivation"" vary around Europe and in some cases the process is very easy to reverse. In 2017, Europol - the EU police agency - said: ""The reactivation of deactivated weapons and conversion of blank-firing firearms are among the main sources of illegal firearms trafficked in the EU."" The National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK says blank-firing and deactivated guns are bought legally by organised crime gangs in Europe who then ""reactivate"" them - often by removing an obstruction from the barrel - and sell them in the criminal market. Some of these then end up in the UK,  often coming from Eastern Europe, hidden in heavy goods vehicles, by sea or even in the post. Guns or parts of guns are also traded online. In 2015, NCA officers seized a gun that had been sent to a man in the UK in the post, concealed within a radio. And finally, there is a growing problem in the UK of antique guns that use obsolete kinds of ammunition being fitted with home-made bullets. Guns such as this Russian made Baikal pistol were built to fire CS gas canisters and can be adapted to fire live 9mm ammunition TheNational Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS),externalsaid that it was identifying more cases where home-made ammunition was used, nodding to a rise in the use of antique weapons by criminals. ""One of the trends which emerged over recent years is offenders increasingly using obsolete calibre or 'antique' firearms, which are easier to get hold of,"" it said. In one high-profile case, Paul Edmunds,a registered firearms dealer, was jailedfor making ammunition to fit antique guns, which he then sold to criminal gangs. His guns were linked to about 50 crime scenes. Gun crime in London rises by 42% No easy answers to London's killings America's gun culture in 10 charts NABIS manages the national database for all recovered firearms and ballistic material, including bullets and cases. It runs forensic labs and works with police forces in England, Wales and Scotland to link this recovered ballistic material to guns, where no gun is recovered at a crime scene, and to crimes. In 2015-16, 30% of the guns used in crime that the organisation recovered and tested were ""obsolete calibre"", meaning they were designed for ammunition no longer produced - in other words, antiques that have been repurposed to be used in crime. This represents a significant rise over the past five years. The rise in the use of antique weaponsis thought to be a sign that non-antique guns have become more difficult to obtain. Gavin Hales, a former deputy director of think tank the Police Foundation says the fact that individual guns are found to have been used in crimes committed by different individuals suggests that the number of illegal firearms in circulation is likely to be quite small. ""Evidence of particular guns popping up all over the country tells us something about how hard it is to get hold of them,"" he says, adding that high prices mean criminal guns often get sold on rather than being destroyed after being used. However, it also serves as an indication of how much damage just a small number of guns in circulation can do. Handguns were the most common type of firearm used to commit offences last year, according to police records. Some of these will also be converted guns, for example Baikal handguns designed to fire gas canisters are modified to turn them into lethal weapons. They are followed by ""imitation weapons"". This category, which includes antiques and blank-firing guns that have been converted to fire bullets, has grown the most over the past 10 years. Dr Helen Poole, an expert in firearms crime, at the University of Northampton, says evidence from Europe that far more firearms are recorded as stolen than are seized suggests an increasing number in circulation. Gun crime remains rare in Britain. In England and Wales in 2016-17, there were31 fatal shootings,external- or one for every 1.9 million people. And there were 9,578 weapons offences that resulted in injury. In the US, in contrast, there were 11,000 murders or manslaughters involving a firearm or one death for every 30,000 people. There are particular hotspots in the police force areas that cover large urban centres. London had the most firearms offences per head of population, followed by the West Midlands force area, covering Birmingham, West Yorkshire, covering Leeds, and South Yorkshire, serving Sheffield. Last year: just over half of all firearms offences involved a gun actually being fired in just under half of cases, a gun was used as a threat in a small minority of cases, a gun was used as a blunt instrument There is evidence of a genuine rise in crime - NHS figures reveal an increase in hospital admissions in England for assault by firearm discharge. But part of the increase in recorded offences could also be down to the police prioritising gun crime. As they focus more of their efforts on looking for these crimes, they find more.

Nine charts on knife crime,"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

Homicide 'up for fourth year in a row',"Only 9% of crimes end with suspects being charged or summonsed in England and Wales,Home Office figures suggest.,external In the 12 months to March, 443,000 crimes resulted in a charge or summons out of 4.6 million offences - the lowest detection rate since 2015. Data also shows police closed nearly half (48%) of all cases because no suspect could be identified. It comes as new figures show the number of homicides has increased for the fourth year running. The Home Office statistics on crime outcomes are published at the same time as quarterly crime figures and the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime. The changing picture of how successfully police are catching criminals comes against a backdrop of rising crime. Overall, crimes recorded by police went up 11% in the year to March,figures published by the Office for National Statistics suggested.,external The Home Office said that along with a growing caseload, there was evidence to suggest that more recorded crimes were in the most challenging offence types to investigate. It gives the example of sexual offences - up 24% on last year - giving officers a bigger workload and becoming more complex. Rape cases take an average of 129 days to solve compared with, for example, two days for theft or criminal damage. The Home Office figures show a continuing downward trend since 2015 in the proportion of cases police have resolved, falling from 15 to 9%. They also showed a fall in the number of cautions and penalty notices served to adults and young people - from about 112,00 in the 12 months to March 2017 down to 88,000 a year later. ChÃ© Donald, of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said the new figures were proof that policing in the UK was ""on the critical list"". ""We are sleepwalking into a nightmare,"" he said. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. Other notable findings from the Home Office include: Insexual offencecases, only 5% resulted in someone being charged or summonsed That figure falls to 3% forrapecases. In about a third (34%) of rape cases, the victim did not want to take the case to its conclusion In all, one in five cases went unresolved because the victim did not support action, usually meaning they did not want to go through the courts Three quarters oftheftcases were closed with no suspect identified This was also the case in more than half (57%) ofrobberies,includingmuggings By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw These figures paint a gloomy picture. Not only are police recording more crimes - but they're solving fewer of them. That's partly because proportionately more of the offences they have to deal with are complex and difficult to investigate, such as rape. But it may also be a reflection of the decline in police officer numbers since 2010, down by a further 738 according to the latest workforce data, and the national shortage of detectives, as the Inspectorate of Constabulary has highlighted. The consequences are serious: victims not getting the justice they deserve, public confidence in the criminal justice system damaged and more offenders avoiding detection - and free to commit further crimes. It threatens to become a vicious circle of crime. Meanwhile, the latest figures for recorded offences showed homicides in England and Wales were up 12% in the 12 months to the end of March, from 627 to 701. Homicide covers cases of murder, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and infanticide, but these figures exclude terror attacks. Reality Check: How do weapons appear on England's streets Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Reality Check: Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said homicide remained rare and tended to take place in London and other cities. The start of 2018 was characterised by what appeared to be regular killings on the streets of London. Between January and March,the BBC recorded46 killings in the city - some from gunshot wounds but most from stabbings. Among those killed were a handful of teenagers. The data also showed: Knife crimeup 16% Robberyoffences, includingmuggings,up 30% - 77,103 cases were recorded in the 12 months to March. In February,the BBC reportedthat the ""rich pickings"" on Oxford Street in London's West End had made it a hotspot for robberies and ride-by moped thefts Vehicle-related theftsup 12% - it is the second year for vehicle-related theft numbers to rise and is backed up by the separate Crime Survey which showed an increase of 17% Publishing the data, the ONS said: ""Over recent decades, we've seen a fall in overall levels of crime, a trend that now looks to be stabilising."" Caroline Youell, of the ONS, said the latest figures showed a ""fairly stable"" picture in England and Wales for most crime types. ""It is too early to say if this is a change to the long-term declining trend,"" she added. ""There have been increases in some lower-volume 'high-harm' offences such as homicide and knife crime, consistent with rises over the past three years. ""However, the latest rise in gun crime is much smaller than previously seen. ""We have also seen continued increases in some theft offences such as vehicle-related theft and burglary, while computer viruses have fallen.""

Amesbury: What we know,"A woman has died and a man spent three weeks in hospital in Wiltshire after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury, on 30 June. Police said they were exposed after handling a contaminated container - which is now believed to have been a perfume bottle. Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 9 July and a murder inquiry has been launched. Mr Rowley was discharged on 20 July. The poisoning comes after a Russian former spy and his daughter were poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury in March. This is what we know so far. On Saturday 30 June, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 10:15 BST after Ms Sturgess, 44, collapsed, and again at 18:20 BST after Mr Rowley, 45, also fell ill. A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said Ms Sturgess had appeared to have a fit and was ""foaming at the mouth"". When Mr Rowley became ill, he was sweating profusely, dribbling, and his eyes were ""red, pinpricked"", he said. Wiltshire Police said it was initially believed the two patients had been using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. But after more tests, scientists at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. Police declared a major incident and counter-terror police are now leading the investigation. What are Novichok nerve agents? Muggleton Road has been cordoned off and specialist search teams are scouring the area Police say that the pair had a high concentration of Novichok on their hands, and so they believe they handled a contaminated item. A government scientist told the BBC the item was probably discovered by the couple in a contained space and was so toxic it was able to pass through the skin. Around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network are working on the investigation, alongside Wiltshire Police. Forensic investigators, wearing protective suits, are working at John Baker House Multiple areas in Amesbury and Salisbury have been cordoned off and scientists and forensic teams in protective clothing are searching the sites. Swabs taken from the sites are being sent to a defence laboratory for testing. The operation could take ""weeks or months"" to complete, police say. Two bins have been removed from a cordoned-off area behind shops in Salisbury for analysis. Detectives are also undertaking precautionary testing of the ambulances used to treat the pair. Police spoke ""briefly"" to Mr Rowley after he regained consciousness and will be speaking to him more as he continues his recovery. Officers are also looking through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage. This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said the couple handled a high dose of Novichok Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in nearby Salisbury on 4 March. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, said it was ""implausible"" that the cases were not linked. It has been reported thatpolice have identified several Russiansas the suspected perpetrators of the attack. Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Dawn Sturgess, who died on 8 July, was a mother of three who lived at John Baker House in Salisbury, which offers supported accommodation. Her family described heras ""a gentle soul who was generous to a fault"". This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Charlie Rowley is 45 and lives at the flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury where the couple fell ill. His brother, Matthew, said: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically."" He said what had happened was ""heartbreaking"". This video can not be played Charlie Rowley's brother Matthew describes how he found out what had happened Police said the pair were both at John Baker House at 12:20 BST on 29 June, before visiting a number of shops in Salisbury and heading to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They returned to the building at around 16:20 BST, before heading to Amesbury by bus at around 22:30. Police believe they were there until emergency services were called on Saturday. Sam Hobson, 29, who also knew the victims, said he spent time with them on Friday and Saturday. He said after Ms Sturgess fell unconscious and was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church. This video can not be played A friend of one of the Amesbury poisoning victims describes the symptoms he witnessed The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said, and an ambulance was called. Five areas the victims are believed to have visited prior to falling ill have been cordoned off: in Amesbury they are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church, while in Salisbury and John Baker House in Rolleston Street and Queen Elizabeth Gardens are being checked. Having spoken to his brother in hospital, Matthew Rowley said Charlie told him thenerve agent was contained in a perfume bottle. Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with the victims of the poisoning, adding: ""the people of Salisbury and Amesbury have shown incredible resilience"". The government has allocated additional funds to support businesses and ""to meet unexpected costs"". In total, the region has been given more than Â£7.5m to help it cope with the Novichok cases. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said that working out whether there was a connection to the attempted murders of Yulia and Sergei Skripal was ""clearly the main line of inquiry"". ""We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security,"" he added. This video can not be played Sajid Javid calls on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" The government accused Russia of being behind the poisoning of the Skripals in March, which Moscow denied, souring relations between the two countries. Russia said Mrs May's government was subjecting them ""to hell"" over the incident in Amesbury. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the ""dirty political game"" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia. Public Health England says the risk to the wider public is low, buthas urged,externalanyone who may have visited the locations that have been cordoned off by police to wash and clean their clothing and personal items. Although they said there was ""no immediate"" danger, anyone who was at the five areas between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 BST on 30 June should: Wash the clothing they were wearing Wipe down personal items like phones and bags with cleansing or baby wipes Double-bag any items which are dry-clean only Chief medical officer Sally Davies has also warned those in the area against picking up ""any foreign object which could contain liquid or gel"". Lorna Wilkinson, director of nursing at Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, said Mr Rowley posed no risk to the community after being discharged.

Morrisons introduces weekly 'quiet hour',"This video can not be played BBC Breakfast's Tim Muffett goes shopping with Joanne Tang and her son Oscar, who has autism Supermarket chain Morrisons has introduced a weekly ""quieter hour"" for autistic shoppers who struggle with music and noise. Its 439 UK stores will dim lights, turn music off, avoid using the tannoy and turn check-out beeps down on Saturdays from 09:00 to 10:00. It is believed to be the first supermarket chain to roll out the scheme to all stores nationwide. The National Autistic Society says it is a ""step in the right direction"". The charity is encouraging retailers to take part in a nationwide ""autism hour"" in October. Toy shop The Entertainer holds ""quiet hours"" during the first hour of opening every Saturday, when staff turn off in-store music in the company's 145 UK stores to ""create a more welcoming environment for children with autism"". Asda said a number of its supermarkets across the country worked with local groups to run quiet hours on a regular basis. It added it was working with specialist charity groups to ensure its stores were inclusive for all. One of its stores in Manchesterfirst introduced the scheme in 2016. Tesco said it was not planning on rolling out the initiative nationwide, but store managers were welcome to introduce it if they felt it appropriate -as one store in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, did last year. And Sainsbury's said more than 600 of its stores took part in the National Autistic Society's Autism Hour in October last year and will be doing so again this year. In three of its Liverpool-based stores, where staff have received training, parents can request a number of store modifications when they begin their shopping trip, it added. Also, a relaxed shopping lane in its Prestwick store has been trialled and will now become a permanent fixture there. 'Autism Hour' helps cut shopping stress What is autism? The Morrisons scheme was introduced following a trial earlier this year in its Lincoln, Woking and Gainsborough stores. Angela Gray, Morrisons community champion at Woking, who has an autistic child herself said she'd found the changes made a ""real difference"". Stores will put signs up during the hour to let other customers know about the scheme and to highlight that it is meant to be a calm environment for shoppers. The movement of trolleys and baskets will also be reduced, it says. Charlotte King, whose three-year-old son Darcy is undergoing diagnosis for autism, said the initiative was ""amazing"", making it ""far less stressful"" for adults with autism and parents of children with the condition. ""I personally avoid taking him anywhere in shopping malls,"" said the mum-of-two, from Hartley-Wintney in Hampshire. ""It is the noise, the lights, it is tannoys. It is too much for him to take in. It looks like you are a bad parent with a naughty child. ""Parents will be more relaxed knowing there will be people there that understand and won't judge them, this will help reduce anxiety levels for everyone."" Mum-of-three Jody Worrell said the scheme was a ""great start"" but more could be done Jody Worrell, who has two teenagers with autism, called the scheme a ""great start"" but said there was more to the condition than just dealing with the sensory aspect. The mum-of-three, from Sittingbourne in Kent, said: ""My son is 16, he finds it incredibly difficult to go in to a shop. He said today it is too noisy and busy. ""His issue is having to pay - he finds it very difficult to interact with people."" She said it would be helpful if staff had training to educate them about the condition and they could then wear a badge saying ""autism friendly"". That would ""almost take the anxiety away"", she said. ""From my point of view that would be the next big step."" Julie Titmuss said big supermarkets are ""deafeningly dreadful"" Julie Titmuss, 61, from Colchester, Essex, was diagnosed with autism only two years ago after what she called a ""lifelong struggle"" to find out why she found certain situations difficult. ""I don't go to the big supermarkets. I can't even begin to tell you how deafeningly dreadful it is,"" she said. ""The trolleys all clashing, the sound of the tills, the volume of noise in there - you can't think straight."" She said the Morrisons scheme was commendable, but that an hour was not enough and that other retailers also needed to consider it. Leeds mum Tabitha Campbell Beattie, whose son Toby is on the autism spectrum, agrees that an hour is insufficient and that staff members should have training. ""If a supermarket has a quieter hour, that doesn't stop the supermarket being busy with long queues which can be an added stress,"" she said, saying she would like to see ""a time zone where disabled children, young adults and so on - not just with autism but other disabilities - should be allowed to shop without the normal public in the shops"". The National Autistic Society says there are 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in the UK, who ""see, hear and feel the world differently to other people, often in a more intense way"". A lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to other people, and how they experience the world around them About 700,000 people in the UK (more than one in 100) are on the autism spectrum Autism does not just affect children.

Private firms cash in on over-stretched NHS,"Under-pressure NHS services in England are spending over Â£1bn a year buying care from outside the NHS because they are unable to keep up with demand. The bill is being racked up by hospitals, ambulances and mental health trusts, data obtained by the BBC shows. NHS managers said money was being wasted as often it was done at the last minute, and led to the NHS over-paying. Sending patients to private clinics for care like hip and knee surgery is thought to be the most common purchase. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Phillippa Hentsch, of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said these decisions were often made as a ""last resort"" where the only alternative would be to cancel. ""Hospitals have to hand over the patients because they have simply not got the beds, staff or theatres free to see them due to the pressures on the emergency side. ""The best interests of the patients are what are paramount. But it is valuable income that is lost to those hospitals. It seems such a waste"" she said. ""In some cases hospitals are over-paying for these treatments and tests. It is another sign that things are not working properly."" The figures have been provided to the BBC by NHS Improvement, the financial regulator for the health service. They show that in each of the last two years just over Â£1bn has been spent by NHS trusts on buying health care from non-NHS bodies. Figures are not available for earlier years. As well as non-emergency operations, the spending is also going on hospitals buying places in care homes to get elderly patients off wards. Ambulances sometimes have to use private crews to transport the less serious patients, and mental health bosses have paid for beds in private hospitals because they have run out of space. Charities are also used to provide support in areas such as cancer and palliative care. David Hare, chief executive of the NHS Partners Network, which represents private health care firms, said there were ""considerable benefits"". He said the flexibility of being able to buy in support could help reduce pressure and improve care. ""It is right that NHS trusts are able to make local decisions about how best to spend precious NHS resources. At a time of immense pressure it makes no sense to leave available capacity from the private and voluntary sectors 'on the shelf'."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said that despite the sums involved the amount spent was still ""low"" given the overall size of the budget - for NHS trusts it exceeds Â£70bn. ""We remain clear that the NHS will remain free at the point of use both now and in the future,"" he added.

Police warned to do better on hate crime,"This video can not be played Blair Wilson was injured in an attack in Scotland, which police are investigating as a homophobic hate crime Police in England and Wales must tackle ""significant problems"" in handling hate crime ahead of a possible rise in such offences after Brexit, a watchdog says. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found inadequate responses in 89 of 180 cases it reviewed. The watchdog said it took an average of five days for police to visit 73 victims, while 65 were not seen at all. It said hate crime rose after the 2016 referendum and the same could happen when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The report,external- which is the first ever of its kind  - said: ""Police forces should prepare for this eventuality and make sure that the recommendations in this report are used in the future to improve the police response to hate crime victims."" A hate crimeis defined,externalas any criminal offence in which the victim, or another person, believes they were targeted because of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. Some forces are also piloting treating misogyny as a hate crime. The watchdog's report looked at victims' experiences of reporting hate crime and how they are handled by police - not convictions. The watchdog said there had been increases in the number of recorded hate crimes following events such as the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013, the referendum vote in June 2016 and the Westminster terror attack in 2017. There was a ""real possibility"" of the same happening in 2019, it added. What makes a disability hate crime? The truth about hate crime and Brexit How hate crime affects a whole community When it came to recording hate crimes, the watchdog said victims faced a ""postcode lottery"", with 43 of the incidents being designated incorrectly at the time victims reported them. Some incidents were given a hate crime ""flag"" without any apparent justification, while others were not flagged at all - despite being hate crimes. Figures also showed that more than 3,000 recorded racially or religiously aggravated offences were not flagged as hate crimes. And one force recorded 700 religiously aggravated crimes, despite more than half actually being racially aggravated. Hate crimes target victims because of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity One case flagged by the watchdog was a 17-year-old girl who reported that she believed she had been assaulted because she was gay. The incident was not flagged as hate-related at first, then later it was incorrectly recorded as racially or religiously aggravated. In another incident, police questioned a trans woman's view that what she had experienced was a hate crime. Lead inspector Wendy Williams said: ""Hate crime is a heinous crime because it strikes at the heart of who you are."" But while there were issues in some forces, she also said there  were many examples of officers and staff dealing with hate crime victims sensitively and effectively, and there was evidence of ""positive practice"". In 2016-17, hate crime accounted for 2% of all police-recorded offences in England and Wales. The figures showed the number of recorded offences increased by 57% between 2014-15 and 2016-17. The watchdog said as well as there being a genuine rise, more people coming forward to report hate crimes and improvements in recording practices had also contributed. The National Police Chiefs' Council lead on hate crime, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, said hate crime had been a priority for the police for many years and their response was ""amongst the best in the world"". He added: ""HMICFRS's recommendations will help us to address inconsistencies around the country and provide a more effective response to victims. ""We will look carefully at the response times to victims.""

BBC would be 'crazy' to appeal Cliff,"This video can not be played Lord Patten chaired the now-defunct BBC Trust until 2014 Former BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has said the corporation would be ""crazy"" to appeal against the ruling in the Sir Cliff Richard privacy case. Sir Cliff was awarded an initial Â£210,000 in damages aftera judge ruledthe BBC had infringed his privacy rights over its coverage of a police raid on his home in 2014. The BBC said journalists acted in good faith and it is considering an appeal. Former BBC chief Mark Thompson said an appeal would be in the public interest. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged over the historical child sex claim. Sir Cliff privacy case: Read the full judgement,external What has the reaction been? On Wednesday night, following the High Court ruling, Tory peer Lord Patten said the BBC should ""swallow hard, say they made a mistake, apologise as they have to Cliff Richard, move on and not to do it again"". He said he did not believe the incident showed ""BBC journalism at its best"". This video can not be played Sir Cliff v BBC: How did it get to this? Lord Patten chaired the BBC's now-defunct governing body, the BBC Trust, from 2011 until 2014, standing down four months before the coverage of the police investigation into Cliff Richard. During the interview with Newsnight, he said: ""I think that the decisions made by some very good people whom I much respect at the BBC were wrong. ""And I think it would be crazy for the BBC arguing that there is some principle of freedom of speech involved and to appeal this decision."" But former BBC director general Mark Thompson,speaking on The Media Show,said ""it would be very much in the public interest to appeal"" against the judgement. He said the BBC has ""got to think very carefully"" because ""it is public money"" but added it was an ""important point of public principle"" for everyone working in journalism in the UK. Mr Thompson said: ""Of course [the BBC] will be looking very closely at the potential cost and the likelihood of success, but how much is freedom of the press worth? In my book it is worth a lot."" Fans of Sir Cliff celebrated his win outside court In hisjudgement,,externalMr Justice Mann rejected the BBC's case that its reporting, which included footage of Sir Cliff's home filmed from a helicopter, was justified under rights of freedom of expression and of the press. He ruled that a suspect in a police investigation ""has a reasonable expectation of privacy"" and while Sir Cliff being investigated ""might be of interest to the gossip-monger"", there was not a ""genuine public interest"" case. Fran Unsworth, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, apologised to Sir Cliff but said the case marked a ""significant shift"" against press freedom and an ""important principle"" around the public's right to know was at stake. This video can not be played The BBC's director of news says there is ""an important principle at stake"" ""Even had the BBC not used helicopter shots or ran the story with less prominence, the judge would still have found that the story was unlawful; despite ruling that what we broadcast about the search was accurate,"" she said in a statement. And in an email to BBC staff, Ms Unsworth said she is ""keen that we learn lessons from the way we reported the story"", but said the principle at stake is one that affects all media organisations, not just the BBC. The BBC said it would look in depth at the 122-page judgement before deciding on whether or not to appeal. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman The judge found it was not merely the BBC's use of helicopter pictures which breached Sir Cliff's right to privacy. The simple naming of Sir Cliff as a suspect in the police investigation amounted to a breach of his privacy. It means, going forward, people who are suspects in police investigations, save in exceptional circumstances, are entitled to reasonably expect the matter is kept private and not covered by the media. That is why the BBC is broadening this out and saying, in effect, this is a dark day for news reporting. Looking at some of the police investigations covered in the past, the BBC points out that naming the suspects has sometimes resulted in additional complainants coming forward. After winning his case,Sir Cliff told ITVthat senior BBC managers ""have to carry the can"", adding: ""If heads roll then maybe it's because it was deserved."" Sir Cliff's close friend, broadcaster Gloria Hunniford, told Good Morning Britain the singer had told her: ""I don't think I'll ever be quite the same again."" She said: ""I agree - you can't get that out of your head, when you haven't slept properly for four years."" TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford said the ruling follows ""four tortuous years"" Conservative MP Nigel Evans, whohas argued for anonymity for suspects of sexual offences,told Radio 4's Today programme that the ruling ""reinforced what the law means which is that the police don't release the name of anybody who has had an allegation made against them"". Meanwhile, Andy Trotter, a former chief constable for British Transport Police who carried out an independent review into the disclosure of information by South Yorkshire Police to the BBC, said: ""Generally speaking, I see no reason for the public to know people have been arrested. ""They [the person arrested] carry the stigma of that arrest for a long time."" However, he said there ""may well be"" a public interest ""in very serious cases"" to release the name of someone who has been arrested. This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard's lawyer said the singer ""aimed to right a wrong"" Sir Cliff sued the BBC over broadcasts of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014. Police officers were investigating an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane in 1985 when he was a child. Sir Cliff was never arrested and in June 2016 prosecutors said he would face no charges. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force. On Wednesday, the judge awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages. The BBC must pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid, 35%. Emotional Sir Cliff speaks.

The people who fought back,"A number of people put their safety at risk and helped others during Saturday's attack on London Bridge and Borough Market, which left eight people dead and 48 injured. Among them was a baker who wielded a bread crate at the attackers, as well as a man who used his skateboard to protect people, with supermarket workers offering free food and drink to emergency workers. Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho was injured trying to help a bouncer Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho dragged his wounded friend to safety while at the Black & Blue restaurant in Southwark - despite himself being stabbed in the neck. Earlier that night, he had helped a bouncer at the Southwark Tavern being attacked by two unarmed men, but said in astatement on Tuesday that the incident happened before he confronted the terrorists,external. ""At that point I thought 'job done, now for beer and food',"" he said. ""Within two minutes of my leaving the Southwark Tavern and posting 'not on my watch' on Facebook, the terrorist attackers arrived at the restaurant. ""Most of my friends and the staff hid under tables but one of my friends was frozen behind me."" The journalist said he ""tried to slow"" the attackers, who appeared to be wearing suicide vests. Victims of the attack What we know so far Who were the attackers? ""I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat. ""They got my friend who was behind me with a minor stab wound in the face and hands and ran off. ""I picked up my friend and bundled him into the store room. I called the police and within moments they arrived. I gave the police descriptions of the three and we were evacuated."" Footage of him being escorted to an ambulance,externalby police has been posted on the Daily Express website. In it he is clutching his neck and using his shirt as a bandage. Mr Ho said he would make a full recovery and thanked staff at the Royal London Hospital. Ignacio had been cycling back from a park with two friends he had been skateboarding with when the attack began A Spanish man who used his skateboard to try to defend a woman who was being stabbed by one of the attackers has now been named as being one of the eight people killed. Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, saw the attack unfolding at London Bridge andrushed to help the woman. According to his father, friends saw the HSBC employee from Madrid, ""lying on the floor on the sidewalk after defending someone with his skateboard"". Spain's prime ministertweeted,externalthat he had requested that Mr Echeverria be granted Spain's Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit. PC Charlie Guenigault, pictured on the night of the London attack Off-duty police officer Charlie Guenigault - an amateur rugby player - was stabbed after tackling one of the three men. He was injured after rushing to the aid of a British Transport Police officer who had faced the attackers with only a baton. The family of the 25-year-old, who serves as an emergency response officer for the Southwark borough, said he ""showed immense bravery"". In a statement, they added: ""Given the opportunity again, Charlie would no doubt do exactly the same if faced with the same situation; helping a fellow police officer in need and protecting the public. ""He is immensely proud to work for the Metropolitan Police Service and serving the Southwark community, and this is an example of that. ""Charlie is described by his peers as a dedicated police officer, who is a diligent, hardworking and respected member of his team"". Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick praised the ""utterly heroic"" actions of the officer, who is in a stable condition in hospital. She said: ""It's hard to pick out individual stories but I am immensely proud of him and what he did."" The BTP officer, who has not been named, was seriously injured but is now in a stable condition. Chief Constable Paul Crowther from the BTP said the bravery he showed was ""outstanding"". The officer, who was stabbed in the attack, has said he has been ""truly moved and overwhelmed by all the support"".

When they told him that three men were stabbing people in the market, he headed outside with two crates to tackle the attackers. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire show, he said: ""I felt pity for the victims, I didn't know how to handle things or react, I thought to myself I'm also in danger. ""I just threw the crate at [one of the attackers]. ""I threw the first crate and I knew he was going to dodge it. While he was dodging it, I walked towards him and hit him in the head with the other crate."" He said a policeman then shouted at him to stand back, before discharging a stun grenade. Roy Larner was stabbed five times while attempting to shield people from the attackers. Friends have raised more than Â£10,000 for Mr Larner, who say he is now in intensive care, to go towards his recovery. Jayne Jacob, who set up a JustGiving page on Sunday, said: ""Roy got caught up in the terror attack at London Bridge and was badly injured whilst protecting lives. ""A Millwall supporter and in my mind a proper hero and deserves our support and aid to help him on his recovery."" According to friend Mick Church, Roy was left with stab wounds on his face, neck and suffered a collapsed lung. Carlos (left) and Giovanni were in a restaurant where an attacker stabbed a woman Giovanni Sagristani, 38, and his friends were in the El Pastor restaurant on Stoney Street when one of the attackers came in and stabbed a woman in the chest. ""He came in shouting and just stabbed her,"" he said. Mr Sagristani's partner Carlos Pinto, 33, who works as a critical care nurse in London, looked after the woman, with the help of his friend, another nurse. ""They took some ice and cloths and tried to stop the bleeding. She lost half a litre of blood in the beginning. He was keeping pressure on the wound,"" Mr Sagristani said. He said fellow diners had managed to push the attacker out of the restaurant by throwing chairs and bottles at him. Once the attacker was outside, staff lowered a security gate and locked people inside. Diners threw chairs and bottles at the attacker ""After the initial moment of panic, everyone tried to help this girl and stay calm. We were all at the back of the restaurant.

"Police warned to do better on hate crimeA watchdog warns there is a ""real possibility"" such offences will increase after the UK leaves the EU.UK","This video can not be played Blair Wilson was injured in an attack in Scotland, which police are investigating as a homophobic hate crime Police in England and Wales must tackle ""significant problems"" in handling hate crime ahead of a possible rise in such offences after Brexit, a watchdog says. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found inadequate responses in 89 of 180 cases it reviewed. The watchdog said it took an average of five days for police to visit 73 victims, while 65 were not seen at all. It said hate crime rose after the 2016 referendum and the same could happen when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The report,external- which is the first ever of its kind  - said: ""Police forces should prepare for this eventuality and make sure that the recommendations in this report are used in the future to improve the police response to hate crime victims."" A hate crimeis defined,externalas any criminal offence in which the victim, or another person, believes they were targeted because of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. Some forces are also piloting treating misogyny as a hate crime. The watchdog's report looked at victims' experiences of reporting hate crime and how they are handled by police - not convictions. The watchdog said there had been increases in the number of recorded hate crimes following events such as the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013, the referendum vote in June 2016 and the Westminster terror attack in 2017. There was a ""real possibility"" of the same happening in 2019, it added. What makes a disability hate crime? The truth about hate crime and Brexit How hate crime affects a whole community When it came to recording hate crimes, the watchdog said victims faced a ""postcode lottery"", with 43 of the incidents being designated incorrectly at the time victims reported them. Some incidents were given a hate crime ""flag"" without any apparent justification, while others were not flagged at all - despite being hate crimes. Figures also showed that more than 3,000 recorded racially or religiously aggravated offences were not flagged as hate crimes. And one force recorded 700 religiously aggravated crimes, despite more than half actually being racially aggravated. Hate crimes target victims because of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity One case flagged by the watchdog was a 17-year-old girl who reported that she believed she had been assaulted because she was gay. The incident was not flagged as hate-related at first, then later it was incorrectly recorded as racially or religiously aggravated. In another incident, police questioned a trans woman's view that what she had experienced was a hate crime. Lead inspector Wendy Williams said: ""Hate crime is a heinous crime because it strikes at the heart of who you are."" But while there were issues in some forces, she also said there  were many examples of officers and staff dealing with hate crime victims sensitively and effectively, and there was evidence of ""positive practice"". In 2016-17, hate crime accounted for 2% of all police-recorded offences in England and Wales. The figures showed the number of recorded offences increased by 57% between 2014-15 and 2016-17. The watchdog said as well as there being a genuine rise, more people coming forward to report hate crimes and improvements in recording practices had also contributed. The National Police Chiefs' Council lead on hate crime, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, said hate crime had been a priority for the police for many years and their response was ""amongst the best in the world"". He added: ""HMICFRS's recommendations will help us to address inconsistencies around the country and provide a more effective response to victims.

Fresh Trump confusion over Russia meddling,"This video can not be played Trump on Putin: ""As the leader of a country, you would have to hold him responsible, yes"" Russian President Vladimir Putin has rounded on US critics of his summit with President Donald Trump. Certain forces in the US wanted to sacrifice US-Russian ties for their ""narrow party interests"", he told a meeting of Russian diplomats in Moscow. ""They are feeding millions of their people stories,"" he said. Mr Trump contradicted US intelligence agencies on Monday when he backed away from blaming Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, provoking condemnation. He later said he had misspoken at the summit. Calls for Trump interpreter to testify Your toolkit to help understand the story Trump's 'most serious mistake' In his comments, Mr Putin said the meeting had been ""successful and has led to useful agreements"". ""Of course, it remains to be seen how the situation will develop, especially given that certain forces in America are trying to belittle and undermine the results of the meeting,"" he added. This video can not be played ""He is not a politician"": US voters on the aftermath of the Trump-Putin summit During an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he held Mr Putin personally responsible for interfering in the election, and that he was ""very strong on the fact that we can't have meddling"". On Thursday, Mr Trump accused opponents of preferring to go to war rather than seeing good relations with Russia. In a series of tweets he said he was keen to meet Mr Putin again. US special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was collusion among the Trump campaign team, something denied by both.

By Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring Donald Trump's apparent U-turn may have come as a shock to some, but not to Russia. It fits perfectly the Kremlin's media narrative: the US president genuinely wants to mend ties with Russia, but is facing fierce opposition from the political mainstream. ""The deep state has literally leapt into action after the Helsinki summit,"" says official TV channel Rossiya 1. According to state-run Channel One, Trump has become ""the target of persecution with a vengeance"" in the US, and therefore had to reverse his remarks on alleged Russian meddling. Gazprom's NTV uses an old Russian saying about a man trying to catch a bird that has flown. The implication is clear: you said Russia never meddled, and it is too late to change that now. And St Petersburg-based Channel Five wonders: ""Is Trump under hypnosis?"" The White House is facing further criticism for not ruling out a Russian proposal to question US citizens accused by the Kremlin of ""illegal activities"". One of those being sought by Russia is former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul, but allowing him to be questioned would breach the legal immunity normally granted to a country's foreign service. Politicians from both sides of the US political divide have rubbished the idea - one Democrat congressman called the suggestion ""crazy"". FBI director Christopher Wray also dismissed it, saying ""it's certainly not high on our list of investigative techniques"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anthony Zurcher explains Meanwhile, a non-binding Senate resolution introduced by Jeff Flake, a Republican, and Chris Coons, a Democrat, was blocked, too. House Democrats are touting a bill to ""hold Russia accountable, strengthen our election security and bolster our alliances"", but it is likely to face strong headwinds. Much of the outrage stemmed from one comment Mr Trump made when he appeared alongside Mr Putin on Monday. During a news conference, Mr Trump was asked whether he believed US intelligence agencies' conclusions or Mr Putin about whether Russia had meddled. According to a White House transcript,external, he said: ""I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be."" Amid outcry, the following day he said he had misspoken.

Watchdog warns over driving permits for EU,"Plans are being drawn up to issue millions of permits so Britons can drive on EU roads after Brexit. Up to seven million International Driving Permits could be needed inside a year if the UK and the EU do not agree to mutually recognise licences, the National Audit Office (NAO) says. The public spending watchdog warned that ""detailed delivery plans"" had not yet been completed. But the government told it the project was ""deliverable"". Johnson: It is not too late to save Brexit Brexit deal must be 'workable' - May The NAO report looks at how the Department for Transport is preparing for the UK's departure from the EU in March 2019. It said the department had made a ""determined effort"" to address the ""significant and complex challenge"" of Brexit - but ""still has much to do"" with an increasing risk that projects will not be delivered on time. Currently, UK driving licences are valid in all EU countries, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. But unless a specific agreement is reached, UK drivers will need ""additional documentation"" in Europe after Brexit, the report says. The government's preparations for this scenario include ratifying a 1968 road traffic convention so International Driving Permits are recognised. About 100,000 of these documents - which cost Â£5.50 and take about five minutes to apply for - are currently issued each year, and they are recommended or required in more than 140 countries worldwide. This could increase to seven million permits being issued by 4,500 Post Offices in the first year of Brexit unless a deal is agreed, the NAO report says. Other transport schemes it looked at include Project Brock, to deal with lorry queues on roads to Dover for cross-Channel journeys. The plan involves holding coast-bound lorries on the M20 so traffic not heading for the port can carry on moving. While Highways England believes the project ""has very little room for delay"" and ""carries significant risks"", according to the NAO, the Department for Transport said it was confident it would be completed by March 2019. The report estimates that Brexit planning and implementation will have cost the department Â£180m by March 2022. ""These are extraordinary times for the civil service and government,"" said NAO head Amyas Morse. ""The department has achieved a great deal in its preparations but over the coming months it will, like many other departments, need to scramble to prepare for the UK's EU exit, particularly if we are faced with a no deal scenario."" A government spokesman said: ""The NAO concludes that the department is making a determined effort to ensure the UK transport system is fully prepared for EU exit and acknowledges that the department has already achieved a great deal. ""We have prioritised preparation for EU exit and royal assent of the Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Bill will be a significant step in this process."" The bill deals with a post-Brexit lorry licensing system in the event of no deal being reached. The spokesman said this was part of wider plans for a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".

Lidl bottom of recyclable packaging survey,"Up to a third of plastic packaging used in supermarkets is either difficult to recycle or not recyclable at all, a consumer group has said. Consumer group Which? said that of 27 own-brand items at 10 big supermarkets, Lidl had the lowest proportion of easily recyclable packaging. However Lidl said the survey did not represent the shop's product range. Which? found 29% of packaging is likely to go to landfill and wants simple recycling labels to be made compulsory. What is your chosen supermarket doing to fight plastic? Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Plastic pollution: Images of a global problem According to the report, 71% of packaging at Lidl was widely recyclable compared to 73% at Iceland, 75% at Sainsbury's and 81% in Morrisons. Some products, such as easy peel oranges, were packaged in non-recyclable material regardless of the supermarket they came from. However, a chocolate cake bought at Morrisons came with a widely recyclable box while a similar product at Lidl was made up of a non-recyclable film within a widely recyclable box with a non-recyclable window. A spokesperson for Lidl said the ""small sample"" used in the report was not representative of the shop's product range. ""We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive review of our entire packaging footprint, and estimate that the vast majority of our packaging is widely recyclable under the industry standard OPRL (On Pack Recycling Labelling) scheme,"" the spokesperson added. Which?'s investigation also criticised ""huge inconsistencies"" in how recyclable packaging was labelled. For example, some items were not labelled at all while some items marked as non-recyclable could in fact be taken to supermarket recycling banks. The report said some labels were only visible once the packaging had been removed - unhelpful to those shoppers wanting to make an environmentally-friendly choice. This video can not be played Going plastic free for a week Which? director of research and publishing, Nikki Stopford, said: ""The plastic pollution crisis makes it more crucial than ever that the government, manufacturers and supermarkets do the best they can to banish plastic that cannot be recycled and promote the use of less damaging packaging."" A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs responded: ""Recycling rates are rising, with less waste being sent to landfill, but more still needs to be done to further reduce avoidable waste and recycle more which will form part of our Resources and Waste Strategy out later this year.""

BBC would be 'crazy' to appeal Sir Cliff,"This video can not be played Lord Patten chaired the now-defunct BBC Trust until 2014 Former BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has said the corporation would be ""crazy"" to appeal against the ruling in the Sir Cliff Richard privacy case. Sir Cliff was awarded an initial Â£210,000 in damages aftera judge ruledthe BBC had infringed his privacy rights over its coverage of a police raid on his home in 2014. The BBC said journalists acted in good faith and it is considering an appeal. Former BBC chief Mark Thompson said an appeal would be in the public interest. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged over the historical child sex claim. Sir Cliff privacy case: Read the full judgement,external What has the reaction been? On Wednesday night, following the High Court ruling, Tory peer Lord Patten said the BBC should ""swallow hard, say they made a mistake, apologise as they have to Cliff Richard, move on and not to do it again"". He said he did not believe the incident showed ""BBC journalism at its best"". This video can not be played Sir Cliff v BBC: How did it get to this? Lord Patten chaired the BBC's now-defunct governing body, the BBC Trust, from 2011 until 2014, standing down four months before the coverage of the police investigation into Cliff Richard. During the interview with Newsnight, he said: ""I think that the decisions made by some very good people whom I much respect at the BBC were wrong. ""And I think it would be crazy for the BBC arguing that there is some principle of freedom of speech involved and to appeal this decision."" But former BBC director general Mark Thompson,speaking on The Media Show,said ""it would be very much in the public interest to appeal"" against the judgement. He said the BBC has ""got to think very carefully"" because ""it is public money"" but added it was an ""important point of public principle"" for everyone working in journalism in the UK. Mr Thompson said: ""Of course [the BBC] will be looking very closely at the potential cost and the likelihood of success, but how much is freedom of the press worth? In my book it is worth a lot."" Fans of Sir Cliff celebrated his win outside court In hisjudgement,,externalMr Justice Mann rejected the BBC's case that its reporting, which included footage of Sir Cliff's home filmed from a helicopter, was justified under rights of freedom of expression and of the press. He ruled that a suspect in a police investigation ""has a reasonable expectation of privacy"" and while Sir Cliff being investigated ""might be of interest to the gossip-monger"", there was not a ""genuine public interest"" case. Fran Unsworth, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, apologised to Sir Cliff but said the case marked a ""significant shift"" against press freedom and an ""important principle"" around the public's right to know was at stake. This video can not be played The BBC's director of news says there is ""an important principle at stake"" ""Even had the BBC not used helicopter shots or ran the story with less prominence, the judge would still have found that the story was unlawful; despite ruling that what we broadcast about the search was accurate,"" she said in a statement. And in an email to BBC staff, Ms Unsworth said she is ""keen that we learn lessons from the way we reported the story"", but said the principle at stake is one that affects all media organisations, not just the BBC. The BBC said it would look in depth at the 122-page judgement before deciding on whether or not to appeal. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman The judge found it was not merely the BBC's use of helicopter pictures which breached Sir Cliff's right to privacy. The simple naming of Sir Cliff as a suspect in the police investigation amounted to a breach of his privacy. It means, going forward, people who are suspects in police investigations, save in exceptional circumstances, are entitled to reasonably expect the matter is kept private and not covered by the media. That is why the BBC is broadening this out and saying, in effect, this is a dark day for news reporting. Looking at some of the police investigations covered in the past, the BBC points out that naming the suspects has sometimes resulted in additional complainants coming forward. After winning his case,Sir Cliff told ITVthat senior BBC managers ""have to carry the can"", adding: ""If heads roll then maybe it's because it was deserved."" Sir Cliff's close friend, broadcaster Gloria Hunniford, told Good Morning Britain the singer had told her: ""I don't think I'll ever be quite the same again."" She said: ""I agree - you can't get that out of your head, when you haven't slept properly for four years."" TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford said the ruling follows ""four tortuous years"" Conservative MP Nigel Evans, whohas argued for anonymity for suspects of sexual offences,told Radio 4's Today programme that the ruling ""reinforced what the law means which is that the police don't release the name of anybody who has had an allegation made against them"". Meanwhile, Andy Trotter, a former chief constable for British Transport Police who carried out an independent review into the disclosure of information by South Yorkshire Police to the BBC, said: ""Generally speaking, I see no reason for the public to know people have been arrested. ""They [the person arrested] carry the stigma of that arrest for a long time."" However, he said there ""may well be"" a public interest ""in very serious cases"" to release the name of someone who has been arrested. This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard's lawyer said the singer ""aimed to right a wrong"" Sir Cliff sued the BBC over broadcasts of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014. Police officers were investigating an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane in 1985 when he was a child. Sir Cliff was never arrested and in June 2016 prosecutors said he would face no charges. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force. On Wednesday, the judge awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages. The BBC must pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid, 35%. Emotional Sir Cliff speaks.

Poverty link to early death 'scandalous',"Glasgow, pictured, has the 5th highest avoidable death rate in Scotland People living in the poorest parts of the UK are more likely to die prematurely, BBC analysis shows. The mortality rate from avoidable causes is more than three times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the country than the most affluent. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said such health inequalities were ""scandalous in 2018"". The government said it was taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives. The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed data from the Office for National Statistics with deprivation data for local authority areas in England and Wales, as well as comparable data for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Our analysis found a strong correlation between deprivation and the number of people dying prematurely. Avoidable death rates range from 138 deaths per 100,000 in affluent areas such as Chiltern in Buckinghamshire, to 517 in the poorest parts of Belfast. Click here for a full dataset,external The ""postcode lottery"" in Manchester Mr Burnham said the findings were a ""stark reminder of the huge health inequalities that exist between the north and south of England"". He added: ""It is scandalous that in 2018 people's life chances are still determined by the postcode of the bed they were born in."" In England - Chiltern, South Oxfordshire, South Cambridgeshire and Hart in Hampshire had the lowest avoidable death rates. Places with the highest rates include Manchester, Blackpool, Middlesbrough, Hull and Liverpool. Father-of-two Mark Oldfield turned his life around after his GP told him he was heading for an early grave A stark warning that he could be dead by next Christmas prompted father-of-two Mark Oldfield to take determined steps to avoid a premature death. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure - the factory supervisor from Dudley topped 24 stone at his heaviest in January 2016. The 50-year-old says he had always been overweight but when his doctor told him he was heading for an early grave it was the warning he needed to ditch his unhealthy ways and diet of takeaways, pizza, crisps, fizzy drinks and cider. He said: ""My diet was typical of my lifestyle - no time for anything, takeaways and jar sauces. I did no exercise and I once nearly got stuck in the turnstile at West Bromwich Albion because of my size. ""I was morbidly obese. My doctor told me I was eating myself to an early grave and in December 2015, shortly after I experienced an episode of breathlessness and dizzy spells, his words 'enjoy this Christmas - it may be your last' really hit home."" The warning came with a referral to a slimming group in Netherton on a 12-week programme - which helped him to lose more than nine stone through healthy eating and an exercise plan. He said: ""I think people become ignorant to weight problems, buy baggier clothes to hide it and carry on. It sometimes needs a short, sharp shock to make you wake up and do something about it. Thank God I listened. I've been given a second chance - I'm not throwing it away. ""I feel great and alive for the first time in years."" Figures released on Wednesday,externalshowed Hull also had the highest overall mortality rate in England and Wales, with 1,346 deaths per 100,000 people in 2017. The city replaced Blackpool as having the highest mortality rate. Jon Date, head of external affairs at the independent think tank the International Longevity Centre - UK, said: ""The reasons behind these disparities are complex, but it is utterly unacceptable to witness a growing health divide in 21st Century Britain."" Deaths in people under 75 from heart disease, some cancers, respiratory conditions and type 2 diabetes are among those classed as avoidable. The list dates back to the 1970s when it was drawn up to help develop effective healthcare. The Department of Health and Social Care (DoH) said more than Â£16bn was being invested in local government services to tackle public health issues in addition to free NHS health checks and screening programmes. It also offers a free flu vaccination programme, a national diabetes prevention programme, a childhood obesity plan and a tobacco control plan. A DoH spokesman said cancer survival was at a record high, with smoking rates at an all-time low. She added: ""Generally, people are living longer."" The highest rate was found in Merthyr Tydfil (319 per 100,000 people), the second most deprived area in Wales; while Monmouthshire - the least deprived - had the lowest rate at 198. Dr Chrissie Pickin, from Public Health Wales, said improvements had been made with heart disease through a reduction in smoking, but cases of liver disease, mental illness and substance misuse had risen. Labour's Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney MP Gerald Jones said the Welsh Government had pumped significant funds into public health over the last 20 years but given the history of heavy industry in areas like Merthyr Tydfil there was a higher incidence of long-term illness. The avoidable death rate varied from 373 deaths per 100,000 in North Ayrshire, where there are high levels of deprivation, to 185 per 100,000 in Shetland. A spokesman for North Ayrshire Health and Social Care Partnership said avoidable mortality was ""inextricably linked to higher levels of deprivation"". He said the most important course of action was to work with the Scottish Government to bring investment and jobs to the area. Dr Andrew Fraser, from NHS Health Scotland, said: ""It's not right that there are such dramatic differences in life expectancy due to circumstances largely beyond a person's control."" The Department of Health in Northern Ireland said reducing inequalities was a ""huge challenge"". A spokesman for the Public Health Agency in Belfast said: ""It is well established that the poorest people live the shortest lives with the worst health."" To help change this trend the agency has invested in organisations which deliver health and wellbeing programmes - particularly in communities with high deprivation. Among them are The Heart Project, which offers rehabilitation to people in Belfast who have suffered heart attacks or strokes, and a network of healthy living centres based in areas of high health inequalities. Belfast father-of-six Gerard O'Neill says he doesn't know where he would be if he had not been referred to one of the city's healthy living centres. Mr O'Neill has lost 12 stone in two years after receiving help from the Maureen Sheehan Centre in West Belfast. Gerard O'Neill weighed 27 stone before he was referred to one of Belfast's healthy living centres The 55-year-old former fisheries officer was initially referred on a 12-week Healthwise plan by his GP after his weight ballooned while caring for his elderly mother as she battled dementia. He said: ""I hadn't got any time for myself and I was eating a lot of junk."" However, following his mother's death he decided he had ""to do something"" about his health and went to see his GP who referred him to the Maureen Sheehan Centre which has a small gym. He said: ""Without this service I honestly don't know where I would be."" Mr O'Neill, who also started attending slimming classes, weighed 27 stone to begin with and said: ""I couldn't even put my own shoes on, my breathing was very bad and I couldn't walk much distance."" Through healthy eating and regular exercise, however, his weight dropped to about 15 stone - and he has even completed two 5k charity walks to raise money and awareness of Alzheimer's. Not content to stop there - he has also rekindled a passion for handball and now coaches a youth team. He has also completed a training course to rehabilitate cancer and heart attack survivors. ""It's great to return something back,"" he said.

New UK medal recognises fight against IS,"Medals honouring UK military personnel involved in the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria have been awarded for the first time. The new silver Operation Shader medal featuring a striped grey, light blue, dark blue and red ribbon was presented to 36 sailors, soldiers and air crew. The defence secretary said the medals would also be given to people working outside conventional areas of combat. This includes UK-based drone pilots and intelligence co-ordinators. The Operation Shader medal is the first operational service medal to be created since 2003. Traditionally, operational service medals are awarded to individuals who have completed service in a specific campaign where they were exposed to physical danger. The Queen has approved the extension of the eligibility criteria for the Operation Shader medal to include personnel who have made a significant contribution to efforts in Iraq and Syria, including civilians. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the move reflects the changing nature of warfare. The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and charts Speaking at the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall after the presentation ceremony, Mr Williamson said: ""It goes to show how important our armed forces are - it is about keeping Britain safe even if they're taking action in the field many thousands of miles away."" More than 1,400 British personnel are involved in thecoalition,externalformed in 2014 to defeat IS. The defence secretary presented the first batch of medals at the MoD in London Personnel based at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire fly the Reaper drones used to carry out strikes and surveillance against IS, assisted by intelligence staff and systems specialists. The head of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, said some of the personnel had worked on the campaign continuously since the UK's involvement began. ""Physical risk is one part of it, but there is also the mental resilience, the endurance and sustainment needed for people who have been effectively deployed on operations for years,"" he said. ""I am just delighted that we are having that opportunity to properly recognise their contribution to this campaign."" The medals presented to personnel based outside the conventional area of operations will not carry a clasp sitting across the ribbon bearing the words Iraq and Syria.

Police 'must tackle hate crime problems',"This video can not be played Blair Wilson was injured in an attack in Scotland, which police are investigating as a homophobic hate crime Police in England and Wales must tackle ""significant problems"" in handling hate crime ahead of a possible rise in such offences after Brexit, a watchdog says. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found inadequate responses in 89 of 180 cases it reviewed. The watchdog said it took an average of five days for police to visit 73 victims, while 65 were not seen at all. It said hate crime rose after the 2016 referendum and the same could happen when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The report,external- which is the first ever of its kind  - said: ""Police forces should prepare for this eventuality and make sure that the recommendations in this report are used in the future to improve the police response to hate crime victims."" A hate crimeis defined,externalas any criminal offence in which the victim, or another person, believes they were targeted because of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. Some forces are also piloting treating misogyny as a hate crime. The watchdog's report looked at victims' experiences of reporting hate crime and how they are handled by police - not convictions. The watchdog said there had been increases in the number of recorded hate crimes following events such as the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013, the referendum vote in June 2016 and the Westminster terror attack in 2017. There was a ""real possibility"" of the same happening in 2019, it added. What makes a disability hate crime? The truth about hate crime and Brexit How hate crime affects a whole community When it came to recording hate crimes, the watchdog said victims faced a ""postcode lottery"", with 43 of the incidents being designated incorrectly at the time victims reported them. Some incidents were given a hate crime ""flag"" without any apparent justification, while others were not flagged at all - despite being hate crimes. Figures also showed that more than 3,000 recorded racially or religiously aggravated offences were not flagged as hate crimes. And one force recorded 700 religiously aggravated crimes, despite more than half actually being racially aggravated. Hate crimes target victims because of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity One case flagged by the watchdog was a 17-year-old girl who reported that she believed she had been assaulted because she was gay. The incident was not flagged as hate-related at first, then later it was incorrectly recorded as racially or religiously aggravated. In another incident, police questioned a trans woman's view that what she had experienced was a hate crime. Lead inspector Wendy Williams said: ""Hate crime is a heinous crime because it strikes at the heart of who you are."" But while there were issues in some forces, she also said there  were many examples of officers and staff dealing with hate crime victims sensitively and effectively, and there was evidence of ""positive practice"". In 2016-17, hate crime accounted for 2% of all police-recorded offences in England and Wales. The figures showed the number of recorded offences increased by 57% between 2014-15 and 2016-17. The watchdog said as well as there being a genuine rise, more people coming forward to report hate crimes and improvements in recording practices had also contributed. The National Police Chiefs' Council lead on hate crime, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, said hate crime had been a priority for the police for many years and their response was ""amongst the best in the world"". He added: ""HMICFRS's recommendations will help us to address inconsistencies around the country and provide a more effective response to victims. ""We will look carefully at the response times to victims.""

Hate crime and the community,"Thousands of people are physically and sometimes brutally attacked each year in hate crimes. Such offences not only affect the victims, but also the thoughts and behaviour of others. Within 24 hours of themassacre of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, protests and vigils were joined by thousands in London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Bangkok and many other cities around the world. Although a particularly stark example, the response shows how the effects of hate crime are not limited to the immediate victims: they also affect others who learn of such events. Over the past five years,the Hate Crime Project at the University of Sussex,externalhas investigated these wider impacts of hate crime, looking at how simply knowing a victim, or even hearing about an incident, can have significant consequences. Many such attacks take place: in England and Wales, for example, the number of hate crimes recorded by police has increased sharply,rising 29%, to more than 80,000, in 2016-17. Race hate crimes were most common, but victims might also be targeted because of their sexual orientation, religion, disability, or because they are transgender. Women in London protest against a burkini ban in France The University of Sussex project used studies, experiments and interviews with a total of more than 1,000 Muslim and 2,000 LGBT people in the UK to investigate the indirect effects of such crimes. It found that four out of five participants knew someone who had been victimised in the past three years, with about half knowing someone who had been physically assaulted. As a result of hearing about hate crime in their community, the most common responses were anger, anxiety and feelings of vulnerability. These emotional reactions had a significant impact on both LGBT and Muslim participants' feelings of safety. Many said they took steps to increase their own security and avoided parts of their neighbourhood where they thought an attack was likely. Others joined community support groups. One Muslim woman described how she had responded to reports of Islamophobic hate crimes, includingthe murder of 82-year-old Mohammed Saleem, who was stabbed as he walked home from a mosque in Birmingham. ""I do feel vulnerableâ¦ and it does affect my behaviour,"" she said. ""I become more fearful and avoid going to certain places that I feel might be a risk to my safety. And especially within certain times, I would avoid walking within those areas."" One reason for these indirect effects is that people feel more empathy for victims who come from their own community. When they learned about a fellow Muslim, or LGBT person, being abused because of their identity, they put themselves in the victims' shoes and felt something of what they must have felt during the attack. This made them feel angry on the victims' behalf, but also threatened and fearful that they could also become a victim. These feelings can lead people to change their behaviour - for example, using social media to raise awareness of such attacks - with the effects lasting three months or longer in many cases. The truth about hate crimes and Brexit What makes a disability hate crime? Terrorism v hate crime: How US courts decide The University of Sussex research demonstrated these effects through experiments in which participants read newspaper articles about someone being attacked. All the articles were identical, except that some described the attacks as anti-LGBT or Islamophobic hate crimes, while the others portrayed the attacks as random, with no mention of hate as the motivation. Those who read about hate crimes reported more empathy for the victim which, in turn, made them more likely to express feelings of anger or anxiety than those who read about the non-hate crimes. The strength of their responses suggest that hate crimes can have a greater impact on the victims and those in the wider community than otherwise comparable attacks which are not motivated by hate. A hate crime is defined as ""any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice"" based on one of five categories: religion, faith or belief; race, ethnicity or nationality; sexual orientation; disability; or gender identity. Source:Home Office,external In 2016-17: 62,685 (78%) were race hate crimes 9,157 (11%) were sexual orientation hate crimes 5,949 (7%) were religious hate crimes 5,558 (7%) were disability hate crimes 1,248 (2%) were transgender hate crimes Total is 105% because some crimes fit into more than one category Among the Muslim and LGBT people who took part in the study, simply knowing someone who had been a victim of a hate crime was linked to them having less positive attitudes towards the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the government. They were also more likely to support laws designed to enhance the penalties for hate crime and different methods of policing - for example, special procedures for dealing with victims and more police in the community. Most had not had any contact with the police about a hate crime, but members of the Muslim group who had been in touch with them were less likely to believe that they would respond effectively than those who had not had contact. During one interview, a Muslim man said: ""For me it seems that a lot of the police force come from a certain background, and sometimes that's why I think they won't take it [Islamophobic hate crime] seriously."" People in London holding a vigil for victims of the Orlando shooting Attitudes towards different forms of justice used to deal with those responsible for hate crime were also investigated. More than six out of 10 Muslim and LGBT people who took part in the study said that instead of an enhanced prison sentence, they preferred restorative justice - in which victims meet or communicate with the perpetrators in order to explain the impact of their crime and agree a form of reparation. This, they believed, was more likely to be an effective way to repair the harm caused by hate and prejudice. One LGBT person said: ""I'm not sure that just sending somebody to prisonâ¦ is going to change somebody's attitudeâ¦ Whereas [restorative justice is] a much better route to be able to understand the impact that their behaviour has had on somebody."" The question for police and politicians now is what they can do to reduce the impact of hate crimes. One step might be to investigate measures - like restorative justice - that aim to address the harm to both the victim and community. Another might be to ensure greater use of community impact statements in criminal trials. With tens of thousands of people affected each year, there are many in the Muslim and LGBT communities, and other parts of society, who will be keen to know the answer.

X-ray result delays 'affect patient care',"The regulator of heath care services in England is calling for a limit on how long it takes to report the results of patients' x-rays and scans. The Care Quality Commission's review of radiology practices found that the process could vary from one hour to two working days in hospital A&Es. This could mean delays in results being shared with doctors and patients receiving timely care. The review also said there were not enough radiologists to meet demand. The Care Quality Commission asked all 151 health trusts in England to reveal their own internal benchmarks for radiology reporting - and it found huge variations in the time taken to examine and report on scans and x-rays. For urgent or fast track cases, this varied from two to five working days In A&E, the range was one hour to two working days And for GP referrals, while some trusts aimed to report back within 24 hours, others settled for 21 days The review also said a shortage of radiologists was contributing to delays and backlogs. The CQC has called for national standards for hospitals to ensure timely reporting. Cancer Research UK said radiology scans were crucial in diagnosing many cancers, and it was extremely worrying that some patients were waiting a long time. Serious concerns had already been aired after inspections of three NHS trusts, where backlogs and delays to radiology reporting were felt to be putting patients at risk. The trusts were Worcester Royal Hospital, Kettering General Hospital and Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth. Professor Ted Baker, CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said: ""While our review found some examples of good practice, it also revealed a major disparity in timescales for interpreting and reporting on examinations, meaning that some patients are waiting far longer than others for their results. ""We are calling for agreed national standards to ensure consistent, timely reporting of radiological examinations,"" he said. ""This will allow trusts to monitor and benchmark their own performances - and ensure that, for example, patients are not put at risk by delays in their x-ray results being reported to the clinician responsible for their care."" He added that many trusts relied on outsourcing to external providers or delegating reporting to non-radiology clinical staff to cope with an increasing workload. But he said that those with the job of interpreting x-rays had to be ""appropriately trained to do so"".

Charges fall as reports double,"Police said there were many reasons charges had fallen, such as victims choosing restorative justice Fewer people are being charged with racially and religiously aggravated hate crimes in England and Wales, despite a two-fold increase in reports. Every police force that responded to a Freedom of Information request reported an increase in hate crimes between January 2013 and December 2017. During this time the number of charges issued was lower than in 2013. One force said a number of factors, such as out-of-court resolutions, contributed to the discrepancy. A hate crime is defined as ""any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice"". The BBC investigation focused on two of the five categories of hate crime - religion, faith or belief, and race, ethnicity or nationality. The BBC sent a Freedom of Information request to all 43 police forces across England and Wales and received the full five years of data from 38. Between them, they recorded about 47,000 racially and religiously aggravated hate crimes in 2017, compared with 22,296 in 2013. But there were 600 fewer people charged in 2017, compared with 2013. ""People want to find out where you're from, and usually it doesn't end in a nice way,"" says Tomasz from Poland ""They hit me, they laughed at me, and they had no respect for me,"" recalls Marta, 45, after being attacked by a gang of youths on her way home in Swindon. ""They were laughing at me because I spoke Polish. They think that they don't have to respect me because I'm Polish, I'm below-human to them."" Marta's 25-year-old son, Tomasz, said the incident left him feeling ""devastated and angry"". ""People want to find out where you're from, and usually it doesn't end in a nice way. What happened to my mother has happened to me."" Greater Manchester Police recorded 2,720 hate crime cases in 2013 and 7,526 in 2017. Following the Manchester Arena attack in May 2017, the force says it received an increase in reports. The force's hate crime lead, Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry, said his force's figures reflected the national picture. He said officers had to meet ""competing demands"" with fewer resources, and there were ""instances where victims do not necessarily want to pursue a case through the criminal justice system but want the behaviour to stop"". A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police, which recorded a drop in charges of 47%, said there were ""a number of reasons"" for the reduction. ""Often the identity of the offender is not known, there may be insufficient evidence to be able to proceed with charges or the matter could be dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal, including restorative justice if that option is supported by the victim,"" he said Of those that gave the full data, Northumbria Police recorded the largest proportional increase in the number of reports over the five-year period. It received 578 reports in 2013, rising to 2,173 in 2017 - equivalent to a 276% increase. Northumbria was one of 15 forces to record an increase in the number of people charged with committing racially and religiously aggravated hate crimes, going up 33% to 363 in 2017. ""The number of individuals that are being charged to court after the report of a hate crime should reassure victims that we will take action if they report an incident to us and that we take their report seriously,"" said Superintendent Nicola Musgrove, Northumbria Police lead for hate crime. ""Hate crime is something which has been underreported for a long time, but now more people have trust and confidence to come forward and report it. ""There has also been a significant improvement in how we record hate crime and a better understanding among officers about what constitutes a hate crime and the additional support that can be provided to victims of this type of crime."" In 2016-2017 there were 9,157 sexual orientation hate crimes, 5,558 disability hate crimes, and 1,248 transgender hate crimes. ""Hate crime is completely unacceptable and there are robust laws in place to stop people committing these vile attacks,"" says a spokesman for the Home Office. Northamptonshire Police recorded 352 hate crime cases in 2013 and 559 in 2017 - an increase of 58%. Despite this, the number of people it charged with committing racially and religiously aggravated hate crimes fell by 47% to 68 in 2017. ""We have worked hard to give victims the confidence to report all forms of hate crime and provide them with a tailored response,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) Lead for Hate Crime. ""These statistics do not include situations where individuals are cautioned for offences, meaning that they only give a partial picture of the overall policing response. ""We have been working with forces to understand why charges fell in 2015-2016. Early indications show that the referral rate is beginning to increase again and we will see whether this reversal is reflected in the official figures, which are due to be published in October 2018.""

'I was attacked for being a goth',"This video can not be played Carys was attacked for ""being a goth"". Do you think this is a hate crime? Carys Serries has suffered racial abuse in the past, but last week she was viciously beaten up for the way she dresses. The 22-year-old, who plays bass guitar in a metal band, says a group of thugs shouted ""goth"" at her before launching the attack in the centre of Glasgow. Carys, who is mixed race, says attacking someone for their ""alternative"" clothing should be treated as a hate crime. She says there is no difference between being abused for the colour of her skin and being attacked for the way she dresses. Carys plays bass in a metal band Carys toldBBC Scotland's The Socialshe had been hosting a charity gig at the Ivory Blacks music venue near Glasgow Central Station on Saturday night when her boot ripped. She decided to nip home dressed in her full metalhead gear. ""I don't usually walk home myself but I thought it was just a quick run over and back,"" she says. ""I literally got to the corner and a group of neds just shouted 'goth' at me. ""I continued walking by them and I just felt a thump on the head and I was on the ground."" Carys says the group, four girls and a boy, aged 16 or 17, kicked her in the head ""full force"" as she tried to protect herself and ""minimise the damage as much as possible"". ""I've been attacked before but that is the first time I thought I was going to die,"" she says. When they stopped and started to walk away, Carys called out to a taxi driver to phone the police. She says the thugs then ran back shouting at her and began attacking her again. The taxi drove off as they started kicking her head again. ""My wig fell off my head and I just grabbed it and ran,"" she says. Carys posted on Facebook that her legs and arms were swollen, she could hardly walk and she had minor concussion. She says that since she posted her message she had heard many ""horror stories"" from people who have suffered just for the way they dress or what music they listen to. In England, Sylvia Lancaster has been campaigning for respect and understanding of subcultures since her daughter was killed in a horrific attack in 2007. Sophie Lancaster was kicked to death for being a goth Sophie Lancaster was just 20 when she was kicked to death by teenage boys because she was a goth. In 2013, Greater Manchester Police became the first to monitor and record hate crimes and incidents against people from ""alternative subcultures"". Several other police authorities have followed. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said inquiries were continuing into the attack on Carys. They confirmed they did not treat incidents against people because of the way they dress as a hate crime. They said that, under existing UK laws, hate crimes only applied to ""protected groups"" such as race, religion, disability, sexual orientation and transgender identity. A recent review of Scots law by Lord Bracadale recommended new aggravations on the grounds of age and gender should be introduced. The Scottish government saidLord Bracadale had published a review of hate crime legislation last monthand they were committed to consulting on its recommendations. ""As you can tell I'm black,"" Carys told The Social. ""I've been attacked before. I've received abuse just for the colour of my skin and the police have been great and taken that seriously. ""I don't see how it is any different from me getting attacked for my music taste or the way I am dressed. There is literally no difference. ""I'm still getting attacked on my appearance. It's an assault based on discrimination.""

Montenegro hits back at 'stupid' Trump,"Montenegro joined Nato last year and its population is eyeing a path to EU membership too Donald Trump reckons that Montenegro is a ""tiny country with very strong people"". And he will soon discover that they have forceful opinions as well. ""He's the strangest president in the history of the United States,"" Ranko Krivokapic told the BBC. Mr Krivokapic knows a thing or two about being a president. He served as President of the Parliament of Montenegro from its independence in 2006 until 2016 - and remains president of the opposition Social Democratic Party. It is fair to say he is unimpressed with the current US president's approach to diplomacy and world affairs. ""With this kind of president, with his knowledge of foreign policy, who knows what is going on? Foreign policy is not his big thing."" In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump suggested that this country of fewer than a million citizens could somehow provoke a global conflict. His reply to interviewer Tucker Carlson caused jaws to drop on the Adriatic coast. ""Let's say Montenegro, which joined last year, is attacked,"" Carlson told the president. ""Why should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack?"" He was referring toArticle 5 of the Nato founding treaty,external, which sees an attack on one member as an attack on all. Mr Trump understood his point. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""They're very strong people, they're very aggressive people. They may get aggressive and, congratulations, you're in World War Three,"" Mr Trump extemporised. Article 5 has been invoked just once, by the US, after the attacks of 11 September 2001. Boris Raonic, programme director at the Civic Alliance human rights organisation, was among those who could barely believe what they were hearing. ""We are used to having [a US president] who unites and promotes Western values; now, instead of a leader, we have a showman."" Mr Raonic says even this would not matter so much if Mr Trump had bothered to study the countries and issues about which he was making snap pronouncements. Trump attacks Putin summit 'haters' Your toolkit to help understand Trump-Putin story 'Double negative' is not not trending ""He is obviously not reading what the state department prepares for him, so we get these stupid statements, which clearly show a lack of knowledge and respect for role that the US had until now."" Mr Trump's depiction of Montenegro as a nation of conflict-crazy lunatics will probably come as a surprise to the million tourists who come each year to enjoy the mountains and beaches. And it is not a picture that Ranko Krivokapic recognises either. Mr Trump's depiction of Montenegro may come as a surprise to those who flock to its peaceful tourist sites ""Peace in Montenegro is not in any kind of danger. Everything is under control - Nato forces are not required in Montenegro."" Boris Raonic is equally unimpressed by Mr Trump's characterisation of modern-day Montenegrins. ""Montenegro departed from its [militaristic] tradition more than half a century ago. [Mr Trump's] claims are, to say the least, inappropriate as we are narrowing our path towards EU accession. Being a Nato member provides us additional security."" But it doesn't necessarily guarantee respect. This video can not be played In May 2017 Donald Trump pushed aside Montenegro's prime minister and dressed down Nato leaders Montenegro's Prime Minister Dusko Markovic discovered that at a Nato summit last year, when Mr Trump shoved him out of the way as heads of government assembled for a ""family photograph"". The US president may also be betraying his ignorance of - or insensitivity towards - Russia's recent activity in the Western Balkans. Russia has made it clear that it still sees the region as part of its sphere of influence. Prior to Montenegro's Nato accession, Russia's then-deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin, said the former Yugoslav republic would ""regret"" joining the alliance. Allow Twitter content?

Montenegrin prosecutors allege that Moscow was behind a subsequent apparent coup attempt in 2016; Russia has denied responsibility. Ranko Krivokapic says he is concerned that his country may have been a bargaining chip at the Trump-Putin summit. Montenegro country profile What has Trump said about your country? ""I hope Montenegro was not on the table in Helsinki; I hope Mr Trump was just giving a reaction to the Fox question, nothing deeper. ""It is very important for us that we are part of Nato. The issue is practically closed and accepted in Montenegro; we are accepted as part of the West."" This video can not be played 'He is not a politician': US voters on the aftermath of the Trump-Putin summit Boris Raonic, meanwhile, has some withering words in response to Mr Trump's praise for Russia's role in World War Two. ""Proportionate to the number of inhabitants, Montenegro had the largest number of casualties in both world wars, as we led the struggle despite being one of the smallest nations in the region."" More outraged Montenegrins are sure to use the US president's preferred medium, Twitter, to put him right. Doubtless in a strong, aggressive fashion. What has Trump said about your country?
