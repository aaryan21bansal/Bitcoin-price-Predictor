'Too early' to consider lockdown exit strategy,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Boris Johnson ""still remains in charge of the government"" It is too early to consider a strategy for exiting the coronavirus lockdown, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab said the current measures were ""beginning to work"" - but shifting focus could mean ""we won't get through the peak as fast as we need to"". He added Boris Johnson remained in charge of the government from hospital, where the PM spent the night receiving treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The number of virus hospital deaths in the UK now stands at 5,373. The Department of Health and Social Care reported 51,608 confirmed cases. Asked during the government's daily briefing when the current social distancing measures could be lifted, the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said it must first establish when the peak of the epidemic will come. ""The key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we have reached the peak, and [that] this is now beyond the peak,"" he said. ""At that point, I think it [will be] possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do, step by step, to move to the next phase of managing this."" He added to start ""having that discussion"" before then would be a mistake. It is the first time Prof Whitty has appeared at one of the briefings since spending time in self-isolation after he showed symptoms. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Deputy chief scientific adviser Prof Dame Angela McLean said it was ""too early to tell"" what the impact of the current measures would be. ""We need people to carry on following those instructions so we can work out, three weeks later, what actually happens in hospitals,"" she said. ""We need to know how well the current restrictions are working before we can say anything sensible about what the next stage might be."" This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says it is too soon to talk about relaxing restrictions In a tweet on Monday, Mr Johnson said he was in ""good spirits"" after spending the night in St Thomas' Hospital in London. The prime minister, 55, tested positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. He was taken to hospital on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature and a cough - for routine tests. Asked whether it was appropriate for the prime minister to run the government from hospital, Mr Raab said Mr Johnson would ""take the medical advice that he gets from his doctor"". He added he had not spoken to the prime minister since Saturday. Asked whether people should work while recovering from the virus, Prof Whitty said some of his own patients were ""perfectly capable of managing massively complicated things"" from their hospital beds. Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work,Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. When do people go to hospital with coronavirus?

US President Donald Trump is among those who has sent his wishes to his ""great friend"" Mr Johnson. And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he hoped the prime minister had a ""speedy recovery"". Meanwhile, the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake  told the BBC it might be ""sensible"" for Mr Johnson to ""step back"" if he was not well enough to carry out his role. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, said Mr Johnson would probably have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital. Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March. This video can not be played Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference.

France records highest virus daily death toll,"Hospitals in France reported a 10% increase in the number of deaths France has reported 833 new coronavirus deaths in the past day, the highest daily toll since its outbreak began. The total number of people who have died after testing positive for Covid-19 now stands at 8,911, while the number of infections is 98,010. ""We have not reached the end of the end of the ascent of this epidemic,"" warned Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran. Italy's daily death toll also rose on Monday after several days of slowing, but Spain's fell for a fourth day. Live: China reports no new virus deaths for first time It came asUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to intensive careat a hospital in London after his Covid-19 symptoms worsened. Why you now have to wear a mask in Austrian shops Stricter measures in Turkey as cases rise sharply Meanwhile, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said the pandemic represented the biggest challenge the European Union had ever faced and that her government was ready to contribute to helping the bloc economically. The data released by the French health ministry on Monday evening showed that 605 people had died in hospitals during the past 24 hours and another 228 had died in nursing homes - both 10% increases. ""It is not over. Far from that. The path is long. The figures that I have announced show this,"" Mr VÃ©ran said. ""Stay at home and continue this confinement effort."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health There was nevertheless some positive news, with the number of people being treated in intensive care only rising by 1.3% to 7,072. Mr VÃ©ran said the government would also start a ""vast operation"" to screen nursing homes, which account for 27% of the death toll, to better protect residents. France's health minister urged people to stay at home France's Equality Minister, MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa, meanwhile said an abuse hotline had been set up for the victims of domestic violence to seek help, as families struggle under lockdown. The pandemic has claimed more than 50,000 lives across the continent. The death toll in Italy is the highest in the world, standing at 16,523. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Quarantined Italian village turned into human laboratory On Monday, the Italian government reported 636 new deaths. That is 111 higher than Sunday's toll - the lowest since 19 March - but 45 lower than Saturday's. The number of new infections increased by 1,941, but continued a downward trend. In Spain, the world's second worst hit country, the daily number of deaths continued to fall, boosting hopes that it had passed the outbreak's peak. Monday's increase of 637 - the lowest for 13 days - means 13,055 people have died in total. MarÃ­a JosÃ© Sierra, deputy head of Spain's health emergency committee, said the outbreak's growth rate appeared to be slowing down ""in almost every region"". In the UK, the Department of Health said on Monday that 439 more people had died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total to 5,373. It is the second day in a row the figure has fallen. But Professor Dame Angela McLean, the government's deputy chief scientific adviser, said it was too early to say whether social distancing was working and that the outbreak was slowing. Meanwhile, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced plans to re-open primary schools from 15 April, as it looks to gradually ease a lockdown. Mette Frederiksen said easing the restrictions would be ""like walking the tightrope"" But she warned that it would only happen if people respected the current measures and that the number of infections remained stable. ""This will probably be a bit like walking the tightrope. If we stand still along the way we could fall and if we go too fast it can go wrong. Therefore, we must take one cautious step at a time,"" she told a briefing. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also said he was considering whether to ease restrictions, including allowing some non-essential shops to re-open after Easter. By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin ""Germany will only do well, if Europe does well,"" Angela Merkel said on Monday. It was a clear call for solidarity with southern European countries, hit hard by the pandemic. Germany would play its part, she said, both to provide emergency aid and to rebuild the economy. But what that means exactly is a fierce debate in Germany and it opens old wounds.   During the financial crisis a decade ago, Berlin and other northern European countries believed ""eurobonds"" - sharing debt with weaker southern European economies - undermined the credibility of the entire eurozone. That position is still held by Mrs Merkel's government, which wants to set up an EU rescue fund and lend using mechanisms set up during the financial crisis. But the mood is changing in Germany. Economists, politicians and commentators who once railed against mutualising eurozone debt to bail out Greece, are calling for exactly that to help southern Europe deal with the coronavirus crisis.

Why masks must be worn in Austrian shops,"Austria's measures are not as strict as those in the Czech Republic and Slovakia It is a debate being had across the world - whether wearing a face mask will stem the spread of Covid-19. In Austria it is now compulsory to wear basic masks in supermarkets and other food and drug stores. The idea appears to be gaining support across Europe, although there is uncertainty about how useful the measure will be. ""If you are going to have protection, you should do it properly,"" said Robert, standing outside an artisanal cheese shop in Vienna, his face largely covered by a woodworking respirator mask. Robert wears a woodworking mask ""I was lucky to have bought this at a hardware store six weeks ago,"" he said. ""It certainly will protect other people, and this mask protects me too. And as I have it, why not?"" The new measure introduced by the Austrian government involves much simpler masks than this. When he announced the move, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz stressed that customers at supermarkets would not be asked to wear medical masks, which are needed for hospital personnel, but basic nose and mouth coverings. Should more of us wear face masks? US set to recommend wearing of masks Why some countries wear face masks and others don't He said the aim was to prevent the wearer coughing or sneezing on others and infecting them, and he suggested masks might be required more widely in public places, once the lockdown began to be lifted. Austria's neighbours, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, have gone even further, making the wearing of face masks compulsory once you leave home. In Germany, the eastern city of Jena has decided that people should cover their faces when shopping or on public transport. Masks are now compulsory on the Charles Bridge in Prague and anywhere else outside the home Now America's CDC public health agency has also recommended thathomemade cloth face coverings are worn in shops,externaland pharmacies. Up to now the World Health Organization (WHO) has said people who are sick and show symptoms should wear masks. But it advises that healthy people only need to wear them if they are caring for others suspected of being infected or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing. It has said the incorrect use of masks can be counterproductive, leading the wearer to become infected. This video can not be played With face masks in high demand, we look at whether they really can protect people from the virus A panel of advisers to the WHO is currently assessing the question. Some people in Austria are now sewing cotton masks for themselves. Otherwise supermarkets have to provide shoppers with masks if they don't have their own. The compulsory mask order could prove a culture shock for Austrians Louise, who lives in Langenzersdorf just outside Vienna, said wearing masks to protect others was a good idea. But after visiting her local store, she said instructions on how to put them on them should be clearer. ""There should be more advice on how to wear them properly and what to do with them afterwards,"" she wrote to me.  ""It wasn't a nice feeling to wear the mask and I think it made me touch my face more to make it fit properly."" If you see anyone wearing this mask, it might just be the BBC's Bethany Bell Sebastian Kurz admits that the move is something of a cultural shift for Austria which introduced a ban on face-coverings, including Muslim burkas and niqabs in 2017. ""I am fully aware that masks are something alien to our culture,"" he said. Astrid in Salzburg told me she was confused. ""For a long time in Austria we were told masks were not needed, that they do not really protect you, and that we should leave the masks we do have to hospital staff. ""Then all of a sudden, it was announced that we should wear masks in supermarkets. I'm not sure where this change of mind comes from, but still, if they ask us to wear them, we'll do it, of course."" Astrid said she had worn a mask on her last shopping trip but it had been a relief to take it off. ""I'm not used to it. It's hard breathing with masks, and it's hot under there.""

Ed Miliband returns to Labour top team,"Sir Keir Starmer has appointed former Labour leader Ed Miliband to his new shadow cabinet. Mr Miliband, who led the party between 2010 and 2015, will now hold the role of shadow business secretary. Sir Keir won the contest to lead the party on Saturday, after beating Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. He named Ms Nandy as his shadow foreign secretary on Sunday, and has now appointed Ms Long-Bailey as shadow education secretary. Lisa Nandy appointed shadow foreign secretary The task facing Labour's new leader Profile of the new shadow chancellor Emily Thornberry, who failed to make it onto the final ballot in the leadership contest, will now become shadow international trade secretary. Sir Keir chose his top team on Sunday, naming the party's new deputy leader, Angela Rayner, as chair of Labour, Anneliese Dodds as shadow chancellor and Nick Thomas-Symonds as shadow home secretary. Rachel Reeves took the job of shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but Jonathan Ashworth kept his post as shadow health secretary. In Monday's announcement, he confirmed the rest of his frontbench, including David Lammy as the new shadow justice secretary, John Healey as shadow defence secretary and Jonathan Reynolds as shadow work and pensions secretary. Mr Miliband, who has also served as climate and energy secretary under Gordon Brown, wrote on Twitter that he was ""looking forward to servingâ¦ alongside such a talented team"". He said everyone must ""focus on playing our part"" to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, but added: ""We cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis."" Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Beyond a handful of lesser known names staying at the top table, Sir Keir Starmer has overseen a clear-out of Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies. Fourteen people who had not already signalled their departure are leaving the shadow cabinet, with several new names to get used to. Ed Miliband is back with a brief he knows well, having served as energy secretary under Gordon Brown. Already the former leader has warned the UK will need to re-shape its economy after the coronavirus crisis, perhaps pointing towards a post-pandemic policy. Lord Falconer is another link to Labour's past in power and Blair-era minister David Lammy, an outspoken and well known face on the backbenches, takes up a key role as shadow justice secretary. Fresh faces bring Sir Keir Starmer the chance to move on from a difficult and divisive time for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. But he will also be well aware that many in the party's mass membership will not want a complete clean break. Deputy leadership candidates Ian Murray and Rosena Allin-Khan have both been given jobs in Sir Keir's new line-up - as shadow Scotland secretary and shadow minister for mental health respectively. And Louise Haigh will serve as the interim shadow Northern Ireland secretary after it was confirmed the current holder of the job, Tony Lloyd, has been hospitalised by coronavirus. Valerie Vaz will remain as shadow leader of the House of Commons, while Andy McDonald is moved from transport to take on the new role of shadow employment rights and protections secretary. Baroness Smith will stay as shadow leader of the Lords and the former Lord Chancellor in Tony Blair's government, Lord Falconer, becomes shadow Attorney General. Other appointments include: Bridget Phillipson as the new shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Luke Pollard remains as shadow environment secretary Steve Reed becomes shadow communities and local government secretary Thangam Debbonaire becomes shadow housing secretary Jim McMahon becomes shadow transport secretary Preet Kaur Gill becomes shadow international development secretary Nia Griffith moves from defence to become shadow Wales secretary Marsha de Cordova is named shadow women and equalities secretary Cat Smith stays on as shadow minister for young people and voter engagement Lord McAvoy remains as chief Lords whip The new shadow cabinet has been described by Labour as ""gender-balanced"", with 17 women and 15 men. It also has seven members from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. Announcing the appointments, Sir Keir said he was ""proud"" of his shadow cabinet, saying it ""showcases the breadth, depth and talents of the Labour Party"". He added: ""This is a new team that will be relentlessly focused on acting in the national interest to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding Labour so that it can win the next election.""

Thousands missed off coronavirus 'high risk' list,"The government has said about 1.5 million people have been identified as needing to ""shield"" Thousands of people have been missed off the government's high risk list for Covid-19 despite meeting the criteria. Among them have been transplant patients, people with asthma and some with rare lung diseases. Many are worried it will affect their ability to access food and medical supplies as they shield from the virus, unable to leave their homes for at least 12 weeks. Supermarkets have been using the list to give priority to vulnerable customers, meaning those not included have already missed out on opportunities for which they would have been eligible. ""It's like she's been forgotten,"" said Bev Pearson, mother of 20-year-old heart transplant patient Lucy Pearson. Miss Pearson, from Whitsbury in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, had her transplant 14 years ago and still visits hospital for regular check-ups. She has been shielding in the home she shares with her mother, brother and sister - none of whom have been venturing out in an attempt to protect her. ""I managed to book three food delivery slots before everybody got put into isolation but after that I can't get any more food delivery slots,"" Ms Pearson said. Despite registering her daughter on the government list herself, she said she had received no confirmation. When she asked her GP she was told it had ""nothing to do with the surgery"", she added. Ms Pearson said a neighbour was currently helping to collect medication for Lucy but she was ""worried about getting food"". ""We're OK for a couple of weeks but what after that? We've got another 11 weeks of this yet."" She said she had come across other transplant patients in the same position, and said: ""People are beginning to feel despondent."" ""I'd be fairly unlikely to survive if I got coronavirus,"" said 79-year-old Liz Goldfinch. Mrs Goldfinch, from Droitwich in Worcestershire, is self-isolating with her 88-year-old husband as she has cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) - a rare lung condition - and Parkinson's disease. ""I haven't yet received a letter and if I have been missed off the list I feel pretty annoyed and worried I suppose,"" she said. ""At the moment we're OK as we have neighbours who have been helping deliver food and anything else we might need. ""I guess it all depends how long this goes on for. If they can no longer help, if they get ill or whatever, it could be a problem. ""I haven't been able to get a supermarket delivery slot up to now. So that would be a problem if no-one was able to help us."" Mrs Goldfinch said she hoped she would not be forced into a position that meant she or her husband would have to leave the house. ""If I just get a cold or flu then my COP means I am very likely to end up in hospital,"" she said. ""This has already happened on two occasions in he last three years. I suspect it would be a much more dire situation if I caught coronavirus."" ""Sometimes I can have three or four asthma attacks in one day if I catch a cold, and I find it really difficult to breathe,"" said Shivani Mistry, from Telford in Shropshire. The 23-year-old lives in a shared house and has been trying to isolate herself from the rest of her housemates. ""I'm not angry that I have been missed off the list as there are more vulnerable people than me but it is a bit of a horrible situation,"" she said. ""I can ask for help but I don't like asking,"" Ms Mistry said. She said money was also an issue because she had no cash in the house. ""I have had to wait for three weeks for a food delivery - I've got another week to go, so I have been surviving off the very last of my supplies from the week before, that were only supposed to last a week. ""For three days straight I was just living off potatoes. ""My boyfriend sent me some facemasks so I could risk going out to the shop, which I have tried but it is very scary. ""It was just insane the amount of people who were not considerate and keeping their distance. People were brushing past me."" Solid organ transplant recipients People with specific cancers: people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy people with lung cancer who are undergoing radical radiotherapy people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment people having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer people having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors people who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last six months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs Other conditions: People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell) People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection Women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired Source:NHS England,external NHS Digital, which compiled the list, said it had identified about 900,000 patients who should have already received an official letter or text. However, it said GPs and hospital doctors were now adding a further 600,000 patients. It also advised people to register themselves on thegovernment website,externalif they needed extra help and support. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Royal College of General Practitioners have also advised those who feel they had been missed off the list to contact their GPs. Meet the âshieldedâ enduring 12 weeks of isolation Coronavirus: What is shielding? 'I'm high-risk and got coronavirus: it can be OK' Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ""GP practices are working hard to notify patients who are considered to be in a vulnerable group, and therefore at higher-risk of getting Covid-19, about measures they should take to keep as safe as possible."" He said the information had been collected from GP computer systems and added ""every effort is being made to ensure that the data is accurate"". ""We're in an ever-changing situation and NHS England are currently updating their guidance for GPs on delivering care for vulnerable patients,"" he said. Defra also said it was ""working quickly"" to support those who did not fall into the ""clinically vulnerable"" category but still needed help, including elderly people and those with disabilities.

Trump labels white supremacist group terrorists,"President Trump, pictured with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has not yet identified a white supremacist group as a terrorist organisation US President Donald Trump has labelled a Russian nationalist group as a terrorist organisation. The announcement marks the first time the US government has applied the label to a white supremacist group. ""These actions are unprecedented,"" said Nathan Sales, assistant secretary of State for counterterrorism on Monday. The Russian Imperialist Movement is believed to have offered military training to neo-Nazi fighters and aided election interference in the US. The group is also thought to have been involved in neo-Nazi bombings at several locations in Sweden in 2016 and 2017. The designation has been seen as an unusual move, as President Trump has previously been criticised for failure to do more about the threat of white supremacy. US labels Iran Guards force as terrorist Why so many US 'mass shooting' arrests suddenly? Smoothest invasion of modern times The terror designation gives the US government authority to block Americans from providing material support or engage in financial dealings with such groups. To receive such a designation, a group must be a foreign organisation and must engage in terrorist activity that threatens the security of US nationals or the national security of the US. The Treasury Department can block any American assets belonging to a named terrorist group, and its members can be prevented from entering the US. The label has been most frequently used for Islamist extremist groups. The Russian Imperial Movement is an ultra-nationalist paramilitary group based in St Petersburg, where it has a training camp, with alleged links to white supremacist organisations in the West. According to Swedish investigators, the group trained two of the three Swedish men convicted of bombings targeting a cafÃ© and refugee centres in 2016, and a synagogue the following year. The group is not believed to be state-sponsored but Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""tolerated"" its activities, the New York Times reports. It supported the Kremlin after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula by recruiting fighters for the conflict. The group is believed to have supported pro-Russia fighters in the Ukraine conflict The US is also labelling three of the group's leaders as individual terrorists who will face separate sanctions. ""This is the first time the United States has ever designated white supremacists as terrorists, and this illustrates how seriously this administration takes the white supremacist terrorist threat,"" Mr Sales said. ""We are doing things no previous administration has done to counter this threat."" The designation of the Russian Imperial Movement as a terrorist organisation suggests the Trump administration is becoming increasingly concerned about a global threat from white supremacist movements. The US has a long history of dealing with home-grown white nationalists and supremacists - including the Ku Klux Klan and the group behind the violent 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Members of a Michigan-based extremist militia group staged the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168, as well. Now, however, the US is considering similar or even greater dangers sponsored or instigated from abroad, which could be a destabilising force not just in the US but among its allies, as well. Far-right extremism appears to have inspired the 2019 Christchurch shooting at a mosque in New Zealand and attacks in Scandinavia. The White House move also represents a change of tone, given that Donald Trump last March said he thought white nationalist violence was the action of ""a small group of people"" and not a rising global threat. As is often the case these past few years, the test will now be whether the president echoes the concerns of his administration officials - or contradicts them. Last year, under a separate authority Mr Trump designated Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organisation - the first time the US had declared another nation's military a terrorist entity. The president has faced criticism for minimising the threat of white nationalist violence in the US, especially compared to other terror groups. He was widely condemned for his reaction to the deadly white supremacist rally in Virginia, and his comments suggesting there were ""very fine people"" on both sides. This past summer, the US faced a wave of mass violence and attempted attacks, many of them targeting specific minority groups. The government lacks any federal penalties for acts of domestic terrorism, however, like those that exist for international acts of terror.

Waitrose in u-turn on virus pay policy,"Waitrose has pledged to reverse a policy where workers self-isolating because of their family had to make up their hours owed at a later date. The company said: ""We're really sorry that we got it wrong. ""We've listened to our Partners and changed our policy. "" Worried Waitrose workers had warned the BBC that customers and staff were being put at risk during the coronavirus crisis through its time bank system, which demanded the hours be recouped. ""Partners who are self isolating without symptoms and unable to work from home will no longer be required to 'time bank' any of their time,"" the company has decided. ""Instead they will be on authorised paid absence from day one."" The firm had expected staff to recover time they took off for sick family members. Its 'time bank' system meant ""some people will continue to show up for work,"" putting people at risk, a concerned worker told the BBC. The problem affected workers who self-isolated because a family member displayed COVID-19 symptoms. The supermarket chain's previous policy was the following: ""If they are physically well enough themselves to work, then we will explore the option of working at home in the first instance."" It meant while they were paid in full during the time they took off, they were forced to pay that time back by working overtime for no extra pay when they returned to work. They had to cover the days they missed in full, up to two week's worth of hours. Before the supermarket reversed the decision a Waitrose worker - who asked to remain anonymous because of fears for their job - told the BBC: ""It means someone on a 35-hour contract would have to work an extra 70 hours if they had two weeks in isolation. ""They would be technically unpaid as the company would say they've already paid them for it."" The worker also claimed that John Lewis staff - part of the same business - were being treated differently. ""Front line Waitrose staff are being pressured to work back hours in order to protect the business, at least that's what they're telling us. ""But some John Lewis and Head office staff are being paid 100% salary to stay at home."" Meanwhile another member of staff told theSunday National newspaper,external: ""My biggest concern around this is that really vulnerable people will not self-isolate or shield, and those who need to self-isolate due to family illness will put society as a whole at risk due to these punitive measures."" The Waitrose worker who contacted the BBC said: ""The message is that time-banking is being translated as being mandatory at store level, with paid absence only for exceptional circumstances. ""But nobody has been able to discover what these circumstances are as it doesn't appear to be up for discussion."" Other supermarkets appeared to have been more generous when it comes to supporting staff during the coronavirus crisis. Marks & Spencer said: ""Any colleague who needs to self-isolate for seven to 14 days can do so on full pay. ""Colleagues who are pregnant, 70+ or with the health conditions specified by the Department of Health, are already on leave for 12 weeks on full pay."" At Asda, boss Roger Burnley said: ""We've committed to supporting our colleagues that have been identified by the government as needing to self-isolate for 12 weeks, ensuring these colleagues receive full pay for their isolation period."" The supermarket is also offering 12 weeks fully paid leave to those over the age of 70, or who are pregnant and classed as vulnerable, as well as the carers of extremely vulnerable people.

Free school meal scheme to continue over holidays,"Ministers are responding to fears that children on free school meals could go hungry Teachers' unions have welcomed a government decision that means families eligible for free school meals (FSM) will continue to receive financial help to buy food over the Easter holidays. Last week ministers said qualifying families could claim shopping vouchers of Â£15 a week per child in term time. Now the scheme will be extended in England over the two-week holiday. Unions said the move would help prevent children going hungry, as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove confirmed over the weekend that the vouchers would continue to be paid over the Easter holidays. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the leaders' union NAHT, said he was pleased to see the government ""taking action to support some of the most vulnerable children"". ""We know that for many children, lunch at school is their only hot meal of the day and, in some cases, their only meal full stop. ""The government is doing the right thing in stepping forward and making sure all children can continue to access the food they need."" Food vouchers for free school meals children How schools and charities plan to feed children Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Many struggling families will be finding it even harder than normal to make ends meet in the current emergency and with children at home for a long period. ""The extension of the voucher scheme will make a real difference in helping to alleviate the risk of children going hungry. ""We are particularly concerned about the impact of a prolonged shutdown of schools on these young people and their families, and are keen to work with the government on examining the full implications and what more support can be provided to them."" Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ''It will be important to get the message out this week that children who qualify for FSM are covered by the national voucher scheme during the Easter holiday period. ''Parents who did not previously qualify for free school meals but whose income has reduced or stopped due to the coronavirus crisis, may qualify based on their new financial circumstances. ""Parents and carers should check local authority websites for how to apply."" Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said providing for vulnerable pupils, including those on free school meals and with special educational needs and disabilities, was a ""top priority for councils and schools"". Ms Blake said the coronavirus pandemic had forced thousands of families into financial insecurity and warned that ""many parents who did not previously qualify for free school meals may be eligible for them"". ""We will continue to work with the Department for Education to ensure that these families have the certainty they need,"" she said. Families are being issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. Around 1.3 million in children in England are entitled to free school meals and, until now, schools had been making their own arrangements.

Airbnb hosts defy lockdown with 'Covid-19 retreats',"Airbnb hosts advertising properties as coronavirus hideouts are ""dangerous and irresponsible"", the government says. Owners have listed homes as being ""Covid-19 retreats"" and ""perfect for isolating with family"" in the British countryside. New coronavirus laws say holiday accommodation should be provided only to keyworkers needing to self-isolate. But some listings on the site allow instant booking of rentals without any vetting, BBC News discovered. The properties advertised as places to self-isolate include an ""idyllic cottage"", a houseboat and even a castle. Only one Airbnb host contacted by BBC News said their rental was available solely to keyworkers. But others complained the lockdown had disrupted their business. In response to the BBC News's findings, Tourism Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""Our advice is clear. ""Essential travel does not include holidays, leisure travel and visits to second homes - and people must remain in their primary residence. âIt is incredibly irresponsible, and dangerous for some property owners to be marketing themselves as âisolation retreatsâ. ""We are writing to companies today to remind them of their responsibilities at this time."" This listing was edited to remove the description above after BBC News contacted the host Individuals and businesses could face fines of up to Â£960 for breaking these rules, the government added. After being contacted by the BBC, Airbnb disabled its ""instant book"" function for whole properties.""We want hosts and guests to follow the rules and we have no tolerance for listings that ignore health or travel advisories,"" an Airbnb spokesperson said. ""The government has set out clear guidance on the limited conditions under which necessary travel is permitted and we have taken a number of steps to support these measures.""Hosts in the UK are also opening their homes to NHS and other healthcare providers as part of a global initiative that has seen more than 100,000 places to stay made available so far.""

Liverpool apologise & reverse furlough,"The Premier League has been suspended indefinitely with Liverpool 25 points clear at the top Liverpool have reversed their decision to place some non-playing staff on temporary leave and apologised to fans. On Saturday, the club said they were going toapply to the government's taxpayer-funded job retention scheme,sparking a fierce backlash. But in a letter to their fans, chief executive Peter Moore said: ""We believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that."" He added that the Reds have ""opted to find alternative means"" to pay staff. What are Premier League clubs doing on pay? The U-turn came after mounting criticism had led to talks between the club's US owners Fenway Sports Group, executives and key stakeholders. Liverpool had become the fifth Premier League team to furlough non-playing staff with the season suspended indefinitely because of the coronavirus pandemic. Staff affected were to receive 80% of their salary through the scheme and the club would make up the difference, despite making a profit of Â£42m last year. Liverpool are the world's seventh-richest football club. The decision was criticised by former Liverpool players Jamie Carragher and Stan Collymore. Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Bournemouth and Norwich City had already announced they will furlough some non-playing staff. ""Despite the fact we were in a healthy position prior to this crisis, our revenues have been shut off yet our outgoings remain,"" said Moore. ""And like almost every sector of society, there is great uncertainty and concern over our present and future. ""Like any responsible employer concerned for its workers in the current situation, the club continues to prepare for a range of different scenarios, around when football can return to operating as it did before the pandemic. ""These scenarios range from best case to worst, and everything in between. ""It is an unavoidable truth that several of these scenarios involve a massive downturn in revenue, with correspondingly unprecedented operating losses. ""Having these vital financial resources so profoundly impacted would obviously negatively affect our ability to operate as we previously have."" This video can not be played 'I don't think anybody is trying to be greedy' - Barnes on Liverpool's furlough U-turn Gareth Roberts, from the Anfield Wrap podcast, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the club may have made the original decision ""without thinking about the ramifications"", but eventually ""common sense had prevailed"". He added: ""It just felt wrong and I know Liverpool qualified for the government's job retention scheme. It boiled down to morals for me and we expect more from football clubs than other businesses because we are emotionally part of the club - it is something we support and put a lot of our money and time and effort into. ""In the statement they put out they are talking about revenues possibly going down without months of football. That is going to be a reality for all of football. ""They just hadn't viably consulted on it. There are plenty of people at the club who would have been opposed to it and it feels like someone, maybe at the very top of the club, made the decision without thinking about the ramifications and what it looked like reputation-wise. ""They have seen the mass reaction and decided to reverse that decision. Common sense has prevailed in the end."" Ex-defender Carragher had tweeted: ""Jurgen Klopp showed compassion for all at the start of this pandemic, senior players heavily involved in Premier League players taking wage cuts. Then all that respect and goodwill is lost - poor this, LFC."" Former striker Collymore posted on social media: ""I don't know of any Liverpool fan of any standing that won't be anything other than disgusted at the club for furloughing staff.

Who's in charge if a PM is incapacitated?,"Foreign SecretaryDominic Raabsaid he had ""all the authority"" he needed to make relevant decisions, as he deputised for Boris Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus. The prime minister,who has paid tribute to the NHS staff who cared for him, is now recovering at Chequers, and is not expected to return to work for some time. So who else shares power and how are decisions made while the prime minister is ill? Mr Raab is the foreign secretary, but he also has the title offirst secretary of state,external- giving him seniority above all other cabinet ministers. So if Mr Johnson did not return to his post, Mr Raab would take over in the first instance. When Mr Johnson was moved into intensive care, Mr Raab said the government would continue to focus ""at the prime minister's direction"" on defeating coronavirus. The role of deputy prime minister - like that of first secretary of state - is not a permanent position in government. Someone is appointed at the discretion of the prime minister. The last deputy PM was Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, during the 2010-15 coalition government with the Conservatives. Although Mr Raab was first asked to deputise for the PM while he was in intensive care, we know very little about the exact extent of his authority. There are various things only the prime minister can do - but some of these could be taken up by Mr Raab without much trouble. For example, he could make recommendations to the Queen on appointments to the senior judiciary and high-ranking positions in the Church of England. But it's harder to imagine him conducting a reshuffle - even though, formally, it seems he ought to have that power. It would be tricky for him to authorise military action at short notice. Other ministers would most likely have to agree first, but the buck would stop with Mr Raab. Then, there are theletters of last resort the prime minister writesfor nuclear submarines, giving commanding officers instructions about what to do in the event of a deadly attack. It's unlikely Mr Raab would have to write them unless Mr Johnson was incapacitated for a long time. When asked if his role let him take decisions, Mr Raab said there was ""total unity"" among his cabinet colleagues and referred to the system of collective responsibility. It means that in practice, any major decisions will probably be taken by Mr Raab in consultation with the cabinet or, where appropriate, senior civil servants. The cabinet is the ultimate decision-making body of government, made up of the most senior ministers including the home secretary, the health secretary and the chancellor of the exchequer. After February's general election, Boris Johnsonformed a cabinetof 22 full members - including himself - and four other attending members. So although he's the head of the government and has some individual powers, most important decisions are taken collectively in cabinet. And the principle of ""collective responsibility"" means each cabinet decision is binding for each member - even if they personally disagreed with it. Not all decisions are taken by full cabinet. It's normal for there to be ""cabinet committees"" - smaller groups of ministers focused on specific issues. There are four ""implementation committees"" working on different parts of the response. They're looking at healthcare, the public sector response, economics and business, and the international response. Each is chaired by a cabinet minister and feeding into a daily overarching ""C-19 meeting"" - led in the prime minister's absence by Dominic Raab. Power is no protection from harm If Boris Johnson wasn't able to continue as PM, the rules for what should happen next are unclear - a consequence of the UK's unwritten constitution. But we do have some idea of what might happen. Thecabinet manual,externalis the closest thing we have to a document which sets out the role of the prime minister. It suggests the cabinet would select a replacement who the Queen would ask to form a government. That could be Mr Raab or another senior MP. The expectation is that he or she would be in place until the Conservative Party appointed a new leader. According to the Institute for Government think tank, prime ministers continue in office unless they resign or die. It adds: ""While political parties usually have the ability to appoint an 'acting leader' if the leader resigns or is incapacitated, there is no formal 'acting prime minister' role. He or she would be prime minister until they chose to resign or if their cabinet forced them out."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

As it happened: Monday's coronavirus updates in WalesRead back through the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Wales.,"First Minister Mark Drakeford and opposition party leaders say their thoughts are with Boris Johnson and his family following the ""concerning news"" that the prime minister is in intensive care Another 27 deaths in Wales linked to coronavirus were confirmed on Monday, taking the total to 193 There are now 3,499 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Wales, an increase of 302 An intensive care consultant in Newport says she has never seen so many sick young patients Nicola Bryan, David Dulin and Ben Frampton That wraps up today's live coverage of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Gavin and Stacey star Rob Brydon is backing a scheme that offers support vulnerable residents who have been told to self-isolate but donât have any family, friends or neighbours to call on for help. Neath Port Talbot council's Safe and Well scheme makes arrangements for a trusted volunteer to help with daily living tasks such as food shopping, collecting medical supplies, posting mail and any other reasonable tasks. From tomorrow, the law about staying two metres apart will extend to all workplaces. The new rules apply to those workplaces not already covered by the original stay-at-home rules introduced almost two weeks ago. Guidance will be issued to explain what can reasonably be expected of employers and businesses. A consultant has described the reality of treating coronavirus patients in one of the worst-hit areas of Wales. Dr Ami Jones is looking after 13 patients on ventilatorsat Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, which is double the usual number.

Jeff Lavington was in hospital recovering from a stroke The son of an
81-year-old man who died after contracting coronavirus in hospital has blamed
his father's death on a lack of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline
NHS staff. Jeff Lavington, from Carmarthen, caught the virus while recovering from a stroke at the town's Glangwili General Hospital. His son Mark Lavington said the staff
caring for him did an ""amazing job"", but claimed some of those
treating him were protected only by disposable gloves, disposable polythene
aprons, and surgical masks. He said: ""From talking to two members of staff on the ward, I gather that one of the members of staff had been exhibiting symptoms."" Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience for Hywel Dda University
Health Board, said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family at this
time and our door is open should they wish to discuss any matters about the
care of their loved one. ""Our staff
working in our hospitals and communities are working tremendously hard and
adjusting environments and pathways of care during these extraordinary times,
in line with expert guidance and in order to keep our patients as safe as
possible. ""Our staff
have been issued with personal protective equipment and are using this in line
with guidance and we have been testing frontline NHS staff in Wales for several
weeks."" Jeff Lavington died at Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen Farmers are being forced to dump milk because of a collapse
in the market. Llyr Griffiths, a farmer in Llangoedmor, near Cardigan, had to dump his milk after his processor, which supplies coffee shops and cruises, lost the majority of its milk sales because of the Covid-19
pandemic. He said: ""It was heartbreaking. I had to dump Â£3,000-worth of milk
in half an hour, while supermarkets apparently have empty shelves... ""Getting rid of the milk in front of my four-year-old boy was
difficult."" More than Â£3,000 worth of milk was dumped in half an hour There could be rising tensions in family homes during the coronavirus pandemic, a researcher into relationships has said. Prof Jacqui Gabb from the Open University said people typically spend two-and-a-half hours together each day, but this has rocketed to 15 or 16 hours per day since lockdown began. ""All the ingredients"" for additional stresses on relationships are there, she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

He was diagnosed with coronavirus more than a week ago, but as many patients are finding, his condition deteriorated rapidly. We'll bring you the latest on that as we get it. But our new coverage is up and running -you can follow it here. New Zealand has recorded 54 new virus cases - the lowest number the country has seen in two weeks. Earlier Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country appeared ""at this early stage to be on track"". New Zealand is currently in a state of emergency and a lockdown has been in place for almost two weeks. All schools and non-essential services have been closed and five million people told not to leave their house unless necessary. People have also been called to stick to their ""bubble"" - your family or the group of people that you live with. ""Whatever your bubble is for the month, this is the bubble that you must maintain,"" said Ardern. There are currently 1,160 confirmed cases in New Zealand, with one death. This video can not be played We're all having to find new ways to fill our time during lockdown. With no customers, Michael Purchase, a Nottinghamshire pub manager in the UK, found a way to serve himself a pint of ""rail ale"" at his bar. Take a watch. The lockdown of Luzon, the most populous island in the Philippines, has been extended to 30 April. The measures had been due to end next week. The Philippines was one of the first countries to adopt strict home quarantine measures. Rules restricting movement and gatherings have been in place in and around the capital, Manila, for nearly a month now since the confirmation of the first domestic transmission. There have been 3,660 positive tests and 163 deaths in the Philippines. But like many countries in the region, there have been very few tests carried out, so the actual number of infections is thought to be much higher. Donald Trump has said the US would ""retaliate"" if India turned down his request to release stocks of a drug that he has called a ""game-changer"" in the fight against Covid-19. Mr Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, a day after the country banned the export of hydroxychloroquine, which it manufactures in large quantities. ""I said we'd appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesnât allow it to come out, that would be okay, but of course there may be retaliation,"" he said during a White House briefing on Monday. India is reportedly still ""considering"" the request. Hydroxychloroquine is very similar to Chloroquine, one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs. But is India really in a position to help the US? And does the drug even work against the coronavirus? You can read morehere   New Zealand's health minister has called himself an ""idiot"" after breaking the lockdown by driving his family to the beach. David Clark admitted the 12-mile (20km) drive was ""a clear breach of the lockdown principles"". He offered his resignation to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but kept his job because of the ongoing crisis. Clark admitted the trip to Ardern after being criticised for another breach of the rules. Last week, he drove a shorter distance to a mountain bike trail - and his van, featuring a picture of himself on the side, wasphotographed at the trail.,external With British PM Boris Johnson in intensive care, what does this mean for the UK government and the country as a whole? The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg breaks it down for us here: This video can not be played Coronavirus and Boris Johnson: 'Terrible time to be without a figurehead' Sweden's government has asked parliament to give it additional powers - which could be an indicator it's heading towards tighter measures or even a lockdown after all. Sweden so far has taken a markedly different approach - that is it did not enforce any tough measures like the rest of Europe has. Instead, the  government has called for people to simply be responsible and follow social distancing guidelines. But shops, restaurants and businesses remain open. Visits to elderly homes are no longer allowed, though. So far, there are 7,206 confirmed infections and 477 deaths in Sweden. While those numbers might seem low compared to the UK, Germany, Spain or Italy, do keep in mind that there are only about 10 million people living in Sweden. The major news out of the UK overnight has been that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. Mr Johnson, who is the most prominent victim yet of the pandemic, is in St Thomas' Hospital in London. We've been told he was moved to intensive care in case he needs ventilation - help to breathe. A statement by Downing Street said he was receiving ""excellent care"". We've not received any further news as to his condition as yet. Farmers in Australia are using billboards to reassure people that there will be no shortage of food during the coronavirus outbreak. The National Farmers Federation is running street adverts in Melbourne that read: ""Donât panic. Weâre experts at working from home."" It comes as grocery stores see waves of panic buying by shoppers worried about food supplies. ""Farmers want all Australians to know that running out of food is one thing they donât need to be worrying about in these challenging times,"" the organisation's president Fiona Simson said in a statement. South Korea has reported fewer than 50 new cases for the second day in a row. It reported 47 new cases - of which 17 were overseas arrivals - on Monday, according to news site Yonhap News, which added that there are now 10,331 cases in the country. South Korea's approach to getting the virus under control has been praised by many. It's basically been down to two things - testing and tracing. It was quick to implement digital contact tracing and also carried out testing on a mass scale, with tens of thousands of people being tested every day. Belgium uses its well-loved food and drink to encourage people to keep their distance Until a few weeks ago, social distancing was an alien idea to most of us. Now, as we learn to navigate this new world, different countries and cultures are figuring out how to best explain new public health measures. Belgians should be keeping apart the same distance as 22 bottles of Orval beer, 10 cones of chips, or three crates of beer. (Presumably those supplies are useful for self-isolation, too.) While in Kenya, one graphic explains that the length of a lion is the correct distance to keep from others. But please don't use actual lions, it warns. A graphic in Kenya encourages people to stay the distance of one lion away from others And in Mexico, superhero Susana Distancia was launched by the government to encourage people to keep their distance and stay at home. Her name is a play on words that translate as ""your healthy distance"". Susana Distancia's superpower is extending her arms 1.5m to create a bubble protecting herself and others from infection Meanwhile in Egypt, a very catchy song with old footage of famous actor Adel Imam is being broadcast on television and even in the streets. ""Don't kiss, don't shake hands, don't transmit the virus,"" it sings. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There are growing concerns over the situation in Indonesia. The country has registered around 2,500 infections and 209 deaths with a confirmed Covid-19 link. But with very low levels of testing, Indonesia's Doctor's Association warnsthe situation could be far worse than the official statistics are suggesting. The news on Monday that 24 doctors are among the dead seemed to confirm the criticism that the health system is woefully unprepared. That picture above actually shows medical staff wearing raincoats instead of proper protective gear. In Jakarta, there's now a special police unit to guard the burials of Covid-19 victims because of fears that worried residents will block funerals. In several cities, angry citizens have already tried to block ambulances from bringing victims to the local cemetery. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Canadian hospitals near the US border in Michigan are asking staff to pick a
side and stay there. Some 1,600 healthcare workers from Windsor-Essex county in Canada travel over the border each day, the county's health authorities say. Windsor Regional Hospital has asked staff members who work in nearby
Detroit to choose a side. More than half chose to remain. The hospital's CEO David Musyj told the BBC he does not want to
stop workers from working in Detroit but he is concerned it is not safe for them to work both sides of the border during the pandemic. He worries that if these steps aren't taken, officials may close the border entirely, which would ""devastate"" Detroit's supply of healthcare workers. ""Our local public health leaders can and should put into place rigid screening mechanisms and self isolation mechanisms for these individuals if and when they come home to Windsor.""  Frances MaoSydney Weâre living in a weird time. However it plays out,

Queen: 'We will succeed',"This video can not be played The Queen: ""We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again"" The Queen has said the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, in a rallying message to the nation. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"". She also thanked key workers, saying ""every hour"" of work ""brings us closer to a return to more normal times"". It comes as the number of people to die with the virus in the UK reached 4,934. Speaking from Windsor Castle, the Queen said: ""While we have faced challenges before, this one is different."" ""This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us. ""We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again."" The Queen, 93, also said the ""painful sense of separation from their loved ones"" that social distancing was causing for people reminded her of the experience child evacuees had during the Second World War. ""Now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do,"" she said. An hour after the Queen's broadcast, Downing Street announced thatPrime Minister Boris Johnson had been taken to hospitalfollowing his coronavirus diagnosis. Mr Johnson has been self-isolating since he tested positive for the virus on 27 March. The monarch said she was reminded of her first radio broadcast, in 1940, when she and her sister Princess Margaret spoke to child evacuees In her address, the Queen said everyone who was following guidance to stay at home was ""helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones"". ""Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,"" she added. She also stressed the value of self-discipline and resolve - and said she hopes that, in the future, everyone would ""be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge"". There have been difficult royal speeches and addresses in the past - times when the wrong word or the wrong phrase could have undermined the message or let slip a critical opportunity. The broadcast after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 for example, or the speech the Queen gave on her visit to Ireland in 2011. The Palace could have played it safe, stressed unity and given thanks. It would have served. This was a different and much more ambitious broadcast, designed to reassure and to inspire. But most of all to recast this crisis as a defining moment in a nation which will forever remember its collective effort to save the lives of its vulnerable. Read more here. The pre-recorded message, written by the Queen with her private secretary Sir Edward Young, was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment. All other technical staff were in another room. It was broadcast on TV, radio and social media channels. The Queen's broadcast in full The decision to deliver the address was made ""in close consultation with Downing Street"", BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. Rainbows drawn by children would become a ""symbol"" of the UK's ""national spirit"" in the face of the pandemic, the Queen said Nightingale Hospital  -the first temporary field hospital to open to treat coronavirus patients- shared photos on Twitter of staff listening to the speech, andthanked the monarch,externalfor recognising the hard work of frontline NHS staff. The UK government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidthe Queen's address was ""striking and important"",external. The new Labour leaderSir Keir Starmer said,externalthe monarch spoke for the whole country ""and our determination to defeat the coronavirus"". The Queen's address came less than a week after her son, thePrince of Wales, came out of self-isolation, following his coronavirus diagnosis. Prince Charles, 71, spent seven days self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive and displaying mild symptoms. It is only the fifth time the monarch has given such a speech in her 68-year reign. While her Christmas Day message is an annual event, only rarely has the Queen made rallying speeches at key moments in the life of the nation: A televised speech to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 A special address to the nation on the eve of her mother's funeral in April 2002 A live broadcast on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in September 1997 And a statement at the beginning of the land war in Iraq on 24 February 1991 Read more here.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health The Department of Health said on Sunday there had been 621 more coronavirus-related deaths in the UK in the past day.

5G does not spread virus,"Conspiracy theories claiming 5G technology helps transmit coronavirus have been condemned by the scientific community. Videos have been shared on social mediashowing mobile phone masts on firein Birmingham and Merseyside - along with the claims. The UK's mobile networks have reported20 cases of masts being targetedin suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend, including damage to a mast providing mobile connectivity to Birmingham's Nightingale Hospital. The posts have been shared on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - including by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. TV regulator Ofcom isassessing comments made by presenter Eamonn Holmesin which hecast doubts on media outletsfor their attempts to debunk the claims. But scientists say the idea of a connection between Covid-19 and 5G is ""complete rubbish"" and biologically impossible. The conspiracy theories have been branded ""the worst kind of fake news"" by NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis. Many of those sharing the post are pushing a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is somehow responsible for coronavirus. These theories appear to have first emerged via Facebook posts in late January, around the same time the first cases were recorded in the US. They appear to fall broadly in to two camps: One claims 5G can suppress the immune system, thus making people more susceptible to catching the virus. The other suggests the virus can somehow be transmitted through the use of 5G technology. Both these notions are ""complete rubbish,"" says Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside, prompting investigations ""The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny,"" Dr Clarke says. ""Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of thing - by being tired one day, or not having a good diet. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses."" While very strong radio waves can cause heating, 5G is nowhere near strong enough to heat people up enough to have any meaningful effect. ""Radio waves can disrupt your physiology as they heat you up, meaning your immune system can't function. But [the energy levels from] 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this."" The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays. It would also be impossible for 5G to transmit the virus, Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, adds. ""The present epidemic is caused by a virus that is passed from one infected person to another. We know this is true. We even have the virus growing in our lab, obtained from a person with the illness. Viruses and electromagnetic waves that make mobile phones and internet connections work are different things. As different as chalk and cheese,"" he says. It's also important to note another major flaw with the conspiracy theories - coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Iran that have yet to roll out the technology. There were plenty of scare stories about 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak which Reality Check has already looked into, such as this piece:Does 5G pose health risks? Earlier this year, a long-running study from the watchdog the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) rebutted these claims, sayingthere was no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses. But if anything, the misinformation seems to have escalated. Trade body Mobile UK has said false rumours and theories linking 5G and coronavirus were ""concerning,"" while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has reiterated there is ""absolutely no credible evidence for the link"". Viruses invade human or animal cells and use them to reproduce, which is what causes infection. Viruses cannot live very long outside a living thing, so they have to find a way in - usually via droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes. Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans - and then began to pass from human to human.

"'Too early' to consider lockdown exit strategyThe foreign secretary says measures are ""beginning to work"", as the number of deaths reaches 5,373.UK","This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Boris Johnson ""still remains in charge of the government"" It is too early to consider a strategy for exiting the coronavirus lockdown, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab said the current measures were ""beginning to work"" - but shifting focus could mean ""we won't get through the peak as fast as we need to"". He added Boris Johnson remained in charge of the government from hospital, where the PM spent the night receiving treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The number of virus hospital deaths in the UK now stands at 5,373. The Department of Health and Social Care reported 51,608 confirmed cases. Asked during the government's daily briefing when the current social distancing measures could be lifted, the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said it must first establish when the peak of the epidemic will come. ""The key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we have reached the peak, and [that] this is now beyond the peak,"" he said. ""At that point, I think it [will be] possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do, step by step, to move to the next phase of managing this.""

Liverpool apologise & reverse furloughLiverpool reverse their decision to place some non-playing staff on temporary leave and apologise to fans.,"The Premier League has been suspended indefinitely with Liverpool 25 points clear at the top Liverpool have reversed their decision to place some non-playing staff on temporary leave and apologised to fans. On Saturday, the club said they were going toapply to the government's taxpayer-funded job retention scheme,sparking a fierce backlash. But in a letter to their fans, chief executive Peter Moore said: ""We believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that."" He added that the Reds have ""opted to find alternative means"" to pay staff. What are Premier League clubs doing on pay? The U-turn came after mounting criticism had led to talks between the club's US owners Fenway Sports Group, executives and key stakeholders. Liverpool had become the fifth Premier League team to furlough non-playing staff with the season suspended indefinitely because of the coronavirus pandemic. Staff affected were to receive 80% of their salary through the scheme and the club would make up the difference, despite making a profit of Â£42m last year. Liverpool are the world's seventh-richest football club. The decision was criticised by former Liverpool players Jamie Carragher and Stan Collymore. Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Bournemouth and Norwich City had already announced they will furlough some non-playing staff. ""Despite the fact we were in a healthy position prior to this crisis, our revenues have been shut off yet our outgoings remain,"" said Moore. ""And like almost every sector of society, there is great uncertainty and concern over our present and future. ""Like any responsible employer concerned for its workers in the current situation, the club continues to prepare for a range of different scenarios, around when football can return to operating as it did before the pandemic. ""These scenarios range from best case to worst, and everything in between. ""It is an unavoidable truth that several of these scenarios involve a massive downturn in revenue, with correspondingly unprecedented operating losses. ""Having these vital financial resources so profoundly impacted would obviously negatively affect our ability to operate as we previously have."" This video can not be played 'I don't think anybody is trying to be greedy' - Barnes on Liverpool's furlough U-turn Gareth Roberts, from the Anfield Wrap podcast, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the club may have made the original decision ""without thinking about the ramifications"", but eventually ""common sense had prevailed"". He added: ""It just felt wrong and I know Liverpool qualified for the government's job retention scheme. It boiled down to morals for me and we expect more from football clubs than other businesses because we are emotionally part of the club - it is something we support and put a lot of our money and time and effort into. ""In the statement they put out they are talking about revenues possibly going down without months of football. That is going to be a reality for all of football. ""They just hadn't viably consulted on it. There are plenty of people at the club who would have been opposed to it and it feels like someone, maybe at the very top of the club, made the decision without thinking about the ramifications and what it looked like reputation-wise. ""They have seen the mass reaction and decided to reverse that decision. Common sense has prevailed in the end."" Ex-defender Carragher had tweeted: ""Jurgen Klopp showed compassion for all at the start of this pandemic, senior players heavily involved in Premier League players taking wage cuts. Then all that respect and goodwill is lost - poor this, LFC."" Former striker Collymore posted on social media: ""I don't know of any Liverpool fan of any standing that won't be anything other than disgusted at the club for furloughing staff.

âOvernight all my paying work disappearedâ,"Matt Haydock runs a paddle sports business in Lochaber People who make their living from outdoors pursuits have told of the dramatic effect coronavirus has had on their businesses. Kayaking coach Zoe Newsam said her bookings dropped ""precipitously"" when social distancing began to be discussed. The lockdown saw the ""tap being turned off completely"" on bookings. Climbing instructor Alan Halewood said months-worth of upcoming work for him was also in doubt. Beauly-based Zoe, who has been coaching since 2013 and running her own business for five years, travelled UK-wide for her work. Her work started to drop off in the early days of the virus outbreak in the UK. She said: ""With the introduction of travel restrictions, and then social distancing measures were put into place, the only thing to do was to cancel or postpone all courses for the foreseeable future. ""When the announcement came that we were to avoid non-essential travel, it almost came as a relief - but one that resulted in a very empty diary. Overnight, all my paying work disappeared at the time of year when I'd be expecting bookings to be picking up."" Zoe Newsam is a kayaking coach based in Beauly Zoe came up with alternative ways of earning a little money such as offering personal training via video calling, but she said: ""Every other trainer did the same thing, so the market is suddenly flooded with fitness coaches."" She said the government self-employed assistance scheme would help ""a little"" but, because her profits have been consistently low, it would not be enough to cover mortgage and other bills. She is also not eligible for benefits as her partner is still working. Zoe is going to work part-time as a temporary supermarket delivery driver to help make ends meet, and to help supply other people with food. She said: ""I'm trying very hard not to think about the future. The scale of what lies ahead just feels too large. ""I worry that the market for outdoor sports won't return for a while, as people struggle with lack of money once the crisis is eventually over. ""I worry that we will be restricted in our travel for some time to come, meaning that some of my work will be impossible to undertake. ""This crisis certainly brings home the fragility of our industry, and the lack of security inherent in it. We spend many thousands of hours and pounds on training, but rarely make much money from it."" Lochaber-based Matt Haydock's paddle sports business Rapid Development had a full work diary through to the middle of 2021 before the coronavirus outbreak. ""Since the prime minister's first big announcement on 16 March, which put in place the initial social distancing measures, my entire work diary emptied literally overnight. All planned activities, trips, coaching sessions were cancelled outright,"" he said. More stringent measures soon followed, and Matt said: ""My Google Calendar emptied itself, and I was looking at no possible income stream, almost immediately. ""Coming to terms with this was pretty daunting to say the least, particularly before the government announced any form of support package."" Matt holds on to a hope the industry can bounce back, but he said: ""Alongside the fears we all share of losing loved ones, catching the virus, and this lasting six months or more, I am deeply fearful for the outdoor industry when we exit this crisis. ""For most in the outdoors, many have just come out the other side of a harsh winter with little work, ready to make money to cover themselves as the main season commences."" Climbing instructor and guide Alan has been working for himself under his business Climb When You're Ready and as a freelance for others for 11 years. His work includes providing training and assessments at Glenmore Lodge, the Scottish National Outdoor Training Centre in the Cairngorms. ""My first day's work cancelled was 16 March. All work for the immediate future went on hold overnight,"" he said. ""I should have had 13 days of work since then and I've cancelled 44 more days up to the end of May. ""Beyond that I've another 50 days beyond that that are all threatened. I'm also usually busy filling my diary up to six months ahead at this point but all new enquiries have disappeared and ongoing discussions on dates with existing clients are on hold indefinitely. ""Work has come to a crashing halt and income has dried up overnight."" Alan said one regular employer had honoured a payment as a cancellation fee for a handful of bookings and one larger overseas contract had a 25% cancellation fee built it. He said those in the outdoor industry were trying to find alternative employment, and also offer help to their communities. ""Outdoors professionals are all first aiders, are often good at problem solving and quite resilient,"" he said. ""I know some have taken jobs in supermarkets and others are volunteering with the NHS and other bodies. We aren't used to being inactive."" Writer and photographer Chris Townsend believes the impact on the outdoor industry will be felt for years to come Outdoor writer and photographer Chris Townsend said he was ""very concerned"" for instructors and guides. He said: ""No-one works in the outdoors field to make money - we do it because we love it - so people don't have reserves to fall back on. ""It can take years to build a reputation and a business that just about provides a living. ""Doing this again will be very difficult.""

"Airbnb hosts defy lockdown with 'Covid-19 retreats'Government criticises ""dangerous and irresponsible"" listings of coronavirus isolation properties.","Airbnb hosts advertising properties as coronavirus hideouts are ""dangerous and irresponsible"", the government says. Owners have listed homes as being ""Covid-19 retreats"" and ""perfect for isolating with family"" in the British countryside. New coronavirus laws say holiday accommodation should be provided only to keyworkers needing to self-isolate. But some listings on the site allow instant booking of rentals without any vetting, BBC News discovered. The properties advertised as places to self-isolate include an ""idyllic cottage"", a houseboat and even a castle. Only one Airbnb host contacted by BBC News said their rental was available solely to keyworkers. But others complained the lockdown had disrupted their business. In response to the BBC News's findings, Tourism Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""Our advice is clear. ""Essential travel does not include holidays, leisure travel and visits to second homes - and people must remain in their primary residence. âIt is incredibly irresponsible, and dangerous for some property owners to be marketing themselves as âisolation retreatsâ. ""We are writing to companies today to remind them of their responsibilities at this time."" This listing was edited to remove the description above after BBC News contacted the host Individuals and businesses could face fines of up to Â£960 for breaking these rules, the government added. After being contacted by the BBC, Airbnb disabled its ""instant book"" function for whole properties.""We want hosts and guests to follow the rules and we have no tolerance for listings that ignore health or travel advisories,"" an Airbnb spokesperson said. ""The government has set out clear guidance on the limited conditions under which necessary travel is permitted and we have taken a number of steps to support these measures.""Hosts in the UK are also opening their homes to NHS and other healthcare providers as part of a global initiative that has seen more than 100,000 places to stay made available so far.""

"Airbnb hosts defy lockdown with 'Covid-19 retreats'Government criticises ""dangerous and irresponsible"" listings of coronavirus isolation properties.Technology","Airbnb hosts advertising properties as coronavirus hideouts are ""dangerous and irresponsible"", the government says. Owners have listed homes as being ""Covid-19 retreats"" and ""perfect for isolating with family"" in the British countryside. New coronavirus laws say holiday accommodation should be provided only to keyworkers needing to self-isolate. But some listings on the site allow instant booking of rentals without any vetting, BBC News discovered. The properties advertised as places to self-isolate include an ""idyllic cottage"", a houseboat and even a castle. Only one Airbnb host contacted by BBC News said their rental was available solely to keyworkers. But others complained the lockdown had disrupted their business. In response to the BBC News's findings, Tourism Minister Nigel Huddleston said: ""Our advice is clear. ""Essential travel does not include holidays, leisure travel and visits to second homes - and people must remain in their primary residence. âIt is incredibly irresponsible, and dangerous for some property owners to be marketing themselves as âisolation retreatsâ. ""We are writing to companies today to remind them of their responsibilities at this time."" This listing was edited to remove the description above after BBC News contacted the host Individuals and businesses could face fines of up to Â£960 for breaking these rules, the government added. After being contacted by the BBC, Airbnb disabled its ""instant book"" function for whole properties.""We want hosts and guests to follow the rules and we have no tolerance for listings that ignore health or travel advisories,"" an Airbnb spokesperson said. ""The government has set out clear guidance on the limited conditions under which necessary travel is permitted and we have taken a number of steps to support these measures.""Hosts in the UK are also opening their homes to NHS and other healthcare providers as part of a global initiative that has seen more than 100,000 places to stay made available so far.""

"'Too early' to consider lockdown exit strategyThe foreign secretary says measures are ""beginning to work"", as the number of deaths reaches 5,373.UKSturgeon defends response to Calderwood revelationsScotland's first minister says she is ""deeply sorry"" for the situation, but stands by her decision-making.Scotland","This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Boris Johnson ""still remains in charge of the government"" It is too early to consider a strategy for exiting the coronavirus lockdown, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab said the current measures were ""beginning to work"" - but shifting focus could mean ""we won't get through the peak as fast as we need to"". He added Boris Johnson remained in charge of the government from hospital, where the PM spent the night receiving treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The number of virus hospital deaths in the UK now stands at 5,373. The Department of Health and Social Care reported 51,608 confirmed cases. Asked during the government's daily briefing when the current social distancing measures could be lifted, the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said it must first establish when the peak of the epidemic will come. ""The key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we have reached the peak, and [that] this is now beyond the peak,"" he said. ""At that point, I think it [will be] possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do, step by step, to move to the next phase of managing this."" He added to start ""having that discussion"" before then would be a mistake. It is the first time Prof Whitty has appeared at one of the briefings since spending time in self-isolation after he showed symptoms. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

""We need to know how well the current restrictions are working before we can say anything sensible about what the next stage might be."" This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says it is too soon to talk about relaxing restrictions In a tweet on Monday, Mr Johnson said he was in ""good spirits"" after spending the night in St Thomas' Hospital in London. The prime minister, 55, tested positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. He was taken to hospital on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature and a cough - for routine tests. Asked whether it was appropriate for the prime minister to run the government from hospital, Mr Raab said Mr Johnson would ""take the medical advice that he gets from his doctor"". He added he had not spoken to the prime minister since Saturday. Asked whether people should work while recovering from the virus, Prof Whitty said some of his own patients were ""perfectly capable of managing massively complicated things"" from their hospital beds.

US President Donald Trump is among those who has sent his wishes to his ""great friend"" Mr Johnson. And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he hoped the prime minister had a ""speedy recovery"". Meanwhile, the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake  told the BBC it might be ""sensible"" for Mr Johnson to ""step back"" if he was not well enough to carry out his role. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, said Mr Johnson would probably have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital. Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March.

Gavin and Stacey star Rob Brydon is backing a scheme that offers support vulnerable residents who have been told to self-isolate but donât have any family, friends or neighbours to call on for help. Neath Port Talbot council's Safe and Well scheme makes arrangements for a trusted volunteer to help with daily living tasks such as food shopping, collecting medical supplies, posting mail and any other reasonable tasks. From tomorrow, the law about staying two metres apart will extend to all workplaces. The new rules apply to those workplaces not already covered by the original stay-at-home rules introduced almost two weeks ago. Guidance will be issued to explain what can reasonably be expected of employers and businesses. A consultant has described the reality of treating coronavirus patients in one of the worst-hit areas of Wales. Dr Ami Jones is looking after 13 patients on ventilatorsat Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, which is double the usual number. ""If we have to get to that 10 times capacity surge, we're going to be absolutely at the limit,"" she said. The Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart has sent his ""warmest wishes to the prime minister
and, of course, Carrie, for whom this must be an especially worrying time.""

Jeff Lavington was in hospital recovering from a stroke The son of an
81-year-old man who died after contracting coronavirus in hospital has blamed
his father's death on a lack of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline
NHS staff. Jeff Lavington, from Carmarthen, caught the virus while recovering from a stroke at the town's Glangwili General Hospital. His son Mark Lavington said the staff
caring for him did an ""amazing job"", but claimed some of those
treating him were protected only by disposable gloves, disposable polythene
aprons, and surgical masks. He said: ""From talking to two members of staff on the ward, I gather that one of the members of staff had been exhibiting symptoms."" Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience for Hywel Dda University
Health Board, said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family at this
time and our door is open should they wish to discuss any matters about the
care of their loved one. ""Our staff
working in our hospitals and communities are working tremendously hard and
adjusting environments and pathways of care during these extraordinary times,
in line with expert guidance and in order to keep our patients as safe as
possible. ""Our staff
have been issued with personal protective equipment and are using this in line
with guidance and we have been testing frontline NHS staff in Wales for several
weeks."" Jeff Lavington died at Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen Farmers are being forced to dump milk because of a collapse
in the market. Llyr Griffiths, a farmer in Llangoedmor, near Cardigan, had to dump his milk after his processor, which supplies coffee shops and cruises, lost the majority of its milk sales because of the Covid-19
pandemic. He said: ""It was heartbreaking. I had to dump Â£3,000-worth of milk
in half an hour, while supermarkets apparently have empty shelves... ""Getting rid of the milk in front of my four-year-old boy was
difficult."" More than Â£3,000 worth of milk was dumped in half an hour There could be rising tensions in family homes during the coronavirus pandemic, a researcher into relationships has said. Prof Jacqui Gabb from the Open University said people typically spend two-and-a-half hours together each day, but this has rocketed to 15 or 16 hours per day since lockdown began. ""All the ingredients"" for additional stresses on relationships are there, she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

He was diagnosed with coronavirus more than a week ago, but as many patients are finding, his condition deteriorated rapidly. We'll bring you the latest on that as we get it. But our new coverage is up and running -you can follow it here. New Zealand has recorded 54 new virus cases - the lowest number the country has seen in two weeks. Earlier Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country appeared ""at this early stage to be on track"". New Zealand is currently in a state of emergency and a lockdown has been in place for almost two weeks. All schools and non-essential services have been closed and five million people told not to leave their house unless necessary. People have also been called to stick to their ""bubble"" - your family or the group of people that you live with. ""Whatever your bubble is for the month, this is the bubble that you must maintain,"" said Ardern. There are currently 1,160 confirmed cases in New Zealand, with one death.

With no customers, Michael Purchase, a Nottinghamshire pub manager in the UK, found a way to serve himself a pint of ""rail ale"" at his bar. Take a watch. The lockdown of Luzon, the most populous island in the Philippines, has been extended to 30 April. The measures had been due to end next week. The Philippines was one of the first countries to adopt strict home quarantine measures. Rules restricting movement and gatherings have been in place in and around the capital, Manila, for nearly a month now since the confirmation of the first domestic transmission. There have been 3,660 positive tests and 163 deaths in the Philippines. But like many countries in the region, there have been very few tests carried out, so the actual number of infections is thought to be much higher. Donald Trump has said the US would ""retaliate"" if India turned down his request to release stocks of a drug that he has called a ""game-changer"" in the fight against Covid-19. Mr Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, a day after the country banned the export of hydroxychloroquine, which it manufactures in large quantities. ""I said we'd appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesnât allow it to come out, that would be okay, but of course there may be retaliation,"" he said during a White House briefing on Monday. India is reportedly still ""considering"" the request. Hydroxychloroquine is very similar to Chloroquine, one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs. But is India really in a position to help the US? And does the drug even work against the coronavirus?

David Clark admitted the 12-mile (20km) drive was ""a clear breach of the lockdown principles"". He offered his resignation to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but kept his job because of the ongoing crisis. Clark admitted the trip to Ardern after being criticised for another breach of the rules. Last week, he drove a shorter distance to a mountain bike trail - and his van, featuring a picture of himself on the side, wasphotographed at the trail.,external With British PM Boris Johnson in intensive care, what does this mean for the UK government and the country as a whole? The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg breaks it down for us here: This video can not be played Coronavirus and Boris Johnson: 'Terrible time to be without a figurehead' Sweden's government has asked parliament to give it additional powers - which could be an indicator it's heading towards tighter measures or even a lockdown after all. Sweden so far has taken a markedly different approach - that is it did not enforce any tough measures like the rest of Europe has. Instead, the  government has called for people to simply be responsible and follow social distancing guidelines. But shops, restaurants and businesses remain open. Visits to elderly homes are no longer allowed, though. So far, there are 7,206 confirmed infections and 477 deaths in Sweden. While those numbers might seem low compared to the UK, Germany, Spain or Italy, do keep in mind that there are only about 10 million people living in Sweden. The major news out of the UK overnight has been that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. Mr Johnson, who is the most prominent victim yet of the pandemic, is in St Thomas' Hospital in London. We've been told he was moved to intensive care in case he needs ventilation - help to breathe. A statement by Downing Street said he was receiving ""excellent care"". We've not received any further news as to his condition as yet. Farmers in Australia are using billboards to reassure people that there will be no shortage of food during the coronavirus outbreak. The National Farmers Federation is running street adverts in Melbourne that read: ""Donât panic. Weâre experts at working from home."" It comes as grocery stores see waves of panic buying by shoppers worried about food supplies. ""Farmers want all Australians to know that running out of food is one thing they donât need to be worrying about in these challenging times,"" the organisation's president Fiona Simson said in a statement. South Korea has reported fewer than 50 new cases for the second day in a row. It reported 47 new cases - of which 17 were overseas arrivals - on Monday, according to news site Yonhap News, which added that there are now 10,331 cases in the country. South Korea's approach to getting the virus under control has been praised by many. It's basically been down to two things - testing and tracing. It was quick to implement digital contact tracing and also carried out testing on a mass scale, with tens of thousands of people being tested every day. Belgium uses its well-loved food and drink to encourage people to keep their distance Until a few weeks ago, social distancing was an alien idea to most of us. Now, as we learn to navigate this new world, different countries and cultures are figuring out how to best explain new public health measures. Belgians should be keeping apart the same distance as 22 bottles of Orval beer, 10 cones of chips, or three crates of beer. (Presumably those supplies are useful for self-isolation, too.) While in Kenya, one graphic explains that the length of a lion is the correct distance to keep from others. But please don't use actual lions, it warns. A graphic in Kenya encourages people to stay the distance of one lion away from others And in Mexico, superhero Susana Distancia was launched by the government to encourage people to keep their distance and stay at home. Her name is a play on words that translate as ""your healthy distance"". Susana Distancia's superpower is extending her arms 1.5m to create a bubble protecting herself and others from infection Meanwhile in Egypt, a very catchy song with old footage of famous actor Adel Imam is being broadcast on television and even in the streets.

There are growing concerns over the situation in Indonesia. The country has registered around 2,500 infections and 209 deaths with a confirmed Covid-19 link. But with very low levels of testing, Indonesia's Doctor's Association warnsthe situation could be far worse than the official statistics are suggesting. The news on Monday that 24 doctors are among the dead seemed to confirm the criticism that the health system is woefully unprepared. That picture above actually shows medical staff wearing raincoats instead of proper protective gear. In Jakarta, there's now a special police unit to guard the burials of Covid-19 victims because of fears that worried residents will block funerals. In several cities, angry citizens have already tried to block ambulances from bringing victims to the local cemetery. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Canadian hospitals near the US border in Michigan are asking staff to pick a
side and stay there. Some 1,600 healthcare workers from Windsor-Essex county in Canada travel over the border each day, the county's health authorities say. Windsor Regional Hospital has asked staff members who work in nearby
Detroit to choose a side. More than half chose to remain. The hospital's CEO David Musyj told the BBC he does not want to
stop workers from working in Detroit but he is concerned it is not safe for them to work both sides of the border during the pandemic. He worries that if these steps aren't taken, officials may close the border entirely, which would ""devastate"" Detroit's supply of healthcare workers. ""Our local public health leaders can and should put into place rigid screening mechanisms and self isolation mechanisms for these individuals if and when they come home to Windsor.""

Peter HoskinsBusiness reporter, BBC News Singapore Asian stock markets made gains on Tuesday after shares rallied in the US on signs of a slowdown in coronavirus-related deaths. Wall Street investors were encouraged by the slowing death toll from the virus across major European nations, including France and Italy.

Belgians should be keeping apart the same distance as 22 bottles of Orval beer, 10 cones of chips, or three crates of beer. (Presumably those supplies are useful for self-isolation, too.) While in Kenya, one graphic explains that the length of a lion is the correct distance to keep from others. But please don't use actual lions, it warns. A graphic in Kenya encourages people to stay the distance of one lion away from others And in Mexico, superhero Susana Distancia was launched by the government to encourage people to keep their distance and stay at home. Her name is a play on words that translate as ""your healthy distance"". Susana Distancia's superpower is extending her arms 1.5m to create a bubble protecting herself and others from infection Meanwhile in Egypt, a very catchy song with old footage of famous actor Adel Imam is being broadcast on television and even in the streets. ""Don't kiss, don't shake hands, don't transmit the virus,"" it sings. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There are growing concerns over the situation in Indonesia. The country has registered around 2,500 infections and 209 deaths with a confirmed Covid-19 link. But with very low levels of testing, Indonesia's Doctor's Association warnsthe situation could be far worse than the official statistics are suggesting. The news on Monday that 24 doctors are among the dead seemed to confirm the criticism that the health system is woefully unprepared. That picture above actually shows medical staff wearing raincoats instead of proper protective gear. In Jakarta, there's now a special police unit to guard the burials of Covid-19 victims because of fears that worried residents will block funerals. In several cities, angry citizens have already tried to block ambulances from bringing victims to the local cemetery. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Canadian hospitals near the US border in Michigan are asking staff to pick a
side and stay there. Some 1,600 healthcare workers from Windsor-Essex county in Canada travel over the border each day, the county's health authorities say. Windsor Regional Hospital has asked staff members who work in nearby
Detroit to choose a side. More than half chose to remain. The hospital's CEO David Musyj told the BBC he does not want to
stop workers from working in Detroit but he is concerned it is not safe for them to work both sides of the border during the pandemic. He worries that if these steps aren't taken, officials may close the border entirely, which would ""devastate"" Detroit's supply of healthcare workers. ""Our local public health leaders can and should put into place rigid screening mechanisms and self isolation mechanisms for these individuals if and when they come home to Windsor.""  Frances MaoSydney Weâre living in a weird time. However it plays out,
thereâs no doubt this coronavirus pandemic will be remembered as a
seismic world event. Whether youâre writing down notes in a diary, or sharing pictures
of your isolation routine on social media - youâre recording history. And the National Museum of Australia wants those everyday
observations. Itâs calling on all Australians to send in their stories toan official Facebook group,external, to help document the major moment weâre all
living through. Just scrolling through some of the personal entries is illuminating â and comforting. Itâs nice to read about other peopleâs experiences, particularly as we remain physically apart from one another. It can be a tricky time for you, if you're living with someone who has the virus.

China has reported 32 new confirmed virus cases - all of which were imported - but crucially no new deaths in the past day. According to news agency AFP, this is the first time China's National Health Commission has reported no new deaths since it started publishing its figures in January. There have been 81,740 confirmed cases nationally, and more than 3,300 deaths. Peter HoskinsBusiness reporter, BBC News Singapore Asian stock markets made gains on Tuesday after shares rallied in the US on signs of a slowdown in coronavirus-related deaths. Wall Street investors were encouraged by the slowing death toll from the virus across major European nations, including France and Italy. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all gained more than 7%. Oil prices also stabilised as traders wait for a potential agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut crude production as lockdown measures hammer demand for energy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was 2.7% higher, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.8%, while China's Shanghai Composite was 1.5% higher. In early Asian trade Brent crude oil was 2.4% higher.  Late on Monday in the UK it was announced that Tony Lloyd, Labour MP for Rochdale, has been admitted to hospital with coronavirus. The 70-year-old was ""stable and responding to treatment"" at Manchester Royal Infirmary, his family said.

Waitrose staff told to make up time off for virus,"Waitrose has pledged to reverse a policy where workers self-isolating because of their family had to make up their hours owed at a later date. The company said: ""We're really sorry that we got it wrong. ""We've listened to our Partners and changed our policy. "" Worried Waitrose workers had warned the BBC that customers and staff were being put at risk during the coronavirus crisis through its time bank system, which demanded the hours be recouped. ""Partners who are self isolating without symptoms and unable to work from home will no longer be required to 'time bank' any of their time,"" the company has decided. ""Instead they will be on authorised paid absence from day one."" The firm had expected staff to recover time they took off for sick family members. Its 'time bank' system meant ""some people will continue to show up for work,"" putting people at risk, a concerned worker told the BBC. The problem affected workers who self-isolated because a family member displayed COVID-19 symptoms. The supermarket chain's previous policy was the following: ""If they are physically well enough themselves to work, then we will explore the option of working at home in the first instance."" It meant while they were paid in full during the time they took off, they were forced to pay that time back by working overtime for no extra pay when they returned to work. They had to cover the days they missed in full, up to two week's worth of hours. Before the supermarket reversed the decision a Waitrose worker - who asked to remain anonymous because of fears for their job - told the BBC: ""It means someone on a 35-hour contract would have to work an extra 70 hours if they had two weeks in isolation. ""They would be technically unpaid as the company would say they've already paid them for it."" The worker also claimed that John Lewis staff - part of the same business - were being treated differently. ""Front line Waitrose staff are being pressured to work back hours in order to protect the business, at least that's what they're telling us. ""But some John Lewis and Head office staff are being paid 100% salary to stay at home."" Meanwhile another member of staff told theSunday National newspaper,external: ""My biggest concern around this is that really vulnerable people will not self-isolate or shield, and those who need to self-isolate due to family illness will put society as a whole at risk due to these punitive measures."" The Waitrose worker who contacted the BBC said: ""The message is that time-banking is being translated as being mandatory at store level, with paid absence only for exceptional circumstances. ""But nobody has been able to discover what these circumstances are as it doesn't appear to be up for discussion."" Other supermarkets appeared to have been more generous when it comes to supporting staff during the coronavirus crisis. Marks & Spencer said: ""Any colleague who needs to self-isolate for seven to 14 days can do so on full pay. ""Colleagues who are pregnant, 70+ or with the health conditions specified by the Department of Health, are already on leave for 12 weeks on full pay."" At Asda, boss Roger Burnley said: ""We've committed to supporting our colleagues that have been identified by the government as needing to self-isolate for 12 weeks, ensuring these colleagues receive full pay for their isolation period."" The supermarket is also offering 12 weeks fully paid leave to those over the age of 70, or who are pregnant and classed as vulnerable, as well as the carers of extremely vulnerable people.

"The Open cancelled, other majors moved","Royal St George's has hosted The Open 14 times, most recently in 2011 The 149th Open Championship has been cancelled but 2020's three other men's majors have been rescheduled because of the global coronavirus pandemic. The Masters has been put back from April to November, while the US PGA Championship is slated for August. The US Open, at Winged Foot, New York, is being moved from June to September, a week before the Ryder Cup. The Open, due to take place in July at Royal St George's in Kent, will now be hosted by the venue in 2021. R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers said: ""We have explored every option for playing The Open this year but it is not going to be possible."" However, all three of the majors hosted on American soil each year are still hoping to go ahead. And the Ryder Cup - the biennial event that pitches Europe's finest golfers against their American counterparts - is being kept in its late September slot. Watch- The Masters 2019: Tiger Roars Again (Sunday 12 April, 17:00 BST, BBC2) Cancelled:The Open Championship 6-9 August:US PGA Championship, TPC Harding Park, San Francisco, California 17-20 September:US Open, Winged Foot Golf Club, New York 25-27 September:Ryder Cup, Whistling Straits, Wisconsin 12-15 November:Masters, Augusta National Golf Club, Georgia The PGA Tour's season-ending FedExCup Play-offs are scheduled to take place on four successive weekends, with the first from 13-16 August. A joint statement, issued by Augusta National Golf Club, European Tour, LPGA, PGA of America, PGA Tour, the R&A and USGA said: ""We remain very mindful of the obstacles ahead, and each organisation will continue to follow the guidance of the leading public health authorities, conducting competitions only if it is safe and responsible to do so."" In the women's game, the LPGA Tour has moved two of its five annual majors. The ANA Inspiration has been pushed back to 10-13 September at Mission Hills, California, while the US Women's Open switches to 10-13 December at Champions Golf Club in Texas. Of the three other majors, The Evian Championship in France, switched from a July date to 6-9 August, while the Women's PGA Championship in Pennsylvania (25-28 June), and Women's British Open at Royal Troon in Scotland (20-23 August) are still going ahead as scheduled. It is the first time The Open has been cancelled since the 1940-45 tournaments were not played because of World War Two. The 149th Open will now be played at Royal St George's in Sandwich from 11-18 July 2021, meaning the R&A can keep the 150th Open at St Andrews in Scotland, from 10-17 July 2022. The R&A said all tickets bought for this year's tournament will be transferred to next year's event, with full refunds for those people who are no longer able to attend. BBC Sport understands that the R&A had pandemic insurance cover, which should significantly reduce the financial losses from the cancellation. In a statement on the R&A website, Slumbers added: ""We care deeply about this historic Championship and have made this decision with a heavy heart. ""We appreciate that this will be disappointing for a great many people around the world but we have to act responsibly during this pandemic and it is the right thing to do. ""We rely on the support of the emergency services, local authorities and a range of other organisations to stage the Championship and it would be unreasonable to place any additional demands on them when they have far more urgent priorities to deal with."" This video can not be played People's health and safety come before golf - Lowry Ireland's Shane Lowry, who won last year's Open Championship at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Obviously I'm disappointed that I won't get to defend the Open Championship this year but I feel the R&A have made the right decisions based on people's health and safety. See you all in Royal St George's in 2021."" And England's Danny Willett, who won the 2016 Masters, told BBC Radio 5 Live; ""Postponement or cancellations is something that we have become accustomed to until everyone is safe and safe to do our sport. It is a shame but there are things bigger than golf at the moment."" Royal St George's has hosted The Open 14 times, most recently in 2011, when Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke won for the first time. The Open, which started in 1860, was also previously not held from 1915 to 1919 because of World War One. The only other previous cancellation came in 1871, when no trophy was available because Tom Morris Jr was allowed to keep the Challenge Belt for winning the tournament three times in a row. The Claret Jug, the prize for the champion golfer of the year, was introduced in 1872. BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter A golfing year without The Open is hard to imagine but staging the 149th championship in the current situation was always going to be a tall order. Work to erect the temporary infrastructure to house about 200,000 spectators during Open week is a massive undertaking. By delaying a year and pushing St Andrews back to 2022, the 150th Open will still be played at the venue known as the home of golf. It is a big ""if"" but if the new schedule plays out as now intended, men's golf will have a blockbuster spell between August and November. The prospect of the US Open and Ryder Cup in consecutive weeks in September will capture the imagination of golf fans everywhere. But the new schedule means that among the biggest tournaments only the PGA Championship can have a material effect on the make up of the European and American teams. Staging major international events as early as August seems optimistic, indeed the most likely of these tournaments to actually be played is a November Masters.

Boris Johnson in 'good spirits' in hospital,"The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street Boris Johnson says he is in ""good spirits"" after spending the night in hospital with coronavirus. The PM was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature and a cough - for routine tests. It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care reported 51,608 confirmed cases. The prime minister, 55, tested positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. He remains in charge of government, although Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab chaired Monday's coronavirus meeting. In a tweet,external, Mr Johnson said he was ""keeping in touch with my team as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe"". He also thanked the ""brilliant NHS staff"" taking care of him and other patients, adding: ""You are the best of Britain"". When do people go to hospital with coronavirus? The prime minister's official spokesman said he remained in hospital ""under observation"", and described Russian reports that Mr Johnson had been placed on a ventilator as ""disinformation"". He is continuing to receive updates and briefings in hospital, the spokesman added. Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work,Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. Profile: Dominic Raab Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he hoped the prime minister would be back in Downing Street ""as soon as possible"". ""He's been working extremely hard leading the government and being constantly updated. That's going to continue,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""I'm sure this is very frustrating for him, for somebody like Boris who wants to be hands [on] running the government from the front, but nonetheless he's still very much in charge of the government,"" he added.

""All Americans are praying for him. He's a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is ""a strong person"". And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he hoped the prime minister had a ""speedy recovery"". Health minister Nadine Dorries, who herself tested positive for coronavirus last month, said many of those with the virus would be ""felled"" by fatigue and a high temperature and use isolation to sleep and recover. ""Boris has risked his health and worked every day on our behalf to lead the battle against this vile virus,""she said in a tweet,external. Meanwhile, the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake said it may be ""sensible"" for Mr Johnson to ""step back"" if he is not well enough to carry out his role for now. ""I think in the end if he's not well, he will have to reflect on this because the job's tough at the best of times and it's doubly tough now,"" he told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Although Downing Street insist the PM is still in charge, if the medics insist he needs to rest and recuperate then he may well have to take a step back for a period of time. In the UK we no longer have a deputy prime minister - the last one was Nick Clegg under David Cameron. Technically, Dominic Raab - as first secretary of state - would be expected to step up. His position as foreign secretary, however, does not put him at the centre of the fight against coronavirus. It would seem likely therefore that the two figures who would be expected to take a key role would be Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Both men have been frequent representatives of the government at the daily news conferences. Fortunately, however, many of the key decisions - namely how long the lockdown should continue and what the exit strategy should be - still appear some way off. At the moment the focus is on ""flattening the curve"" and reducing the level of infections and admissions to hospital. The day-to-day decisions are therefore likely to depend much more on the advice of the scientists and officials. The really big decisions are some way off - when it is hoped the prime minister will have recovered. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital. Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March. He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning. Later that day, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms. This video can not be played Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday ""I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,"" he said. ""But we're working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus."" On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference. The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, self-isolated after showing symptoms but has now recovered and is back at work. Tony Lloyd, Labour MP for Rochdale, has also been admitted to hospital for coronavirus treatment. Sir Keir wished him a ""swift and full recovery"" on Twitter on Monday afternoon. The news of Mr Johnson's admission to hospital came shortly afterthe Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"".

Too early to consider lockdown exit strategy - Raab,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Boris Johnson ""still remains in charge of the government"" It is too early to consider a strategy for exiting the coronavirus lockdown, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab said the current measures were ""beginning to work"" - but shifting focus could mean ""we won't get through the peak as fast as we need to"". He added Boris Johnson remained in charge of the government from hospital, where the PM spent the night receiving treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The number of virus hospital deaths in the UK now stands at 5,373. The Department of Health and Social Care reported 51,608 confirmed cases. Asked during the government's daily briefing when the current social distancing measures could be lifted, the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said it must first establish when the peak of the epidemic will come. ""The key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we have reached the peak, and [that] this is now beyond the peak,"" he said. ""At that point, I think it [will be] possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do, step by step, to move to the next phase of managing this."" He added to start ""having that discussion"" before then would be a mistake.

"Boris Johnson in 'good spirits' in hospitalThe PM is undergoing ""routine tests"", as the number of coronavirus deaths in the UK reaches 5,373.UK","The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street Boris Johnson says he is in ""good spirits"" after spending the night in hospital with coronavirus. The PM was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature and a cough - for routine tests. It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care reported 51,608 confirmed cases. The prime minister, 55, tested positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. He remains in charge of government, although Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab chaired Monday's coronavirus meeting. In a tweet,external, Mr Johnson said he was ""keeping in touch with my team as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe"". He also thanked the ""brilliant NHS staff"" taking care of him and other patients, adding: ""You are the best of Britain"". When do people go to hospital with coronavirus? The prime minister's official spokesman said he remained in hospital ""under observation"", and described Russian reports that Mr Johnson had been placed on a ventilator as ""disinformation"". He is continuing to receive updates and briefings in hospital, the spokesman added. Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work,Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. Profile: Dominic Raab Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he hoped the prime minister would be back in Downing Street ""as soon as possible"". ""He's been working extremely hard leading the government and being constantly updated. That's going to continue,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""I'm sure this is very frustrating for him, for somebody like Boris who wants to be hands [on] running the government from the front, but nonetheless he's still very much in charge of the government,"" he added. This video can not be played Jenrick: PM 'still very much in charge' A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health US President Donald Trump is among those who has sent his wishes to Mr Johnson. ""All Americans are praying for him. He's a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is ""a strong person"". And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he hoped the prime minister had a ""speedy recovery"". Health minister Nadine Dorries, who herself tested positive for coronavirus last month, said many of those with the virus would be ""felled"" by fatigue and a high temperature and use isolation to sleep and recover. ""Boris has risked his health and worked every day on our behalf to lead the battle against this vile virus,""she said in a tweet,external. Meanwhile, the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake said it may be ""sensible"" for Mr Johnson to ""step back"" if he is not well enough to carry out his role for now. ""I think in the end if he's not well, he will have to reflect on this because the job's tough at the best of times and it's doubly tough now,"" he told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Although Downing Street insist the PM is still in charge, if the medics insist he needs to rest and recuperate then he may well have to take a step back for a period of time. In the UK we no longer have a deputy prime minister - the last one was Nick Clegg under David Cameron. Technically, Dominic Raab - as first secretary of state - would be expected to step up. His position as foreign secretary, however, does not put him at the centre of the fight against coronavirus. It would seem likely therefore that the two figures who would be expected to take a key role would be Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Both men have been frequent representatives of the government at the daily news conferences. Fortunately, however, many of the key decisions - namely how long the lockdown should continue and what the exit strategy should be - still appear some way off. At the moment the focus is on ""flattening the curve"" and reducing the level of infections and admissions to hospital. The day-to-day decisions are therefore likely to depend much more on the advice of the scientists and officials. The really big decisions are some way off - when it is hoped the prime minister will have recovered. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital. Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March. He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning. Later that day, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms. This video can not be played Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday ""I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,"" he said. ""But we're working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus."" On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference. The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, self-isolated after showing symptoms but has now recovered and is back at work. Tony Lloyd, Labour MP for Rochdale, has also been admitted to hospital for coronavirus treatment. Sir Keir wished him a ""swift and full recovery"" on Twitter on Monday afternoon. The news of Mr Johnson's admission to hospital came shortly afterthe Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"".

Debenhams to file for administration as virus hits,"Debenhams will file for administration after the coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut its shops across the UK. It described the process as a ""light touch"" administration to protect it from legal action from creditors while its department stores are closed. Debenhams boss Stefaan Vansteenkiste said the circumstances of the decision were ""unprecedented"". ""We have taken this step to protect our business, our employees, and other important stakeholders,"" he said. Mr Vansteenkiste said it will allow Debenhams ""to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted"". However, he did not say how many of its 142 shops would reopen after the lockdown. ""We are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible,"" he said. It will be the second time in a year that Debenhams has filed for administration. It has already closed 22 stores this year and plans to shut a further 28 in 2021. The retailer said it is still trading online ""normally"" while its shops are closed. It has furloughed the majority of its staff who are being paid under the government's coronavirus job retention scheme which pays 80% of a worker's salary up to Â£2,500 a month. Cath Kidston set to call in administrators Debenhams is set to appoint administrators ""Debenhams has been in financial difficulties for a while so this doesn't come as a major surprise,"" said Julie Palmer, regional managing partner at restructuring firm Begbies Traynor. ""But it will leave its 20,000 plus strong workforce in a precarious position who will struggle to get new employment during the ongoing uncertainty."" Last week, the BBC reportedthat Debenhams was in urgent talks with its landlords to strike new terms and conditions.  They were told that a number of restructuring scenarios were being explored which had ""varying outcomes"" for the business, landlords and Debenhams' 20,000 workers. Last April, Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders, comprising a group of banks and hedge funds led by US firm Silver Point Capital, after struggling for years to keep up with competition from rivals. Sir Philip Green controls Arcadia which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burtons The lockdown has exacerbated the pressures the struggling retail sector was already facing. Arcadia, which is controlled by Sir Philip Green, is reported to be preparing to walk away from a number of its property leases. The firm which owns several well known High Street chains including Topshop, Wallis and Miss Selfridge, has furloughed 14,500 of its 16,000 employees since the coronavirus lockdown and said its board members and senior leadership are taking pay cuts of between 25% and 50%. Arcadia is also facing uncertainty over the future of its concessions in Debenhams' stores. Meanwhile, with all non-essential shops closed, some retailers, such as Primark, have opted to cancel orders with their suppliers. Fashion chain New Look recently informed its suppliers that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centre would be delayed ""indefinitely"". Independent retail expert Clare Bailey said retailers had already been under strain for the last two or three years because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its effect on consumer confidence. ""[Coronavirus] was the final straw of all the straws that broke the camel's already very broken back,"" she said.

"The Open cancelled, other majors movedThe 149th Open Championship is cancelled but 2020's three other men's majors are rescheduled because of the global coronavirus pandemic.","Royal St George's has hosted The Open 14 times, most recently in 2011 The 149th Open Championship has been cancelled but 2020's three other men's majors have been rescheduled because of the global coronavirus pandemic. The Masters has been put back from April to November, while the US PGA Championship is slated for August. The US Open, at Winged Foot, New York, is being moved from June to September, a week before the Ryder Cup. The Open, due to take place in July at Royal St George's in Kent, will now be hosted by the venue in 2021. R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers said: ""We have explored every option for playing The Open this year but it is not going to be possible."" However, all three of the majors hosted on American soil each year are still hoping to go ahead. And the Ryder Cup - the biennial event that pitches Europe's finest golfers against their American counterparts - is being kept in its late September slot. Watch- The Masters 2019: Tiger Roars Again (Sunday 12 April, 17:00 BST, BBC2) Cancelled:The Open Championship 6-9 August:US PGA Championship, TPC Harding Park, San Francisco, California 17-20 September:US Open, Winged Foot Golf Club, New York 25-27 September:Ryder Cup, Whistling Straits, Wisconsin 12-15 November:Masters, Augusta National Golf Club, Georgia The PGA Tour's season-ending FedExCup Play-offs are scheduled to take place on four successive weekends, with the first from 13-16 August. A joint statement, issued by Augusta National Golf Club, European Tour, LPGA, PGA of America, PGA Tour, the R&A and USGA said: ""We remain very mindful of the obstacles ahead, and each organisation will continue to follow the guidance of the leading public health authorities, conducting competitions only if it is safe and responsible to do so."" In the women's game, the LPGA Tour has moved two of its five annual majors. The ANA Inspiration has been pushed back to 10-13 September at Mission Hills, California, while the US Women's Open switches to 10-13 December at Champions Golf Club in Texas. Of the three other majors, The Evian Championship in France, switched from a July date to 6-9 August, while the Women's PGA Championship in Pennsylvania (25-28 June), and Women's British Open at Royal Troon in Scotland (20-23 August) are still going ahead as scheduled. It is the first time The Open has been cancelled since the 1940-45 tournaments were not played because of World War Two. The 149th Open will now be played at Royal St George's in Sandwich from 11-18 July 2021, meaning the R&A can keep the 150th Open at St Andrews in Scotland, from 10-17 July 2022. The R&A said all tickets bought for this year's tournament will be transferred to next year's event, with full refunds for those people who are no longer able to attend. BBC Sport understands that the R&A had pandemic insurance cover, which should significantly reduce the financial losses from the cancellation. In a statement on the R&A website, Slumbers added: ""We care deeply about this historic Championship and have made this decision with a heavy heart. ""We appreciate that this will be disappointing for a great many people around the world but we have to act responsibly during this pandemic and it is the right thing to do. ""We rely on the support of the emergency services, local authorities and a range of other organisations to stage the Championship and it would be unreasonable to place any additional demands on them when they have far more urgent priorities to deal with."" This video can not be played People's health and safety come before golf - Lowry Ireland's Shane Lowry, who won last year's Open Championship at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Obviously I'm disappointed that I won't get to defend the Open Championship this year but I feel the R&A have made the right decisions based on people's health and safety. See you all in Royal St George's in 2021."" And England's Danny Willett, who won the 2016 Masters, told BBC Radio 5 Live; ""Postponement or cancellations is something that we have become accustomed to until everyone is safe and safe to do our sport. It is a shame but there are things bigger than golf at the moment."" Royal St George's has hosted The Open 14 times, most recently in 2011, when Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke won for the first time. The Open, which started in 1860, was also previously not held from 1915 to 1919 because of World War One. The only other previous cancellation came in 1871, when no trophy was available because Tom Morris Jr was allowed to keep the Challenge Belt for winning the tournament three times in a row. The Claret Jug, the prize for the champion golfer of the year, was introduced in 1872. BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter A golfing year without The Open is hard to imagine but staging the 149th championship in the current situation was always going to be a tall order. Work to erect the temporary infrastructure to house about 200,000 spectators during Open week is a massive undertaking. By delaying a year and pushing St Andrews back to 2022, the 150th Open will still be played at the venue known as the home of golf. It is a big ""if"" but if the new schedule plays out as now intended, men's golf will have a blockbuster spell between August and November. The prospect of the US Open and Ryder Cup in consecutive weeks in September will capture the imagination of golf fans everywhere. But the new schedule means that among the biggest tournaments only the PGA Championship can have a material effect on the make up of the European and American teams. Staging major international events as early as August seems optimistic, indeed the most likely of these tournaments to actually be played is a November Masters.

Georgia's wholesale flower market is closed because of the coronavirus pandemic and his flowers were doomed to wilt. But then something unexpected happened. A local artist contacted the farmer, got his account details and set up a crowdfunding campaign suggesting people donate and buy a virtual bouquet. Other social media users set up a Facebook group titled ""Tulips that wither without us"". Money started pouring into Uncle Kako's account. Over the weekend, a woman who set up the Facebook group visited the farmer to collect hundreds of tulips and deliver them to doctors treating Covid-19 patients. The bouquets arrived with a note saying: ""We are proud of you, thank you!"".

David SillitoMedia and Arts correspondent For many people the coronavirus lockdown means relying on friends, neighbours and social media.

I visited BBC Sussex to see how the radio station is making a difference. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Local radio a lifeline for listeners Rob EnglandBBC News As pressure builds on police forces to help enforce the lockdown rules across the country, it's nice to see officers still have time to put a smile on someone's face. Police and fire crews in Buxton took a brief break from patrolling towish happy birthday to a 5-year-old boy,externalwho ""wasn't able to celebrate"" because of coronavirus. Officers said: ""We wouldn't want him to miss out on some birthday fun!"" A football team isdonating all the money raised from fining players to the NHS to support staffin the fight against coronavirus. Cottenham United FC's players have been fined Â£719 this season for misdemeanours such as missing training or having too many new haircuts. The money would usually be spent on a party for the Cambridgeshire players. However, this year the team decided to give the money to a charity supporting Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. First-team manager Chris Hancock said: ""All the lads agreed the hospital can use the money much better than we can."" Withdomestic abuse calls up 25% since lockdown, according to charities, BBC presenter Victoria Derbyshire took matters into her own hands this morning by reading the news with a helpline number in full view. The presenter said she wanted to make sure those in need knew there was someone ""right now"" available to take their call. Two women a week were killed by a partner or ex before the coronavirus crisis - a fact that is shocking enough. Now some will be trapped with a violent perpetrator in self-isolation or lockdown so itâs even more vital to get the helpline number out there. People need to know there is someone right now available to take your call and help if youâre in an abusive or threatening situation. Iâd written the number on my hand to tweet a photo of it first thing alongside the new figures from Refuge, and left it on my skin in case it could help any of the millions watching after 09:00 on BBC One.'

R&A announces cancellation of The Open,"Royal St George's has hosted The Open 14 times, most recently in 2011 The 149th Open Championship has been cancelled but 2020's three other men's majors have been rescheduled because of the global coronavirus pandemic. The Masters has been put back from April to November, while the US PGA Championship is slated for August. The US Open, at Winged Foot, New York, is being moved from June to September, a week before the Ryder Cup. The Open, due to take place in July at Royal St George's in Kent, will now be hosted by the venue in 2021. R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers said: ""We have explored every option for playing The Open this year but it is not going to be possible."" However, all three of the majors hosted on American soil each year are still hoping to go ahead. And the Ryder Cup - the biennial event that pitches Europe's finest golfers against their American counterparts - is being kept in its late September slot. Watch- The Masters 2019: Tiger Roars Again (Sunday 12 April, 17:00 BST, BBC2) Cancelled:The Open Championship 6-9 August:US PGA Championship, TPC Harding Park, San Francisco, California 17-20 September:US Open, Winged Foot Golf Club, New York 25-27 September:Ryder Cup, Whistling Straits, Wisconsin 12-15 November:Masters, Augusta National Golf Club, Georgia The PGA Tour's season-ending FedExCup Play-offs are scheduled to take place on four successive weekends, with the first from 13-16 August. A joint statement, issued by Augusta National Golf Club, European Tour, LPGA, PGA of America, PGA Tour, the R&A and USGA said: ""We remain very mindful of the obstacles ahead, and each organisation will continue to follow the guidance of the leading public health authorities, conducting competitions only if it is safe and responsible to do so."" In the women's game, the LPGA Tour has moved two of its five annual majors. The ANA Inspiration has been pushed back to 10-13 September at Mission Hills, California, while the US Women's Open switches to 10-13 December at Champions Golf Club in Texas. Of the three other majors, The Evian Championship in France, switched from a July date to 6-9 August, while the Women's PGA Championship in Pennsylvania (25-28 June), and Women's British Open at Royal Troon in Scotland (20-23 August) are still going ahead as scheduled. It is the first time The Open has been cancelled since the 1940-45 tournaments were not played because of World War Two. The 149th Open will now be played at Royal St George's in Sandwich from 11-18 July 2021, meaning the R&A can keep the 150th Open at St Andrews in Scotland, from 10-17 July 2022. The R&A said all tickets bought for this year's tournament will be transferred to next year's event, with full refunds for those people who are no longer able to attend. BBC Sport understands that the R&A had pandemic insurance cover, which should significantly reduce the financial losses from the cancellation. In a statement on the R&A website, Slumbers added: ""We care deeply about this historic Championship and have made this decision with a heavy heart. ""We appreciate that this will be disappointing for a great many people around the world but we have to act responsibly during this pandemic and it is the right thing to do. ""We rely on the support of the emergency services, local authorities and a range of other organisations to stage the Championship and it would be unreasonable to place any additional demands on them when they have far more urgent priorities to deal with.""

See you all in Royal St George's in 2021."" And England's Danny Willett, who won the 2016 Masters, told BBC Radio 5 Live; ""Postponement or cancellations is something that we have become accustomed to until everyone is safe and safe to do our sport. It is a shame but there are things bigger than golf at the moment."" Royal St George's has hosted The Open 14 times, most recently in 2011, when Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke won for the first time. The Open, which started in 1860, was also previously not held from 1915 to 1919 because of World War One. The only other previous cancellation came in 1871, when no trophy was available because Tom Morris Jr was allowed to keep the Challenge Belt for winning the tournament three times in a row. The Claret Jug, the prize for the champion golfer of the year, was introduced in 1872. BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter A golfing year without The Open is hard to imagine but staging the 149th championship in the current situation was always going to be a tall order. Work to erect the temporary infrastructure to house about 200,000 spectators during Open week is a massive undertaking. By delaying a year and pushing St Andrews back to 2022, the 150th Open will still be played at the venue known as the home of golf. It is a big ""if"" but if the new schedule plays out as now intended, men's golf will have a blockbuster spell between August and November. The prospect of the US Open and Ryder Cup in consecutive weeks in September will capture the imagination of golf fans everywhere. But the new schedule means that among the biggest tournaments only the PGA Championship can have a material effect on the make up of the European and American teams. Staging major international events as early as August seems optimistic, indeed the most likely of these tournaments to actually be played is a November Masters.

Ed Miliband returns to Labour top teamThe former party leader is appointed shadow business secretary by Sir Keir Starmer.UK Politics,"Sir Keir Starmer has appointed former Labour leader Ed Miliband to his new shadow cabinet. Mr Miliband, who led the party between 2010 and 2015, will now hold the role of shadow business secretary. Sir Keir won the contest to lead the party on Saturday, after beating Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. He named Ms Nandy as his shadow foreign secretary on Sunday, and has now appointed Ms Long-Bailey as shadow education secretary. Lisa Nandy appointed shadow foreign secretary The task facing Labour's new leader Profile of the new shadow chancellor Emily Thornberry, who failed to make it onto the final ballot in the leadership contest, will now become shadow international trade secretary. Sir Keir chose his top team on Sunday, naming the party's new deputy leader, Angela Rayner, as chair of Labour, Anneliese Dodds as shadow chancellor and Nick Thomas-Symonds as shadow home secretary. Rachel Reeves took the job of shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but Jonathan Ashworth kept his post as shadow health secretary. In Monday's announcement, he confirmed the rest of his frontbench, including David Lammy as the new shadow justice secretary, John Healey as shadow defence secretary and Jonathan Reynolds as shadow work and pensions secretary. Mr Miliband, who has also served as climate and energy secretary under Gordon Brown, wrote on Twitter that he was ""looking forward to servingâ¦ alongside such a talented team"". He said everyone must ""focus on playing our part"" to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, but added: ""We cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis."" Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Beyond a handful of lesser known names staying at the top table, Sir Keir Starmer has overseen a clear-out of Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies. Fourteen people who had not already signalled their departure are leaving the shadow cabinet, with several new names to get used to. Ed Miliband is back with a brief he knows well, having served as energy secretary under Gordon Brown. Already the former leader has warned the UK will need to re-shape its economy after the coronavirus crisis, perhaps pointing towards a post-pandemic policy. Lord Falconer is another link to Labour's past in power and Blair-era minister David Lammy, an outspoken and well known face on the backbenches, takes up a key role as shadow justice secretary. Fresh faces bring Sir Keir Starmer the chance to move on from a difficult and divisive time for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. But he will also be well aware that many in the party's mass membership will not want a complete clean break. Deputy leadership candidates Ian Murray and Rosena Allin-Khan have both been given jobs in Sir Keir's new line-up - as shadow Scotland secretary and shadow minister for mental health respectively. And Louise Haigh will serve as the interim shadow Northern Ireland secretary after it was confirmed the current holder of the job, Tony Lloyd, has been hospitalised by coronavirus. Valerie Vaz will remain as shadow leader of the House of Commons, while Andy McDonald is moved from transport to take on the new role of shadow employment rights and protections secretary. Baroness Smith will stay as shadow leader of the Lords and the former Lord Chancellor in Tony Blair's government, Lord Falconer, becomes shadow Attorney General. Other appointments include: Bridget Phillipson as the new shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Luke Pollard remains as shadow environment secretary Steve Reed becomes shadow communities and local government secretary Thangam Debbonaire becomes shadow housing secretary Jim McMahon becomes shadow transport secretary Preet Kaur Gill becomes shadow international development secretary Nia Griffith moves from defence to become shadow Wales secretary Marsha de Cordova is named shadow women and equalities secretary Cat Smith stays on as shadow minister for young people and voter engagement Lord McAvoy remains as chief Lords whip The new shadow cabinet has been described by Labour as ""gender-balanced"", with 17 women and 15 men. It also has seven members from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. Announcing the appointments, Sir Keir said he was ""proud"" of his shadow cabinet, saying it ""showcases the breadth, depth and talents of the Labour Party"". He added: ""This is a new team that will be relentlessly focused on acting in the national interest to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding Labour so that it can win the next election.""

New UK car registrations plunge by more than 40%,"New car registrations for March saw a steeper fall than during the financial crisis, according to the motor industry. Data from the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show a drop of 44.4% compared with last year. March is usually one of the strongest months of the year for the car industry. But the Covid-19 outbreak has taken a heavy toll, forcing potential customers to stay at home for the past fortnight. New number plate registrations are released in March and September every year. But last month new registrations dropped by about 200,000 compared with the same period last year. They fell to the lowest level in March for more than two decades. Coronavirus: BMW, Honda and Toyota suspend UK car production Coronavirus: Nissan extends Sunderland plant production pause The crisis has come at a difficult time for the motor industry, which was already suffering with falling sales and a collapse in demand for diesel vehicles, while struggling to meet tough new emissions targets. The coronavirus outbreak has also halted car production. All of the UK's major car factories suspended work last month, and it is not yet clear when they will reopen. In total, 254,684 new cars were registered in March according to the SMMT, a fall of 203,370 compared with March 2019. Demand from private buyers and larger fleets fell by 40.4% and 47.4% respectively. At the same time, the numbers of petrol and diesel cars reaching the country's roads were down 49.9% and 61.9% respectively. However, registrations of battery electric vehicles rose almost threefold to 11,694 units, accounting for 4.6% of the market, while plug-in hybrids grew by 38%. Hybrid electric vehicles fell 7.1%. The SMMT said it now expected car sales of 1.73 million in 2020, 25% lower than last year. Larger falls in new car registrations have been reported in other European countries, with Italy down -85%, France -72% and Spain down -69% in March, the SMMT said. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said, ""With the country locked down in crisis mode for a large part of March, this decline will come as no surprise. ""Despite this being the lowest March since we moved to the bi-annual plate change system, it could have been worse, had the significant advanced orders placed for the new 20 plate not been delivered in the early part of the month. ""We should not, however, draw long-term conclusions from these figures, other than this being a stark realisation of what happens when economies grind to a halt."" Mr Hawes added that it was uncertain how long the market would remain stalled, but it would reopen and the products would be there.

"Defence firm Babcock to make 10,000 ventilatorsThe move comes as tech giant Apple says it will start making face shields for medical workers.BusinessComments","Defence firm Babcock has said it will be manufacturing 10,000 ventilators to help deal with the coronavirus crisis. The plan comes nearly two weeks afterDyson said it had received a government order for 10,000 ventilators. Both devices still have to pass stringent medical tests before they can be accepted. The move came as tech giant Apple, best-known for phones and computers, said it would start making face shields for medical workers. Apple chief executive Tim Cook tweeted on Sunday that it has designed and is now making the protective gear. The tech giant plans to make more than one million shields a week, which will be shipped first to US medical workers and then distributed globally. It has also sourced 20 million face masks which it is donating worldwide to help prevent the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The supplier, believed to be based outside the UK, has asked not to be named. A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide. A shortage of ventilators to treat coronavirus patients with acute symptoms is seen as one of the major problems facing the NHS as it battles the pandemic. Babcock's statement did not say where the ventilators would be manufactured, but it has factories in Scotland and south-west England.

Tiger at US zoo tests positive for coronavirusThe Bronx Zoo in New York says this case of human-to-animal transmission appears to be unique.US & Canada,"One of the Bronx Zoo's Malayan tigers A four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus. The tiger, named Nadia, is believed to be the first known case of an animal infected with Covid-19 in the US. The Bronx Zoo, in New York City, says the test result was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa. Nadia, along with six other big cats, is thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper. The cats started showing symptoms, including a dry cough, late last month after exposure to the employee, who has not been identified. ""This is the first time that any of us know of anywhere in the world that a person infected the animal and the animal got sick,"" Paul Calle, the chief veterinarian at the zoo, told Reuters news agency on Sunday. There have been isolated instances of pets testing positive for the coronavirus elsewhere in the world, but experts have stressed there is no evidence they can become sick or spread the disease. Mr Calle said he intends to share the findings with other zoos and institutions researching the transmission of Covid-19. Tiger King star in virus isolation, husband says Pangolins carry strains related to new coronavirus ""We tested the cat [Nadia] out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about Covid-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" the zoo said in a statement. Nadia, her sister Azul, as well as two Amur tigers and three African lions who showed symptoms, are all expected to make a full recovery, the zoo said. The big cats did have some decrease in appetite but ""are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers"", it said. The zoo said it is not known how the virus will develop in animals like tigers and lions since various species can react differently to new infections, but all the animals will be closely monitored.

"Defence firm Babcock to make 10,000 ventilators","Defence firm Babcock has said it will be manufacturing 10,000 ventilators to help deal with the coronavirus crisis. The plan comes nearly two weeks afterDyson said it had received a government order for 10,000 ventilators. Both devices still have to pass stringent medical tests before they can be accepted. The move came as tech giant Apple, best-known for phones and computers, said it would start making face shields for medical workers. Apple chief executive Tim Cook tweeted on Sunday that it has designed and is now making the protective gear. The tech giant plans to make more than one million shields a week, which will be shipped first to US medical workers and then distributed globally. It has also sourced 20 million face masks which it is donating worldwide to help prevent the spread of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, Babcock said in a statement that it had ""responded quickly to the UK Prime Minister's UK Ventilator Challenge"". ""We are proud to have been awarded a contract by the Cabinet Office to manufacture 10,000 Zephyr Plus ventilators, subject to regulatory approvals; a product being developed in collaboration with an established major international supplier of critical care ventilators,"" the firm added. The supplier, believed to be based outside the UK, has asked not to be named. A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide. A shortage of ventilators to treat coronavirus patients with acute symptoms is seen as one of the major problems facing the NHS as it battles the pandemic. Babcock's statement did not say where the ventilators would be manufactured, but it has factories in Scotland and south-west England. Companies, from electronics firms to carmakers, have been shifting production to help make vital medical equipment and supplies for hospitals around the world. Self-isolating design student makes PPE masks 3D-printer owners rally to create NHS face masks Councils appeal for protective gear for carers In a video posted on Twitter, Apple's Mr Cook said: ""This is a truly global effort, and we're working continuously and closely with governments at all levels to ensure these are donated to places of greatest need."" Apple has pulled in designers, engineers and suppliers to shape, produce and ship the face shields. Mr Cook said the first shipment of the plastic face shields, which can be assembled in less than two minutes, was delivered last week to some hospitals in Silicon Valley. The materials are sourced from both the US and China. ""In both these efforts, out focus is on unique ways Apple can help, meeting essential needs of caregivers urgently and at a scale the circumstances require,"" Mr Cook added. ""For Apple, this is a labour of love and gratitude, and we will share more of our efforts over time."" With a worldwide shortage of hospital equipment such as ventilators and protective gear for medical workers, organisations, educational institutions and individuals have been joining the effort to meet the demand. In the UK, around 1,400 3D-printer owners have pledged to use their machines to help make face masks for the NHS.

Under 25s and women 'finances hit worst by virus',"Young workers, the worst-paid and women will be most affected economically by the coronavirus, a study has found. A ""remarkable concentration"" of those groups are employed in sectors that have shut down, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) discovered. It said its research raised serious worries"" about the longer-term effect of the crisis on young people especially and inequality. Those with the lowest earnings were particularly hard hit, the IFS said. The research comes as the UK's confidence in the economy has fallen to its lowest in 12 years as the COVID-19 crisis drains consumer confidence. The last time such a decline happened was during the 2008 economic downturn. Market research firm GfK's consumer confidence gauge dropped to -34, a decline of 25 points compared to just two weeks earlier. It suggested record grocery sales were not enough to counteract the ""stark""  outlook for the retail industry. The IFS found that the virus lockdown was likely to hit younger workers the hardest, being nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to work in a shutdown area. But it also found that the virus was likely to have a bigger effect on women's earnings because of a disproportionate amount of women working in retail and hospitality, with 17% of female employees working in shutdown sectors compared with 13% of men. However, it was also found that the majority of the affected younger workers and lower earners live with parents, or other household members, whose earnings are not directly affected by the lockdown. In mitigation, ""in the short run, many will have the cushion of the incomes of parents or other household members,"" it said. IFS director Paul Johnson told the Today programme said young people aged 25 years old and under tend to work in the leisure, retail and hospitality sectors, which have been heavily impacted by the Covid-19 lockdown. Looking ahead to the future, he said there were two particular problems facing young people. ""There are those young people who are in those jobs at the moment or were in those jobs before Covid hit, and if they're not able to get back into work then there may be longer term consequences for them. ""We know that periods of unemployment when you're young can have long-term effects,"" he said. The second problem is younger people coming into the labour market after finishing school or university. Mr Johnson said they are making their entry ""in probably the most difficult time in living memory"". ""Traditionally you're going to be looking to start work in September, [but] now couldn't be a worse moment to be doing it."" GfK asked people in mid-March and at the end of March how confident they were about a number of areas such as personal finance and the general economic situation. Data showed that many are now expecting their personal and household's financial position to worsen over the next 12 months. ""Our falling confidence in our personal financial situation and the wider economy reflects the new concern for many across the UK,"" said Joe Staton, GfK's Client Strategy Director. The UK's supermarkets had their best month on record as shoppers rushed to stockpile ahead of the coronavirus lock-down. Market data provider Kantar revealed last week that overall sales were up 20.6% in March. It said that the average household spent Â£63 more than usual during this period. However, Mr Staton warned the latest data shows that consumers plan on withholding from making many unnecessary purchases during the current period of economic uncertainty. He suggested it could spell disaster for many high-street chains which are already under pressure due to the forced closure of stores. ""Despite record grocery sales, and recent peaks for purchases of freezers, TVs and home office equipment as people prepared for a long period in the home, the Major Purchase Index is down 50 points - a stark picture for some parts of the retail industry in the short to medium term,"" added Mr Staton. It was claimed this week that that 20% of small businesses could fold in April due to the collapse in consumer demand, despite unprecedented government intervention to support jobs. The Department for Work and Pensions revealed a record number of people had applied for universal credit benefits in the past fortnight as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. It said 950,000 successful applications for the payment were made between 16 March, when people were advised to work from home, and the end of the month. The department said it would normally expect around 100,000 claims in a two week period. Meanwhile, thousands of people are calling on the government to close a loophole in its plans to help workers during the coronavirus outbreak. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced help for companies to pay staff - but only those on the payroll on 28 February.

New UK car registrations drop by more than 40%,"New car registrations for March saw a steeper fall than during the financial crisis, according to the motor industry. Data from the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show a drop of 44.4% compared with last year. March is usually one of the strongest months of the year for the car industry. But the Covid-19 outbreak has taken a heavy toll, forcing potential customers to stay at home for the past fortnight. New number plate registrations are released in March and September every year. But last month new registrations dropped by about 200,000 compared with the same period last year. They fell to the lowest level in March for more than two decades. Coronavirus: BMW, Honda and Toyota suspend UK car production Coronavirus: Nissan extends Sunderland plant production pause The crisis has come at a difficult time for the motor industry, which was already suffering with falling sales and a collapse in demand for diesel vehicles, while struggling to meet tough new emissions targets. The coronavirus outbreak has also halted car production. All of the UK's major car factories suspended work last month, and it is not yet clear when they will reopen. In total, 254,684 new cars were registered in March according to the SMMT, a fall of 203,370 compared with March 2019. Demand from private buyers and larger fleets fell by 40.4% and 47.4% respectively. At the same time, the numbers of petrol and diesel cars reaching the country's roads were down 49.9% and 61.9% respectively. However, registrations of battery electric vehicles rose almost threefold to 11,694 units, accounting for 4.6% of the market, while plug-in hybrids grew by 38%. Hybrid electric vehicles fell 7.1%. The SMMT said it now expected car sales of 1.73 million in 2020, 25% lower than last year. Larger falls in new car registrations have been reported in other European countries, with Italy down -85%, France -72% and Spain down -69% in March, the SMMT said. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said, ""With the country locked down in crisis mode for a large part of March, this decline will come as no surprise. ""Despite this being the lowest March since we moved to the bi-annual plate change system, it could have been worse, had the significant advanced orders placed for the new 20 plate not been delivered in the early part of the month. ""We should not, however, draw long-term conclusions from these figures, other than this being a stark realisation of what happens when economies grind to a halt."" Mr Hawes added that it was uncertain how long the market would remain stalled, but it would reopen and the products would be there.

New car registrations may drop more than 40%,"New car registrations for March saw a steeper fall than during the financial crisis, according to the motor industry. Data from the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show a drop of 44.4% compared with last year. March is usually one of the strongest months of the year for the car industry. But the Covid-19 outbreak has taken a heavy toll, forcing potential customers to stay at home for the past fortnight. New number plate registrations are released in March and September every year.

High street pharmacists 'put at risk' from virus,"Safety screens protect a pharmacist at Boots, but others say they are being put at risk High street pharmacists are ""needlessly being put at risk"" of catching and spreading coronavirus due to a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), a professional body says. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society says that its members have not got the right equipment - masks, gloves and aprons. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that pharmacists are key health care professionals and are entitled to PPE. NHS England said millions of pieces of PPE were being delivered. The chief pharmaceutical officer Keith Ridge has said the government is making arrangements to get the equipment to pharmacists. Community pharmacists work as contractors for the NHS or for pharmacy chains like Lloyds or Boots and are the first port of call for much of the public when unwell. Pharmacists give health advice, dispense medication and check doctor's prescriptions for errors. Pharmacist Johnathan Laird, 36, who is editor of Pharmacy in Practice, said: ""Pharmacies can be very small and we have to get close to patients - it's impossible to keep a two metre distance. ""The least we expect when delivering NHS services out there is safe and effective PPE. Some pharmacies have bought plastic screens and masks out of their own pocket. That's something the NHS should be paying for."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Graham Phillips, 60, is a pharmacist who runs several pharmacies in Hertfordshire and Essex. He said ""my blood is boiling at the callous indifference NHS England has shown towards me and my colleagues. ""Community pharmacists have been abandoned on the front line. ""I have tried to source PPE at my own cost - but it has proved impossible to find adequate supplies and I am certain some of my colleagues will die as a result."" Without a ready supply of protective equipment, pharmacists fear they are likely to become unwell - and without the local pharmacy network many patients could struggle to get their prescriptions. Robbie Turner, director of pharmacy at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""The problem the message pharmacists have been getting up until now is to buy PPE from wholesalers. When they even have them in stock it's expensive. ""Pharmacies should not be having to go out and buy protection to keep them safe - this should be supplied by the NHS. Without it pharmacists are being needlessly put at risk."" NHS guidance says that pharmacists in high street stores should wear masks in store and wear gloves and aprons whilst in close contact with patients. Some pharmacists say they have been forced to ration what PPE they have - and use gloves and masks only when a patient comes in with suspected coronavirus. Naba Hussain, 29, a pharmacist in London, said: ""We are the front line - GP surgeries are shut so if anyone is ill they go to the pharmacy. ""We are unprotected and the most at risk. People could be asymptomatic or with the coronavirus symptoms."" Naba said customers often don't take the government's coronavirus guidelines seriously. ""One guy came in for advice the other day saying my partner has coronavirus, what should I do? I told him he needed to leave the pharmacy, self-isolate at home and call 111."" ""I sometimes ask myself if it's worth going into work and ask myself why I put myself at such high risk when customers aren't taking coronavirus seriously."" Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the National Pharmacy Association, said that pharmacy staff needed protective equipment ""without delay"", along with access to testing and funding to cover ""vastly increased costs"". A spokesperson for the NHS said the latest advice, endorsed by the royal colleges, is that pharmacists should rarely require protective equipment but ""it is vital that all those who need it get the right level of protection"". Millions of pieces of protective equipment have been procured and are being delivered to front line workers, the spokesperson said. ""Where there are any issues with supply, staff can raise them through a dedicated hotline, which is open 24/7.""

Boris Johnson in hospital over virus symptoms,"The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said. He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature. It is said to be a ""precautionary step"" taken on the advice of his doctor. The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning. Mr Johnson, 55, spent the night in hospital and is having what has been described as a series of ""routine tests"". In a statement, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. ""This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.""

Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished Mr Johnson well, saying he hoped for a ""speedy recovery"". The prime minister, alongside the Queen, personifies the country's public response to this pandemic. And Boris Johnson is continuing to personally experience the unpleasant reality of the virus. Downing Street officials are adamant Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government and is in contact with ministerial colleagues and civil servants. But the undeniable reality is there is nothing conventional, nothing normal about this - however routine the tests are that the prime minister is receiving. The coronavirus has repeatedly proven its capacity to turn the far-fetched into reality, over and over again. Advisers, officials and ministerial colleagues have all been forced to self-isolate. Covid-19, the illness which the virus causes, is crippling the economy, robbing us of our usual liberties - and now it is straining the personal capacity of those at the highest level of government to respond to it. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital. Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March. He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning. Also on Friday, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms. This video can not be played Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday ""I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,"" he said. ""But we're working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus."" On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she has spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference. The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms. Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if the prime minister was unwell and unable to work,Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The news of Mr Johnson's admission to hospital came shortly afterthe Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

Boris Johnson 'in charge' despite hospital admission,"The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street Boris Johnson says he is in ""good spirits"" after spending the night in hospital with coronavirus. The PM was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature and a cough - for routine tests. It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care reported 51,608 confirmed cases. The prime minister, 55, tested positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. He remains in charge of government, although Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab chaired Monday's coronavirus meeting. In a tweet,external, Mr Johnson said he was ""keeping in touch with my team as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe"". He also thanked the ""brilliant NHS staff"" taking care of him and other patients, adding: ""You are the best of Britain"". When do people go to hospital with coronavirus? The prime minister's official spokesman said he remained in hospital ""under observation"", and described Russian reports that Mr Johnson had been placed on a ventilator as ""disinformation"". He is continuing to receive updates and briefings in hospital, the spokesman added. Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work,Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. Profile: Dominic Raab Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he hoped the prime minister would be back in Downing Street ""as soon as possible"". ""He's been working extremely hard leading the government and being constantly updated. That's going to continue,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""I'm sure this is very frustrating for him, for somebody like Boris who wants to be hands [on] running the government from the front, but nonetheless he's still very much in charge of the government,"" he added.

""All Americans are praying for him. He's a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is ""a strong person"". And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he hoped the prime minister had a ""speedy recovery"". Health minister Nadine Dorries, who herself tested positive for coronavirus last month, said many of those with the virus would be ""felled"" by fatigue and a high temperature and use isolation to sleep and recover. ""Boris has risked his health and worked every day on our behalf to lead the battle against this vile virus,""she said in a tweet,external. Meanwhile, the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake said it may be ""sensible"" for Mr Johnson to ""step back"" if he is not well enough to carry out his role for now. ""I think in the end if he's not well, he will have to reflect on this because the job's tough at the best of times and it's doubly tough now,"" he told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Although Downing Street insist the PM is still in charge, if the medics insist he needs to rest and recuperate then he may well have to take a step back for a period of time. In the UK we no longer have a deputy prime minister - the last one was Nick Clegg under David Cameron. Technically, Dominic Raab - as first secretary of state - would be expected to step up. His position as foreign secretary, however, does not put him at the centre of the fight against coronavirus. It would seem likely therefore that the two figures who would be expected to take a key role would be Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Both men have been frequent representatives of the government at the daily news conferences. Fortunately, however, many of the key decisions - namely how long the lockdown should continue and what the exit strategy should be - still appear some way off. At the moment the focus is on ""flattening the curve"" and reducing the level of infections and admissions to hospital. The day-to-day decisions are therefore likely to depend much more on the advice of the scientists and officials. The really big decisions are some way off - when it is hoped the prime minister will have recovered. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital.

The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, self-isolated after showing symptoms but has now recovered and is back at work.

Tiger at US zoo tests positive for coronavirus,"One of the Bronx Zoo's Malayan tigers A four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus. The tiger, named Nadia, is believed to be the first known case of an animal infected with Covid-19 in the US. The Bronx Zoo, in New York City, says the test result was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa. Nadia, along with six other big cats, is thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper. The cats started showing symptoms, including a dry cough, late last month after exposure to the employee, who has not been identified. ""This is the first time that any of us know of anywhere in the world that a person infected the animal and the animal got sick,"" Paul Calle, the chief veterinarian at the zoo, told Reuters news agency on Sunday. There have been isolated instances of pets testing positive for the coronavirus elsewhere in the world, but experts have stressed there is no evidence they can become sick or spread the disease. Mr Calle said he intends to share the findings with other zoos and institutions researching the transmission of Covid-19. Tiger King star in virus isolation, husband says Pangolins carry strains related to new coronavirus ""We tested the cat [Nadia] out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about Covid-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" the zoo said in a statement. Nadia, her sister Azul, as well as two Amur tigers and three African lions who showed symptoms, are all expected to make a full recovery, the zoo said. The big cats did have some decrease in appetite but ""are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers"", it said. The zoo said it is not known how the virus will develop in animals like tigers and lions since various species can react differently to new infections, but all the animals will be closely monitored.

None of the zoo's other big cats are showing any signs of illness.  All the tigers showing symptoms were housed in the zoo's Tiger Mountain area. It is unclear if the others will be tested. All four zoos run by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City, including the Bronx Zoo, have been closed to the public since 16 March.  New measures will now be put in place to protect the animals and their caretakers at all the facilities. Calls to protect great apes from coronavirus Shenzhen becomes first Chinese city to ban eating cats and dogs Coronavirus: Five things you need to know This coronavirus was first detected in humans in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The coronavirus (called Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19) is thought to have originated in wildlife and been passed to humans via a live animal market in Wuhan. The pandemic has been driven by human-to-human transmission, but the infection of Nadia raises new questions about human-to-animal transmission. The new virus is part of the coronavirus family, which includes the common cold, Sars and Mers There have been less than a handful of isolated reports of companion animals testing positive for coronavirus, including two dogs in Hong Kong. There is ""no evidence that any person has been infected with Covid-19 in the US by animals, including by pet dogs or cats,"" the zoo's statement noted. That is also the view of the World Organisation for Animal Health and  the World Health Organization (WHO),which says there is no evidence that pet dogs or cats can pass on the coronavirus,external. The World Organisation for Animal Health says studies are under way to understand the issue more.,externaland urges anyone who has become sick to limit contact with pets. Dr Sarah Caddy, Veterinarian and Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, is among experts to respond to the reports. ""It is surprising that the tiger has become infected with what must have been a fairly low dose of virus - we can assume the tiger did not have continual close contact with the asymptomatic zoo keeper,"" she said about the transmission. ""It is also interesting that the tiger showed clinical signs consistent with Covid-19 in humans. Although scientific proof is lacking, the chance this is just a coincidence is low."" Conservation experts have warned that the virus could pose a threat to some wildlife like the great apes - and have said measures are needed to reduce the risk of wild gorillas, chimps and orangutans.

Queen: 'We will succeed' in fight against virus,"This video can not be played The Queen: ""We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again"" The Queen has said the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, in a rallying message to the nation. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"". She also thanked key workers, saying ""every hour"" of work ""brings us closer to a return to more normal times"". It comes as the number of people to die with the virus in the UK reached 4,934. Speaking from Windsor Castle, the Queen said: ""While we have faced challenges before, this one is different."" ""This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us. ""We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again."" The Queen, 93, also said the ""painful sense of separation from their loved ones"" that social distancing was causing for people reminded her of the experience child evacuees had during the Second World War. ""Now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do,"" she said. An hour after the Queen's broadcast, Downing Street announced thatPrime Minister Boris Johnson had been taken to hospitalfollowing his coronavirus diagnosis. Mr Johnson has been self-isolating since he tested positive for the virus on 27 March. The monarch said she was reminded of her first radio broadcast, in 1940, when she and her sister Princess Margaret spoke to child evacuees In her address, the Queen said everyone who was following guidance to stay at home was ""helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones"". ""Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,"" she added. She also stressed the value of self-discipline and resolve - and said she hopes that, in the future, everyone would ""be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge"". There have been difficult royal speeches and addresses in the past - times when the wrong word or the wrong phrase could have undermined the message or let slip a critical opportunity. The broadcast after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 for example, or the speech the Queen gave on her visit to Ireland in 2011. The Palace could have played it safe, stressed unity and given thanks. It would have served. This was a different and much more ambitious broadcast, designed to reassure and to inspire. But most of all to recast this crisis as a defining moment in a nation which will forever remember its collective effort to save the lives of its vulnerable. Read more here. The pre-recorded message, written by the Queen with her private secretary Sir Edward Young, was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment. All other technical staff were in another room. It was broadcast on TV, radio and social media channels. The Queen's broadcast in full The decision to deliver the address was made ""in close consultation with Downing Street"", BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. Rainbows drawn by children would become a ""symbol"" of the UK's ""national spirit"" in the face of the pandemic, the Queen said Nightingale Hospital  -the first temporary field hospital to open to treat coronavirus patients- shared photos on Twitter of staff listening to the speech, andthanked the monarch,externalfor recognising the hard work of frontline NHS staff. The UK government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidthe Queen's address was ""striking and important"",external. The new Labour leaderSir Keir Starmer said,externalthe monarch spoke for the whole country ""and our determination to defeat the coronavirus"". The Queen's address came less than a week after her son, thePrince of Wales, came out of self-isolation, following his coronavirus diagnosis. Prince Charles, 71, spent seven days self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive and displaying mild symptoms. It is only the fifth time the monarch has given such a speech in her 68-year reign. While her Christmas Day message is an annual event, only rarely has the Queen made rallying speeches at key moments in the life of the nation: A televised speech to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 A special address to the nation on the eve of her mother's funeral in April 2002 A live broadcast on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in September 1997 And a statement at the beginning of the land war in Iraq on 24 February 1991 Read more here.

Young 'among financially worst hit in lockdown',"Young workers, the worst-paid and women will be most affected economically by the coronavirus, a study has found. A ""remarkable concentration"" of those groups are employed in sectors that have shut down, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) discovered. It said its research raised serious worries"" about the longer-term effect of the crisis on young people especially and inequality. Those with the lowest earnings were particularly hard hit, the IFS said. The research comes as the UK's confidence in the economy has fallen to its lowest in 12 years as the COVID-19 crisis drains consumer confidence. The last time such a decline happened was during the 2008 economic downturn. Market research firm GfK's consumer confidence gauge dropped to -34, a decline of 25 points compared to just two weeks earlier. It suggested record grocery sales were not enough to counteract the ""stark""  outlook for the retail industry. The IFS found that the virus lockdown was likely to hit younger workers the hardest, being nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to work in a shutdown area. But it also found that the virus was likely to have a bigger effect on women's earnings because of a disproportionate amount of women working in retail and hospitality, with 17% of female employees working in shutdown sectors compared with 13% of men. However, it was also found that the majority of the affected younger workers and lower earners live with parents, or other household members, whose earnings are not directly affected by the lockdown. In mitigation, ""in the short run, many will have the cushion of the incomes of parents or other household members,"" it said. IFS director Paul Johnson told the Today programme said young people aged 25 years old and under tend to work in the leisure, retail and hospitality sectors, which have been heavily impacted by the Covid-19 lockdown. Looking ahead to the future, he said there were two particular problems facing young people. ""There are those young people who are in those jobs at the moment or were in those jobs before Covid hit, and if they're not able to get back into work then there may be longer term consequences for them. ""We know that periods of unemployment when you're young can have long-term effects,"" he said. The second problem is younger people coming into the labour market after finishing school or university. Mr Johnson said they are making their entry ""in probably the most difficult time in living memory"". ""Traditionally you're going to be looking to start work in September, [but] now couldn't be a worse moment to be doing it."" GfK asked people in mid-March and at the end of March how confident they were about a number of areas such as personal finance and the general economic situation. Data showed that many are now expecting their personal and household's financial position to worsen over the next 12 months. ""Our falling confidence in our personal financial situation and the wider economy reflects the new concern for many across the UK,"" said Joe Staton, GfK's Client Strategy Director. The UK's supermarkets had their best month on record as shoppers rushed to stockpile ahead of the coronavirus lock-down. Market data provider Kantar revealed last week that overall sales were up 20.6% in March. It said that the average household spent Â£63 more than usual during this period. However, Mr Staton warned the latest data shows that consumers plan on withholding from making many unnecessary purchases during the current period of economic uncertainty. He suggested it could spell disaster for many high-street chains which are already under pressure due to the forced closure of stores. ""Despite record grocery sales, and recent peaks for purchases of freezers, TVs and home office equipment as people prepared for a long period in the home, the Major Purchase Index is down 50 points - a stark picture for some parts of the retail industry in the short to medium term,"" added Mr Staton. It was claimed this week that that 20% of small businesses could fold in April due to the collapse in consumer demand, despite unprecedented government intervention to support jobs. The Department for Work and Pensions revealed a record number of people had applied for universal credit benefits in the past fortnight as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. It said 950,000 successful applications for the payment were made between 16 March, when people were advised to work from home, and the end of the month. The department said it would normally expect around 100,000 claims in a two week period. Meanwhile, thousands of people are calling on the government to close a loophole in its plans to help workers during the coronavirus outbreak. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced help for companies to pay staff - but only those on the payroll on 28 February.

PM tests positive for virus,"This video can not be played In a video on Twitter, Boris Johnson says he is self-isolating and will continue to work from home. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the past 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but would continue to lead the government. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had also tested positive while England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms. Another 181 people died with the virus in the past day,figures showed.,external It takes the total number of UK deaths to 759, with 14,543 confirmed cases. The daily coronavirus news conference was led by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, alongside deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. What we don't know about coronavirus deaths They announced plans to begin a large-scale testing programme of health service staff,starting with critical care teams. It will later be expanded to cover social care staff too. It follows mounting criticism from NHS staff over a lack of testing - currently, only seriously-ill patients in hospital are being tested. Testing will be carried out on staff showing possible symptoms of the virus or staff who live with people who have symptoms - not for all frontline workers as a matter of course. ""This will be antigen testing - testing whether people currently have the disease - so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative,"" Mr Gove said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the announcement was ""long overdue"" and the lack of testing so far had been ""incredibly frustrating"". ""For every healthy member of staff at home self-isolating needlessly when they do not have the virus, the NHS is short of someone who could be providing vital care to patients on the frontline,"" BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. Sir Simon Stevens also announced plans for two further field hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester,similar to thatbeing readied at the ExCel centre in east London. He said that 33,000 beds - the equivalent of 50 hospitals - had been freed up across England ready for coronavirus patients. This video can not be played Michael Gove announced increased testing capacity for frontline workers The government has imposed strict restrictions on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the virus. However, BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said the UK's daily death toll will still rise into the many hundreds in the coming weeks. This does not mean social distancing measures are not working - but there will be a lag of two to four weeks before we see the effects, our correspondent says. Mr Gove said scientific analysis suggested the rate of infection had been doubling every three to four days, but the ""fantastic"" public response to the restrictions would make a difference. Asked whether the prime minister and health secretary should have been ""better protected"", he said: ""The fact that the virus is no respecter of individuals, whoever they are, is one of the reasons why we do need to have strict social distancing measures so that we can reduce the rate of infection and reduce the pressure on the NHS,"" he added. Mr Johnson is thought to be the first world leader to announce they have the virus. He was last seen on Thursday night, clapping outside No 10 as part ofa nationwide gesture to thank NHS staffand carers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a video on his Twitter account, Mr Johnson, 55, said: ""I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do. ""But, be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight-back against coronavirus."" The PM chaired a phone call on Friday morning, and later in the day, Downing Street said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump. ""The president wished the prime minister a speedy recovery from coronavirus,"" a spokesman said. ""They agreed to work together closely, along with the G7, the G20, and other international partners, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic."" How the UK clapped for carers from doorsteps and balconies Mr Hancock said,externalhe was experiencing mild symptoms of the virus, and would be self-isolating until next Thursday. He told BBC Look East it was ""understandable that people will ask the question"" why he and the prime minister were tested, but most people with possible symptoms were not. The health secretary said there was a protocol laid down by the chief medical officer which required a small number of senior figures, key to the national effort, to be tested. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Earlier this week the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The prime minister's fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds, who is several months pregnant, is also self-isolating, although it is not known if they are still living together. Pregnant women in their third trimesterare advised to be particularly stringent,externalwhen following social distancing advice, and minimise social contact for up to 12 weeks. Maybe it was inevitable. One of the first moments that raised eyebrows in the course of the UK outbreak was when health minister Nadine Dorries came down with coronavirus. Then, last week, we discovered that some key staff in No 10, including the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost, were self-isolating with suspected symptoms. A fair number of MPs took themselves off into isolation for fear of having contracted the infection. Their remaining colleagues were continually ordered to sit far apart on the green benches, before finally, this week, Parliament itself closed early, with no certain date for a return of normal business. Still, the news this morning that the prime minister himself has contracted coronavirus felt like a shock. Read more from Laura Neither the PM's senior adviser Dominic Cummings nor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has symptoms. They have not been tested. A Buckingham Palace spokesman confirmed the Queen, 93, saw Mr Johnson more than two weeks ago on 11 March, and she is in good health. The pair usually meet weekly for the prime minister's audience with the Queen, but the most recent meetings have been over the phone. In other developments: Police forces in England and Wales have fined peoplefor ignoring guidance issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said he expects the number of coronavirus cases to increase over the next two to three weeks, and then start to gradually decrease due to the current lockdown. Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned Londoners there will be ""a large number"" of deathsand temporary mortuaries will be set up across the capital. The Ministry of Justice says 27 prisoners, in 14 prisons, have tested positive. Italian restaurant chain Carluccio's is facing collapse,after warning it is facing permanent branch closures due to coronavirus. The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS has reached 700,000. The government originally set a target of 250,000 but increased it to 750,000 after a huge response. More than 7,000 former nurses and midwiveshave signed up to return to the profession,external. Tesco has saidthat online shoppers will have their deliveries capped at 80 items from now on, while supermarkets will also use a government database of 1.5 million vulnerable shoppers in England to help prioritise delivery slots. The Queen's birthday parade, the Trooping the Colour, will not go ahead in its usual form, and other options are being considered. Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock were seen together and following social distancing advice at PMQs on Wednesday Other world leaders including Canada's Justin Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel have self-isolated after coming into contact with people who have tested positive for the virus. Politicians including Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott shared messages to the PM, wishing him a ""speedy recovery"". Meanwhile, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, told Mr Johnson: ""Europe wishes you a speedy recovery."" In the Irish Republic, the Taoiseach,Leo Varadkar, has announced tough new restrictions on movement. From midnight on Friday, for a two-week period until Easter Sunday, everyone must stay at home unless their work is essential or they are buying food.

Video games add 'stay at home' coronavirus adverts,"Three of the UK's leading video games developers are to display coronavirus safety advice within their titles. Candy Crush Saga, Dirt Rally 2.0 and Sniper Elite 4 are among the games that will feature the messaging. The initial ads will focus on the theme: ""Stay home. Save lives."" Rebellion - one of the companies involved - also publishes 2000AD among other comics, and has also offered space in these for the government's campaign. ""I reached out to DCMS [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] a few days ago to say is there anything we can do,"" Jason Kingsley, chief executive of Rebellion and chair of the games trade body Tiga told the BBC. ""A lot of people spend hundreds of hours in computer games. ""And in this case, we thought we could help society by reminding people of their obligations to others."" The inclusion of Codemasters' off-road racing game Dirt Rally 2.0 comes a day before it is included in Sony's latest PlayStation Plus package. This should give it a high profile over coming weeks, and ensure many thousands of subscribers see the in-game ads despite the title being more than a year old. Likewise, Activision Blizzard's London-based division, King, predicts millions of gamers will see the ads within its mobile games, which include Farm Heroes Saga in addition to Candy Crush. The firm has also donated 230 digital advertising screens it had booked, to carry coronavirus-related information. King had previously promoted other social-distancing advice in its some of its social media posts The games creators will feature the promotions in different ways. In Rebellion's case, it will display the message on a screen shown before gameplay begins within its Strange Brigade and Sniper Elite titles. It normally uses the launcher pages to promote its other wares. In the case of PC gamers, the pages will also contain a link to a website containing further advice about the virus. By contrast, Codemasters will take advantage of the fact it has built in the ability to display ads within the action itself, which it can remotely update. The tech for this is supplied by the London-based start-up Bidstack. ""We realised that technology within our games, which enables the remote updating of banners within the virtual environment, could be repurposed to assist with the coronavirus communication effort,"" Codemasters' business development chief Toby Evan-Jones explained. ""Reaching out to our contacts at the civil service was met with nothing but support."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health In the case of Dirt Rally, players will see the advice on the roadside banners they race past. Because the technology is geo-targeted, the messages will be restricted to UK-based gamers. But Codemasters says it hopes to extend the initiative to other European and American players soon with localised public safety information. ""As this is a global pandemic, we have prepared localised variants of the asset in French, Italian, German and Spanish - the predominant languages for those within our community whose authorities are advising self-isolation,"" added Mr Evan-Jones. DCMS is now inviting the UK's other 2,000-plus games companies to join the effort.

Jeff Lavington was in hospital recovering from a stroke The son of an
81-year-old man who died after contracting coronavirus in hospital has blamed
his father's death on a lack of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline
NHS staff. Jeff Lavington, from Carmarthen, caught the virus while recovering from a stroke at the town's Glangwili General Hospital. His son Mark Lavington said the staff
caring for him did an ""amazing job"", but claimed some of those
treating him were protected only by disposable gloves, disposable polythene
aprons, and surgical masks. He said: ""From talking to two members of staff on the ward, I gather that one of the members of staff had been exhibiting symptoms."" Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience for Hywel Dda University
Health Board, said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family at this
time and our door is open should they wish to discuss any matters about the
care of their loved one. ""Our staff
working in our hospitals and communities are working tremendously hard and
adjusting environments and pathways of care during these extraordinary times,
in line with expert guidance and in order to keep our patients as safe as
possible. ""Our staff
have been issued with personal protective equipment and are using this in line
with guidance and we have been testing frontline NHS staff in Wales for several
weeks."" Jeff Lavington died at Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen Farmers are being forced to dump milk because of a collapse
in the market. Llyr Griffiths, a farmer in Llangoedmor, near Cardigan, had to dump his milk after his processor, which supplies coffee shops and cruises, lost the majority of its milk sales because of the Covid-19
pandemic. He said: ""It was heartbreaking. I had to dump Â£3,000-worth of milk
in half an hour, while supermarkets apparently have empty shelves... ""Getting rid of the milk in front of my four-year-old boy was
difficult."" More than Â£3,000 worth of milk was dumped in half an hour There could be rising tensions in family homes during the coronavirus pandemic, a researcher into relationships has said. Prof Jacqui Gabb from the Open University said people typically spend two-and-a-half hours together each day, but this has rocketed to 15 or 16 hours per day since lockdown began. ""All the ingredients"" for additional stresses on relationships are there, she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Falconry Days, in Hexham, Northumberland, has cancelled all this summer's falconry displays amid the lockdown, and Mark French and his wife Mandy have had to let one part-time member of staff go. They are also concerned about finding the money to feed more than 90 birds if the shutdown continues for the months ahead. ""We don't have a rateable value on any part of the premises so can't qualify for any of the grants,"" said Mr French. ""We've got enough food to feed the birds for three months. After that we'll need to reorder, but basically we've got no income at all. ""We do need support. It's not our fault our business has closed. We need to survive."" Official data suggests testing for Covid-19 in England has been considerably slower per person than in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Across England there have been 238 people tested per 100,000, which compares to 395 per 100,000 in Northern Ireland, 351 in Scotland and 330 in Wales.

Small batch distillery Tarquin's Gin, from Padstow, switched its production from floral spirits in order to help frontline health and emergency workers to clean their hands when no soap is available. The cleaning product will be distributed to to community hospitals across the county, as well as foodbanks and Devon & Cornwall Police, the company said. Company owner Tarquin Leadbetter said the distillery had moved into making sanitiser to help the community after significant demand from the public. Mr Leadbetter said: ""My older brother is a doctor with the NHS, and Iâm so proud to be able to help in any way we can.â Patients at a children's hospital have been given hundreds of drawings of their  therapy dogs as the animals are unable to visit wards during the pandemic. Lyndsey Uglow, a therapy dog handler at Southampton Children's Hospital, came up with the idea and has delivered 1,500 drawings of the golden retrievers - Leo, Milo, Quinn, Archie, Jessie, Hattie and Pollyanna - for patients to colour in. The ""pawtraits"", by illustrator Daniel Howarth, are also part of a #goldenhugsforall social media
campaign that encourages children at home to get involved too. Joyce
Stebbings, youth and play services manager at the hospital, said the dogs were ""such an important part of life in the childrenâs hospital and not having them
around is really tough for patients and our staff"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Queen: 'We will succeed' in fight against virusIn a rare address to the nation, the monarch thanks key workers, and says ""better days will return"".","This video can not be played The Queen: ""We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again"" The Queen has said the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, in a rallying message to the nation. In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those ""coming together to help others"". She also thanked key workers, saying ""every hour"" of work ""brings us closer to a return to more normal times"". It comes as the number of people to die with the virus in the UK reached 4,934. Speaking from Windsor Castle, the Queen said: ""While we have faced challenges before, this one is different."" ""This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us. ""We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again."" The Queen, 93, also said the ""painful sense of separation from their loved ones"" that social distancing was causing for people reminded her of the experience child evacuees had during the Second World War. ""Now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do,"" she said. An hour after the Queen's broadcast, Downing Street announced thatPrime Minister Boris Johnson had been taken to hospitalfollowing his coronavirus diagnosis. Mr Johnson has been self-isolating since he tested positive for the virus on 27 March. The monarch said she was reminded of her first radio broadcast, in 1940, when she and her sister Princess Margaret spoke to child evacuees In her address, the Queen said everyone who was following guidance to stay at home was ""helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones"". ""Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,"" she added. She also stressed the value of self-discipline and resolve - and said she hopes that, in the future, everyone would ""be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge"". There have been difficult royal speeches and addresses in the past - times when the wrong word or the wrong phrase could have undermined the message or let slip a critical opportunity. The broadcast after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 for example, or the speech the Queen gave on her visit to Ireland in 2011. The Palace could have played it safe, stressed unity and given thanks. It would have served. This was a different and much more ambitious broadcast, designed to reassure and to inspire. But most of all to recast this crisis as a defining moment in a nation which will forever remember its collective effort to save the lives of its vulnerable. Read more here. The pre-recorded message, written by the Queen with her private secretary Sir Edward Young, was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment. All other technical staff were in another room. It was broadcast on TV, radio and social media channels. The Queen's broadcast in full The decision to deliver the address was made ""in close consultation with Downing Street"", BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. Rainbows drawn by children would become a ""symbol"" of the UK's ""national spirit"" in the face of the pandemic, the Queen said Nightingale Hospital  -the first temporary field hospital to open to treat coronavirus patients- shared photos on Twitter of staff listening to the speech, andthanked the monarch,externalfor recognising the hard work of frontline NHS staff. The UK government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidthe Queen's address was ""striking and important"",external. The new Labour leaderSir Keir Starmer said,externalthe monarch spoke for the whole country ""and our determination to defeat the coronavirus"". The Queen's address came less than a week after her son, thePrince of Wales, came out of self-isolation, following his coronavirus diagnosis. Prince Charles, 71, spent seven days self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive and displaying mild symptoms. It is only the fifth time the monarch has given such a speech in her 68-year reign. While her Christmas Day message is an annual event, only rarely has the Queen made rallying speeches at key moments in the life of the nation: A televised speech to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 A special address to the nation on the eve of her mother's funeral in April 2002 A live broadcast on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in September 1997 And a statement at the beginning of the land war in Iraq on 24 February 1991 Read more here.

Young to be among worst hit in lockdown says study,"Young workers, the worst-paid and women will be most affected economically by the coronavirus, a study has found. A ""remarkable concentration"" of those groups are employed in sectors that have shut down, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) discovered. It said its research raised serious worries"" about the longer-term effect of the crisis on young people especially and inequality. Those with the lowest earnings were particularly hard hit, the IFS said. The research comes as the UK's confidence in the economy has fallen to its lowest in 12 years as the COVID-19 crisis drains consumer confidence. The last time such a decline happened was during the 2008 economic downturn. Market research firm GfK's consumer confidence gauge dropped to -34, a decline of 25 points compared to just two weeks earlier. It suggested record grocery sales were not enough to counteract the ""stark""  outlook for the retail industry. The IFS found that the virus lockdown was likely to hit younger workers the hardest, being nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to work in a shutdown area. But it also found that the virus was likely to have a bigger effect on women's earnings because of a disproportionate amount of women working in retail and hospitality, with 17% of female employees working in shutdown sectors compared with 13% of men. However, it was also found that the majority of the affected younger workers and lower earners live with parents, or other household members, whose earnings are not directly affected by the lockdown. In mitigation, ""in the short run, many will have the cushion of the incomes of parents or other household members,"" it said. IFS director Paul Johnson told the Today programme said young people aged 25 years old and under tend to work in the leisure, retail and hospitality sectors, which have been heavily impacted by the Covid-19 lockdown. Looking ahead to the future, he said there were two particular problems facing young people. ""There are those young people who are in those jobs at the moment or were in those jobs before Covid hit, and if they're not able to get back into work then there may be longer term consequences for them. ""We know that periods of unemployment when you're young can have long-term effects,"" he said. The second problem is younger people coming into the labour market after finishing school or university. Mr Johnson said they are making their entry ""in probably the most difficult time in living memory"". ""Traditionally you're going to be looking to start work in September, [but] now couldn't be a worse moment to be doing it."" GfK asked people in mid-March and at the end of March how confident they were about a number of areas such as personal finance and the general economic situation. Data showed that many are now expecting their personal and household's financial position to worsen over the next 12 months. ""Our falling confidence in our personal financial situation and the wider economy reflects the new concern for many across the UK,"" said Joe Staton, GfK's Client Strategy Director. The UK's supermarkets had their best month on record as shoppers rushed to stockpile ahead of the coronavirus lock-down. Market data provider Kantar revealed last week that overall sales were up 20.6% in March. It said that the average household spent Â£63 more than usual during this period. However, Mr Staton warned the latest data shows that consumers plan on withholding from making many unnecessary purchases during the current period of economic uncertainty. He suggested it could spell disaster for many high-street chains which are already under pressure due to the forced closure of stores. ""Despite record grocery sales, and recent peaks for purchases of freezers, TVs and home office equipment as people prepared for a long period in the home, the Major Purchase Index is down 50 points - a stark picture for some parts of the retail industry in the short to medium term,"" added Mr Staton. It was claimed this week that that 20% of small businesses could fold in April due to the collapse in consumer demand, despite unprecedented government intervention to support jobs. The Department for Work and Pensions revealed a record number of people had applied for universal credit benefits in the past fortnight as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. It said 950,000 successful applications for the payment were made between 16 March, when people were advised to work from home, and the end of the month. The department said it would normally expect around 100,000 claims in a two week period. Meanwhile, thousands of people are calling on the government to close a loophole in its plans to help workers during the coronavirus outbreak. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced help for companies to pay staff - but only those on the payroll on 28 February.

Understanding the death toll Can I go for a walk in the sunshine? What powers do the police have to fight coronavirus? Mr Hancock said the government was ""not planning any changes imminently"" to social distancing policies but he ""could not rule out further steps"". ""What we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed,"" he said.

""If you're stuck in inadequate accommodation... and you're all on top of each other, quite literally, then I think people should do social distancing and should keep their distance, but also be reasonable and proportionate about that,"" she said.

PM admitted to hospital over virus symptoms,"The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said. He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature. It is said to be a ""precautionary step"" taken on the advice of his doctor. The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning. Mr Johnson, 55, spent the night in hospital and is having what has been described as a series of ""routine tests"". In a statement, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. ""This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus."" She added: ""The prime minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government's advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.""

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending ""our nation's well wishes"" for Mr Johnson's ""own personal fight with the virus"". ""All Americans are praying for him. He's a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is ""a strong person"". Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished Mr Johnson well, saying he hoped for a ""speedy recovery"". The prime minister, alongside the Queen, personifies the country's public response to this pandemic. And Boris Johnson is continuing to personally experience the unpleasant reality of the virus. Downing Street officials are adamant Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government and is in contact with ministerial colleagues and civil servants. But the undeniable reality is there is nothing conventional, nothing normal about this - however routine the tests are that the prime minister is receiving. The coronavirus has repeatedly proven its capacity to turn the far-fetched into reality, over and over again. Advisers, officials and ministerial colleagues have all been forced to self-isolate. Covid-19, the illness which the virus causes, is crippling the economy, robbing us of our usual liberties - and now it is straining the personal capacity of those at the highest level of government to respond to it. Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath. She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart's function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital. Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March. He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning. Also on Friday, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms. This video can not be played Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday ""I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,"" he said. ""But we're working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus."" On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she has spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference. The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms. Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if the prime minister was unwell and unable to work,Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The news of Mr Johnson's admission to hospital came shortly afterthe Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK ""will succeed"" in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

""Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,"" she added. She also stressed the value of self-discipline and resolve - and said she hopes that, in the future, everyone would ""be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge"". There have been difficult royal speeches and addresses in the past - times when the wrong word or the wrong phrase could have undermined the message or let slip a critical opportunity. The broadcast after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 for example, or the speech the Queen gave on her visit to Ireland in 2011. The Palace could have played it safe, stressed unity and given thanks. It would have served. This was a different and much more ambitious broadcast, designed to reassure and to inspire. But most of all to recast this crisis as a defining moment in a nation which will forever remember its collective effort to save the lives of its vulnerable. Read more here. The pre-recorded message, written by the Queen with her private secretary Sir Edward Young, was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment. All other technical staff were in another room. It was broadcast on TV, radio and social media channels. The Queen's broadcast in full The decision to deliver the address was made ""in close consultation with Downing Street"", BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said. Rainbows drawn by children would become a ""symbol"" of the UK's ""national spirit"" in the face of the pandemic, the Queen said Nightingale Hospital  -the first temporary field hospital to open to treat coronavirus patients- shared photos on Twitter of staff listening to the speech, andthanked the monarch,externalfor recognising the hard work of frontline NHS staff. The UK government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidthe Queen's address was ""striking and important"",external. The new Labour leaderSir Keir Starmer said,externalthe monarch spoke for the whole country ""and our determination to defeat the coronavirus"". The Queen's address came less than a week after her son, thePrince of Wales, came out of self-isolation, following his coronavirus diagnosis. Prince Charles, 71, spent seven days self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive and displaying mild symptoms. It is only the fifth time the monarch has given such a speech in her 68-year reign. While her Christmas Day message is an annual event, only rarely has the Queen made rallying speeches at key moments in the life of the nation: A televised speech to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 A special address to the nation on the eve of her mother's funeral in April 2002 A live broadcast on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in September 1997 And a statement at the beginning of the land war in Iraq on 24 February 1991 Read more here.

Cath Kidston set to call in administratorsThe retailer is expected to appoint advisers as the coronavirus heaps more pressure on the High Street.Business,"Cath Kidston, the floral fashion brand, is set to file for administration as the coronavirus shutdown pushes High Street retailers to breaking point. The move will put nearly 950 jobs at risk at the company which is best-known for its brightly-coloured designs. Debenhams, the department store chain, is also expected to appoint administrators as early as this week. And reports have emerged that Topshop-owner Arcadia may walk away from the leases on some of its 550 shops. Cath Kidston confirmed that it intends to appoint advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal as administrators. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Coronavirus: New Look delays supplier payments 'indefinitely' Worst year for retail in 25 years, says trade body A spokesperson said it was part of an ongoing process to explore all options for the company which was in the middle of a turnaround plan before the global Covid-19 pandemic hit. Cath Kidston employs 941 people, of which 820 have beenfurloughed under the government's employee payment scheme. After the coronavirus outbreak forced store closures, Cath Kidston has stayed open online. But most employees were furloughed on 22 March which means the government will pay 80% of an employee's wages up to Â£2,500 a month. An urgent review of the business began last month and there has been interest from possible buyers. The chain sells home furnishings, clothes and accessories in trademark floral and vintage prints. It has 60 shops in the UK and a presence in 200 globally. Founded in 1993, it was bought by Baring Private Equity Asia in 2016. It is thought a so-called pre-pack administration is now the most likely outcome for Cath Kidston. Debenhams, which employs around 20,000 staff, is also understood to be considering a pre-pack administration. Debenhams employs around 20,000 people If it goes ahead, it will bethe second time in a year that the retailer has filed for administration. It is understood Debenhams wants to protect the business against claims from creditors including suppliers who are yet to be paid. Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that Arcadia, which is owned by Sir Philip Green, is preparing to walk away from a number of its property leases. A spokesman for Arcadia said: ""No decision has been taken at this time."" Arcadia has furloughed 14,500 of its 16,000 employees since the coronavirus lockdown and said its board members and senior leadership are taking pay cuts of between 25% and 50%. Sir Philip Green controls Arcadia which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burtons Arcadia is also facing uncertainty over the future of its concessions in Debenhams' stores which include the brands Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge and Wallis. As the High Street remains in shutdown, some retailers such as Primark have opted to cancel orders with their suppliers. Fashion chain New Look recently informed its suppliers that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centre would be delayed ""indefinitely"". While the coronavirus has heaped pressure on many businesses, independent retail expert Clare Bailey said retailers had already been under strain for the last two or three years because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its effect on consumer confidence. ""[Coronavirus] was the final straw of all the straws that broke the camel's already very broken back,"" she said.
