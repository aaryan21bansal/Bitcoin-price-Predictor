The actress, who has joined the social justice organisation Ford Foundation, wants the World Trade Organization to agree a waiver on vaccine patents - so countries can manufacture their own jabs.

Kenyan family anger over UK army murder 'cover-up',"Agnes Wanjiru was 21 when she was killed and left behind a five-month-old baby The family of a Kenyan woman allegedly killed by a British soldier in 2012 have told the BBC of their anger and despair that no-one has yet been convicted of her murder. The UK defence ministry says it has been co-operating with a Kenyan inquiry into Agnes Wanjiru's death following allegations of a cover-up reportedby the Sunday Times at the weekend (subscription required),external. Her body was found in a septic tank at a hotel in central Kenya nearly three months after she had spent an evening partying with soldiers. The 21-year-old left behind a five-month old daughter, who is now being cared for by her sister Rose Wanyua in the town of Nanyuki, 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi. Ms Wanyua sobbed as she revealed how the Sunday Times report had raked up painful memories. She and her husband John Muchiri said the family had given up any hope of finding justice for Ms Wanjiru, who they knew as Ciru. Agnes Wanjiru's sister (L) was in tears as she recalled the death of her sibling ""If it was Ciru who had killed that white person, by now I wouldn't even know where she is jailed,"" Ms Wanyua said. ""But whoever killed her went free and is living his life. I am raising her child alone, no-one has asked about their well-being, not even the government."" Ms Wanjiru, who dropped out of high school and later became a sex worker to look after her baby, was last seen by witnesses on the night of 31 March 2012. She was walking out of a Nanyuki bar accompanied by two British soldiers. Her body was later discovered behind a room where the soldiers had stayed, with missing body parts and a stabbing injury. Kenyan judge Njeri Thuku concluded after an inquest in 2019 that Ms Wanjiru had been murdered by one or two British soldiers. She ordered two further criminal inquiries, but the military took no action, the Sunday Times reports. A soldier told the paper that the killer had confessed to him and he had reported it, but the army had failed to initially investigate. Kenyan detectives are also said to have asked British military police to question some of the soldiers, but the UK's defence ministry denied receiving such a request. On Tuesday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Ministry of Defence (MOD) had fully co-operated with the Kenyan investigation - and would continue to do so. The British army holds training exercises near Nanyuki Mr Muchiri said the family felt let down, but could not afford legal representation to take the matter further. ""You know, we are poor. I'm a casual labourer. We'd have loved to retain a lawyer to follow up. We can't,"" he said. For decades, locals have complained about the British army, which has a training base in Nanyuki. A lawyer who represents them told the BBC many of the issues go unaddressed. ""Even with our local police, you will just report a case, and then nothing goes beyond the investigation stage,"" Kelvin Kubai said. ""Most of the locals do not have the resources and financial capacity, to enable them pursue justice on such grounds."" The UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Jane Marriott, has expressed ""shared concern"" over Ms Wanjiru's death andreiterated her government's support for the investigation,external. The British Army Training Unit Kenya (BatUK) has also saidit is supporting the MOD's discussions with Kenyan authorities over the murder,external.

New legal duty over sewage as Lords forces issue,"The government says it will force water companies to make a ""progressive reduction"" in the sewage it dumps in rivers, amid pressure from the Lords. Peers proposed a change to the Environment Bill last week in an attempt to cut the pollution, but it did not win enough support from MPs. It led to a backlash on social media, and Lords promising to try again. But Environment Secretary George Eustice has now promised to bolster measures by making them a legal duty. He said the government already had plans in place to require water companies to act on sewage, but added: ""We've listened to the debate in Parliament [and] we will write what was already government policy into [law] to give people the reassurance they seek."" Tory MPs defend votes after uproar over sewage plan Sewage discharged into rivers 400,000 times What's in the government's new environment bill? The crossbench peer who put forward the Lords amendment, the Duke of Wellington, said he met Mr Eustice earlier on Tuesday ahead of a debate in Parliament on the Environment Bill. Speaking in the Lords, he said was ""grateful for the gesture"", but he had yet to form an opinion on the language of the government's proposal, so would be pushing ahead with his own plan to end the ""revolting practice"". The duke's amendment passed in the Lords by 213 votes to 60, and will now be debated by MPs at a later date. However, due to parliamentary rules, his amendment would have to be approved by the Lords anyway to allow the government to replace it with its own plan when the bill returns to the Commons. The environmental issue has come to a head days before the start ofthe COP26 climate summit, being hosted by the UK in Glasgow. The Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events, such as prolonged heavy rain. This protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes. But according to the public body's own figures, water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, with untreated effluent - including human waste, wet wipes and condoms - released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020. The Lords agreed an amendment to the Environment Bill that would put a legal duty on water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to ""take all reasonable steps"" to avoid using combined sewer overflows. But when the proposal was voted on by MPs last week, it lost by 265 votes to 202 - even with 22 Tories rebelling against the government to vote in favour of the plan. The government had said the amount of sewage discharged by water companies was ""not acceptable"" and that it had made it ""crystal clear"" to firms that significant reductions must be a priority. But a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the intentions of the Lords' amendment, which it said would involve an overhaul of the UK's Victorian sewerage system - would cost upwards of Â£150bn. ""That would mean that individuals - every one of us as taxpayers - paying potentially thousands of pounds each as a result,"" they added. Shortly before the issue was brought up again for debate in the Lords, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposed its own amendment for when the bill returns to the Commons. The new legal duty would be placed directly on water companies to make a ""progressive reduction"" in the sewage it dumps into rivers. It follows on from advice it gave the industry's financial regulator, Ofwat, earlier this year, saying water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows and that the regulator should ensure funding should be approved for them to do so. And the firms would need to produce ""comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans, setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon - including how storm overflows will be addressed"". A number of peers welcomed the move by the government, but some warned it still may not go far enough, with Labour's Baroness Quin saying she hoped the government would move even further now people across the country were ""waking up to the problem"". Labour's shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, also said the ""screeching u-turn"" on the issue due to the public backlash would ""do little to convince the public that the health of our rivers, rather than the health of Conservative polling, is at the forefront of ministers' minds"". He added: ""The government still has no clear plan and no grip on the issue of raw sewage being pumped into our seas and rivers.""

Sunak to announce Â£70m boost for NI businesses,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce Â£70m in funding to help small and medium sized enterprises (SME) in Northern Ireland in this week's budget. Her Majesty's Treasury said the funding will build on the British Business Bank's existing programmes to help SMEs to invest and grow. It will provide loans or invest in local companies. The way in which businesses can access the fund will be outlined in due course. Local companies that may avail of the funding include recent start-ups looking to borrow smaller amounts to kickstart activity or established SMEs looking for larger investments to grow their business. The funding will be part of a government commitment to level up opportunities. A simple guide to Budget 2021 It will build on the success of existing funds in other parts of the UK, which have been shown to support the creation of high-paying high productivity jobs and the upskilling of existing workforces, the Treasury said. On Budget day the chancellor usually holds up a traditional red box full of financial documents Describing Northern Ireland as a ""powerhouse of ingenuity"", Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK government was continuing to support small businesses across the country to grow and succeed. ""We're investing millions of pounds to help thousands of businesses take their next step,"" he said. ""Since the start of the pandemic, the UK government has spent Â£352bn right across the UK on support.

Queen will miss COP26 climate summit,"The Queen was pictured during a video call from Windsor Castle on Tuesday The Queen will not attend the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow following medical advice to rest. The 95-year-old monarch underwent preliminary medical checks in hospital last Wednesday after cancelling a visit to Northern Ireland. She resumed public engagements on Tuesday by meeting ambassadors via video link from Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace said she ""regretfully"" decided not to attend a reception at the summit. But the palace said she would deliver her address to delegates using a recorded video message instead. The Queen was due to travel to Scotland as part of a string of COP26 engagements by senior members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge between 1-5 November. The other royals will still attend the summit. In pictures: The Queen's busy October Who gives the Queen medical advice? Queen 'irritated' by climate change inaction What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all It is understood that the monarch very much wants COP26 to result in meaningful action on climate change from participating nations, and hopes her absence will not be used by others as a reason not to attend. The Queen was overheard at the opening of the Welsh Parliament earlier this month saying it was ""really irritating"" when people talk but don't act on climate issues. Sir Peter Westmacott, a former UK ambassador to the US, said the cancellation was a ""blow"" to the summit, but argued the substance of the talks should not be affected. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Queen's attendance would have been the ""icing on the cake"" but it was still a ""very important opportunity"" for Prince Charles to speak alongside other senior royals. The Queen smiled as she greeted the South Korean and Swiss ambassadors during video calls In photographs released on Tuesday, the Queen was seen smiling on camera as she greeted the South Korean and Swiss ambassadors, who were speaking to her from Buckingham Palace. She also spoke to Chancellor Rishi Sunak by phone on Tuesday evening ahead of his Budget unveiling on Wednesday afternoon. The photographed video calls were the first occasions she had been seen since she hosted an investment summit at Windsor Castle on the evening of 19 October. The following day, Buckingham Palace said the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". The Queen was pictured alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson last Tuesday evening A cancelled trip to Northern Ireland and a night in hospital last week were followed by reassurances that this would only mean a rest and recharging of the royal batteries ahead of the COP26 summit. That trip to Glasgow has now been cancelled too. It was a big moment in the royal calendar and it's a decision that would not have been taken lightly. Only on Tuesday morning the 95-year-old Queen was shown back at work and sending a signal that all was well. Her meetings on Tuesday were held on video - and a video message will be sent to the Glasgow summit - so perhaps this will be more of how we'll see the monarch in future. She will be more online, while those in-line will take up more of the public responsibilities. The Queen spent the night of 20 October in a London hospital before returning the next day to Windsor Castle, where she was said to be ""in good spirits"". She did not attend a church service at Windsor on Sunday. It has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen. An official record of her diary showed at least 16 formal events during October. She has been seen using a walking stick at recent public events, including ata Westminster Abbey serviceand when she opened thesixth term of the Senedd in Wales. In its latest statement, the palace said: ""Following advice to rest, The Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle. ""Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of COP26 on Monday, 1 November."" The statement concluded: ""Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Sunak promises new economy amid Commons anger,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: âTodayâs Budget delivers a stronger economy for British peopleâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs the Budget begins the work to prepare for a new economy post Covid, as he delivers his speech in the Commons. Spending plans for transport, health and education have been unveiled in the press. Mr Sunak is under pressure to help people with the cost of living. Sources say he will adjust the universal credit taper rate, meaning those working will be able to take home more of the money they earn. A Â£20 a week top up to the benefit was cut earlier this month, but details of any changes have yet to be announced. LIVE: Sunak set to unveil Budget Faisal Islam: Will Sunak's plans calm cost of living concerns? A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will not be responding to the Budget, as the leader of the opposition is normally expected to do, as he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out Labour's response instead. According to Downing Street, Mr Sunak told the cabinet on Wednesday morning that his Budget ""will deliver a stronger economy for the British people"" with the ""levelling-up"" agenda - spreading prosperity around the country - a ""golden thread"" running through it. The chancellor is under pressure to reveal more about the economic outlook, with government debt soaring to record peace time levels in the wake of the pandemic. And he will deliver a three-year spending review alongside his Budget. The Treasury has asked departments to find ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" - so it is clear not every area will get the same treatment. Policies already unveiled from the chancellor's Budget include: Â£6.9bn for English city regions to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects - including the Â£4.2bn promised in 2019 alongside funding for buses announced by the PM in 2020 Â£5.9bn for NHS Englandto tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans A rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April Â£2.6bn to be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds and Â£550m for adult skills in England You can read more on the announcements the government has already made here. One of the pre-announced policies is theend to a pay freeze for public sector workers- such as teachers, nurses and police officers - but ministers have so far refused to say whether it will be a real-terms rise by being higher than inflation. Pay for most frontline workforces is set by independent pay review bodies and No 10 has said it could not ""prejudge that process"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was furious about the number of spending plans that were given to the media before Mr Sunak's big speech - they are traditionally meant to be announced in Parliament so MPs can challenge and scrutinise them. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing echoed the reproof just before the Chancellor got to his feet. A No 10 spokesman said they ""recognised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny"" and they ""always listen very carefully to the Speaker"". This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. Whisper it. After the economy took an absolute hammering during the pandemic, might the chancellor tomorrow actually be in a much cheerier political mood than he could have predicted? During his Budget warm-up in the last few days, Rishi Sunak has already totted up promises of around an extra Â£20bn of spending, as well as announcing how some of the cash that was already promised is going to be carved up. Hold on for a second though. On the specifics, there is no guarantee that unfreezing the wages of 2.5 million workers in England will mean they get pay rises that aren't eroded by inflation. The same goes for increases for workers on low pay, and cuts to universal credit will pinch too. Having treated us all to cosy snaps of him and his Labrador, Nova, and him hard at work in his athleisure wear, Rishi Sunak wants to give the political impression that he's a chancellor we can all be comfortable with - careful with our money, but not afraid to spend it on things that matter, who has modern Tory instincts, but won't ditch the party's traditions. But remember Budget warm-ups are just that. However many announcements there have already been, however carefully the photographs of the prep have been thought through and selected, what matters is what he actually says at lunchtime on Wednesday. What matters are the numbers - what's in black and white - in the end. Read more from Laura here. Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""The Budget must take the pressure off working people. ""With costs growing and inflation rising, Labour would cut VAT on domestic energy bills immediately for six months. ""Unlike the Tories, we wouldn't hike taxes on working people and we'd ensure online giants pay their fair share."" Ex-Tory chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Newscast the government should not use higher wages as ""a bung"" to secure the support of low income voters. ""The instinct to send a message to business that we need to invest more capital rather than just relying on cheap labour, I think is the right instinct, I would support that,"" he said. Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, warned it was going to be a ""brutal and bitter winter for millions of householders"" who were unable to bear the costs of energy price rises. He called for the chancellor to find a way to put some of the extra tax receipts raised by the price increases back in the pockets of the most vulnerable.

The Queen's busy October,"The Queen has been told by her doctors to rest for two weeks and only undertake light duties until mid-November. Earlier this month, she spent a night in hospital for some medical investigations - her first overnight hospital stay in eight years. But that followed a particularly busy few weeks of public engagements across the UK for the 95-year-old monarch. The Queen began the month at her Balmoral Estate in Scotland, where she helped to plant a tree with the Prince of Wales. The pair were promoting their campaign urging people across the UK to plant a tree ahead of the Platinum Jubilee next year. She and Prince Charles met primary school children during the event. Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, planted a tree with his mother for the Queen's Green Canopy campaign The monarch spoke with schoolchildren from Crathie Primary at the event The following day, the Queen was more than 100 miles away in Edinburgh forthe opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament. It was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. During her speech, she spoke of her deep affection for Scotland. A few days later, the Queen held audiences with diplomats from Belize and Greece over video call. The same day, she met members of the Canadian Army at Windsor Castle at an event to mark the 150th anniversary of the A and B batteries of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. She later had a telephone call with Boris Johnson. The Queen presented the Captain General's Sword to representatives of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery The Queen then travelled to Londonto attend the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relayat Buckingham Palace. It was her first major event at Buckingham Palace since the Covid pandemic began and she was joined by her youngest son, Prince Edward. The Queen placed a message in the baton, which will travel through 72 Commonwealth nations and territories ahead of the Games in 2022 A few days later she attended a church service at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion. Accompanied by the Princess Royal, she was seen using a walking stick as she arrived via the Poet's Yard entrance. The Westminster Abbey service was thought to be the first time the Queen had used a stick at a major public event The Queen welcomed pianist Dame Imogen Cooper to Buckingham Palace, presenting her with The Queen's Medal for Music for 2019. She also held three other audiences. The Queen's Medal for Music is awarded each year and 2019's went to English classical pianist Imogen Cooper The following day, the Queen travelled to Cardiff toopen the sixth term of the Senedd. It was her first visit to Wales in five years, and she praised the spirit of the Welsh people during the pandemic. While there,she was overheard appearing to sayshe was irritated by people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"" anything on climate change. A 21-gun salute in Cardiff Bay marked the Queen's arrival in the city By Saturday she was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire. The Queen has a lifelong love of horseracing The Queen held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand Dame Cindy Kiro. The governor-general's role is to act as the Queen's representative in New Zealand. On Tuesday she had two virtual audiences during the day with the Japanese ambassador and the EU ambassador. Then in the evening she was back at Windsor Castle hosting a reception for guests attending the Global Investment Summit, including billionaire business leaders like Microsoft's Bill Gates.

What is COP26?,"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"Wage rises will put 30p on a pint, says pub chain","The price of a pint of beer will have to rise by as much as 30p to help pay for higher wages and energy costs, one pub company has warned. As the government prepares to unveil its Budget, City Pub Group said price rises were ""the only way forward"". On Monday, the government saidthe National Living Wage would riseto Â£9.50 per hour in April for those over 23 years old. Clive Watson, the chain's boss, said this would cost it about Â£1m a year. Other pub owners echoed Mr Watson's warning, with industry bodies calling for help for the sector. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that while increases to the minimum wage and the minimum living rate would be ""welcomed"" by many staff in pubs, it was a further cost increase for pubs who were ""still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future"". ""It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,"" she added. Wetherspoons, however, has announced it will cut drink prices next month on a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Becks bottles and whisky measures will be sold for 99p at some branches. Wetherspoons said prices will be reduced at all of its almost 900 pubs but the discounts will vary. In October, JD Wetherspoon reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. The firm was also recently affected by a shortage of some beer brands, caused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's latest Budget, to be delivered later, comes as the pub trade is still recovering from lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. City Pub Group weathered the financial storm thanks to government assistance, putting 99% of its staff on furlough during the pandemic. ""That's basically kept the industry on life support, but we're coming off life support now and we need to be able to have a road to recovery,"" Mr Watson told the BBC. Last month, the group, which owns 45 pubs, reported that sales had been above 90% of pre-pandemic levels since Covid restrictions were eased in May. But now it faces further challenges - not just minimum wage rises, but also higher energy and food costs, as well as employers' national insurance contributions going up next April. The price of beer ""would probably have to go up by 25 to 30p a pint"" to take account of all that, Mr Watson said. ""We want to do our bit - it's very important, but at the same time we don't want everything going up the whole time, because all that will do is stoke inflation,"" he added. UK inflation isexpected to rise above 4%by the end of this year. Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 Premier Inn owner warns of staff shortages No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget Inflation likely to hit 5%, warns Bank economist While Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a ""good idea"", he warned that those increases could be ""gobbled up by other inflationary pressures"". He said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. The hospitality industry currently benefits froma reduced VAT rate of 12.5%,external, but that is due to revert to 20% in April. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be ""unsustainable"" and mean that businesses would have ""no option"" but to pass the cost on to customers. ""We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,"" she added. Martin Greenhow said wage increases would cost his business thousands Costs 'inevitably' passed on. Martin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were ""certainly putting pressure"" on the business. ""If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,"" he said. All of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage. ""The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,"" he explained. Mr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would ""inevitably be passed on to the consumer"". ""Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver."" The Cock in Ringmer is one of Ian Ridley's pubs Ian Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. ""Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,"" he explained. Although he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p. ""When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,"" he told the BBC. The wage increases will mean an estimated Â£20,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. Rising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another ""huge worry"".

Escape plans needed to avoid next Grenfell - union,"Firefighters, pictured at a Grenfell anniversary event, say building owners must plan for evacuations There was an ""unjustified reliance"" on firefighters to evacuate Grenfell Tower on the night of the fatal fire, a union has told the inquiry into the disaster. The Fire Brigades Union said building owners and managers should draw up evacuation plans to prevent future catastrophes. Union lawyer Martin Seaward said there was a ""near total failure"" of fire safety measures at Grenfell Tower. The June 2017 disaster at the west London tower block killed 72 people. The comments came on the final day of closing statements in a section of the inquiry focusing on the fire safety measures in the building, its management, risk assessment and the communication with residents. Mr Seaward criticised the approach to fire safety taken by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO). He told the inquiry on Tuesday the ""hazardous rainscreen cladding system"" should have been identified as a risk and removed by April 2016. ""Additionally, the near total failure of all the active and passive fire safety measures allowed the rapid deterioration of conditions inside the tower, which grossly impeded the firefighters' operations, including search and rescue,"" Mr Seaward said. The fire in Grenfell Tower broke out in June 2017, killing 72 people Mr Seaward added if the fire risk management system from the tenant management organisation had worked ""most, if not all"" of the people who died would have been saved. The lawyer argued to the inquiry the safety plans were characterised by an ""unjustified reliance"" on the London Fire Brigade to evacuate residents, ""including those especially at risk in the event of fire in Grenfell tower"". Mr Seaward said: ""Of course, the fire and rescue service will attend and do its best at any fire or other emergency, but fire safety depends on everyone doing their bit. ""That very much includes responsible persons developing and practising building-specific evacuation plans for residents, including personal emergency evacuation plans for those especially at risk, in the same way that employers do in office blocks or factories."" Anne Studd QC, representing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, told the inquiry the tenant management organisation did ""very little"" to see if Grenfell was suitable for the stay put strategy in its fire assessments and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council (RBKC) had limited oversight of them. ""The evidence before you, Mr Chairman, has demonstrated a culture of failings in transparency and candour by the KCTMO, which, coupled with a lack of intrusion from RBKC, was a toxic combination,"" she said. James Maxwell-Scott QC, representing the council, told the inquiry it ""apologised unreservedly"" again for council failings before the disaster. The failings included the number of council officers devoted to monitoring the KCTMO being ""insufficient"" and its housing commissioning team not making enough use of the corporate health and safety team's expertise to ""prevent issues falling between the gaps,"" he said. The lawyer added the KCTMO was an independent, managing agent of Grenfell Tower which was at an ""arm's length"" from the council, which was the building's landlord. ""The council fully admits that it retained some control over the tower, and therefore continued to have some responsibilities for it under the Fire Safety Order. But those responsibilities are better described as residual ones than shared primary ones,"" he told the inquiry.

Overnight protest held at museum over sponsors,"This vigil was staged outside the Science Museum Climate activists who slept overnight in London's Science Museum will approach the attraction's visitors to tell them about its sponsorship deals. A new gallery funded by a subsidiary of the Adani Group, a multinational business involved in coal extraction, is due to open in 2023. About 30 members of the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) camped out in the lobby as a protest on behalf of ""victims"" of fossil fuel companies. No arrests have been made. The museum has also faced criticism for partnering with Shell to fund its Our Future Planet exhibition Demonstrator Izzy Warren, 17, said the group, which includes school pupils, university students and scientists, chose to occupy the museum because the owners had ignored their petitions, letters and boycotts. ""We would really like to greet people who come to the museum this morning so they are aware of what they are supporting, and what they are paying for. ""The Science Museum is blatantly taking money from some of the worst perpetrators of the climate crisis."" The demonstration comes after the Science Museum last week announced a new gallery, called Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery. The demonstration comes after the Science Museum last week announced a new gallery, called Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery Adani Green Energy is a solar power developer based in India and is a subsidiary of the Adani Group, which through another arm of its business is also involved in extracting coal. A spokesperson for the renewables company said: ""An environment where every child can grow up breathing pollution-free air - that is the environment we dream to create and have to a certain extent managed to enrich lives with our renewable energy plants. ""Adani Green Energy is pioneering in helping transition to renewable power generation. We develop, build, own, operate and maintain utility scale grid connected solar and wind projects."" Biologist Dr Alexander Penson, who took part in the sit-in, said it was ""appalling"" the museum was persisting in fossil fuel sponsorship and starting a new relationship with Adani. The activists said they negotiated with museum staff to be moved from the second floor of the building to the Energy Hall near the main entrance so that they would have access to toilets for the whole night. London's Science Museum The Science Museum is a major museum on Exhibition Road in South Kensington Founded in 1857, it is one of the city's major tourist attractions, attracting 3.3 million visitors every year It is free to enter, although special exhibitions may incur a fee The museum has also faced criticism for partnering with Shell to fund its Our Future Planet exhibition, which is about carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions to the climate crisis. The agreement with the fossil fuel giant included a gagging clause, committing the museum not to say anything that could damage Shell's reputation. The students have staged the protest against sponsorship by fossil fuel companies The Science Museum has consistently defended its stance on working with fossil fuel partners. Chief executive Ian Blatchford said trustees ""are not convinced by the argument from some who say we should sever all ties with organisations that are 'tainted' by association, direct or indirect, with fossil fuels. ""We believe the right approach is to engage, debate and challenge companies, governments and individuals to do more to make the global economy less carbon intensive. ""Adani Green Energy is an example of an energy sector business bringing expertise and investment to renewables at the scale needed to deliver meaningful change."" A Met Police spokesperson said: ""Officers attended and engaged with the protesters and museum staff. ""The protesters stated their intention was to remain in the museum overnight. This was agreed to by museum staff. ""No further police action was required."" Science Museum begins Covid-19 collection.

UN emissions report a 'thundering wake-up call',"Current plans to cut carbon emissions don't work quickly enough, says the UN National plans to cut carbon fall far short of what's needed to avert dangerous climate change, according to the UN Environment Programme. TheirEmissions Gap report,externalsays country pledges will fail to keep the global temperature under 1.5C this century. The Unep analysis suggests the world is on course to warm around 2.7C with hugely destructive impacts. But there is hope that, if long term net-zero goals are met, temperatures can be significantly reined in. Attenborough in 'act now' warning over climate Make people fly less, climate change advisers say Australia's 2050 net zero pledge draws criticism Just a few days beforeCOP26opens in Glasgow, another scientific report on climate change is ""another thundering wake-up call"", according to the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. Street art in Glasgow where COP26 begins in a few days time This week, we've already had a study from the WMO showing thatwarming gases were at a new high last year, despite the pandemic. Now in its 12th year, this Emissions Gap report looks at the nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) or carbon-cutting plans that countries have submitted to the UN ahead of COP. These pledges run up to 2030 and have been submitted by 120 countries. Unep has also taken account of other commitments to cut warming gases not yet formally submitted in an NDC. The report finds that when added together, the plans cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by around 7.5% compared to the previous pledges made five years ago. This is nowhere near enough to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within sight, say the scientists who compiled the study. To keep 1.5C alive would require 55% cuts by the same 2030 date. That means the current plans would need to have seven times the level of ambition to remain under that limit. ""To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of Unep. ""The clock is ticking loudly."" According to the authors, the current pledges would see the world warm by 2.7C this century, a scenario that Antonio Guterres calls a ""climate catastrophe"". He believes the report highlights the failures of political leaders. ""The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap,"" he said at the launch of the study. ""But leaders can still make this a turning point to a greener future instead of a tipping point to climate catastrophe."" As Mr Guterres suggests, there are some hopeful signs in the report. Fires in California are continuing to burn, made worse by a changing climate Around 50 countries plus the EU have pledged a net zero target for the middle of this century. These strategies cover over half of greenhouse gas emissions. The Unep analysis finds that if these plans were implemented fully, this could shave 0.5C off the temperature rise by 2100. This would bring the global temperature level down to 2.2C, which would see dramatic and deadly impacts from warming but would be a step in the right direction from where the world is currently headed. The problem, though, is that many of these net zero goals are ambiguous, say the authors - particularly among the world's 20 richest nations, where a dozen long-term plans are said to be quite vague. Many delay significant cuts until after 2030, raising serious doubts about whether they can really deliver net zero just 20 years later. Six easy ways  to be environmentally friendly How to talk to your child about climate change Another hopeful sign relates to methane. The report also says there is great potential to make progress on these emissions, which are the second largest source of warming. Up to 20% of these emissions from fossil fuels, from waste and from agriculture could be curbed at low or no cost. Boats on a lake where the water level has fallen significantly due to drought However, the opportunity to develop a far greener world as the world recovers from Covid is in danger of being lost, say the authors. They find that around 20% of recovery investments will support renewables and the green economy. ""The huge sums spent to recover economies from Covid-19 are a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost low-carbon technologies and industries. In most cases, this opportunity is not being taken,"" said Brian O'Callaghan, project manager of the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project, and an author on the Unep report. ""This is a particular slap in the face for vulnerable nations who are suffering the worst consequences of climate changeâ¦we remain without a commitment from the highest emitters to cover the loss and damage that they have brought on the world.""

"'Airbnb host increased my COP26 booking by $2,000'","Tan Copsey had booked his accommodation well in advance of the summit An Airbnb host has been banned from taking bookings during COP26 after he hiked the cost of a lodging by $2,000. Tan Copsey had booked the two-bedroom flat in Glasgow's west end well in advance of the summit only to receive an email with the inflated price. The host said he was concerned he had ""missed out on a great deal of money"" after seeing the average room price increase by ""400%"" in the area. Mr Copsey said: ""I had already paid. We already had an agreement."" Airbnb said it had ""zero tolerance"" for this kind of behaviour. Originally reported inThe Herald,external, Mr Copsey posted about his experience on social media, joking he was having a ""great time"" with COP26 accommodation. Cruise ship arrives on River Clyde to accommodate summit goers 'Why I am giving up my home to climate activists' Mr Copsey, who will be visiting his 10th UN climate summit, told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetimeprogramme he made the booking about three months ago. But a few weeks ago he received a ""really interesting"" message from the host. Mr Copsey, who works for a US non-profit organisation, said: ""The message essentially said: 'I am pretty disappointed that you booked early because I have missed out on a whole lot of money. Prices in our area have gone up 400% and so I would like to charge you more. Specifically, in your currency, $2,000 more."" He had originally booked a two-week stay at the property for Â£2,175 ($3,000). Mr Copsey said: ""The thing that bothered me about it was that I had already paid. We already had an agreement."" He cancelled his booking and has since arranged alternative accommodation for COP26, which starts at the Scottish Event Campus on Sunday. Thousands of delegates and hundreds of world leaders will descend on Glasgow for the climate summit Mr Copsey said his main concern now was the situation facing delegates who did not have the same resources. ""The bigger thing that is happening is that all these people from around the world are coming to Glasgow and they are coming to do something that is really important and really good,"" he said. ""And I don't think it is right that they are priced out because they are on government salaries. They work for small non-profits in Africa or the Pacific Islands, and they are already paying a huge amount of money to get to Glasgow because of the pandemic and because of travel being disrupted."" Despite his experience, Mr Copsey, whose area of specialism is the reduction of methane emissions, said he did not have any vindictive thoughts against the host or a negative opinion of Scottish people. And he said he hopes the many ""incredibly kind"" offers of accommodation he has received can now be used to help others who are less fortunate. An Airbnb spokesperson said: ""We have zero tolerance for this behaviour and have taken action against the host and blocked them from accepting other bookings during this period. ""The guest has been refunded in full and we have offered support in helping them find alternative accommodation."" Earlier this month BBC Scotland found evidence that a squeeze on available accommodation hadsent prices soaring in Glasgow. One room in the city initially advertised as Â£42 per night was later advertised at Â£1,400 per night during the summit. Fiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was ""a huge concern"" for activists hoping to attend. And restaurateur and property owner Charan Gill called the practice ""opportunistic"". He said: ""You will not live off this money forever - fine, you might make an extra few hundred or thousand pounds here and there. ""At the end of the day you have to go back to your normal people, your normal market, your normal tenants who keep your bread buttered."" Airbnb told the BBC they would donate all revenue from stays in Glasgow during the summit to Zero Waste Scotland. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Greta Thunberg to march at Glasgow climate protest,"Greta Thunberg will join the climate march from Glasgow's Kelvingrove Park on Friday 5 November Greta Thunberg has invited Glasgow workers who plan on striking during COP26 to join her on a protest march. The Swedish activist confirmed she would come to the city during the UN summit to take part in a climate strike on Friday 5 November. Railway staff, council cleaners and refuse workers have said theywould take industrial actionduring COP26. Ms Thunberg wrote on Twitter: ""Climate justice also means social justice and that we leave no one behind."" She added: ""So we invite everyone, especially the workers striking in Glasgow, to join us. See you there."" Greta: 'We need public pressure, not just summits' Strikes and disruption during COP26 climate summit The Climate Strike has been organised by Fridays for Future Scotland, which was founded by young people inspired by Ms Thunberg's activism. The protest march will go from Kelvingrove Park in the west end of Glasgow to George Square in the city centre. ScotRail strikes could begin on 1 November after the RMT Union rejected a pay offer Ms Thunberg's comments came as unions representing rail and council workers confirmed their plans for strikes during the summit. Council cleaners, janitors, refuse and recycling workers across Scotland could take industrial action from 8 November. A joint trade union group, including Unison, Unite and the GMB, is seeking a Â£2,000 flat rate pay increase or 6%, whichever is greater, from Scotland's local authority umbrella body Cosla. ScotRail could also be hit by strikes from 1 November after the RMT Union rejected the latest pay offer. The union described the offer of a 2.5% increase this year, 2,2% in 2022 and a one-off Â£300 bonus for staff working during the summit as ""pitiful"". This video can not be played Watch: Greta Thunberg says she's 'completely different' in private Three other rail unions, Unite, Aslef and the TSSA have already accepted the offer. The Scottish government has said it will focus on ""making alternative plans for rail operations during Cop26"" if a pay offer is not accepted by Wednesday. About 120 world leaders are expected to attend the United Nations summit from 31 October to 12 November. Greta Thunberg told the BBC this week that summits will not lead to action on climate goals unless the public demand change too.

Minister 'not optimistic' of avoiding rail strike,"The Scottish government is making contingency plans to try to keep services running Scotland's transport minister has said he is ""not optimistic"" a rail strike during COP26 will be avoided. Graeme Dey accused the RMT union of moving the goalposts during negotiations aimed at avoiding industrial action by ScotRail staff. He said contingency plans were being made to keep the trains running but warned of extensive disruption. ScotRail and the government has set an arbitrary deadline of 17:00 on Wednesday for the offer to be accepted. Three other unions representing rail workers -  Unite, Aslef and TSSA - have accepted a pay deal which is worth 4.7% over two years and includes a Â£300 bonus for working during the summit. Council and rail unions step closer to COP26 strikes Sturgeon: Credible action needed on climate crisis The Scottish government has said the offer remains on the table but the union has described the deadline as like ""having a gun pointed at our head"". ScotRail said it was necessary to allow contingency plans, which will see suitably-trained supervisors and managers replace striking staff, to be finalised. The operator said its focus would be on connecting Glasgow and Edinburgh and on providing key routes through Glasgow but it would not be drawn on the frequency of services or their period of operation. Transport minister Graeme Dey warned that strikes would cause extensive disruption Asked onBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmeif he thought a strike would be avoided, the transport minister said ""the signs are not optimistic"". He added: ""The RMT along with the other trade unions were made an offer several weeks ago and it took them two weeks to come back to ScotRail and give us a formal decision on whether or not they were accepting it. ""In the subsequent period we've tried to reach an agreement and time and time again the goalposts have been moved. ""This is not about a gun being held to anybody's head. We are less than a week away from COP and we need to know where we stand."" Mr Dey said there were contingency plans to keep some train services running during the UN climate change summit. ""Considerable amount of effort has gone in to deliver the best possible train service that we can in the circumstances. I'm not going to mislead the public and suggest it will rival the current level of service,"" he said. ""There will be disruption. It won't just affect COP26 - it will affect the wider travelling public. It will be extensive - there is no doubt about that but we are working flat out to try and ensure that as many trains as possible are running."" Analysis by Andrew Picken ""Decimated"" is the word used by ScotRail officials when describing service levels if the planned industrial action goes ahead. RMT members in ScotRail are mainly conductors and ticket examiners and, unlike in other countries, without them the majority of train services in Scotland do not operate. This would include the flagship express route between Edinburgh and Glasgow as well as ScotRail's InterCity services. Contingency planning for the strike is under way, but it is likely the level of service would not even match the limited offering there has been on Sundays since March where separate strike action has been taking place. If there is no resolution by Wednesday's deadline, ScotRail will spend the rest of the week training workers from other parts of its business to take on some of the duties, such as staffing ticket barriers. Three other trade unions which represent ScotRail staff, including train driver union Aslef, have accepted the pay rise on offer and this increase has been put in place for them and non-unionised ScotRail workers. RMT regional organiser in Scotland Mick Hogg said the transport minister's comments were ""nonsense"" and claimed the union had been ""stonewalled"" for months. He said while there had been movement over a separate issue of rest day working, there had been no progress on pay and proposed efficiency savings. ""What that means is there are going to be booking office closures, job losses and station closures - and a denial for the most vulnerable people in society to get access to Scotland's trains,"" he said. Mr Hogg later told the BBC the RMT was pressing for a one-year pay deal of about 4.9% which was not linked to efficiency savings. The current offer is for 2.5% this year and 2.2% in 2022. ScotRail operations director David Simpson defended the current offer, especially as passenger numbers have plummeted due to Covid. He told BBC Scotland: ""It reflects very clearly the financial position the industry is in post pandemic."" Mr Simpson added that he could not understand why Mr Hogg had not put the deal to his members. On the impact of a strike as the eyes of the world are on Glasgow, he said: ""I think everybody wants to make sure COP is successful and rail is to play its part in that but we can't just throw money at that without consequences. There is a very strong offer on the table."" As the deadline looms, he added: ""We hope the strike can be resolved but on the basis of the RMT's current position it is very wise and prudent to be making these contingency plans in case it goes ahead."" COP26 runs from Sunday 31 October to Friday 12 November, with 120 world leaders and more than 30,000 visitors are expected in Glasgow. Glasgow is expecting more than 30,000 visitors during COP26 The RMT is threatening strike action from 1 November, for the duration of the summit. A separate dispute could see thousands of council workers across Scotland including refuse, recycling, maintenance and school catering and janitorial stafftaking strike action during the second week of the climate talks. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish ministers should have acted earlier to resolve the disputes. ""These unions are exploiting COP26 to their advantage and I think that's absolutely wrong,"" he said. ""But fundamentally the Scottish government have been found wanting, they've stood on the sidelines, done nothing about this until the last minute which is why there's potential for absolute chaos because the SNP Scottish government and Glasgow City Council haven't dealt with these issues soon enough."" Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said setting a deadline for the RMT to accept the offer was not the way to resolve the rail dispute. ""The derisory offer, that I think is of 2.2% - less than what inflation is currently running at - is a pay cut in real terms for people who kept the railways running during Covid,"" he said. He said the dispute with council workers was an example of cuts ""coming home to roost"" after a decade of underinvestment in council services. The Scottish Liberal Democrats said the transport minister should resign if the dispute was not resolved by the start of the ""most important climate summit of all time"". Transport spokeswoman Jill Reilly said: ""If the trains don't run smoothly and on time for the duration of COP26, then Graeme Dey should resign. ""The eyes of the world will soon be on Scotland. Ministers need to stop grandstanding and hammer out a deal that gets the trains running.""

Covid rates in Wales hit new record high,"The Covid pass scheme could be widened, as ministers consider how to combat infection rates in Wales Covid rates in Wales have hit another new record high, according to health officials. Figures published on Tuesday showed a rate of 719.9 cases for every 100,000 people over the last seven days. The number of Covid cases in Wales remains the highest infection rate of all the UK nations. But one of the heads of Public Health Wales said he felt the levels of infection were beginning to slow. ""We are looking at fairly high rates compared to other times in the pandemic response,"" accepted Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, who is the national director of health protection at PHW. ""But I feel that we are plateauing."" He said the daily number of cases in Wales stood between 2,500 and 3,000 new infections. Dr Khaw said all the models looking at the latest wave of Covid suggested it would begin to fall in the near future, despite the current high levels. ""I am confident that over the coming weeks we will start seeing a drop,"" he told BBC Wales. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales It follows a warning that some people arebehaving as if the Covid pandemic is over - ignoring Wales' face mask laws and not social distancing. School-age students are showing the highest levels of Covid, says PHW The latest number of positive cases reported by Public Health Wales (PHW) was 5,228 between Friday morning and Monday morning. A further 31 deaths with Covid-19 have also been recorded, with 6,117 people dying with the virus since the start of the pandemic in Wales, according to PHW figures. The health body said due to a technical issue reporting figures on Tuesday, not all cases of Covid reported in Wales in the last 72 hours had been flagged as new, and it was likely there had been about 8,000 actual new cases over the period. Dr Khaw said the highest levels of Covid transmission were being seen among young adults and children in Wales. He also said the rate of hospital admissions from Covid was increasing, and was being carefully monitored to ensure it was not down to new variants of the disease. But he stressed there was ""no evidence"" that a new ""variant of concern"" was in circulation in Wales at the moment. The highest infection rate is in Blaenau Gwent, at just under 1,330 cases per 100,000 over the last seven days. Neighbouring counties in the Aneurin Bevan health board area also share high levels of Covid, with both Torfaen and Caerphilly nudging over the 1,000 infection rate. Wrexham has Wales' lowest rate, at 368.5 cases per 100,000 people. Covid passes were introduced across Wales at the start of October for nightclubs and large events First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was ""right to be concerned"" about the current Covid rates. ""There is far too much coronavirus circulating in the community"", he said. The Welsh government will announce its latest response to the pandemic on Friday, as part of a three-week review. But ministers have said they were not considering moving into ""Covid Urgent"" - where social and business restrictions could be reintroduced. However, Mr Drakeford added that if numbers continued to rise ""we would all have to be asking ourselves serious questions about what we would need to do to bring numbers of that sort back under control"". Health Minister Eluned Morgan has already indicated they will considerwhether the Covid Pass schemeintroduced at the start of October should be widened.

"Christmas turkey shortage likely, farmers warn","Britain's turkey farmers will do their best to ensure Christmas ""is as normal as it can be"" but shortages are likely, an industry representative has warned. The government has assured consumers that turkeys will be available for the festive season. Ministers are pinning their hopes on overseas workers brought in on temporary visas to ""save Christmas"". But Graeme Dear, from the British Poultry Council, told MPs the scheme had come too late. ""We have been given access through the seasonal workers scheme for up to 5,500 [employees] but that finishes on 31 December,"" he said. ""We would have loved to have known about that in June, and therefore could have placed enough turkeys for a full Christmas."" What's in short supply and why? Labour shortage human disaster for pig farms - NFU The shortages hitting countries around the world He added that farmers ""will do our utmost to make sure Christmas is as normal as it can be,"" but told MPs: ""There is a likelihood there will be a shortage"". He said his industry was facing a 16% reduction in its workforce. Earlier this month, Conservative Party chairmanOliver Dowden told Sky News,external: ""We will make sure that people have their turkeys for Christmas. ""I know that for the Environment Secretary George Eustice, this is absolutely top of his list."" This video can not be played The NFU's Tom Bradshaw says it is âcompletely inexcusableâ and the government must act âurgentlyâ to stop a repeat next year. Other farming industry representatives blamed shortages on Brexit and Covid, and urged the government to ease restrictions on immigration, in evidence to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. Tom Bradshaw, of the National Farmers' Union, said labour shortages were ""our number one challenge"". He cited daffodil farms, which he said were down a third on their usual staff numbers, leading to nearly a quarter of their crop going to waste. And he added that courgettes, apples and autumn raspberries had not been picked, in addition to""the tragic cull in the pig sector"". ""Many businesses are mothballing their facilities... I've never seen the industry in this position and the real lack of confidence is crippling the sector,"" he added. His comments were echoed by Derek Jarman, from the British Protected Ornamentals Association, who said the flowers and plants industry were facing a 25% reduction in labour next year. The pig industry is suffering severe staff shortages ""That will mean crops un-harvested - the market is there but not the labour to produce them,"" he said. ""We're all frightened, we're all in great fear, we don't know what to do, I've never seen it like this in my entire life, never."" Conservative MP Sheryll Murray asked the witnesses what was the dominant reason for the shortages. Mr Jarman blamed Brexit for workers leaving the UK, telling the committee: ""We as a nation said 'we don't want you'."" Charlie Dewhirst, a policy adviser for the National Pig Association said the coronavirus pandemic had been ""an accelerator of so many issues"". ""It is almost 50:50,"" said Mr Dear arguing that a lot of EU citizens left in ""the run up"" to Brexit but the pandemic ""encouraged"" others to ""go home"". Asked if labour shortages could be filled by the UK population, Mr Bradshaw noted that unemployment is ""very low"". He said the industry had been told the end of the furlough scheme, introduced during the pandemic, would result in high unemployment and that ""we would recruit from that pool"". ""It's now not happened so where is the pool of labour,"" he asked, The government has said firms should pay higher wages to attract staff. Asked about labour shortages in farming earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC the industry could not ""simply go back to the tired, failed, old model, reach for the lever called 'uncontrolled immigration' get people in, low wages"". In October, the governmentannounced a number of measuresto ease pressure on the pig industry including extending its seasonal workers scheme to pork butchers. The Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme allows farmers to recruit overseas on a quota basis - but Mr Bradshaw said the numbers should be expanded and extended to other areas such as the ornamental sector.

Areas with most higher-risk coal tips revealed,"A landslide at a tip in Tylorstown prompted new work to identify Wales' disused coal tips Rhondda Cynon Taf has the largest number of higher-risk coal tips in Wales, with 75 posing a potential safety threat, new figures show. A council-by-council breakdown of where Wales' 327 higher-risk tips are located has been published, including 71 now revealed to be in the worst category. There are calls from opposition parties for precise locations to be disclosed. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government was not hiding anything. Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) council, said the tips were regularly monitored and checked for movement, but long-term investment was needed. ""Clearly, if climate change is going to see more heavy rain in short periods of time, we want to make sure and give assurance to residents that the tips are stable,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. As well as RCT, Merthyr Tydfil and Caerphilly have large numbers of high-risk tips. The former coal villages turning green The images Aberfan survivors can never forget Why Wales is prone to landslides The information was published ahead of a coal tip safety summit on Tuesday between Welsh and UK ministers. Category A tips are either ""minor"" or have already been restored, while category B ones are unlikely to cause a risk due to their size or location. Category C and D tips pose a higher potential safety risk, but the Welsh government stressed it did not mean they posed an imminent or immediate threat, but that more frequent inspections were scheduled. It also renewed calls for the Conservatives in London to fund work to repurpose, reclaim and remediate disused coal tips, which it thinks will cost Â£500m to Â£600m over the next 15 years. But the UK government said the Welsh government was ""more than adequately funded"". Climate change has raised concern that extreme weather could increase the risk of tips becoming unstable. Alandslide at Tylorstownin RCT following Storm Dennis prompted new work to identify all disused coal tips in Wales. The study, conducted by the Welsh government with the UK government's Coal Authority and others, identified 2,456. While 1,155 and 678 are in category A and B groups respectively, 256 are in category C and 71 are in category D. This video can not be played Heavy rain caused ""multiple"" floods and landslides, according to South Wales Police Rhondda Cynon Taf has the highest number of high-risk tips, with 23 category D and 52 category C. It is followed by Merthyr Tydfil with 14 in category D and 45 in category C, then Caerphilly, which has seven in D and 44 in C. Neath Port Talbot has the highest number of disused tips of any authority, but only has 12 category D and 27 category C. Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Newport and Vale of Glamorgan have no recorded disused coal tips. Many tips are in private ownership and the Welsh government said the figures were subject to change. It also plans to introduce a new management regime and law which would have a new categorisation system. The collapse of a coal tip at Aberfan took 144 lives in 1966, including 116 children The Welsh government said it was the first time it had published a breakdown by council area, but opposition parties have previously called for more detail of their locations. Under current plans the Welsh government hopes to publish the details in the first half of next year. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales that his government will publish precise locations ""as soon as we are confident that it is in proper order, ready to be shared"". ""70% of coal tips in Wales are privately owned. There's quite a complex piece of work to be done to make sure we've got all the proper details in good order,"" he said. Philip Thomas, from Ynyshir, lives less than 100m from a coal tip and runs social media accounts calling for action to clean up the sites across south Wales. He said while the figures were not a surprise, it was ""shocking that there are so many higher risk tips out there"". He added: ""What goes through my mind is if they're teaching children that Aberfan is a terrible disaster, and we should never forget, why have we forgotten? ""Why has it taken Tylorstown for us to realise that these tips have been there?"" Welsh Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders said it was ""vital Labour ministers provide more detail on the locations of these sites and urgently announce an action plan to put local communities' worries at ease"". ""However, all we have seen so far is Labour ministers blaming others. They've had ample opportunities to protect people and communities by making these coal tips safe, but as ever, they've chosen not to act, instead they've opted to pass responsibility."" Plaid Cymru's Heledd Fychan urged both the UK and Welsh governments to work together so that Aberfan is never repeated. She said: ""People living in the communities most at risk should also be told the status of the coal tips nearby, so that they can help authorities by urgently reporting any changes they may see."" 60,000 tonnes of spoil collapsed in a landslide at Tylorstown last year Mr Drakeford said winter inspections were under way for higher-risk tips. ""We recognise how concerning living in the shadow of a coal tip can be for communities and we want to reassure local residents that a lot of work is being done to ensure they are safe. ""Our funding settlement does not recognise the substantial, long-term costs of remediating and repairing these sites.""

Funding plan paves way for Sizewell C nuclear site,"Sizewell C (lighter grey on the right) would be built next to Sizewell B Funding rules paving the way for a new major nuclear power station have been announced by the Business and Energy Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The move is the latest stage in efforts to build the Â£20bn Sizewell C project in Suffolk. The proposed plant is still subject to planning approval, but until now, the Treasury has been uncertain of how to pay for it. Even if the project is approved, it still faces strong local objections. The government said the new financing model could help cut the cost of new nuclear power projects in Britain, saving consumers more than Â£30bn on each new large-scale station. The proposals include electricity customers paying for part of nuclear schemes' costs upfront through bills. The new model, known as RAB (Regulated Asset Base), has already been used to finance some large infrastructure projects, including the Â£4.2bn Thames Tideway ""super-sewer"". It allows investors to receive returns before the projects have been completed. Sizewell C pledges Â£250m to mitigate its impact Plans for Sizewell C are outdated, says scientist Government in talks to fund Â£20bn nuclear plant The Treasury was initially reluctant to use the RAB model. Not only does it add money to consumer bills over the lifetime of the project, but it also leaves consumers vulnerable to cost overruns, which have plagued previous nuclear developments. However, contractor EDF Energy has been adamant that lessons learned on previous projects - and the fact that it is building an identical plant at Hinkley Point - have largely mitigated those risks, says BBC business editor Simon Jack. Mr Kwarteng said the new funding model was a better way to finance such projects. ""The existing financing scheme led to too many overseas nuclear developers walking away from projects, setting Britain back years,"" he said. ""We urgently need a new approach to attract British funds and other private investors to back new large-scale nuclear power stations in the UK."" Employers' organisation the CBI said the new financing model was ""a crucial step in building a secure, affordable and greener energy system in the years ahead"". ""Getting new projects off the ground will be a huge boost to supply chains and can deliver jobs right across the UK,"" said Tom Thackray, director of the CBI's decarbonisation programme. The Nuclear Industry Association said it would add a small levy to bills of no more than a few pounds during the early phase of construction and less than Â£1 a month over the course of a project. It ""warmly welcomed"" the plan, adding it would also bring substantial savings in terms of CO2 emissions worth Â£526m a year at today's carbon prices, or Â£18 per year for every UK household. But the high cost of big nuclear plants and the plummeting cost of renewables such as offshore wind make the project controversial. However, the enormous amount of low-carbon non-intermittent electricity that it produces is considered by the government to be an essential part of the UK's future energy mix as existing nuclear plants are phased out. The recent intermittency of wind power has also made the case in ministers' minds for an ""always on"" part of the energy supply, our business editor adds. Together, Hinkley and Sizewell C are expected to produce 14% of the UK's current electricity needs, but they are unlikely to be operational until the late 2030s. The new funding plan has been greeted with dismay by campaigners against the proposed plant. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C described it as ""a desperate measure to attract investment"" for ""a project so toxic that no one wants to pay for it"". She added: ""Compared to other energy solutions, Sizewell C is an expensive distraction - too damaging, too slow for our climate emergency and with serious question marks over its reactor technology.""

In pictures: The Queen's busy October,"The Queen has been told by her doctors to rest for two weeks and only undertake light duties until mid-November. Earlier this month, she spent a night in hospital for some medical investigations - her first overnight hospital stay in eight years. But that followed a particularly busy few weeks of public engagements across the UK for the 95-year-old monarch. The Queen began the month at her Balmoral Estate in Scotland, where she helped to plant a tree with the Prince of Wales. The pair were promoting their campaign urging people across the UK to plant a tree ahead of the Platinum Jubilee next year. She and Prince Charles met primary school children during the event. Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, planted a tree with his mother for the Queen's Green Canopy campaign The monarch spoke with schoolchildren from Crathie Primary at the event The following day, the Queen was more than 100 miles away in Edinburgh forthe opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament. It was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. During her speech, she spoke of her deep affection for Scotland. A few days later, the Queen held audiences with diplomats from Belize and Greece over video call. The same day, she met members of the Canadian Army at Windsor Castle at an event to mark the 150th anniversary of the A and B batteries of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. She later had a telephone call with Boris Johnson. The Queen presented the Captain General's Sword to representatives of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery The Queen then travelled to Londonto attend the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relayat Buckingham Palace. It was her first major event at Buckingham Palace since the Covid pandemic began and she was joined by her youngest son, Prince Edward. The Queen placed a message in the baton, which will travel through 72 Commonwealth nations and territories ahead of the Games in 2022 A few days later she attended a church service at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion. Accompanied by the Princess Royal, she was seen using a walking stick as she arrived via the Poet's Yard entrance. The Westminster Abbey service was thought to be the first time the Queen had used a stick at a major public event The Queen welcomed pianist Dame Imogen Cooper to Buckingham Palace, presenting her with The Queen's Medal for Music for 2019. She also held three other audiences. The Queen's Medal for Music is awarded each year and 2019's went to English classical pianist Imogen Cooper The following day, the Queen travelled to Cardiff toopen the sixth term of the Senedd. It was her first visit to Wales in five years, and she praised the spirit of the Welsh people during the pandemic. While there,she was overheard appearing to sayshe was irritated by people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"" anything on climate change. A 21-gun salute in Cardiff Bay marked the Queen's arrival in the city By Saturday she was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire. The Queen has a lifelong love of horseracing The Queen held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand Dame Cindy Kiro. The governor-general's role is to act as the Queen's representative in New Zealand. On Tuesday she had two virtual audiences during the day with the Japanese ambassador and the EU ambassador. Then in the evening she was back at Windsor Castle hosting a reception for guests attending the Global Investment Summit, including billionaire business leaders like Microsoft's Bill Gates. The Queen was joined by the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge at the reception Royal Family tree Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Queen declines Oldie of the Year award Queen back at Windsor after hospital stay Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Queen declines Oldie of the Year award Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Watchdog recommends 30-day suspension for Tory MP,"This video can not be played Conservative MP Owen Paterson: ""I stuck within the rules."" Ex-minister Owen Paterson could be suspended from the Commons for 30 days after an MPs' watchdog found he had ""repeatedly"" used his position as an MP to benefit two companies who paid him as a consultant. The watchdog described his actions as ""an egregious case of paid advocacy"". In reply, the Conservative MP said: ""The process I have been subjected to does not comply with natural justice."" ""I am not guilty and a fair process would exonerate me,"" he added. Mr Paterson said the process was ""a major contributory factor"" in the death of his wife, Rose, who took her own life last year. The committee said the allegations related to events which took place before Mrs Paterson's death. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone opened an investigation into the North Shropshire MP following accusations he had lobbied on behalf of two companies who employed him. Her report said he was a paid consultant to Randox and Lynn's Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards Agency and Department for International Development ministers about the companies. Family's 'anguish' after Rose Paterson death MPs agree to new conduct rules after bullying report MPs to get new standards commissioner The commissioner also found Mr Paterson had breached the MPs' code of conduct by using his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for meetings relating to his outside business interests between October 2016 and February 2020 - and in sending two letters relating to business interests on House of Commons headed notepaper. The report noted,externalthat there was no immediate financial benefit secured by the two companies, but that Mr Paterson's approaches could ""clearly have conferred significant benefits on Randox and Lynn's in the long term and even in the short term secured meetings that would not have been available without Mr Paterson's involvement"". The Standards Committee recommended that Mr Paterson, who is a former Northern Ireland Secretary, be suspended from Parliament for 30 sitting days, which will now be debated. If an MP is suspended for more than 10 sitting days by a parliamentary committee, this can automatically trigger a recall petition - something which could lead to a by-election in their seat. Mr Paterson has strongly denied any wrongdoing. Speaking to the BBC, the former environment secretary said he was ""absolutely stunned"" by the report's recommendations. He said he had wanted to alert the environment department about carcinogenic products in milk and ham, defending his actions as ""absolutely right"" and arguing that it had ""saved lives"". ""If it happened again this morning, I would do it again,"" he added. The MP accused the commissioner and the committee of not talking to him until months into the investigation and failing to hear from his 17 witnesses. He claims he was pronounced guilty by the commissioner ""without being spoken to"" and that ""no proper investigation was undertaken"". The BBC has been told the committee interviewed Mr Paterson and reviewed all the witness statements he provided, while the commissioner offered Mr Paterson an interview but he didn't proceed with it. A spokesperson for Randox said it was aware of the report, adding: ""Randox does not wish, or need, to comment on this investigation.  This is a matter for Mr Paterson and the relevant parliamentary authorities."" A spokesperson for Lynn's Country Foods said the company would not be making a statement. In Mr Paterson's response to the committee report he said: ""I lost my beloved wife of 40 years and this process was a major contributory factor."" He said the way the investigation was conducted ""undoubtedly played a major role"", saying: ""Rose would ask me despairingly every weekend about the progress of the inquiry, convinced that the investigation would go to any lengths to somehow find me in the wrong."" Mr Paterson told the BBC the investigation had ""destroyed the last quarter of my life"" and that his wife had been ""very rattled"" by the inquiry. This video can not be played Owen Paterson says his family has been left in ""anguish and misery"" after his wife took her own life In the report, the committee said it was ""painfully conscious that Mr Paterson lost his wife in tragic circumstances in June 2020"". ""We wish to express our deepest sympathy to him for his loss - this last year must have been very distressing for him and we have taken these circumstances fully into account in considering Mr Paterson's conduct during the period of the investigation."" However, the committee said the allegations related to conduct prior to Mrs Paterson's death and that ""it is these allegations on which we are required to adjudicate, impartially, without fear or favour, and with a sole eye to the rules of the House and the requirements of natural justice"". It added that it was ""very possible that grief and distress caused by this event has affected the way in which Mr Paterson approached the Commissioner's investigation thereafter"". The committee also noted other mitigating factors including Mr Paterson's ill health. The committee said Mr Paterson's ""evident passion for and expertise"" in food and farming was ""admirable"" but warned it should be ""channelled within the rules of the House"". Listing ""aggravating factors"" that influenced the recommended punishment for Mr Paterson, it said: ""No previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests."" It added that ""Mr Paterson's financial remuneration from Randox and Lynn's amounted to nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary"" and that during the investigation Mr Paterson had ""made serious, personal, and unsubstantiated allegations against the integrity of the commissioner and her team"".

UK research hit by Brexit talks,"UK scientists are likely to be ""frozen out"" of EU research programmes because of delays in Brexit negotiations, according to MPs. Earlier this month, the EU indicated that the UK's participation in its Â£100bn research programme was tied to negotiations over Northern Ireland. The Commons European Scrutiny Select Committee says British science will not recover from ""lost opportunities"". Its chair, Sir Bill Cash, said that the delay was damaging UK businesses. ""It's been the best part of a year and British research institutions remain frozen out of key projects and funding despite agreement on participation. With each passing day, the opportunities are missed, British institutions are left high and dry while science marches on without them and the returns on our financial contribution edge lower,"" said Mr Cash. ""This needs to be addressed swiftly, so we're calling on the government to lay out the steps it is taking to ensure UK participation is formalised."" The EU's Horizon Europe programme brings together researchers from industry and academic research institutions. The projects range from fundamental research to tackling societal issues, such as combating climate change. The UK's continued participation in the EU's Horizon programme was agreed in principle just before Christmas in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. But the signing off of a formal agreement on the UK's associate membership has dragged on for months. Boris Johnson wants UK scientists to have the closest possible relationship with EU researchers There have been growing fears that scientific collaboration had become a bargaining chip tied to negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market after Brexit. Earlier this month, the EU's research commissioner, Mariya Gabriel, seemed to confirm these suspicions when she told the R&D policy news website sciencebusiness.net: ""transversal issues need to be tackled first"". The delay is creating problems, because funding cannot be released to UK collaborators until there is a formal agreement. If it becomes apparent that agreement will take many more months, EU researchers will not include UK scientists in their projects. Prof James Wilsdon, who is the director of the Research on Research Institute at the University of Sheffield, points to estimates that uncertainties arising from Brexit have already led to the UK research to missing out on Â£1.5bn of research funding since 2016. ""This number is rising fast, as Horizon Europe, the world's largest and most successful co-funding scheme, gets into full swing, and the UK is stuck outside. ""Unless this is resolved soon, the fear must be that the UK drops out, or is locked out, by default rather than design, as the rest of Europe marches on without us. This would be a tragedy for both sides, and would leave the UK's ambitions to be a scientific superpower in tatters."" The EU's Earth mapping effort, Copernicus, is similarly affected by the delay. This affects UK aerospace companies wanting to bid for contracts to manufacture equipment for Copernicus because the contracts are dished out as a proportion of the contribution from member states. Because of the impasse, British firms can't contribute and so, according to the Select Committee report, will be ""frozen out"". MPs on the Committee said that the delay raised concerns about value for money of participation in EU programmes. The UK's contribution to the Horizon Europe programme is expected to be about Â£2.1bn a year. The President of the UK's Royal Society, Prof Sir Adrian Smith, called for negotiators to stop treating the issue of research funding as a bargaining chip. ""Last Christmas, all sides agreed that the UK would associate to Horizon Europe,"" he said. ""Nearly a year on, the association agreement is still not signed, having become entangled in other issues. Vital research that benefits all nations will be delayed unless all sides look at Horizon Europe on its own merits and get the deal signed.""

Queen back to public duties after hospital stay,"The Queen has carried out her first engagements since staying overnight in hospital last week, meeting two ambassadors via video call. The monarch, who is at Windsor Castle, met virtually with the South Korean and Swiss ambassadors in Buckingham Palace. The audiences come after she went to hospital for preliminary medical checks last Wednesday. The Queen, 95, is expected to lead a royal delegation to the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit next week. She was seen smiling on camera as she greeted South Korea's Gunn Kim and HeeJung Lee, as well as Switzerland's Markus Leitner and Nicole Leitner. The ambassador for the Republic of Korea, Gunn Kim, accompanied by HeeJung Lee at Buckingham Palace Who gives the Queen medical advice? Queen 'irritated' by climate change inaction In pictures: The Queen's busy October The engagements are the first time the Queen has been seen since she hosted a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle last Tuesday evening. However, on Wednesday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said a planned trip to Northern Ireland had been cancelled, and the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". Then, in a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said she had stayed in hospital on Wednesday night after attending for ""some preliminary investigations"" and had returned the following day to Windsor Castle, where she was ""in good spirits"". This was a diplomatic engagement by the Queen in every sense. She was taking part in a virtual audience with two ambassadors - but the real message was that after last week's hospital stay she was back at work. It might have been one of the most upmarket work video meetings ever held, from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace, with backdrops of antique furniture and oil paintings. But it was sending a very modern media signal that any health worries were not going to stop the 95-year-old monarch from returning to her job. It was a photo intended to reassure. The Queen might be WFC (working from castle) but she's showing no signs of slowing down. The Queen stayed in King Edward VII's, a private hospital used by senior royals - including her husband, the late Duke of Edinburgh, who received treatment there earlier this year. She did not attend a church service at Windsor on Sunday. The Queen was pictured alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson last Tuesday evening The Queen is looked after by her physician Sir Huw Thomas,who is ""head of the medical household"". It has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen. An official record of her diary showed at least 16 formal events during October. She has been seen using a walking stick at recent public events, including ata Westminster Abbey serviceandwhen she opened the sixth term of the Senedd in Wales. The Royal Family's website says the Queen is due to attend a reception on 1 November as part of the climate change conference in Glasgow. She is due to attend engagements there between 1 and 5 November alongside the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Youth clubs still waiting for 2019 government cash,"Youth clubs say they're still waiting to receive Â£500m promised by the government two years ago. Ministers have admitted to the BBC that the Youth Investment Fund hasn't launched yet. Local authority funding for youth services in England and Wales have been cut by 70% to Â£978m, according to recent research. The government says helping charities through Covid has been its priority. James Francis is a professional boxer helping at Vibe UK in Knowsley, Liverpool City, which is one of the most deprived in the UK. It's among the clubs the BBC has spoken to that are relying on help from the Youth Investment Fund to keep going. ""If the youth club does get shut down, looking at the people that do come here, they'll be devastated,"" James says. Vibe UK, like many others, offers things like care, support, social events and help with education. ""Our funding tends to come from the local authority, who are under a lot of pressure themselves,"" says Paul Oginsky, who's CEO of the youth service. ""It also comes from the community or the police. ""We're scrambling around to find enough money to survive, and that isn't how it should be because we are an essential service. ""We are waiting for money from the youth investment fund. It's been promised, but it hasn't been delivered."" Service cuts may expose rural youth to county lines Youth clubs fear for children 'lost to the streets' Young people 'saw record job losses' this summer The Youth Investment Fund was announced in 2019 by then-Chancellor Sajid Javid. It was pledged to help build 60 new youth centres across the country, refurbish 360 existing youth facilities, and provide more than 100 mobile facilities, as well as support the provision and co-ordination of services for young people. There have been reports the scheme was supposed to launch in April 2020, but the government hasn't confirmed this. In a statement the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: ""During the pandemic our priority has been to stabilise youth charities and we have done so by distributing Â£15.6m through the Youth Covid Support Fund. ""This has helped to secure their future and is part of our wider support for young people that includes the Â£200m Youth Endowment Fund.

"Make people fly less, ministers told","The government has been blamed for failing to reduce demand for flying and meat-eating as part of its plans to rein in climate change. The Climate Change Committee advisory body says ministers also have not shown how to achieve their ambition of cutting the demand for road travel. It warns a âtechno-centricâ approach to cutting emissions adopted by the prime minister has a high risk of failure. But areport from the committee,externalpraised the government's Net Zero Strategy. A government spokeswoman welcomed the CCCâs generally positive response to the Net Zero Strategy and said it would meet all its climate change goals. Boris Johnson has regularly promised that climate change can be tackled without what he calls âhairshirteryâ. Many experts agree technology is needed but say behaviour must change too. They judge that the demand for high-carbon activities must be cut for the UK to meet climate targets in the 2030s. The report from the CCC - an independent body advising the UK and devolved governments on emissions targets - comes ahead ofthe COP26 climate summit which will be held in Glasgow from Sunday. What does net zero mean? Obstacles to UK government's net zero plans It says: ""There is less emphasis on reducing demand for high carbon activities than in the CCC's scenarios. ""The government does not include an explicit ambition on diet change, or reductions in the growth of aviation, and policies for managing travel demand have not been developed to match the funding that has been committed."" The committee added: ""These remain valuable options with major co-benefits and can help manage delivery risks around a techno-centric approach. They must be explored further with a view to early action."" Nick Eyre, Professor of Energy and Climate Policy at the University of Oxford, went even further. With reference to the PM's ""hairshirtery"" jibe, he told a COP26 media briefing: ""The PM's headline about not changing the way we use energy is not just helpful - it's unrealistic. ""We won't reach climate goals unless there's a combination of technology and behaviour change."" The governmentâs over-arching Net Zero climate plansunveiled last weekshowed how almost every sector of the economy should virtually eliminate planet-heating carbon emissions by 2050. But on the eve of the Budget the committee warns that the Treasury still lacks policies to cut emissions. It has not explained, for instance, how finances can be raised for a massive investment in clean electricity, or how a great home insulation programme will be prompted and supported. The committee said: ""Currently vague plans must be quickly pinned down for improving home energy efficiency for the 60% of UK households that are owner-occupiers but not in fuel poverty."" More policies are needed, too, to curb emissions from land use and farming, it says. The criticisms are tempered by praise for the sweeping nature of the governmentâs Net Zero Strategy, which is thought to be the first in the world to demonstrate how emissions can be cut across the board. The report says the strategy is achievable and affordable, and will create many jobs. CCC chairman Lord Deben said: âThis is a genuine step forward. The UK was the first major industrialised nation to set Net Zero into law â now we have policy plans to get us there. âMinisters have made the big decisions â to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles, to back heat pumps for homes. âThey have proposed policies to do it. I applaud their ambition but now they must deliver these goals and fill in the remaining gaps in funding and implementation.â This may prove easier said than done, because there is currently a gulf between the governmentâs climate promises and its achievements. The CCC recently judged that ministers had only achieved around a fifth of the carbon cuts needed to meet previous climate targets. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Six ways the UK could tackle climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change A government spokeswoman said: ""We value the Climate Change Committee's expert advice as we work to implement our comprehensive plan to finish the job and eradicate the UK's contribution to climate change by 2050. ""As the committee rightly highlights, our world-leading Net Zero Strategy builds on the UK's proven track record of having decarbonised faster than any other G7 country in recent decades.""

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Three quarters of the 1.4 billion people in China have been fully vaccinated Although anti-vax movements have appeared in many countries such as the US and the UK in recent months â and concerns have been highlighted about
dangerous misinformation linked to many such groups â there has been notably
little to suggest any sort of similar attitude in China. However, Hong Kongâs South China Morning Post says it has
interviewed people in China who are sceptical about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines in the country. It interviews a Beijing travel agent called Jessica Xu
who says: âI feel I need more time and evidence to show the vaccines are safe
and effective for me to take it.â The paper says Ms Xu has âadvised her parents
not to eitherâ. SCMP also interviews a Beijing-based officer manager, Sun Zhaoyun,
who says: ""I feel vaccination makes little difference."" Sun tells the paper: âI am less worried about getting Covid-19
without vaccination than about being judged and mocked for not being
inoculated.â Official media have said this week that 75% of Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated. Vaccination is actively encouraged in China, where the media environment is overwhelmingly state controlled, meaning it delivers a shared message. Anti-vax attitudes are largely presented as a Western phenomenon due to societal divisions. However, it is not mandatory and discouraged among people with certain medical conditions, or with flu and cold symptoms. Regardless, the governments of urban Chinese communities have stressed vaccination is important âto strengthen the immunity barrier of the whole populationâ. Some local governments have moved to restrict the non-vaccinated from venues where large groups of people might congregate, but there have been divisive attitudes from specialists in the country towards this. Kathryn StanczyszynPolitical Reporter, BBC Radio WM Birmingham's director of public health says plans to open Covid vaccination centres to 12 to 15-year-olds have been taking longer than expected as sites had to be made safe following anti-vaccination protests. Dr Justin Varney says: ""There have been some issues around anti-vaxxers - aggression and abuse of staff at vaccination sites. ""Yesterday when I had my booster I was hearing from the pharmacy where they had people coming in and being quite aggressive to them and that's disgraceful."" Dr Justin Varney said new sites were opening up every day He says the council has to ensure sites, particularly those visited by children, ""aren't environments where they can get hassled or abused by anti-vaxxers and that's what is taking a bit of time but there are sites opening up every day"". He urges people to look for centreson the NHS website,external. Children aged 12 to 15 in England are being offered the vaccine outside schools inbid to get more vaccinated. Dr Varney says the latest Covid-19 case rate in the city was 310 cases per 100,000 people, which is about an 8% rise from the previous seven days. Some 86.5% of the UK population aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 79.3% have had two doses. Another 37,809 people have had a first dose and a further 21,446 have had a second dose. The UK has recorded another 263 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure since 3 March. Figures for daily deaths tend to be higher on a Tuesday because of recording delays over the weekend. Due to technical issues, today's figures also include deaths and cases in Wales covering a 72-hour period. However, the total number of deaths recorded over the past seven days is up 7.8% on the previous week Another 40,954 cases have also been recorded - a slight rise on yesterday's figure of 36,567. Before today, cases had fallen for four days in a row. The total number of cases recorded over the past seven days is down slightly - by 0.4% - on the previous week. Workers hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show. Employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics. Construction and manufacturing were among the sectors to see sharp rises in pay. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise whena freeze on pay is lifted. Read more. COP26 will ""inevitably"" pose a risk of transmission of Covid-19,  Nicola Sturgeon has told Scottish Politicians. But the First Minister tells MSPs work has been done by the Scottish Government and United Nations to mitigate the effects of the climate conference. Sturgeon says: ""The hosting of COP26 would always have been a significant challenge for the UK and Scottish governments and Glasgow City Council. ""However, the fact it is happening amidst the global pandemic makes it even more so. ""It is inevitably the case that it poses a risk of increased Covid transmission."" Most delegates at the climate conference will be double vaccinated, those from outside the common travel area will have to show proof of a negative test and those on thetravel red list,externalwill have to stay in managed quarantine. Those in the conference's ""blue zone"" will have to carry out daily lateral flow testing and follow hygiene mitigations. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy expressed by football star Joshua Kimmich has caused concern among German experts. The Bayern Munich midfielder has confirmed reports he is yet to have a jab over worries about their long term safety. However, he insists he is not a ""Covid denier or an anti-vaxxer"" and argues it's a personal decision. ""There is a very good chance that I will still get vaccinated,"" the 26-year-old adds. Thomas Mertens, the head of Germany's expert panel on vaccine use, says several studies have shown long-term side effects ""do not exist, or are an extreme rarity"". ""Joshua Kimmich is certainly a recognised expert on football issues, but not an expert on vaccination,"" he says. Bayern Munich has expressed support for vaccines and advised players and staff to get them, but CEO Oliver Kahn explained the club respects players who have a ""different opinion"". International travellers coming to Scotland will be able to take a cheaper lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on the second day after their arrival, Nicola Sturgeon says. Arrivals who are double vaccinated and travelling from countries not on the red list will be eligible to take a lateral flow test. The first minister says the change will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday and lateral flow tests are expected to cost between Â£20 and Â£30. It will bring Scotland into line with England, which brought in the change on Sunday, while Wales will introduce the same changes from 31 October. All 12 to 15-year-olds in Scotland have had a Covid vaccination appointment scheduled, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells MSPs 53% of this age group have had their first dose. ""I can confirm that everyone in that age group has now had an appointment scheduled and should have received a letter telling them about that,"" she says. She encourages children and their parents to read the online information so they can make an informed decision about getting the vaccine. A committee in Brazil's senate is meeting to decide whether to approve a damning report into the government's handling of the pandemic. It  recommends President Jair Bolsonaro face nine criminal charges, including crimes against humanity, misusing public funds and peddling fake news. The report, presented in the Senate last week, follows a six-month inquiry into scandals and corruption in Brazil. President Bolsonaro says he is ""guilty of absolutely nothing"" and his government ""did the right thing from the first moment"". More than 600,000 people in Brazil have died from Covid - the second highest death toll worldwide, after the USA. Read morehere. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says no changes will be made to the Covid mitigations in place there - including rules around face masks. She tells MSPs while Scotland's situation has ""greatly improved"" since August, it ""remains fragile"" heading into winter months and she cannot ignore that cases are ""creeping up"". However, she points out that since August, cases have declined quickly without the need for further restrictions, which suggests that factors including the vaccination programme have been able to stem the Delta variant. She adds that Scotland currently has the lowest case rate of the four UK nations. Earlier, we heard from Prof Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser to the Department of Health, who told MPs that officials were considering moving away from testing people without Covid symptoms - but said the government was committed to asymptomatic testing until at least January. Prof Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, has also been asked about the issue when speaking to the Commons Science and Technology Committee. He says widespread testing in schools is ""very disruptive"" due to individual children being forced to isolate after testing positive and families taking children out of school because of a positive case. ""I think probably we need to move in the pandemic,
over this winter, maybe towards the end of the winter to a completely different
system of clinically-driven testing,"" he says. ""In other words, testing people who are unwell
rather than having regular testing of those people who are well."" Across the UK, all school staff and secondary school pupils are currently asked to do regular lateral flow tests. A major study of long Covid plans to gather data from patients to forecast the people who might need treatment. All adults in Scotland who have tested positive for the virus, as well as a small number who were negative, will be asked to take part by text message. They will be encouraged to log their symptoms through an app. Long Covid has been describedas symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after infection, which cannot be explained by other causes. An estimated 79,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Read more about the new studyhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has begun offering booster vaccines A senior Chinese official has told media that by the end of the year, China aims to have provided two billion
vaccine doses to the world. Luo Zhaohui, the head of the China
International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), was speaking at a press
conference today hosted by Chinaâs State Council. According to the national Global Times
newspaper, he stated China has so far âprovided more than 1.5bn Covid-19
vaccine doses to 106 countries and four international organisations since the
beginning of this yearâ. There are aims to reach 2bn by the end of the year,
and also provide $100m to the international vaccine sharing scheme, Covax. State media have repeatedly stressed
that China has the capacity to produce 5bn vaccine doses annually. As the
country has a population of 1.4bn, in theory it only needs half of those.
However, booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities. Chinaâs National Health Commission
provides daily updates on the number of vaccines given domestically. Today's says 2.24bn doses have been administered to date on the mainland. It was reported in official media
yesterday that 1.06bn people âhave completed their vaccination against
Covid-19â - meaning they have received two vaccine doses. That means so far, at least 75% of
Chinaâs population have been fully vaccinated against the virus. Read more: Covid-19 vaccines: Has China made more than other countries combined?

Watchdog recommends 30-day suspension for Tory MPA report says ex-minister Owen Paterson had used his position as MP to benefit two companies who paid him.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Conservative MP Owen Paterson: ""I stuck within the rules."" Ex-minister Owen Paterson could be suspended from the Commons for 30 days after an MPs' watchdog found he had ""repeatedly"" used his position as an MP to benefit two companies who paid him as a consultant. The watchdog described his actions as ""an egregious case of paid advocacy"". In reply, the Conservative MP said: ""The process I have been subjected to does not comply with natural justice."" ""I am not guilty and a fair process would exonerate me,"" he added. Mr Paterson said the process was ""a major contributory factor"" in the death of his wife, Rose, who took her own life last year. The committee said the allegations related to events which took place before Mrs Paterson's death. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone opened an investigation into the North Shropshire MP following accusations he had lobbied on behalf of two companies who employed him. Her report said he was a paid consultant to Randox and Lynn's Country Foods and had made approaches to the Food Standards Agency and Department for International Development ministers about the companies. Family's 'anguish' after Rose Paterson death MPs agree to new conduct rules after bullying report MPs to get new standards commissioner The commissioner also found Mr Paterson had breached the MPs' code of conduct by using his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for meetings relating to his outside business interests between October 2016 and February 2020 - and in sending two letters relating to business interests on House of Commons headed notepaper. The report noted,externalthat there was no immediate financial benefit secured by the two companies, but that Mr Paterson's approaches could ""clearly have conferred significant benefits on Randox and Lynn's in the long term and even in the short term secured meetings that would not have been available without Mr Paterson's involvement"". The Standards Committee recommended that Mr Paterson, who is a former Northern Ireland Secretary, be suspended from Parliament for 30 sitting days, which will now be debated. If an MP is suspended for more than 10 sitting days by a parliamentary committee, this can automatically trigger a recall petition - something which could lead to a by-election in their seat. Mr Paterson has strongly denied any wrongdoing. Speaking to the BBC, the former environment secretary said he was ""absolutely stunned"" by the report's recommendations. He said he had wanted to alert the environment department about carcinogenic products in milk and ham, defending his actions as ""absolutely right"" and arguing that it had ""saved lives"". ""If it happened again this morning, I would do it again,"" he added. The MP accused the commissioner and the committee of not talking to him until months into the investigation and failing to hear from his 17 witnesses. He claims he was pronounced guilty by the commissioner ""without being spoken to"" and that ""no proper investigation was undertaken"". The BBC has been told the committee interviewed Mr Paterson and reviewed all the witness statements he provided, while the commissioner offered Mr Paterson an interview but he didn't proceed with it. A spokesperson for Randox said it was aware of the report, adding: ""Randox does not wish, or need, to comment on this investigation.  This is a matter for Mr Paterson and the relevant parliamentary authorities."" A spokesperson for Lynn's Country Foods said the company would not be making a statement. In Mr Paterson's response to the committee report he said: ""I lost my beloved wife of 40 years and this process was a major contributory factor."" He said the way the investigation was conducted ""undoubtedly played a major role"", saying: ""Rose would ask me despairingly every weekend about the progress of the inquiry, convinced that the investigation would go to any lengths to somehow find me in the wrong."" Mr Paterson told the BBC the investigation had ""destroyed the last quarter of my life"" and that his wife had been ""very rattled"" by the inquiry. This video can not be played Owen Paterson says his family has been left in ""anguish and misery"" after his wife took her own life In the report, the committee said it was ""painfully conscious that Mr Paterson lost his wife in tragic circumstances in June 2020"". ""We wish to express our deepest sympathy to him for his loss - this last year must have been very distressing for him and we have taken these circumstances fully into account in considering Mr Paterson's conduct during the period of the investigation."" However, the committee said the allegations related to conduct prior to Mrs Paterson's death and that ""it is these allegations on which we are required to adjudicate, impartially, without fear or favour, and with a sole eye to the rules of the House and the requirements of natural justice"". It added that it was ""very possible that grief and distress caused by this event has affected the way in which Mr Paterson approached the Commissioner's investigation thereafter"". The committee also noted other mitigating factors including Mr Paterson's ill health. The committee said Mr Paterson's ""evident passion for and expertise"" in food and farming was ""admirable"" but warned it should be ""channelled within the rules of the House"". Listing ""aggravating factors"" that influenced the recommended punishment for Mr Paterson, it said: ""No previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests."" It added that ""Mr Paterson's financial remuneration from Randox and Lynn's amounted to nearly three times his annual parliamentary salary"" and that during the investigation Mr Paterson had ""made serious, personal, and unsubstantiated allegations against the integrity of the commissioner and her team"".

Teachers' fair employment law exemption 'outdated',"The union says every teacher should be able to apply for work in any school regardless of their religion The exemption of teachers in Northern Ireland from fair employment legislation ""is outdated and needs to be removed"", according to a union. A number of MLAs and the former first minister, Arlene Foster,have previously criticised that exemption. The teaching union, the NASUWT, is the latest to call for the exemption to be scrapped. The recruitment of teachers is exempt from legislation outlawing religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. The NASUWT said removing the exemption would ""tackle endemic nepotism and lack of diversity in the teaching profession."" The union is to present a motion to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) conference in Belfast on Tuesday. It calls for the backing of the wider trade union movement for the exemption to be removed. ""The practical effect of this is that it is not currently unlawful to discriminate against someone in an appointment process on the basis of their religious belief,"" the NASUWT said. In 1976,the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Ac,externalt exempted teachers and clergy as ""the essential nature of the job requires it be done by a person holding, or not holding, a particular religious belief"". That was maintained in the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998. The exemption allows schools to use religious background or belief in deciding who to recruit to teaching posts. It also means schools have no legal obligation to monitor the community background of their teaching staff. Teacher fair employment exemption 'needs addressed' Women teachers affected by need for RE certificate In 2004, the Equality Commission investigated the exemption and found ""the exception of teachers from the religious discrimination provisions is widely accepted, and the support for change is a minority view"". According to the Equality Commission, there were concerns from the Catholic church at the time that ending it would lead to Catholic schools losing their religious ethos and becoming non-denominational. There were also concerns from the Protestant churches that Protestant teachers would be disadvantaged because of the need for teachers in Catholic primary schools tohave a certificate in religious education. The commission did recommend scrapping the exemption for post-primary schools but no changes to the law were subsequently made. Geraldine McGahey, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said: ""It definitely should go from post-primary schools and, in primary schools, we think there should be a concerted effort to find a way to remove from that as well."" The recruitment of teachers in Northern Ireland is exempt from legislation outlawing religious discrimination In recent years a number of assembly members have been critical of the recruitment of teachers being exempt from fair employment laws. In 2019, research from the Unesco Education centre at Ulster University (UU) alsosuggested it contributed to relatively few teachers from a Protestant background teaching in Catholic maintained schools, and vice-versa. The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) said it was ""actively considering its position on the issue"". But CCMS added it believed the exemption ""should remain in place until such time as any proposals for its repeal can be demonstrated to give complete confidence to the future of, in our case, Catholic education"". The NASUWT's Northern Ireland official Justin McCamphill said the exemption was ""outdated and needs to be removed"". ""We are calling on the first and deputy first minister to remove this and ensure that every teacher has equality of opportunity and is able to apply for work in any school regardless of their religion or perceived community background,"" he said. The leaders of the five main political parties in Northern Ireland are also expected to speak at the ICTU conference at the Waterfront Hall on Tuesday.

little to suggest any sort of similar attitude in China. However, Hong Kongâs South China Morning Post says it has
interviewed people in China who are sceptical about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines in the country. It interviews a Beijing travel agent called Jessica Xu
who says: âI feel I need more time and evidence to show the vaccines are safe
and effective for me to take it.â The paper says Ms Xu has âadvised her parents
not to eitherâ. SCMP also interviews a Beijing-based officer manager, Sun Zhaoyun,
who says: ""I feel vaccination makes little difference."" Sun tells the paper: âI am less worried about getting Covid-19
without vaccination than about being judged and mocked for not being
inoculated.â Official media have said this week that 75% of Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated. Vaccination is actively encouraged in China, where the media environment is overwhelmingly state controlled, meaning it delivers a shared message. Anti-vax attitudes are largely presented as a Western phenomenon due to societal divisions. However, it is not mandatory and discouraged among people with certain medical conditions, or with flu and cold symptoms. Regardless, the governments of urban Chinese communities have stressed vaccination is important âto strengthen the immunity barrier of the whole populationâ. Some local governments have moved to restrict the non-vaccinated from venues where large groups of people might congregate, but there have been divisive attitudes from specialists in the country towards this. Kathryn StanczyszynPolitical Reporter, BBC Radio WM Birmingham's director of public health says plans to open Covid vaccination centres to 12 to 15-year-olds have been taking longer than expected as sites had to be made safe following anti-vaccination protests. Dr Justin Varney says: ""There have been some issues around anti-vaxxers - aggression and abuse of staff at vaccination sites. ""Yesterday when I had my booster I was hearing from the pharmacy where they had people coming in and being quite aggressive to them and that's disgraceful."" Dr Justin Varney said new sites were opening up every day He says the council has to ensure sites, particularly those visited by children, ""aren't environments where they can get hassled or abused by anti-vaxxers and that's what is taking a bit of time but there are sites opening up every day"". He urges people to look for centreson the NHS website,external. Children aged 12 to 15 in England are being offered the vaccine outside schools inbid to get more vaccinated. Dr Varney says the latest Covid-19 case rate in the city was 310 cases per 100,000 people, which is about an 8% rise from the previous seven days. Some 86.5% of the UK population aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 79.3% have had two doses. Another 37,809 people have had a first dose and a further 21,446 have had a second dose. The UK has recorded another 263 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure since 3 March. Figures for daily deaths tend to be higher on a Tuesday because of recording delays over the weekend. Due to technical issues, today's figures also include deaths and cases in Wales covering a 72-hour period. However, the total number of deaths recorded over the past seven days is up 7.8% on the previous week Another 40,954 cases have also been recorded - a slight rise on yesterday's figure of 36,567. Before today, cases had fallen for four days in a row. The total number of cases recorded over the past seven days is down slightly - by 0.4% - on the previous week. Workers hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show. Employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics. Construction and manufacturing were among the sectors to see sharp rises in pay. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise whena freeze on pay is lifted. Read more. COP26 will ""inevitably"" pose a risk of transmission of Covid-19,  Nicola Sturgeon has told Scottish Politicians. But the First Minister tells MSPs work has been done by the Scottish Government and United Nations to mitigate the effects of the climate conference. Sturgeon says: ""The hosting of COP26 would always have been a significant challenge for the UK and Scottish governments and Glasgow City Council. ""However, the fact it is happening amidst the global pandemic makes it even more so. ""It is inevitably the case that it poses a risk of increased Covid transmission."" Most delegates at the climate conference will be double vaccinated, those from outside the common travel area will have to show proof of a negative test and those on thetravel red list,externalwill have to stay in managed quarantine. Those in the conference's ""blue zone"" will have to carry out daily lateral flow testing and follow hygiene mitigations. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy expressed by football star Joshua Kimmich has caused concern among German experts. The Bayern Munich midfielder has confirmed reports he is yet to have a jab over worries about their long term safety. However, he insists he is not a ""Covid denier or an anti-vaxxer"" and argues it's a personal decision. ""There is a very good chance that I will still get vaccinated,"" the 26-year-old adds. Thomas Mertens, the head of Germany's expert panel on vaccine use, says several studies have shown long-term side effects ""do not exist, or are an extreme rarity"". ""Joshua Kimmich is certainly a recognised expert on football issues, but not an expert on vaccination,"" he says. Bayern Munich has expressed support for vaccines and advised players and staff to get them, but CEO Oliver Kahn explained the club respects players who have a ""different opinion"". International travellers coming to Scotland will be able to take a cheaper lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on the second day after their arrival, Nicola Sturgeon says. Arrivals who are double vaccinated and travelling from countries not on the red list will be eligible to take a lateral flow test. The first minister says the change will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday and lateral flow tests are expected to cost between Â£20 and Â£30. It will bring Scotland into line with England, which brought in the change on Sunday, while Wales will introduce the same changes from 31 October. All 12 to 15-year-olds in Scotland have had a Covid vaccination appointment scheduled, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells MSPs 53% of this age group have had their first dose. ""I can confirm that everyone in that age group has now had an appointment scheduled and should have received a letter telling them about that,"" she says. She encourages children and their parents to read the online information so they can make an informed decision about getting the vaccine. A committee in Brazil's senate is meeting to decide whether to approve a damning report into the government's handling of the pandemic. It  recommends President Jair Bolsonaro face nine criminal charges, including crimes against humanity, misusing public funds and peddling fake news. The report, presented in the Senate last week, follows a six-month inquiry into scandals and corruption in Brazil. President Bolsonaro says he is ""guilty of absolutely nothing"" and his government ""did the right thing from the first moment"". More than 600,000 people in Brazil have died from Covid - the second highest death toll worldwide, after the USA. Read morehere. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says no changes will be made to the Covid mitigations in place there - including rules around face masks. She tells MSPs while Scotland's situation has ""greatly improved"" since August, it ""remains fragile"" heading into winter months and she cannot ignore that cases are ""creeping up"". However, she points out that since August, cases have declined quickly without the need for further restrictions, which suggests that factors including the vaccination programme have been able to stem the Delta variant. She adds that Scotland currently has the lowest case rate of the four UK nations. Earlier, we heard from Prof Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser to the Department of Health, who told MPs that officials were considering moving away from testing people without Covid symptoms - but said the government was committed to asymptomatic testing until at least January. Prof Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, has also been asked about the issue when speaking to the Commons Science and Technology Committee. He says widespread testing in schools is ""very disruptive"" due to individual children being forced to isolate after testing positive and families taking children out of school because of a positive case. ""I think probably we need to move in the pandemic,
over this winter, maybe towards the end of the winter to a completely different
system of clinically-driven testing,"" he says. ""In other words, testing people who are unwell
rather than having regular testing of those people who are well."" Across the UK, all school staff and secondary school pupils are currently asked to do regular lateral flow tests. A major study of long Covid plans to gather data from patients to forecast the people who might need treatment. All adults in Scotland who have tested positive for the virus, as well as a small number who were negative, will be asked to take part by text message. They will be encouraged to log their symptoms through an app. Long Covid has been describedas symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after infection, which cannot be explained by other causes. An estimated 79,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Read more about the new studyhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has begun offering booster vaccines A senior Chinese official has told media that by the end of the year, China aims to have provided two billion
vaccine doses to the world. Luo Zhaohui, the head of the China
International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), was speaking at a press
conference today hosted by Chinaâs State Council. According to the national Global Times
newspaper, he stated China has so far âprovided more than 1.5bn Covid-19
vaccine doses to 106 countries and four international organisations since the
beginning of this yearâ. There are aims to reach 2bn by the end of the year,
and also provide $100m to the international vaccine sharing scheme, Covax. State media have repeatedly stressed
that China has the capacity to produce 5bn vaccine doses annually. As the
country has a population of 1.4bn, in theory it only needs half of those.
However, booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities. Chinaâs National Health Commission
provides daily updates on the number of vaccines given domestically. Today's says 2.24bn doses have been administered to date on the mainland. It was reported in official media
yesterday that 1.06bn people âhave completed their vaccination against
Covid-19â - meaning they have received two vaccine doses. That means so far, at least 75% of
Chinaâs population have been fully vaccinated against the virus. Read more: Covid-19 vaccines: Has China made more than other countries combined?

The rate of cases in Wales remains the highest of all the UK nations but Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, national director of health protection at Public Health Wales, says rates appear to be ""plateauing"".

"Public sector workers set for pay rise - SunakThe chancellor will use his Budget on Wednesday to confirm that the ""pay pause"" is being lifted.","Millions of public sector workers are set to see their wages rise next year, after the government confirmed a pay freeze is being lifted. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his Budget on Wednesday to say nurses, teachers and members of the armed forces are among those set to benefit. A ""temporary pause"" in salary progression wasintroduced last Novemberas a response to the pandemic. Labour says tax and price rises mean families face a cost of living crisis. The public sector pay freeze was part of the government's response to what it described as the ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid, with only the lowest-paid excluded. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Is there a gap between public and private sector pay? A simple guide to Budget 2021 In his spending review in November 2020, Mr Sunak said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis. The Treasury said exactly how much of a pay rise public sector workers receive depends on the recommendations from the independent pay review bodies, who set the pay for most frontline workforces - including nurses, police officers, prison officers and teachers. But asked if public sector pay would rise above inflation, a Downing Street spokesperson said the independent pay review body would consider what the rise should be and that No 10 couldn't ""pre-judge that process"". Separately, campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the tax to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row at Wednesday's Budget. The BBC has also been toldVAT on household energy would not be cutwith the Treasury arguing it would be poorly targeted and that lower income households could be better helped through other schemes. 2010-12:Two-year pay freeze, excluding workers below Â£21,000 2013-17:Pay awards limited to an average of 1% per year 2018-20:No explicit pay policy 2021:One-year pay freeze, excluding NHS staff and workers earning below Â£24,000 In an announcement on Monday, the Treasury said the chancellor would use his forthcoming Budget to say ""the solid economic recovery and encouraging signs in the labour market"" mean the ""pay pause"" can be lifted. In a statement, Mr Sunak said: ""The economic impact and uncertainty of the virus meant we had to take the difficult decision to pause public sector pay. ""And now, with the economy firmly back on track, it's right that nurses, teachers and all the other public sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise."" Union backlash over public sector pay freeze Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Pay rebound for workers hit by the pandemic Business Minister Paul Scully said it was ""important public sector workers are recognised for what they do and are rewarded fairly"". He said it was part of a number of measures to help people on low incomes, which also included therise in the national living wage announced on Monday. He told BBC Breakfast: ""We know there are pressures. We know this is a difficult time for the economy, for people in the country in terms of the cost of living."" The Treasury said the ""temporary pause"" had helped ensure the gap between public and private sector pay did not widen further during the height of the pandemic. It said public sector average weekly earnings rose by 4.5% in 2020/21 whilst private sector wage increases were a third lower than they were pre-crisis, at 1.8%. On Tuesday figures from the Office for National Statistics showed thatworkers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, with employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work seeing the sharpest dip and recovery. It comes at a time of fierce debate about the pressure families are under amid soaring energy bills and price rises for goods in shops. Opposition MPs have accused the Conservatives of presiding over a cost of living crisis withcuts to universal creditandtax rises to fund the NHS and social care. There is disquiet among some Conservative backbenchers too about whether ministers should be doing more to help struggling households. There may be an element of relief for some public sector workers that their pay will at at least not be frozen for another year. But it may not be enough to lift the bitterness many feel that in the year when many of them were key workers, often risking their health on the frontlines of the pandemic, they're coping with a real terms pay cut. Even nurses, who've received more than most, have seen their spending power shrink as inflation gets above 3%. And that renewed squeeze on living standards is getting worse with record petrol prices and energy bills driving up the cost of living. What shouldn't be taken at face value is the notion that the government ""can't afford"" to pay more. What a government that issues its own currency decides it can or cannot ""afford"" has no objective economic basis, but is a matter of political choice. For example, as the IFS points out, the cost of servicing debt is lower than it was pre-pandemic. In fact, it's the second lowest it's been since the 1950s. Even if official interest rates rise to 1.25%, they will still be historically low - and that is manageable as long as tax receipts are rising faster than the debt servicing cost. With teachers' pay in real terms 8% lower than a decade ago, hospital consultants 9% lower, NHS dentists 32% down, a reality is coming home: you can't get the work done if you can't attract the staff to do it. The cost of not allowing pay rises - in the harm it could to the government's other goals such as better public health and education - could have been higher than any pay rise. The UK's largest union, Unison, said the pay freeze would continue ""in all but name"" unless government departments get extra money. Its general secretary Christina McAnea said while there was ""never a good time to freeze public sector pay"", to do so ""at the peak of a pandemic was the height of folly"" while ""staff were doing their all to keep under-pressure services running"". She added: ""There can be no decent public services without the people to run them. ""Pay freezes don't help employers hold on to experienced staff, nor attract new recruits. ""But if the chancellor doesn't allocate extra money to government departments to fund the much-needed wage rises, the pay freeze will continue in all but name."" Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation described the announcement as ""blindingly obvious"" adding that it was ""totally inevitable"" the pay freeze would be lifted. ""What we don't know, is what is going to happen to public sector pay - lifting the freeze is one thing, but a rise could be anything between 0 to a million per cent pay rise."" Labour says many of those working on the frontline dealing with Covid are among those being hit by the government's choices. Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said: ""This Conservative government's choice last year to freeze pay for so many frontline workers, who have been among the real heroes of the pandemic, was damaging and unsustainable. ""The government must work to ensure a fair settlement and reflect the vital work of all key workers including many who have been burnt out over the course of the pandemic."" Meanwhile, the Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has told MPs it was""not acceptable"" to brief the mediaahead of MPs about the Budget. Sir Lindsay said that ministers used to ""walk"" if they briefed about a Budget.

Pay rebound for workers hit by the pandemic,"Construction workers are among those witnessing the biggest pay rebound Workers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show. Employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A revival in pay rates for men has meant the gender pay gap has widened. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise whena freeze on pay is lifted. ""We need a proper plan from the chancellor [at the Budget] to get pay rising across the economy,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""That means a pay rise for all public sector workers that at least matches the cost of living. If Rishi Sunak does not increase department budgets the pay freeze will be over in name only."" TheONS figures,externalshow median weekly pay for full-time employees was Â£611 in April 2021, representing a 4.3% increase from the same month in the previous year. However, the change was far more dramatic for certain sections of the workforce, owing to furlough and other effects of the Covid crisis. For example, employees aged 16 and 17 saw pay drop by 11.4% in 2019-20, before growing by 12.5% the following year. Construction workers saw weekly pay go up by 16.8% in 2021 compared with a fall of 10.4% a year earlier. Manufacturing employees benefited from an 8.3% increase after a 3.1% drop previously. There were also significant regional differences, with gross weekly earnings up by 8.8% in Northern Ireland, compared with a 1.1% rise in London, in 2021. Starter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years The future of the office Nicola White, head of earnings at the ONS, said: ""After virtually flatlining last year at the start of the pandemic, earnings are returning to something like their long-term trend over the last few years. ""Increases this year were most marked for the groups worst affected in 2020, such as younger people, men and those in lowest-paid jobs."" The impact of the pandemic was different for men's pay compared with women's earnings, primarily due to furlough. The recent rebound in pay for many men resulted in a worsening of the gender pay gap between male and female earners. In April 2020, the gap was 7%, but it was 7.9% in April this year, following previous improvements. ""This isn't a reversal of the trend, it is a bump caused by the pandemic,"" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. ""When the 2020 study was carried out, more men were furloughed, and half were on temporarily lower pay, so the gap looked smaller than it actually was. When the 2021 study was done, the position was reversed, so it looked larger than it really was."" Ms Coles said the gender pay gap was affected significantly by how people lived their lives and brought flexibility of work into sharp focus. ""Children make an enormous difference, but the gap doesn't widen when women take time off with their first newborn, at the average age of 31. It is later, when they reach 40, that it opens up, so the relationship between pay and parenting is more complicated,"" she said.

"Airbnb host banned for $2,000 hike during COP26","Tan Copsey had booked his accommodation well in advance of the summit An Airbnb host has been banned from taking bookings during COP26 after he hiked the cost of a lodging by $2,000. Tan Copsey had booked the two-bedroom flat in Glasgow's west end well in advance of the summit only to receive an email with the inflated price. The host said he was concerned he had ""missed out on a great deal of money"" after seeing the average room price increase by ""400%"" in the area. Mr Copsey said: ""I had already paid. We already had an agreement."" Airbnb said it had ""zero tolerance"" for this kind of behaviour. Originally reported inThe Herald,external, Mr Copsey posted about his experience on social media, joking he was having a ""great time"" with COP26 accommodation. Cruise ship arrives on River Clyde to accommodate summit goers 'Why I am giving up my home to climate activists' Mr Copsey, who will be visiting his 10th UN climate summit, told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetimeprogramme he made the booking about three months ago. But a few weeks ago he received a ""really interesting"" message from the host. Mr Copsey, who works for a US non-profit organisation, said: ""The message essentially said: 'I am pretty disappointed that you booked early because I have missed out on a whole lot of money. Prices in our area have gone up 400% and so I would like to charge you more. Specifically, in your currency, $2,000 more."" He had originally booked a two-week stay at the property for Â£2,175 ($3,000). Mr Copsey said: ""The thing that bothered me about it was that I had already paid. We already had an agreement."" He cancelled his booking and has since arranged alternative accommodation for COP26, which starts at the Scottish Event Campus on Sunday. Thousands of delegates and hundreds of world leaders will descend on Glasgow for the climate summit Mr Copsey said his main concern now was the situation facing delegates who did not have the same resources. ""The bigger thing that is happening is that all these people from around the world are coming to Glasgow and they are coming to do something that is really important and really good,"" he said. ""And I don't think it is right that they are priced out because they are on government salaries. They work for small non-profits in Africa or the Pacific Islands, and they are already paying a huge amount of money to get to Glasgow because of the pandemic and because of travel being disrupted."" Despite his experience, Mr Copsey, whose area of specialism is the reduction of methane emissions, said he did not have any vindictive thoughts against the host or a negative opinion of Scottish people. And he said he hopes the many ""incredibly kind"" offers of accommodation he has received can now be used to help others who are less fortunate. An Airbnb spokesperson said: ""We have zero tolerance for this behaviour and have taken action against the host and blocked them from accepting other bookings during this period. ""The guest has been refunded in full and we have offered support in helping them find alternative accommodation."" Earlier this month BBC Scotland found evidence that a squeeze on available accommodation hadsent prices soaring in Glasgow. One room in the city initially advertised as Â£42 per night was later advertised at Â£1,400 per night during the summit. Fiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was ""a huge concern"" for activists hoping to attend. And restaurateur and property owner Charan Gill called the practice ""opportunistic"". He said: ""You will not live off this money forever - fine, you might make an extra few hundred or thousand pounds here and there. ""At the end of the day you have to go back to your normal people, your normal market, your normal tenants who keep your bread buttered."" Airbnb told the BBC they would donate all revenue from stays in Glasgow during the summit to Zero Waste Scotland. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

They work for small non-profits in Africa or the Pacific Islands, and they are already paying a huge amount of money to get to Glasgow because of the pandemic and because of travel being disrupted."" Despite his experience, Mr Copsey, whose area of specialism is the reduction of methane emissions, said he did not have any vindictive thoughts against the host or a negative opinion of Scottish people. And he said he hopes the many ""incredibly kind"" offers of accommodation he has received can now be used to help others who are less fortunate. An Airbnb spokesperson said: ""We have zero tolerance for this behaviour and have taken action against the host and blocked them from accepting other bookings during this period. ""The guest has been refunded in full and we have offered support in helping them find alternative accommodation."" Earlier this month BBC Scotland found evidence that a squeeze on available accommodation hadsent prices soaring in Glasgow. One room in the city initially advertised as Â£42 per night was later advertised at Â£1,400 per night during the summit. Fiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was ""a huge concern"" for activists hoping to attend. And restaurateur and property owner Charan Gill called the practice ""opportunistic"". He said: ""You will not live off this money forever - fine, you might make an extra few hundred or thousand pounds here and there. ""At the end of the day you have to go back to your normal people, your normal market, your normal tenants who keep your bread buttered."" Airbnb told the BBC they would donate all revenue from stays in Glasgow during the summit to Zero Waste Scotland. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

UK research frozen because of Brexit delay,"UK scientists are likely to be ""frozen out"" of EU research programmes because of delays in Brexit negotiations, according to MPs. Earlier this month, the EU indicated that the UK's participation in its Â£100bn research programme was tied to negotiations over Northern Ireland. The Commons European Scrutiny Select Committee says British science will not recover from ""lost opportunities"". Its chair, Sir Bill Cash, said that the delay was damaging UK businesses. ""It's been the best part of a year and British research institutions remain frozen out of key projects and funding despite agreement on participation. With each passing day, the opportunities are missed, British institutions are left high and dry while science marches on without them and the returns on our financial contribution edge lower,"" said Mr Cash. ""This needs to be addressed swiftly, so we're calling on the government to lay out the steps it is taking to ensure UK participation is formalised."" The EU's Horizon Europe programme brings together researchers from industry and academic research institutions. The projects range from fundamental research to tackling societal issues, such as combating climate change. The UK's continued participation in the EU's Horizon programme was agreed in principle just before Christmas in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. But the signing off of a formal agreement on the UK's associate membership has dragged on for months. Boris Johnson wants UK scientists to have the closest possible relationship with EU researchers There have been growing fears that scientific collaboration had become a bargaining chip tied to negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market after Brexit. Earlier this month, the EU's research commissioner, Mariya Gabriel, seemed to confirm these suspicions when she told the R&D policy news website sciencebusiness.net: ""transversal issues need to be tackled first"". The delay is creating problems, because funding cannot be released to UK collaborators until there is a formal agreement. If it becomes apparent that agreement will take many more months, EU researchers will not include UK scientists in their projects. Prof James Wilsdon, who is the director of the Research on Research Institute at the University of Sheffield, points to estimates that uncertainties arising from Brexit have already led to the UK research to missing out on Â£1.5bn of research funding since 2016. ""This number is rising fast, as Horizon Europe, the world's largest and most successful co-funding scheme, gets into full swing, and the UK is stuck outside. ""Unless this is resolved soon, the fear must be that the UK drops out, or is locked out, by default rather than design, as the rest of Europe marches on without us. This would be a tragedy for both sides, and would leave the UK's ambitions to be a scientific superpower in tatters."" The EU's Earth mapping effort, Copernicus, is similarly affected by the delay. This affects UK aerospace companies wanting to bid for contracts to manufacture equipment for Copernicus because the contracts are dished out as a proportion of the contribution from member states. Because of the impasse, British firms can't contribute and so, according to the Select Committee report, will be ""frozen out"". MPs on the Committee said that the delay raised concerns about value for money of participation in EU programmes. The UK's contribution to the Horizon Europe programme is expected to be about Â£2.1bn a year. The President of the UK's Royal Society, Prof Sir Adrian Smith, called for negotiators to stop treating the issue of research funding as a bargaining chip. ""Last Christmas, all sides agreed that the UK would associate to Horizon Europe,"" he said. ""Nearly a year on, the association agreement is still not signed, having become entangled in other issues. Vital research that benefits all nations will be delayed unless all sides look at Horizon Europe on its own merits and get the deal signed.""

UN emissions report a 'thundering wake up call',"Current plans to cut carbon emissions don't work quickly enough, says the UN National plans to cut carbon fall far short of what's needed to avert dangerous climate change, according to the UN Environment Programme. TheirEmissions Gap report,externalsays country pledges will fail to keep the global temperature under 1.5C this century. The Unep analysis suggests the world is on course to warm around 2.7C with hugely destructive impacts. But there is hope that, if long term net-zero goals are met, temperatures can be significantly reined in. Attenborough in 'act now' warning over climate Make people fly less, climate change advisers say Australia's 2050 net zero pledge draws criticism Just a few days beforeCOP26opens in Glasgow, another scientific report on climate change is ""another thundering wake-up call"", according to the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres. Street art in Glasgow where COP26 begins in a few days time This week, we've already had a study from the WMO showing thatwarming gases were at a new high last year, despite the pandemic. Now in its 12th year, this Emissions Gap report looks at the nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) or carbon-cutting plans that countries have submitted to the UN ahead of COP. These pledges run up to 2030 and have been submitted by 120 countries. Unep has also taken account of other commitments to cut warming gases not yet formally submitted in an NDC. The report finds that when added together, the plans cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by around 7.5% compared to the previous pledges made five years ago. This is nowhere near enough to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within sight, say the scientists who compiled the study. To keep 1.5C alive would require 55% cuts by the same 2030 date. That means the current plans would need to have seven times the level of ambition to remain under that limit. ""To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, we have eight years to almost halve greenhouse gas emissions: eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of Unep. ""The clock is ticking loudly."" According to the authors, the current pledges would see the world warm by 2.7C this century, a scenario that Antonio Guterres calls a ""climate catastrophe"". He believes the report highlights the failures of political leaders. ""The emissions gap is the result of a leadership gap,"" he said at the launch of the study. ""But leaders can still make this a turning point to a greener future instead of a tipping point to climate catastrophe."" As Mr Guterres suggests, there are some hopeful signs in the report. Fires in California are continuing to burn, made worse by a changing climate Around 50 countries plus the EU have pledged a net zero target for the middle of this century. These strategies cover over half of greenhouse gas emissions. The Unep analysis finds that if these plans were implemented fully, this could shave 0.5C off the temperature rise by 2100. This would bring the global temperature level down to 2.2C, which would see dramatic and deadly impacts from warming but would be a step in the right direction from where the world is currently headed. The problem, though, is that many of these net zero goals are ambiguous, say the authors - particularly among the world's 20 richest nations, where a dozen long-term plans are said to be quite vague. Many delay significant cuts until after 2030, raising serious doubts about whether they can really deliver net zero just 20 years later. Six easy ways  to be environmentally friendly How to talk to your child about climate change Another hopeful sign relates to methane. The report also says there is great potential to make progress on these emissions, which are the second largest source of warming. Up to 20% of these emissions from fossil fuels, from waste and from agriculture could be curbed at low or no cost. Boats on a lake where the water level has fallen significantly due to drought However, the opportunity to develop a far greener world as the world recovers from Covid is in danger of being lost, say the authors. They find that around 20% of recovery investments will support renewables and the green economy. ""The huge sums spent to recover economies from Covid-19 are a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost low-carbon technologies and industries. In most cases, this opportunity is not being taken,"" said Brian O'Callaghan, project manager of the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project, and an author on the Unep report. ""This is a particular slap in the face for vulnerable nations who are suffering the worst consequences of climate changeâ¦we remain without a commitment from the highest emitters to cover the loss and damage that they have brought on the world.""

Queen holds first engagements since hospital stay,"The Queen has carried out her first engagements since staying overnight in hospital last week, meeting two ambassadors via video call. The monarch, who is at Windsor Castle, met virtually with the South Korean and Swiss ambassadors in Buckingham Palace. The audiences come after she went to hospital for preliminary medical checks last Wednesday. The Queen, 95, is expected to lead a royal delegation to the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit next week. She was seen smiling on camera as she greeted South Korea's Gunn Kim and HeeJung Lee, as well as Switzerland's Markus Leitner and Nicole Leitner. The ambassador for the Republic of Korea, Gunn Kim, accompanied by HeeJung Lee at Buckingham Palace Who gives the Queen medical advice? Queen 'irritated' by climate change inaction In pictures: The Queen's busy October The engagements are the first time the Queen has been seen since she hosted a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle last Tuesday evening. However, on Wednesday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said a planned trip to Northern Ireland had been cancelled, and the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". Then, in a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said she had stayed in hospital on Wednesday night after attending for ""some preliminary investigations"" and had returned the following day to Windsor Castle, where she was ""in good spirits"". This was a diplomatic engagement by the Queen in every sense. She was taking part in a virtual audience with two ambassadors - but the real message was that after last week's hospital stay she was back at work. It might have been one of the most upmarket work video meetings ever held, from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace, with backdrops of antique furniture and oil paintings. But it was sending a very modern media signal that any health worries were not going to stop the 95-year-old monarch from returning to her job. It was a photo intended to reassure. The Queen might be WFC (working from castle) but she's showing no signs of slowing down. The Queen stayed in King Edward VII's, a private hospital used by senior royals - including her husband, the late Duke of Edinburgh, who received treatment there earlier this year. She did not attend a church service at Windsor on Sunday. The Queen was pictured alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson last Tuesday evening The Queen is looked after by her physician Sir Huw Thomas,who is ""head of the medical household"". It has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen. An official record of her diary showed at least 16 formal events during October. She has been seen using a walking stick at recent public events, including ata Westminster Abbey serviceandwhen she opened the sixth term of the Senedd in Wales. The Royal Family's website says the Queen is due to attend a reception on 1 November as part of the climate change conference in Glasgow. She is due to attend engagements there between 1 and 5 November alongside the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Japanese princess in muted wedding after controversy,"The couple spoke at a press conference on Tuesday Japan's Princess Mako has married her college sweetheart Kei Komuro - thus losing her royal status. Under Japanese law, female imperial family members forfeit their status upon marriage to a ""commoner"" although male members do not. She also skipped the usual rites of a royal wedding and turned down a payment offered to royal females upon their departure from the family. She is the first female member of the royal family to decline both. The woman who gave up royal status to marry The couple are expected to move to the US - where Mr Komuro works as a lawyer - after marriage. The move has drawn inevitable comparisons with British royals Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, earning the newlyweds the nickname ""Japan's Harry and Meghan"". Like Ms Markle, Mr Komuro has come under intense scrutiny since his relationship with Ms Mako was announced. He was most recently criticised for sporting a ponytail when he returned to Japan. Some tabloid newspapers and social media users felt his hairstyle - seen as unconventional in Japan - was unbecoming of someone set to marry a princess. There was also a protest on Tuesday against the couple's marriage. In a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Mako said she apologised for any trouble brought to people by her marriage. ""I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused and I am grateful for those... who have continued to support me,"" she said, according to an NHK report. ""For me, Kei is irreplaceable - marriage was a necessary choice for us."" Mr Komuro added that he loved Ms Mako and wanted to spend his life with her. ""I love Mako. We only get one life, and I want us to spend it with the one we love,"" said Mr Komuro according to an AFP report.  ""I feel very sad that Mako has been in a bad condition, mentally and physically, because of the false accusations."" Princess Mako left her Tokyo residence at around 10:00 local time on Tuesday (01:00 GMT) to register her marriage, bowing several times to her parents, Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko. She also hugged her younger sister before she left, news outlet Kyodo reported. There has been excessive media coverage around the couple over the years, which has caused the princess to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) had earlier said. Her relationship has been met with controversy in the country. On Tuesday, people were pictured protesting against the marriage in a Japanese park. Many slogans appeared to bring up financial issues around Mr Komuro's family - specifically his mother. The former princess got engaged to Mr Komuro in 2017 and the two were set to wed the following year. But the marriage was delayed following claims Mr Komuro's mother had financial problems - she had reportedly taken a loan from her ex-fiancÃ© and not paid him back. The palace denied the delay was linked to this, though Crown Prince Fumihito said it was important for the money issues to be dealt with before the couple got married. According to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, the real reason for the animosity towards Mr Komuro seems to be among some conservative Japanese who believe he is not a worthy partner for a niece of the emperor. Mr Komuro - who has received a job offer from a top New York law firm - comes from humble origins, and local tabloids have spent years digging dirt on his family, including the allegations against his mother. The reaction to Princess Mako and Kei Komuro's relationship by some media and people in Japan, has highlighted the pressure women in Japan's imperial family face. The Imperial Household Agency has said Princess Mako suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the harsh criticism from the media and on social media around her engagement since it was announced nearly four years ago. She is not the first woman in the Japanese royal family to be affected this way. Her grandmother Empress Emerita Michiko temporarily lost her voice nearly 20 years ago when criticised by the media as being somehow unfit to be the Emperor's wife. Her aunt-in-law Empress Masako, suffered depression after she was blamed for failing to produce a male heir. Royal women have been forced to strictly adhere to certain expectations - they must be supportive of their husbands, produce an heir, and be a guardian of Japan's traditions. If they fall short they are savagely criticised. This is also true of Princess Mako, who said she would give up her royal status. But even that has not been enough to stop the attacks on her, her husband, and their marriage. Read this story in Japanesehere.

Colin Cox tells BBC Radio Cumbria: ""It seems to me we've been at a level of infection for quite some time that has been much higher than we would have accepted before, and we're accepting a higher rate of infection because it is not translating into a massive rate of hospitalisations and deaths."" However, he adds that there are more than 60 people currently in hospital with Covid in Cumbria, which ""still adds very substantially to the burden on the NHS"". The NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association are among the groups to have called for some restrictions to be reintroduced in England, amid rising cases. But the government has said the data does not suggest ""immediately moving to Plan B"". Read more: What is Plan B?

Public Health Scotland says Covid restrictions led to a drop of about 3.5 million dental treatments - a 76.4% fall. Dentistry was badly hit by the first national lockdown in March 2020, which resulted in practices being told to suspend all treatments. Urgent dental centres were then set up in every health board area to provide emergency care for those who needed it. Restrictions have since been eased but the British Dental Association says it is dealing with an ""unprecedented backlog"". Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Three quarters of the 1.4 billion people in China have been fully vaccinated Although anti-vax movements have appeared in many countries such as the US and the UK in recent months â and concerns have been highlighted about
dangerous misinformation linked to many such groups â there has been notably
little to suggest any sort of similar attitude in China. However, Hong Kongâs South China Morning Post says it has
interviewed people in China who are sceptical about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines in the country. It interviews a Beijing travel agent called Jessica Xu
who says: âI feel I need more time and evidence to show the vaccines are safe
and effective for me to take it.â The paper says Ms Xu has âadvised her parents
not to eitherâ. SCMP also interviews a Beijing-based officer manager, Sun Zhaoyun,
who says: ""I feel vaccination makes little difference."" Sun tells the paper: âI am less worried about getting Covid-19
without vaccination than about being judged and mocked for not being
inoculated.â Official media have said this week that 75% of Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated. Vaccination is actively encouraged in China, where the media environment is overwhelmingly state controlled, meaning it delivers a shared message. Anti-vax attitudes are largely presented as a Western phenomenon due to societal divisions. However, it is not mandatory and discouraged among people with certain medical conditions, or with flu and cold symptoms. Regardless, the governments of urban Chinese communities have stressed vaccination is important âto strengthen the immunity barrier of the whole populationâ. Some local governments have moved to restrict the non-vaccinated from venues where large groups of people might congregate, but there have been divisive attitudes from specialists in the country towards this. Kathryn StanczyszynPolitical Reporter, BBC Radio WM Birmingham's director of public health says plans to open Covid vaccination centres to 12 to 15-year-olds have been taking longer than expected as sites had to be made safe following anti-vaccination protests. Dr Justin Varney says: ""There have been some issues around anti-vaxxers - aggression and abuse of staff at vaccination sites. ""Yesterday when I had my booster I was hearing from the pharmacy where they had people coming in and being quite aggressive to them and that's disgraceful."" Dr Justin Varney said new sites were opening up every day He says the council has to ensure sites, particularly those visited by children, ""aren't environments where they can get hassled or abused by anti-vaxxers and that's what is taking a bit of time but there are sites opening up every day"". He urges people to look for centreson the NHS website,external. Children aged 12 to 15 in England are being offered the vaccine outside schools inbid to get more vaccinated. Dr Varney says the latest Covid-19 case rate in the city was 310 cases per 100,000 people, which is about an 8% rise from the previous seven days. Some 86.5% of the UK population aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 79.3% have had two doses. Another 37,809 people have had a first dose and a further 21,446 have had a second dose. The UK has recorded another 263 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure since 3 March. Figures for daily deaths tend to be higher on a Tuesday because of recording delays over the weekend. Due to technical issues, today's figures also include deaths and cases in Wales covering a 72-hour period. However, the total number of deaths recorded over the past seven days is up 7.8% on the previous week Another 40,954 cases have also been recorded - a slight rise on yesterday's figure of 36,567. Before today, cases had fallen for four days in a row. The total number of cases recorded over the past seven days is down slightly - by 0.4% - on the previous week. Workers hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show. Employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics. Construction and manufacturing were among the sectors to see sharp rises in pay. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise whena freeze on pay is lifted. Read more. COP26 will ""inevitably"" pose a risk of transmission of Covid-19,  Nicola Sturgeon has told Scottish Politicians. But the First Minister tells MSPs work has been done by the Scottish Government and United Nations to mitigate the effects of the climate conference. Sturgeon says: ""The hosting of COP26 would always have been a significant challenge for the UK and Scottish governments and Glasgow City Council. ""However, the fact it is happening amidst the global pandemic makes it even more so. ""It is inevitably the case that it poses a risk of increased Covid transmission."" Most delegates at the climate conference will be double vaccinated, those from outside the common travel area will have to show proof of a negative test and those on thetravel red list,externalwill have to stay in managed quarantine. Those in the conference's ""blue zone"" will have to carry out daily lateral flow testing and follow hygiene mitigations. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy expressed by football star Joshua Kimmich has caused concern among German experts. The Bayern Munich midfielder has confirmed reports he is yet to have a jab over worries about their long term safety. However, he insists he is not a ""Covid denier or an anti-vaxxer"" and argues it's a personal decision. ""There is a very good chance that I will still get vaccinated,"" the 26-year-old adds. Thomas Mertens, the head of Germany's expert panel on vaccine use, says several studies have shown long-term side effects ""do not exist, or are an extreme rarity"". ""Joshua Kimmich is certainly a recognised expert on football issues, but not an expert on vaccination,"" he says. Bayern Munich has expressed support for vaccines and advised players and staff to get them, but CEO Oliver Kahn explained the club respects players who have a ""different opinion"". International travellers coming to Scotland will be able to take a cheaper lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on the second day after their arrival, Nicola Sturgeon says. Arrivals who are double vaccinated and travelling from countries not on the red list will be eligible to take a lateral flow test. The first minister says the change will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday and lateral flow tests are expected to cost between Â£20 and Â£30. It will bring Scotland into line with England, which brought in the change on Sunday, while Wales will introduce the same changes from 31 October. All 12 to 15-year-olds in Scotland have had a Covid vaccination appointment scheduled, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells MSPs 53% of this age group have had their first dose. ""I can confirm that everyone in that age group has now had an appointment scheduled and should have received a letter telling them about that,"" she says. She encourages children and their parents to read the online information so they can make an informed decision about getting the vaccine. A committee in Brazil's senate is meeting to decide whether to approve a damning report into the government's handling of the pandemic. It  recommends President Jair Bolsonaro face nine criminal charges, including crimes against humanity, misusing public funds and peddling fake news. The report, presented in the Senate last week, follows a six-month inquiry into scandals and corruption in Brazil. President Bolsonaro says he is ""guilty of absolutely nothing"" and his government ""did the right thing from the first moment"". More than 600,000 people in Brazil have died from Covid - the second highest death toll worldwide, after the USA. Read morehere. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says no changes will be made to the Covid mitigations in place there - including rules around face masks. She tells MSPs while Scotland's situation has ""greatly improved"" since August, it ""remains fragile"" heading into winter months and she cannot ignore that cases are ""creeping up"". However, she points out that since August, cases have declined quickly without the need for further restrictions, which suggests that factors including the vaccination programme have been able to stem the Delta variant. She adds that Scotland currently has the lowest case rate of the four UK nations. Earlier, we heard from Prof Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser to the Department of Health, who told MPs that officials were considering moving away from testing people without Covid symptoms - but said the government was committed to asymptomatic testing until at least January. Prof Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, has also been asked about the issue when speaking to the Commons Science and Technology Committee. He says widespread testing in schools is ""very disruptive"" due to individual children being forced to isolate after testing positive and families taking children out of school because of a positive case. ""I think probably we need to move in the pandemic,
over this winter, maybe towards the end of the winter to a completely different
system of clinically-driven testing,"" he says. ""In other words, testing people who are unwell
rather than having regular testing of those people who are well."" Across the UK, all school staff and secondary school pupils are currently asked to do regular lateral flow tests. A major study of long Covid plans to gather data from patients to forecast the people who might need treatment. All adults in Scotland who have tested positive for the virus, as well as a small number who were negative, will be asked to take part by text message. They will be encouraged to log their symptoms through an app. Long Covid has been describedas symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after infection, which cannot be explained by other causes. An estimated 79,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Read more about the new studyhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has begun offering booster vaccines A senior Chinese official has told media that by the end of the year, China aims to have provided two billion
vaccine doses to the world. Luo Zhaohui, the head of the China
International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), was speaking at a press
conference today hosted by Chinaâs State Council. According to the national Global Times
newspaper, he stated China has so far âprovided more than 1.5bn Covid-19
vaccine doses to 106 countries and four international organisations since the
beginning of this yearâ. There are aims to reach 2bn by the end of the year,
and also provide $100m to the international vaccine sharing scheme, Covax. State media have repeatedly stressed
that China has the capacity to produce 5bn vaccine doses annually. As the
country has a population of 1.4bn, in theory it only needs half of those.
However, booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities. Chinaâs National Health Commission
provides daily updates on the number of vaccines given domestically. Today's says 2.24bn doses have been administered to date on the mainland. It was reported in official media
yesterday that 1.06bn people âhave completed their vaccination against
Covid-19â - meaning they have received two vaccine doses. That means so far, at least 75% of
Chinaâs population have been fully vaccinated against the virus. Read more: Covid-19 vaccines: Has China made more than other countries combined?

Today's updates were written by Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin and Becky Morton and the page has been edited by Hamish Mackay, George Bowden and James Clarke. As we wrap up the coronavirus live page for the day, here's a round-up of the main coronavirus developments so far : Cumbria's director of public healthis urging the government to bring in its Plan B measures for tackling Covid in England, including mandatory face masks in some public places. Colin Cox tells BBC Radio Cumbria: ""It seems to me we've been at a level of infection for quite some time that has been much higher than we would have accepted before, and we're accepting a higher rate of infection because it is not translating into a massive rate of hospitalisations and deaths."" However, he adds that there are more than 60 people currently in hospital with Covid in Cumbria, which ""still adds very substantially to the burden on the NHS"". The NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association are among the groups to have called for some restrictions to be reintroduced in England, amid rising cases. But the government has said the data does not suggest ""immediately moving to Plan B"". Read more: What is Plan B? A student from Liverpool who took up care work during the coronavirus pandemic has decided to don scrubs instead of dancing shoes in a change of career. Paul Wilson, a dance graduate from Edge Hill University, worked in a home during the lockdowns to help fund his degree. ""I quickly realised I had a massive passion and love for the profession. Nothing gave me the satisfaction I get from care,"" Paul says. This video can not be played Liverpool dancer takes up nursing after Covid care work The number of dental treatments carried out in Scotland last year fell to just a quarter of the figure for the previous 12 months, according to the latest official figures. Public Health Scotland says Covid restrictions led to a drop of about 3.5 million dental treatments - a 76.4% fall. Dentistry was badly hit by the first national lockdown in March 2020, which resulted in practices being told to suspend all treatments. Urgent dental centres were then set up in every health board area to provide emergency care for those who needed it. Restrictions have since been eased but the British Dental Association says it is dealing with an ""unprecedented backlog"". Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Three quarters of the 1.4 billion people in China have been fully vaccinated Although anti-vax movements have appeared in many countries such as the US and the UK in recent months â and concerns have been highlighted about
dangerous misinformation linked to many such groups â there has been notably
little to suggest any sort of similar attitude in China. However, Hong Kongâs South China Morning Post says it has
interviewed people in China who are sceptical about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines in the country. It interviews a Beijing travel agent called Jessica Xu
who says: âI feel I need more time and evidence to show the vaccines are safe
and effective for me to take it.â The paper says Ms Xu has âadvised her parents
not to eitherâ. SCMP also interviews a Beijing-based officer manager, Sun Zhaoyun,
who says: ""I feel vaccination makes little difference."" Sun tells the paper: âI am less worried about getting Covid-19
without vaccination than about being judged and mocked for not being
inoculated.â Official media have said this week that 75% of Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated. Vaccination is actively encouraged in China, where the media environment is overwhelmingly state controlled, meaning it delivers a shared message. Anti-vax attitudes are largely presented as a Western phenomenon due to societal divisions. However, it is not mandatory and discouraged among people with certain medical conditions, or with flu and cold symptoms. Regardless, the governments of urban Chinese communities have stressed vaccination is important âto strengthen the immunity barrier of the whole populationâ. Some local governments have moved to restrict the non-vaccinated from venues where large groups of people might congregate, but there have been divisive attitudes from specialists in the country towards this. Kathryn StanczyszynPolitical Reporter, BBC Radio WM Birmingham's director of public health says plans to open Covid vaccination centres to 12 to 15-year-olds have been taking longer than expected as sites had to be made safe following anti-vaccination protests. Dr Justin Varney says: ""There have been some issues around anti-vaxxers - aggression and abuse of staff at vaccination sites. ""Yesterday when I had my booster I was hearing from the pharmacy where they had people coming in and being quite aggressive to them and that's disgraceful."" Dr Justin Varney said new sites were opening up every day He says the council has to ensure sites, particularly those visited by children, ""aren't environments where they can get hassled or abused by anti-vaxxers and that's what is taking a bit of time but there are sites opening up every day"". He urges people to look for centreson the NHS website,external. Children aged 12 to 15 in England are being offered the vaccine outside schools inbid to get more vaccinated. Dr Varney says the latest Covid-19 case rate in the city was 310 cases per 100,000 people, which is about an 8% rise from the previous seven days. Some 86.5% of the UK population aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 79.3% have had two doses. Another 37,809 people have had a first dose and a further 21,446 have had a second dose. The UK has recorded another 263 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure since 3 March. Figures for daily deaths tend to be higher on a Tuesday because of recording delays over the weekend. Due to technical issues, today's figures also include deaths and cases in Wales covering a 72-hour period. However, the total number of deaths recorded over the past seven days is up 7.8% on the previous week Another 40,954 cases have also been recorded - a slight rise on yesterday's figure of 36,567. Before today, cases had fallen for four days in a row. The total number of cases recorded over the past seven days is down slightly - by 0.4% - on the previous week. Workers hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show. Employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics. Construction and manufacturing were among the sectors to see sharp rises in pay. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise whena freeze on pay is lifted. Read more. COP26 will ""inevitably"" pose a risk of transmission of Covid-19,  Nicola Sturgeon has told Scottish Politicians. But the First Minister tells MSPs work has been done by the Scottish Government and United Nations to mitigate the effects of the climate conference. Sturgeon says: ""The hosting of COP26 would always have been a significant challenge for the UK and Scottish governments and Glasgow City Council. ""However, the fact it is happening amidst the global pandemic makes it even more so. ""It is inevitably the case that it poses a risk of increased Covid transmission."" Most delegates at the climate conference will be double vaccinated, those from outside the common travel area will have to show proof of a negative test and those on thetravel red list,externalwill have to stay in managed quarantine. Those in the conference's ""blue zone"" will have to carry out daily lateral flow testing and follow hygiene mitigations. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy expressed by football star Joshua Kimmich has caused concern among German experts. The Bayern Munich midfielder has confirmed reports he is yet to have a jab over worries about their long term safety. However, he insists he is not a ""Covid denier or an anti-vaxxer"" and argues it's a personal decision. ""There is a very good chance that I will still get vaccinated,"" the 26-year-old adds.

"Funding plan paves way for Sizewell C nuclear siteThe new rules, to be announced in Parliament, will boost the prospects of the Â£20bn project in Suffolk.Business","Sizewell C (lighter grey on the right) would be built next to Sizewell B Funding rules paving the way for a new major nuclear power station have been announced by the Business and Energy Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The move is the latest stage in efforts to build the Â£20bn Sizewell C project in Suffolk. The proposed plant is still subject to planning approval, but until now, the Treasury has been uncertain of how to pay for it. Even if the project is approved, it still faces strong local objections. The government said the new financing model could help cut the cost of new nuclear power projects in Britain, saving consumers more than Â£30bn on each new large-scale station. The proposals include electricity customers paying for part of nuclear schemes' costs upfront through bills. The new model, known as RAB (Regulated Asset Base), has already been used to finance some large infrastructure projects, including the Â£4.2bn Thames Tideway ""super-sewer"". It allows investors to receive returns before the projects have been completed. Sizewell C pledges Â£250m to mitigate its impact Plans for Sizewell C are outdated, says scientist Government in talks to fund Â£20bn nuclear plant The Treasury was initially reluctant to use the RAB model. Not only does it add money to consumer bills over the lifetime of the project, but it also leaves consumers vulnerable to cost overruns, which have plagued previous nuclear developments. However, contractor EDF Energy has been adamant that lessons learned on previous projects - and the fact that it is building an identical plant at Hinkley Point - have largely mitigated those risks, says BBC business editor Simon Jack. Mr Kwarteng said the new funding model was a better way to finance such projects. ""The existing financing scheme led to too many overseas nuclear developers walking away from projects, setting Britain back years,"" he said. ""We urgently need a new approach to attract British funds and other private investors to back new large-scale nuclear power stations in the UK."" Employers' organisation the CBI said the new financing model was ""a crucial step in building a secure, affordable and greener energy system in the years ahead"". ""Getting new projects off the ground will be a huge boost to supply chains and can deliver jobs right across the UK,"" said Tom Thackray, director of the CBI's decarbonisation programme. The Nuclear Industry Association said it would add a small levy to bills of no more than a few pounds during the early phase of construction and less than Â£1 a month over the course of a project. It ""warmly welcomed"" the plan, adding it would also bring substantial savings in terms of CO2 emissions worth Â£526m a year at today's carbon prices, or Â£18 per year for every UK household. But the high cost of big nuclear plants and the plummeting cost of renewables such as offshore wind make the project controversial. However, the enormous amount of low-carbon non-intermittent electricity that it produces is considered by the government to be an essential part of the UK's future energy mix as existing nuclear plants are phased out. The recent intermittency of wind power has also made the case in ministers' minds for an ""always on"" part of the energy supply, our business editor adds. Together, Hinkley and Sizewell C are expected to produce 14% of the UK's current electricity needs, but they are unlikely to be operational until the late 2030s. The new funding plan has been greeted with dismay by campaigners against the proposed plant. Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C described it as ""a desperate measure to attract investment"" for ""a project so toxic that no one wants to pay for it"". She added: ""Compared to other energy solutions, Sizewell C is an expensive distraction - too damaging, too slow for our climate emergency and with serious question marks over its reactor technology.""

"Attenborough in 'act now' warning over climate""If we don't act now, it'll be too late,"" warns Sir David Attenborough ahead of the COP26 climate summit.Science & Environment","This video can not be played The BBC goes behind the scenes with Sir David Attenborough on the set of his new documentary, The Green Planet ""If we don't act now, it'll be too late."" That's the warning from Sir David Attenborough ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. The broadcaster says the richest nations have ""a moral responsibility"" to help the world's poorest. And it would be ""really catastrophic"" if we ignored their problems, he told me in a BBC News interview. ""Every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted,"" he said. Sir David and I were speaking at Kew Gardens in London during filming for a new landmark series, The Green Planet, to be aired on BBC1 next year. Attenborough warns leaders over extinction crisis Greta Thunberg to march at Glasgow climate protest Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plastic Our conversation ranged from the latest climate science to the importance of COP26 to the pace of his working life. The UN climate science panel recently concluded that it is ""unequivocal"" that human activity is driving up global temperatures. And Sir David said that proved that he and others had not been making ""a fuss about nothing"", and that the risks of a hotter world are real. Extreme weather such as drought will increase as the world gets warmer ""What climate scientists have been saying for 20 years, and that we have been reporting upon, you and I both, is the case - we were not causing false alarms. ""And every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted. And things are being made worse"". But he said the report had not convinced everyone and that they are acting as a brake on efforts to tackle climate change. ""There are still people in North America, there are still people in Australia who say 'no, no, no, no, of course it's very unfortunate that there was that forest fire that absolutely demolished, incinerated that village, but it's a one-off'. ""Particularly if it's going to cost money in the short term, the temptation is to deny the problem and pretend it's not there. ""But every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects."" His call for an urgent response reflects the latest scientific assessment that to avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures, global carbon emissions need to be halved no later than 2030. That's why the coming years are described as ""the decisive decade"" and why the COP26 talks are so crucial for getting the world on a safer path now. As things stand, emissions are projected to continue rising rather than starting to fall, and Sir David was sounding more exasperated than I've heard before. ""If we don't act now, it will be too late,"" he said. ""We have to do it now."" We turned to the question of responsibility, a highly contentious issue which will loom large at the conference. Developing countries have for years accused the richest nations, which were the first to start polluting the atmosphere, of failing to shoulder their share of the burden. The argument is that they should be making the deepest cuts in carbon emissions and providing help to those who need it most.  A long-standing promise of $100bn a year for low carbon development and to build stronger defences against more violent weather has yet to be fulfilled - reaching that total will be a key test of whether COP26 succeeds or fails. Bangladesh, on the UN's list of Least Developed Countries, is battling river erosion due to climate change For Sir David, this is one of the most worrying challenges, and he says it would be ""really catastrophic"" if threats to the poorest nations were ignored. ""Whole parts of Africa are likely to be unliveable - people will simply have to move away because of the advancing deserts and increasing heat, and where will they go? Well, a lot of them will try to get into Europe. ""Do we say, 'Oh, it's nothing to do with us' and cross our arms? ""We caused it - our kind of industrialisation is one of the major factors in producing this change in climate. So we have a moral responsibility. ""Even if we didn't cause it, we would have a moral responsibility to do something about thousands of men, women and children who've lost everything, everything. Can we just say goodbye and say this is no business of ours?"" Finally I asked about his own hectic workload at the age of 95 - from filming documentaries to addressing the G7 summit, the UN Security Council and the Duke of Cambridge's Earthshot Prize. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Six ways the UK could tackle climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change ""I don't plan very far ahead - as you say, I'm 95. How long can you go on? It isn't within our gift to say those things or to know those things. ""All I know is that if I get up tomorrow and I feel that I'm able to do a decent day's work, then I shall jolly well do it and be grateful. ""And the day is going to come when I'm going to get out of bed and say, I don't think I can do that. When that's going to be, who knows? I don't."" Having watched him filming for five hours straight, and remaining not only focused but also good-humoured, I suggested that he still loved what he was doing. ""At the moment, I feel it would be a waste of an opportunity just to back out and not do the things I think are very important to do in which I am well placed to do."" And the next major engagement in the Attenborough diary? Nothing less than speaking, virtually or in-person, to what's set to be the largest ever gathering of global leaders on British soil: COP26, in a few days' time.

Figures published on Tuesday showed a rate of 719.9 cases for every 100,000 people over the last seven days. The number of Covid cases in Wales remains the highest infection rate of all the UK nations. But one of the heads of Public Health Wales said he felt the levels of infection were beginning to slow. ""We are looking at fairly high rates compared to other times in the pandemic response,"" accepted Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, who is the national director of health protection at PHW. ""But I feel that we are plateauing."" He said the daily number of cases in Wales stood between 2,500 and 3,000 new infections. Dr Khaw said all the models looking at the latest wave of Covid suggested it would begin to fall in the near future, despite the current high levels. ""I am confident that over the coming weeks we will start seeing a drop,"" he told BBC Wales. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales It follows a warning that some people arebehaving as if the Covid pandemic is over - ignoring Wales' face mask laws and not social distancing. School-age students are showing the highest levels of Covid, says PHW The latest number of positive cases reported by Public Health Wales (PHW) was 5,228 between Friday morning and Monday morning. A further 31 deaths with Covid-19 have also been recorded, with 6,117 people dying with the virus since the start of the pandemic in Wales, according to PHW figures. The health body said due to a technical issue reporting figures on Tuesday, not all cases of Covid reported in Wales in the last 72 hours had been flagged as new, and it was likely there had been about 8,000 actual new cases over the period. Dr Khaw said the highest levels of Covid transmission were being seen among young adults and children in Wales. He also said the rate of hospital admissions from Covid was increasing, and was being carefully monitored to ensure it was not down to new variants of the disease. But he stressed there was ""no evidence"" that a new ""variant of concern"" was in circulation in Wales at the moment. The highest infection rate is in Blaenau Gwent, at just under 1,330 cases per 100,000 over the last seven days. Neighbouring counties in the Aneurin Bevan health board area also share high levels of Covid, with both Torfaen and Caerphilly nudging over the 1,000 infection rate. Wrexham has Wales' lowest rate, at 368.5 cases per 100,000 people. Covid passes were introduced across Wales at the start of October for nightclubs and large events First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was ""right to be concerned"" about the current Covid rates. ""There is far too much coronavirus circulating in the community"", he said. The Welsh government will announce its latest response to the pandemic on Friday, as part of a three-week review. But ministers have said they were not considering moving into ""Covid Urgent"" - where social and business restrictions could be reintroduced. However, Mr Drakeford added that if numbers continued to rise ""we would all have to be asking ourselves serious questions about what we would need to do to bring numbers of that sort back under control"". Health Minister Eluned Morgan has already indicated they will considerwhether the Covid Pass schemeintroduced at the start of October should be widened.

Teachers' fair employment law exemption 'outdated'The exemption allows schools to use religious background in deciding who to recruit to teaching posts.Northern Ireland,"The union says every teacher should be able to apply for work in any school regardless of their religion The exemption of teachers in Northern Ireland from fair employment legislation ""is outdated and needs to be removed"", according to a union. A number of MLAs and the former first minister, Arlene Foster,have previously criticised that exemption. The teaching union, the NASUWT, is the latest to call for the exemption to be scrapped. The recruitment of teachers is exempt from legislation outlawing religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. The NASUWT said removing the exemption would ""tackle endemic nepotism and lack of diversity in the teaching profession."" The union is to present a motion to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) conference in Belfast on Tuesday. It calls for the backing of the wider trade union movement for the exemption to be removed. ""The practical effect of this is that it is not currently unlawful to discriminate against someone in an appointment process on the basis of their religious belief,"" the NASUWT said. In 1976,the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Ac,externalt exempted teachers and clergy as ""the essential nature of the job requires it be done by a person holding, or not holding, a particular religious belief"". That was maintained in the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998. The exemption allows schools to use religious background or belief in deciding who to recruit to teaching posts. It also means schools have no legal obligation to monitor the community background of their teaching staff. Teacher fair employment exemption 'needs addressed' Women teachers affected by need for RE certificate In 2004, the Equality Commission investigated the exemption and found ""the exception of teachers from the religious discrimination provisions is widely accepted, and the support for change is a minority view"". According to the Equality Commission, there were concerns from the Catholic church at the time that ending it would lead to Catholic schools losing their religious ethos and becoming non-denominational. There were also concerns from the Protestant churches that Protestant teachers would be disadvantaged because of the need for teachers in Catholic primary schools tohave a certificate in religious education. The commission did recommend scrapping the exemption for post-primary schools but no changes to the law were subsequently made. Geraldine McGahey, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said: ""It definitely should go from post-primary schools and, in primary schools, we think there should be a concerted effort to find a way to remove from that as well."" The recruitment of teachers in Northern Ireland is exempt from legislation outlawing religious discrimination In recent years a number of assembly members have been critical of the recruitment of teachers being exempt from fair employment laws. In 2019, research from the Unesco Education centre at Ulster University (UU) alsosuggested it contributed to relatively few teachers from a Protestant background teaching in Catholic maintained schools, and vice-versa. The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) said it was ""actively considering its position on the issue"". But CCMS added it believed the exemption ""should remain in place until such time as any proposals for its repeal can be demonstrated to give complete confidence to the future of, in our case, Catholic education"". The NASUWT's Northern Ireland official Justin McCamphill said the exemption was ""outdated and needs to be removed"". ""We are calling on the first and deputy first minister to remove this and ensure that every teacher has equality of opportunity and is able to apply for work in any school regardless of their religion or perceived community background,"" he said. The leaders of the five main political parties in Northern Ireland are also expected to speak at the ICTU conference at the Waterfront Hall on Tuesday.

Her Majesty's Treasury said the funding will build on the British Business Bank's existing programmes to help SMEs to invest and grow. It will provide loans or invest in local companies. The way in which businesses can access the fund will be outlined in due course.

Japan princess in muted wedding after controversyShe will lose her royal status and has declined a $1.3m payment for leaving the family.,"The couple spoke at a press conference on Tuesday Japan's Princess Mako has married her college sweetheart Kei Komuro - thus losing her royal status. Under Japanese law, female imperial family members forfeit their status upon marriage to a ""commoner"" although male members do not. She also skipped the usual rites of a royal wedding and turned down a payment offered to royal females upon their departure from the family. She is the first female member of the royal family to decline both. The woman who gave up royal status to marry The couple are expected to move to the US - where Mr Komuro works as a lawyer - after marriage. The move has drawn inevitable comparisons with British royals Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, earning the newlyweds the nickname ""Japan's Harry and Meghan"". Like Ms Markle, Mr Komuro has come under intense scrutiny since his relationship with Ms Mako was announced. He was most recently criticised for sporting a ponytail when he returned to Japan. Some tabloid newspapers and social media users felt his hairstyle - seen as unconventional in Japan - was unbecoming of someone set to marry a princess. There was also a protest on Tuesday against the couple's marriage. In a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Mako said she apologised for any trouble brought to people by her marriage. ""I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused and I am grateful for those... who have continued to support me,"" she said, according to an NHK report. ""For me, Kei is irreplaceable - marriage was a necessary choice for us."" Mr Komuro added that he loved Ms Mako and wanted to spend his life with her. ""I love Mako. We only get one life, and I want us to spend it with the one we love,"" said Mr Komuro according to an AFP report.  ""I feel very sad that Mako has been in a bad condition, mentally and physically, because of the false accusations."" Princess Mako left her Tokyo residence at around 10:00 local time on Tuesday (01:00 GMT) to register her marriage, bowing several times to her parents, Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko. She also hugged her younger sister before she left, news outlet Kyodo reported. There has been excessive media coverage around the couple over the years, which has caused the princess to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) had earlier said. Her relationship has been met with controversy in the country. On Tuesday, people were pictured protesting against the marriage in a Japanese park. Many slogans appeared to bring up financial issues around Mr Komuro's family - specifically his mother. The former princess got engaged to Mr Komuro in 2017 and the two were set to wed the following year. But the marriage was delayed following claims Mr Komuro's mother had financial problems - she had reportedly taken a loan from her ex-fiancÃ© and not paid him back. The palace denied the delay was linked to this, though Crown Prince Fumihito said it was important for the money issues to be dealt with before the couple got married. According to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, the real reason for the animosity towards Mr Komuro seems to be among some conservative Japanese who believe he is not a worthy partner for a niece of the emperor. Mr Komuro - who has received a job offer from a top New York law firm - comes from humble origins, and local tabloids have spent years digging dirt on his family, including the allegations against his mother. The reaction to Princess Mako and Kei Komuro's relationship by some media and people in Japan, has highlighted the pressure women in Japan's imperial family face. The Imperial Household Agency has said Princess Mako suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the harsh criticism from the media and on social media around her engagement since it was announced nearly four years ago. She is not the first woman in the Japanese royal family to be affected this way. Her grandmother Empress Emerita Michiko temporarily lost her voice nearly 20 years ago when criticised by the media as being somehow unfit to be the Emperor's wife. Her aunt-in-law Empress Masako, suffered depression after she was blamed for failing to produce a male heir. Royal women have been forced to strictly adhere to certain expectations - they must be supportive of their husbands, produce an heir, and be a guardian of Japan's traditions. If they fall short they are savagely criticised. This is also true of Princess Mako, who said she would give up her royal status. But even that has not been enough to stop the attacks on her, her husband, and their marriage. Read this story in Japanesehere.

Premier Inn owner warns of staff shortagesWhitbread is paying millions in wage rises and bonuses to try to combat persistent shortages.,"Premier Inn owner Whitbread has said it will pay millions in wage rises and bonuses to try to combat what it calls persistent staff shortages. The chain said hospitality-wide labour shortages meant a ""material number of vacancies"" remained unfilled. Higher pay rates will cost Whitbread Â£12m-Â£13m, it said, while it is also paying Â£10m in retention bonuses. Recent official figures show vacancies at a record, with hospitality seeing some of the biggest shortages. The Office for National Statistics said vacancies reached 1.1 million between July and September, the highest level since records began in 2001. The Institute for Employment Studies said this month that labour shortages were affecting the whole economy. Many firms are being forced to pay signing on bonuses, or raise pay rates to tempt staff to work for them. Staff costs are among a host of price pressures facing businesses and Whitbread also pointed to rising utility costs. However, the company said its recovery in recent months had been better than expected, and UK demand had been ""very strong"" since 17 May when Covid restrictions were eased to allow leisure overnight stays at its hotels. It added that it now expects revenue-per-room rates to return to pre-pandemic levels next year. At the start of this month Whitbread announced a pay increase for its UK-based hourly-paid staff. It needs to add 2,000 staff to its current head count of 30,000, including in housekeeping, reception and kitchens. Chief executive Alison Brittain said: ""Whitbread traded significantly ahead of the market in the UK during the first half of the year. ""The operating environment during the summer and into autumn has been challenging largely as a result of our very high occupancy levels, market-wide supply chain issues and a tighter labour supply in the hospitality sector."" Its revenue remains 39% down on the same period pre-pandemic two years ago, but it has more than doubled since last year. Pre-tax losses in the first half of the year narrowed from Â£724.7m last year to Â£19.3m, but this was still well down on the profit of Â£219.9m made before the pandemic.

Afghans press UK over resettlement scheme,"This video can not be played Chaotic scenes at Kabul airport as people try desperately to flee Afghans, including former officials and activists, are calling on the UK government to announce when its new resettlement scheme will open. Many fearful for their safety under the Taliban regime say they are worried for their lives while they wait to find out if they are eligible to come to the UK. One man currently in hiding in the country told the BBC: ""The more we wait the more in danger we are."" Minister Victoria Atkins told MPs the scheme was not being paused. The Home Office minister said: ""While we appreciate the need to act quickly it is also important that we do this properly and ensure any scheme meets the needs of those it is being set up to support."" Meanwhile, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has written to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to raise ""serious concerns"", saying that months after the official evacuation ended thousands of people are still stranded in Afghanistan. Ms Truss faces questions from MPs in Parliament on Tuesday, the first time in her new role. The government announced a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) on 18 August, and committed to re-house 5,000 vulnerable Afghans in the UK in the first year, and 20,000 in the coming years. It is not yet open. That scheme is separate to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) that launched on 1 April to resettle people who worked for the UK in Afghanistan. Resettling Afghans in UK will take time - Patel Afghan refugees: Those who worked for UK can stay permanently The BBC has spoken to Afghans who are waiting to find out if they will be eligible for the scheme, one who talks about his family home being raided by the Taliban, and another who reports family members being threatened. All their names have been changed to protect their anonymity. Mohammed, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, is an alumnus of the Chevening scholarship scheme, the government programme that funds masters degrees at UK universities for foreign students with leadership potential. In August, he and other Chevening alumni were told they - and current scholars - would be a priority for the first wave of evacuations and provided the UK government with their details. But they are not sure if they will be eligible for the new ACRS scheme. He told the BBC: ""The fact that it has taken so long is one concern, but the fact we don't even know if we will be considered for the scheme is a bigger concern for us."" He fears that ""the more we wait the more in danger we are, the more risk we face"" and worries that because Chevening scholars and alumni were previously prioritised for evacuation they have been identified as a group with a strong affiliation to the UK. ""It's been more than a month now that I and many other Chevening alumni like me are hiding in our houses and we are fearing persecution if we step out. ""We are trying to limit our interactions - we have had very limited interaction with our friends and relatives."" He added that if ""you go out and you talk to someone and they find you - it's over for you"". ""If I stay here - that's the end of life. I can't go out, I can't get a job, I can't work, study - nothing at all. That's something to think about later. Right now - it's our lives that are in danger."" Aminais also a Chevening alumni and feels particularly at risk from the Taliban because of her work as a women's rights campaigner and because she is from the Hazara community - an ethnic group who have been persecuted. ""The thing that makes me really worried is that they know about my identity, my background in Afghanistan, and my work experience. I'm a Chevening scholar alumni, before I was a women's rights advocate."" Amina was contacted by the Home Office in the summer - identified as an individual at risk - and provided them with all the details of her and her dependents. But she says she hasn't heard back from the UK government since mid-August. Ahmadworked for the Afghan government security services and is currently hiding in Afghanistan. He shared videos with BBC News that show his family home after being raided by the Taliban. He received an email on 20 August from the Foreign Office asking for his details but he has not heard from them since. ""On the fourth day of the Taliban in Kabul, we left our home and hid in a safe and secret place since then because my mother was also an adviser to the intelligence service department of Afghanistan."" He said his ""main fear"" is that the Taliban will arrest, torture or kill former government employees. A Taliban fighter stands guard at the market in Kabul Alialso worked for the Afghan government and gave his details to the Home Office one and a half months before leaving Afghanistan but had no response. After Kabul fell to the Taliban he fled to a third country, gave the Home Office his details, and was told he was a priority for evacuation - but has not had contact since. His family are still in Afghanistan and he says they have been threatened by the Taliban. ""Every single, or every two days, they are going to our offices, to our homes to find us or to find one of our family members. Every single day I worry about their lives, about their security. ""I fought many years against the Taliban - it was also about ISIS, al-Qaeda who were a big worry for Afghanistan and a big worry for the world. ""The world did not remain a good soldier and a good friend to Afghanistan. Especially to people like me who were in the frontline and who were defending the world from terrorism."" Ms Nandy said: ""Many of them [Afghans waiting to hear] are people who helped us, British nationals, or the dependents of those who helped us - who are now being targeted by the Taliban and in some cases hunted door to door,"" she said. She said when Parliament was recalled in August the ""only concrete commitment"" the prime minister and former foreign secretary Dominic Raab made was ""to respond to every email from members of parliament raising urgent cases of people who were stranded in Afghanistan"". She said: ""They promised to do that by the beginning of September, that promise was not met, now the Foreign Office is writing to MPs asking them not to raise cases any more and signposting them to a scheme run by the Home Office that isn't even open yet."" She has written to the new foreign secretary to ask her to ""get a grip on the mess that she was left when she took office"". Foreign Affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat said: ""Those who stood with us now need us to stand with them but every day of delay costs lives. We've been pressing the government for clarity urgently to protect our friends and their families."" In the Commons, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said Afghans who had arrived in the UK were ""desperately"" looking for information on how the ACRS was going to work to help family members join them. And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas told the BBC that when she told the Foreign Office about British nationals still stranded she was met with ""deafening silence"". ""Of the seven British nationals I have been in contact with who are still in Afghanistan, none of them according to the responses I've received, were actually registered with the FCDO as being British nationals stranded in Afghanistan,"" she said. ""This is despite me sending multiple messages to the FCDO and Home Office, and most of the British nationals also making enquiries directly themselves to the FCDO contact points in the public domain."" One former ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Nick Kay, said he has ""daily"" requests from Afghans in hiding ""in very perilous situations"" asking for help: ""At the moment all I can do is point them towards the Home Office website for the ACRS. ""Very high up on the screen there is the simple statement that 'this scheme is not yet operational'. ""There is no date for when they can apply. And there is no clarity for the criteria there will be for the scheme. ""So really I feel frustrated but, more than that, these Afghans feel incredibly at risk, their lives have been turned upside down, they would just like some clarity from the UK government, a clear timeframe and some action rather than just the words.""

Australia vows to reach net zero carbon emissions,"This video can not be played PM Scott Morrison sets out ""a uniquely Australian way"" of meeting climate commitments Leading global coal and gas supplier Australia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Scott Morrison however said the plan would not include ending Australia's fossil fuel sectors. The nation will also not set ambitious targets for 2030 - an objective of next month's COP26 global climate summit. His plan has drawn criticism, with Murdoch University fire ecology expert Joe Fontaine saying it had ""all the strength of a wet paper bag"". Australia has long dragged its heels on climate action. It has some of the highest emissions per head of population and is a massive exporter of fossil fuels. Strategic allies the US and UK have both pledged to cut emissions faster. The UK has pledged thatall its electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035, while theUS has announced plans to halve its emissions by 2030,externalcompared to 2005 levels. ""We won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It's about getting it done,"" Mr Morrison wrote in a newspaper column on Tuesday. To halt the worst effects of climate change, nations have pledged to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C by 2050. This requires cutting emissions by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050, scientists say. Over 100 nations have committed to carbon neutrality. Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures, such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology. Mr Morrison announced an investment of more than A$20bn (Â£11bn; $15bn) in ""low-emissions technologies"" over the next 20 years - such as efforts to capture carbon in soil, lower solar energy costs, and developing greener industries. But Australia will also use more gas, at least in the short term. Most controversially, there is no plan to limit fossil fuels. ""We want our heavy industries, like mining, to stay open, remain competitive and adapt, so they remain viable for as long as global demand allows,"" Mr Morrison wrote. Australia's 2030 commitment will remain a 26% cut on 2005 emissions. It is currently on track for a 30-35% reduction, the government said. Why Australia refuses to give up coal Climate action is still hotly contested in Australia While the 2050 pledge has been widely welcomed, the government has been ferociously criticised for not offering more details. Australia's Climate Council think tank said it was ""a joke without strong emissions cuts this decade"". Many said the government has been too slow on climate action, despite seeing first-hand impacts such as bushfires, floods and drought. ""The word plan doesn't constitute a plan no matter how many times you say it,"" said Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese. Scott Morrison's announcement is worth noting not because it offers anything different to other countries, but because of how late to the party Australia is! This announcement took months of political wrangling and was left down to the wire with days before the COP26 summit in Glasgow. That the government had to make political concessions to its junior coalition partner - the National Party - shows you how complicated and politically divisive climate action is in Australia. The Nationals represent electorates in regional areas where most high-emission industries like coal mining are based. After days of toing and froing, they backed the 'process'. The prime minister assured Australians the target will not mean paying more for their energy bills. ""Technology not taxes,"" he said. He addressed regional Australians directly and said the plan won't involve shutting down coal and gas production or exports. He talked about billions of dollars invested in low-emission technologies. The government's plan would ""strike a balance"", Mr Morrison said. But he failed to explain how this balance will be struck. How the government will square keeping its coal industry, for example, and reaching net zero by 2050 - and what role technology will play in all of that. Especially when Canberra won't budge on its much-criticised 2030 targets. While this is a big moment for Australia, the details are still murky and potentially problematic on how net zero will be achieved. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Premier Inn owner warns of staff shortages,"Premier Inn owner Whitbread has said it will pay millions in wage rises and bonuses to try to combat what it calls persistent staff shortages. The chain said hospitality-wide labour shortages meant a ""material number of vacancies"" remained unfilled. Higher pay rates will cost Whitbread Â£12m-Â£13m, it said, while it is also paying Â£10m in retention bonuses. Recent official figures show vacancies at a record, with hospitality seeing some of the biggest shortages. The Office for National Statistics said vacancies reached 1.1 million between July and September, the highest level since records began in 2001. The Institute for Employment Studies said this month that labour shortages were affecting the whole economy. Many firms are being forced to pay signing on bonuses, or raise pay rates to tempt staff to work for them. Staff costs are among a host of price pressures facing businesses and Whitbread also pointed to rising utility costs. However, the company said its recovery in recent months had been better than expected, and UK demand had been ""very strong"" since 17 May when Covid restrictions were eased to allow leisure overnight stays at its hotels. It added that it now expects revenue-per-room rates to return to pre-pandemic levels next year. At the start of this month Whitbread announced a pay increase for its UK-based hourly-paid staff. It needs to add 2,000 staff to its current head count of 30,000, including in housekeeping, reception and kitchens. Chief executive Alison Brittain said: ""Whitbread traded significantly ahead of the market in the UK during the first half of the year. ""The operating environment during the summer and into autumn has been challenging largely as a result of our very high occupancy levels, market-wide supply chain issues and a tighter labour supply in the hospitality sector."" Its revenue remains 39% down on the same period pre-pandemic two years ago, but it has more than doubled since last year. Pre-tax losses in the first half of the year narrowed from Â£724.7m last year to Â£19.3m, but this was still well down on the profit of Â£219.9m made before the pandemic.

Today's updates were written by Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin and Becky Morton and the page has been edited by Hamish Mackay, George Bowden and James Clarke. As we wrap up the coronavirus live page for the day, here's a round-up of the main coronavirus developments so far : Cumbria's director of public healthis urging the government to bring in its Plan B measures for tackling Covid in England, including mandatory face masks in some public places. Colin Cox tells BBC Radio Cumbria: ""It seems to me we've been at a level of infection for quite some time that has been much higher than we would have accepted before, and we're accepting a higher rate of infection because it is not translating into a massive rate of hospitalisations and deaths."" However, he adds that there are more than 60 people currently in hospital with Covid in Cumbria, which ""still adds very substantially to the burden on the NHS"". The NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association are among the groups to have called for some restrictions to be reintroduced in England, amid rising cases. But the government has said the data does not suggest ""immediately moving to Plan B"". Read more: What is Plan B? A student from Liverpool who took up care work during the coronavirus pandemic has decided to don scrubs instead of dancing shoes in a change of career. Paul Wilson, a dance graduate from Edge Hill University, worked in a home during the lockdowns to help fund his degree. ""I quickly realised I had a massive passion and love for the profession. Nothing gave me the satisfaction I get from care,"" Paul says. This video can not be played Liverpool dancer takes up nursing after Covid care work The number of dental treatments carried out in Scotland last year fell to just a quarter of the figure for the previous 12 months, according to the latest official figures. Public Health Scotland says Covid restrictions led to a drop of about 3.5 million dental treatments - a 76.4% fall. Dentistry was badly hit by the first national lockdown in March 2020, which resulted in practices being told to suspend all treatments. Urgent dental centres were then set up in every health board area to provide emergency care for those who needed it. Restrictions have since been eased but the British Dental Association says it is dealing with an ""unprecedented backlog"". Read more. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Three quarters of the 1.4 billion people in China have been fully vaccinated Although anti-vax movements have appeared in many countries such as the US and the UK in recent months â and concerns have been highlighted about
dangerous misinformation linked to many such groups â there has been notably
little to suggest any sort of similar attitude in China. However, Hong Kongâs South China Morning Post says it has
interviewed people in China who are sceptical about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines in the country. It interviews a Beijing travel agent called Jessica Xu
who says: âI feel I need more time and evidence to show the vaccines are safe
and effective for me to take it.â The paper says Ms Xu has âadvised her parents
not to eitherâ. SCMP also interviews a Beijing-based officer manager, Sun Zhaoyun,
who says: ""I feel vaccination makes little difference."" Sun tells the paper: âI am less worried about getting Covid-19
without vaccination than about being judged and mocked for not being
inoculated.â Official media have said this week that 75% of Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated. Vaccination is actively encouraged in China, where the media environment is overwhelmingly state controlled, meaning it delivers a shared message. Anti-vax attitudes are largely presented as a Western phenomenon due to societal divisions. However, it is not mandatory and discouraged among people with certain medical conditions, or with flu and cold symptoms. Regardless, the governments of urban Chinese communities have stressed vaccination is important âto strengthen the immunity barrier of the whole populationâ. Some local governments have moved to restrict the non-vaccinated from venues where large groups of people might congregate, but there have been divisive attitudes from specialists in the country towards this. Kathryn StanczyszynPolitical Reporter, BBC Radio WM Birmingham's director of public health says plans to open Covid vaccination centres to 12 to 15-year-olds have been taking longer than expected as sites had to be made safe following anti-vaccination protests. Dr Justin Varney says: ""There have been some issues around anti-vaxxers - aggression and abuse of staff at vaccination sites. ""Yesterday when I had my booster I was hearing from the pharmacy where they had people coming in and being quite aggressive to them and that's disgraceful."" Dr Justin Varney said new sites were opening up every day He says the council has to ensure sites, particularly those visited by children, ""aren't environments where they can get hassled or abused by anti-vaxxers and that's what is taking a bit of time but there are sites opening up every day"". He urges people to look for centreson the NHS website,external. Children aged 12 to 15 in England are being offered the vaccine outside schools inbid to get more vaccinated. Dr Varney says the latest Covid-19 case rate in the city was 310 cases per 100,000 people, which is about an 8% rise from the previous seven days. Some 86.5% of the UK population aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 79.3% have had two doses. Another 37,809 people have had a first dose and a further 21,446 have had a second dose. The UK has recorded another 263 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure since 3 March. Figures for daily deaths tend to be higher on a Tuesday because of recording delays over the weekend. Due to technical issues, today's figures also include deaths and cases in Wales covering a 72-hour period. However, the total number of deaths recorded over the past seven days is up 7.8% on the previous week Another 40,954 cases have also been recorded - a slight rise on yesterday's figure of 36,567. Before today, cases had fallen for four days in a row. The total number of cases recorded over the past seven days is down slightly - by 0.4% - on the previous week. Workers hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, official figures show. Employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work saw the sharpest dip and recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics. Construction and manufacturing were among the sectors to see sharp rises in pay. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls from unions to give public sector workers a significant rise whena freeze on pay is lifted. Read more. COP26 will ""inevitably"" pose a risk of transmission of Covid-19,  Nicola Sturgeon has told Scottish Politicians. But the First Minister tells MSPs work has been done by the Scottish Government and United Nations to mitigate the effects of the climate conference. Sturgeon says: ""The hosting of COP26 would always have been a significant challenge for the UK and Scottish governments and Glasgow City Council. ""However, the fact it is happening amidst the global pandemic makes it even more so. ""It is inevitably the case that it poses a risk of increased Covid transmission."" Most delegates at the climate conference will be double vaccinated, those from outside the common travel area will have to show proof of a negative test and those on thetravel red list,externalwill have to stay in managed quarantine. Those in the conference's ""blue zone"" will have to carry out daily lateral flow testing and follow hygiene mitigations. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy expressed by football star Joshua Kimmich has caused concern among German experts. The Bayern Munich midfielder has confirmed reports he is yet to have a jab over worries about their long term safety. However, he insists he is not a ""Covid denier or an anti-vaxxer"" and argues it's a personal decision. ""There is a very good chance that I will still get vaccinated,"" the 26-year-old adds. Thomas Mertens, the head of Germany's expert panel on vaccine use, says several studies have shown long-term side effects ""do not exist, or are an extreme rarity"". ""Joshua Kimmich is certainly a recognised expert on football issues, but not an expert on vaccination,"" he says. Bayern Munich has expressed support for vaccines and advised players and staff to get them, but CEO Oliver Kahn explained the club respects players who have a ""different opinion"". International travellers coming to Scotland will be able to take a cheaper lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on the second day after their arrival, Nicola Sturgeon says. Arrivals who are double vaccinated and travelling from countries not on the red list will be eligible to take a lateral flow test. The first minister says the change will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday and lateral flow tests are expected to cost between Â£20 and Â£30. It will bring Scotland into line with England, which brought in the change on Sunday, while Wales will introduce the same changes from 31 October. All 12 to 15-year-olds in Scotland have had a Covid vaccination appointment scheduled, Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells MSPs 53% of this age group have had their first dose. ""I can confirm that everyone in that age group has now had an appointment scheduled and should have received a letter telling them about that,"" she says. She encourages children and their parents to read the online information so they can make an informed decision about getting the vaccine. A committee in Brazil's senate is meeting to decide whether to approve a damning report into the government's handling of the pandemic. It  recommends President Jair Bolsonaro face nine criminal charges, including crimes against humanity, misusing public funds and peddling fake news. The report, presented in the Senate last week, follows a six-month inquiry into scandals and corruption in Brazil. President Bolsonaro says he is ""guilty of absolutely nothing"" and his government ""did the right thing from the first moment"". More than 600,000 people in Brazil have died from Covid - the second highest death toll worldwide, after the USA. Read morehere. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says no changes will be made to the Covid mitigations in place there - including rules around face masks. She tells MSPs while Scotland's situation has ""greatly improved"" since August, it ""remains fragile"" heading into winter months and she cannot ignore that cases are ""creeping up"". However, she points out that since August, cases have declined quickly without the need for further restrictions, which suggests that factors including the vaccination programme have been able to stem the Delta variant. She adds that Scotland currently has the lowest case rate of the four UK nations. Earlier, we heard from Prof Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser to the Department of Health, who told MPs that officials were considering moving away from testing people without Covid symptoms - but said the government was committed to asymptomatic testing until at least January. Prof Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, has also been asked about the issue when speaking to the Commons Science and Technology Committee. He says widespread testing in schools is ""very disruptive"" due to individual children being forced to isolate after testing positive and families taking children out of school because of a positive case. ""I think probably we need to move in the pandemic,
over this winter, maybe towards the end of the winter to a completely different
system of clinically-driven testing,"" he says. ""In other words, testing people who are unwell
rather than having regular testing of those people who are well."" Across the UK, all school staff and secondary school pupils are currently asked to do regular lateral flow tests. A major study of long Covid plans to gather data from patients to forecast the people who might need treatment. All adults in Scotland who have tested positive for the virus, as well as a small number who were negative, will be asked to take part by text message. They will be encouraged to log their symptoms through an app. Long Covid has been describedas symptoms continuing for more than 12 weeks after infection, which cannot be explained by other causes. An estimated 79,000 people in Scotland are living with ""self-reported"" long Covid, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Read more about the new studyhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has begun offering booster vaccines A senior Chinese official has told media that by the end of the year, China aims to have provided two billion
vaccine doses to the world. Luo Zhaohui, the head of the China
International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), was speaking at a press
conference today hosted by Chinaâs State Council. According to the national Global Times
newspaper, he stated China has so far âprovided more than 1.5bn Covid-19
vaccine doses to 106 countries and four international organisations since the
beginning of this yearâ. There are aims to reach 2bn by the end of the year,
and also provide $100m to the international vaccine sharing scheme, Covax. State media have repeatedly stressed
that China has the capacity to produce 5bn vaccine doses annually. As the
country has a population of 1.4bn, in theory it only needs half of those.
However, booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities. Chinaâs National Health Commission
provides daily updates on the number of vaccines given domestically. Today's says 2.24bn doses have been administered to date on the mainland. It was reported in official media
yesterday that 1.06bn people âhave completed their vaccination against
Covid-19â - meaning they have received two vaccine doses. That means so far, at least 75% of
Chinaâs population have been fully vaccinated against the virus. Read more: Covid-19 vaccines: Has China made more than other countries combined?

The rate of cases in Wales remains the highest of all the UK nations but Dr Fu-Meng Khaw, national director of health protection at Public Health Wales, says rates appear to be ""plateauing"".

Japan princess in muted wedding after controversyShe will lose her royal status and has declined a $1.3m payment for leaving the family.Asia,"The couple spoke at a press conference on Tuesday Japan's Princess Mako has married her college sweetheart Kei Komuro - thus losing her royal status. Under Japanese law, female imperial family members forfeit their status upon marriage to a ""commoner"" although male members do not. She also skipped the usual rites of a royal wedding and turned down a payment offered to royal females upon their departure from the family. She is the first female member of the royal family to decline both. The woman who gave up royal status to marry The couple are expected to move to the US - where Mr Komuro works as a lawyer - after marriage. The move has drawn inevitable comparisons with British royals Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, earning the newlyweds the nickname ""Japan's Harry and Meghan"". Like Ms Markle, Mr Komuro has come under intense scrutiny since his relationship with Ms Mako was announced. He was most recently criticised for sporting a ponytail when he returned to Japan. Some tabloid newspapers and social media users felt his hairstyle - seen as unconventional in Japan - was unbecoming of someone set to marry a princess. There was also a protest on Tuesday against the couple's marriage. In a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Mako said she apologised for any trouble brought to people by her marriage. ""I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused and I am grateful for those... who have continued to support me,"" she said, according to an NHK report. ""For me, Kei is irreplaceable - marriage was a necessary choice for us."" Mr Komuro added that he loved Ms Mako and wanted to spend his life with her. ""I love Mako. We only get one life, and I want us to spend it with the one we love,"" said Mr Komuro according to an AFP report.  ""I feel very sad that Mako has been in a bad condition, mentally and physically, because of the false accusations."" Princess Mako left her Tokyo residence at around 10:00 local time on Tuesday (01:00 GMT) to register her marriage, bowing several times to her parents, Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko. She also hugged her younger sister before she left, news outlet Kyodo reported. There has been excessive media coverage around the couple over the years, which has caused the princess to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) had earlier said. Her relationship has been met with controversy in the country. On Tuesday, people were pictured protesting against the marriage in a Japanese park. Many slogans appeared to bring up financial issues around Mr Komuro's family - specifically his mother. The former princess got engaged to Mr Komuro in 2017 and the two were set to wed the following year. But the marriage was delayed following claims Mr Komuro's mother had financial problems - she had reportedly taken a loan from her ex-fiancÃ© and not paid him back. The palace denied the delay was linked to this, though Crown Prince Fumihito said it was important for the money issues to be dealt with before the couple got married. According to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, the real reason for the animosity towards Mr Komuro seems to be among some conservative Japanese who believe he is not a worthy partner for a niece of the emperor. Mr Komuro - who has received a job offer from a top New York law firm - comes from humble origins, and local tabloids have spent years digging dirt on his family, including the allegations against his mother. The reaction to Princess Mako and Kei Komuro's relationship by some media and people in Japan, has highlighted the pressure women in Japan's imperial family face. The Imperial Household Agency has said Princess Mako suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the harsh criticism from the media and on social media around her engagement since it was announced nearly four years ago. She is not the first woman in the Japanese royal family to be affected this way. Her grandmother Empress Emerita Michiko temporarily lost her voice nearly 20 years ago when criticised by the media as being somehow unfit to be the Emperor's wife. Her aunt-in-law Empress Masako, suffered depression after she was blamed for failing to produce a male heir. Royal women have been forced to strictly adhere to certain expectations - they must be supportive of their husbands, produce an heir, and be a guardian of Japan's traditions. If they fall short they are savagely criticised. This is also true of Princess Mako, who said she would give up her royal status. But even that has not been enough to stop the attacks on her, her husband, and their marriage. Read this story in Japanesehere.

Facebook earns $9bn despite whistleblower scandal,"Facebook has posted better-than-expected profits for the third quarter, as it continues to face bad press over leaked internal documents. The social media giant made $9bn (Â£6.5bn) of profit in the three months to September, up from $7.8bn last year. However, it was hit by a new privacy update to Apple's iOS 14 operating system, which made it harder for brands to target ads at specific users. It comes amid fresh claims of unethical behaviour made by a former employee. Frances Haugen has released a cache of internal documents to the public, alleging that Facebook put profit before user safety. Multiple media reports say the documents show Facebook struggled to moderate content that promoted hate speech and sex trafficking outside of the US. On Monday, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerburg told investors on a conference call: ""What we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company."" In the 12 months to 30 September, the social media giant said its monthly user-base had grown 6% to 2.91 billion. However, despite its strong profits, its revenue slightly undershot analyst expectations, amid ""headwinds"" caused by Apple's privacy rules. Facebook said the privacy update would also have an impact on its digital business in the final quarter of the year, but that it expected to adjust to the changes in time. The firm said it would spend some $10bn on its metaverse division this year - known as Facebook Reality Labs - which is tasked with creating augmented and virtual reality hardware, software and content. Facebook is making hate worse, whistleblower says Facebook under fire over secret teen research The world's largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices. This video can not be played Watch: Frances Haugen tells MPs that Facebook ""unquestionably"" makes hate worse The whistleblower documents, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have only intensified that pressure. They include internal research about Instagram's effects on teen mental health; whether Facebook's platforms stoke division; and the social media giant's handling of the 6 January Capitol riot. At a hearing on Monday, Ms Haugen told UK MPs that Facebook is ""unquestionably making hate worse"". She said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and that ""Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety"". The MPs are considering what new rules to impose on big social networks under the planned Online Safety Bill. But on his conference call, Mr Zuckerberg hit back: ""Good faith criticism helps us get better, but my view is that we are seeing a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company. ""The reality is that we have an open culture that encourages discussion and research on our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us."" Despite the allegations, shares in Facebook climbed by 1.3% in after hours trading on Monday. The firm's stock is up by about 20% so far this year.

"'The more we wait, the more in danger we are'","This video can not be played Chaotic scenes at Kabul airport as people try desperately to flee Afghans, including former officials and activists, are calling on the UK government to announce when its new resettlement scheme will open. Many fearful for their safety under the Taliban regime say they are worried for their lives while they wait to find out if they are eligible to come to the UK. One man currently in hiding in the country told the BBC: ""The more we wait the more in danger we are."" Minister Victoria Atkins told MPs the scheme was not being paused. The Home Office minister said: ""While we appreciate the need to act quickly it is also important that we do this properly and ensure any scheme meets the needs of those it is being set up to support."" Meanwhile, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has written to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to raise ""serious concerns"", saying that months after the official evacuation ended thousands of people are still stranded in Afghanistan. Ms Truss faces questions from MPs in Parliament on Tuesday, the first time in her new role. The government announced a new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) on 18 August, and committed to re-house 5,000 vulnerable Afghans in the UK in the first year, and 20,000 in the coming years. It is not yet open. That scheme is separate to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) that launched on 1 April to resettle people who worked for the UK in Afghanistan. Resettling Afghans in UK will take time - Patel Afghan refugees: Those who worked for UK can stay permanently The BBC has spoken to Afghans who are waiting to find out if they will be eligible for the scheme, one who talks about his family home being raided by the Taliban, and another who reports family members being threatened. All their names have been changed to protect their anonymity. Mohammed, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, is an alumnus of the Chevening scholarship scheme, the government programme that funds masters degrees at UK universities for foreign students with leadership potential. In August, he and other Chevening alumni were told they - and current scholars - would be a priority for the first wave of evacuations and provided the UK government with their details. But they are not sure if they will be eligible for the new ACRS scheme. He told the BBC: ""The fact that it has taken so long is one concern, but the fact we don't even know if we will be considered for the scheme is a bigger concern for us."" He fears that ""the more we wait the more in danger we are, the more risk we face"" and worries that because Chevening scholars and alumni were previously prioritised for evacuation they have been identified as a group with a strong affiliation to the UK. ""It's been more than a month now that I and many other Chevening alumni like me are hiding in our houses and we are fearing persecution if we step out. ""We are trying to limit our interactions - we have had very limited interaction with our friends and relatives."" He added that if ""you go out and you talk to someone and they find you - it's over for you"". ""If I stay here - that's the end of life. I can't go out, I can't get a job, I can't work, study - nothing at all. That's something to think about later. Right now - it's our lives that are in danger."" Aminais also a Chevening alumni and feels particularly at risk from the Taliban because of her work as a women's rights campaigner and because she is from the Hazara community - an ethnic group who have been persecuted. ""The thing that makes me really worried is that they know about my identity, my background in Afghanistan, and my work experience. I'm a Chevening scholar alumni, before I was a women's rights advocate."" Amina was contacted by the Home Office in the summer - identified as an individual at risk - and provided them with all the details of her and her dependents. But she says she hasn't heard back from the UK government since mid-August. Ahmadworked for the Afghan government security services and is currently hiding in Afghanistan. He shared videos with BBC News that show his family home after being raided by the Taliban. He received an email on 20 August from the Foreign Office asking for his details but he has not heard from them since. ""On the fourth day of the Taliban in Kabul, we left our home and hid in a safe and secret place since then because my mother was also an adviser to the intelligence service department of Afghanistan."" He said his ""main fear"" is that the Taliban will arrest, torture or kill former government employees. A Taliban fighter stands guard at the market in Kabul Alialso worked for the Afghan government and gave his details to the Home Office one and a half months before leaving Afghanistan but had no response. After Kabul fell to the Taliban he fled to a third country, gave the Home Office his details, and was told he was a priority for evacuation - but has not had contact since. His family are still in Afghanistan and he says they have been threatened by the Taliban. ""Every single, or every two days, they are going to our offices, to our homes to find us or to find one of our family members. Every single day I worry about their lives, about their security. ""I fought many years against the Taliban - it was also about ISIS, al-Qaeda who were a big worry for Afghanistan and a big worry for the world. ""The world did not remain a good soldier and a good friend to Afghanistan. Especially to people like me who were in the frontline and who were defending the world from terrorism."" Ms Nandy said: ""Many of them [Afghans waiting to hear] are people who helped us, British nationals, or the dependents of those who helped us - who are now being targeted by the Taliban and in some cases hunted door to door,"" she said. She said when Parliament was recalled in August the ""only concrete commitment"" the prime minister and former foreign secretary Dominic Raab made was ""to respond to every email from members of parliament raising urgent cases of people who were stranded in Afghanistan"". She said: ""They promised to do that by the beginning of September, that promise was not met, now the Foreign Office is writing to MPs asking them not to raise cases any more and signposting them to a scheme run by the Home Office that isn't even open yet."" She has written to the new foreign secretary to ask her to ""get a grip on the mess that she was left when she took office"". Foreign Affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat said: ""Those who stood with us now need us to stand with them but every day of delay costs lives. We've been pressing the government for clarity urgently to protect our friends and their families."" In the Commons, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said Afghans who had arrived in the UK were ""desperately"" looking for information on how the ACRS was going to work to help family members join them. And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas told the BBC that when she told the Foreign Office about British nationals still stranded she was met with ""deafening silence"". ""Of the seven British nationals I have been in contact with who are still in Afghanistan, none of them according to the responses I've received, were actually registered with the FCDO as being British nationals stranded in Afghanistan,"" she said. ""This is despite me sending multiple messages to the FCDO and Home Office, and most of the British nationals also making enquiries directly themselves to the FCDO contact points in the public domain."" One former ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Nick Kay, said he has ""daily"" requests from Afghans in hiding ""in very perilous situations"" asking for help: ""At the moment all I can do is point them towards the Home Office website for the ACRS. ""Very high up on the screen there is the simple statement that 'this scheme is not yet operational'. ""There is no date for when they can apply. And there is no clarity for the criteria there will be for the scheme. ""So really I feel frustrated but, more than that, these Afghans feel incredibly at risk, their lives have been turned upside down, they would just like some clarity from the UK government, a clear timeframe and some action rather than just the words.""

Climate-laggard Australia vows to reach net zero,"This video can not be played PM Scott Morrison sets out ""a uniquely Australian way"" of meeting climate commitments Leading global coal and gas supplier Australia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Scott Morrison however said the plan would not include ending Australia's fossil fuel sectors. The nation will also not set ambitious targets for 2030 - an objective of next month's COP26 global climate summit. His plan has drawn criticism, with Murdoch University fire ecology expert Joe Fontaine saying it had ""all the strength of a wet paper bag"". Australia has long dragged its heels on climate action. It has some of the highest emissions per head of population and is a massive exporter of fossil fuels. Strategic allies the US and UK have both pledged to cut emissions faster. The UK has pledged thatall its electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035, while theUS has announced plans to halve its emissions by 2030,externalcompared to 2005 levels. ""We won't be lectured by others who do not understand Australia. The Australian Way is all about how you do it, and not if you do it. It's about getting it done,"" Mr Morrison wrote in a newspaper column on Tuesday. To halt the worst effects of climate change, nations have pledged to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C by 2050. This requires cutting emissions by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050, scientists say. Over 100 nations have committed to carbon neutrality. Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures, such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology. Mr Morrison announced an investment of more than A$20bn (Â£11bn; $15bn) in ""low-emissions technologies"" over the next 20 years - such as efforts to capture carbon in soil, lower solar energy costs, and developing greener industries. But Australia will also use more gas, at least in the short term. Most controversially, there is no plan to limit fossil fuels. ""We want our heavy industries, like mining, to stay open, remain competitive and adapt, so they remain viable for as long as global demand allows,"" Mr Morrison wrote. Australia's 2030 commitment will remain a 26% cut on 2005 emissions. It is currently on track for a 30-35% reduction, the government said. Why Australia refuses to give up coal Climate action is still hotly contested in Australia While the 2050 pledge has been widely welcomed, the government has been ferociously criticised for not offering more details. Australia's Climate Council think tank said it was ""a joke without strong emissions cuts this decade"". Many said the government has been too slow on climate action, despite seeing first-hand impacts such as bushfires, floods and drought. ""The word plan doesn't constitute a plan no matter how many times you say it,"" said Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese. Scott Morrison's announcement is worth noting not because it offers anything different to other countries, but because of how late to the party Australia is! This announcement took months of political wrangling and was left down to the wire with days before the COP26 summit in Glasgow. That the government had to make political concessions to its junior coalition partner - the National Party - shows you how complicated and politically divisive climate action is in Australia. The Nationals represent electorates in regional areas where most high-emission industries like coal mining are based. After days of toing and froing, they backed the 'process'. The prime minister assured Australians the target will not mean paying more for their energy bills. ""Technology not taxes,"" he said. He addressed regional Australians directly and said the plan won't involve shutting down coal and gas production or exports. He talked about billions of dollars invested in low-emission technologies. The government's plan would ""strike a balance"", Mr Morrison said. But he failed to explain how this balance will be struck. How the government will square keeping its coal industry, for example, and reaching net zero by 2050 - and what role technology will play in all of that. Especially when Canberra won't budge on its much-criticised 2030 targets. While this is a big moment for Australia, the details are still murky and potentially problematic on how net zero will be achieved. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Japan's Princess Mako marries commoner boyfriend,"The couple spoke at a press conference on Tuesday Japan's Princess Mako has married her college sweetheart Kei Komuro - thus losing her royal status. Under Japanese law, female imperial family members forfeit their status upon marriage to a ""commoner"" although male members do not. She also skipped the usual rites of a royal wedding and turned down a payment offered to royal females upon their departure from the family. She is the first female member of the royal family to decline both. The woman who gave up royal status to marry The couple are expected to move to the US - where Mr Komuro works as a lawyer - after marriage. The move has drawn inevitable comparisons with British royals Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, earning the newlyweds the nickname ""Japan's Harry and Meghan"". Like Ms Markle, Mr Komuro has come under intense scrutiny since his relationship with Ms Mako was announced. He was most recently criticised for sporting a ponytail when he returned to Japan. Some tabloid newspapers and social media users felt his hairstyle - seen as unconventional in Japan - was unbecoming of someone set to marry a princess. There was also a protest on Tuesday against the couple's marriage. In a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Mako said she apologised for any trouble brought to people by her marriage. ""I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused and I am grateful for those... who have continued to support me,"" she said, according to an NHK report. ""For me, Kei is irreplaceable - marriage was a necessary choice for us."" Mr Komuro added that he loved Ms Mako and wanted to spend his life with her. ""I love Mako. We only get one life, and I want us to spend it with the one we love,"" said Mr Komuro according to an AFP report.  ""I feel very sad that Mako has been in a bad condition, mentally and physically, because of the false accusations."" Princess Mako left her Tokyo residence at around 10:00 local time on Tuesday (01:00 GMT) to register her marriage, bowing several times to her parents, Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko. She also hugged her younger sister before she left, news outlet Kyodo reported. There has been excessive media coverage around the couple over the years, which has caused the princess to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) had earlier said. Her relationship has been met with controversy in the country. On Tuesday, people were pictured protesting against the marriage in a Japanese park. Many slogans appeared to bring up financial issues around Mr Komuro's family - specifically his mother. The former princess got engaged to Mr Komuro in 2017 and the two were set to wed the following year. But the marriage was delayed following claims Mr Komuro's mother had financial problems - she had reportedly taken a loan from her ex-fiancÃ© and not paid him back. The palace denied the delay was linked to this, though Crown Prince Fumihito said it was important for the money issues to be dealt with before the couple got married. According to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, the real reason for the animosity towards Mr Komuro seems to be among some conservative Japanese who believe he is not a worthy partner for a niece of the emperor. Mr Komuro - who has received a job offer from a top New York law firm - comes from humble origins, and local tabloids have spent years digging dirt on his family, including the allegations against his mother. The reaction to Princess Mako and Kei Komuro's relationship by some media and people in Japan, has highlighted the pressure women in Japan's imperial family face. The Imperial Household Agency has said Princess Mako suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the harsh criticism from the media and on social media around her engagement since it was announced nearly four years ago. She is not the first woman in the Japanese royal family to be affected this way. Her grandmother Empress Emerita Michiko temporarily lost her voice nearly 20 years ago when criticised by the media as being somehow unfit to be the Emperor's wife. Her aunt-in-law Empress Masako, suffered depression after she was blamed for failing to produce a male heir. Royal women have been forced to strictly adhere to certain expectations - they must be supportive of their husbands, produce an heir, and be a guardian of Japan's traditions. If they fall short they are savagely criticised. This is also true of Princess Mako, who said she would give up her royal status. But even that has not been enough to stop the attacks on her, her husband, and their marriage. Read this story in Japanesehere.
