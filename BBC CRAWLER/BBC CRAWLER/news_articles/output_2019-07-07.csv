"Deutsche Bank confirms plan to cut 18,000 jobs","Deutsche Bank will cut 18,000 jobs over three years as part of a radical reorganisation of the German bank. It will also report a second quarter loss of â¬2.8bn to partly pay for the shake-up, which will significantly shrink its investment banking business. Deutsche Bank is yet to specify exactly where jobs will be lost. But it said it intends to completely exit activities related to the buying and selling of shares, much of which is conducted in London and New York. With almost 8,000 staff, London is the home to its biggest trading operation. Deutsche Bank said it will cut its global workforce to 74,000 by 2022 and that the restructure will cost â¬7.4bn over the next three years. ""Today we have announced the most fundamental transformation of Deutsche Bank in decades,"" chief executive Christian Sewing said. Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing ""This is a restart for Deutsche Bank... In refocusing the bank around our clients, we are returning to our roots and to what once made us one of the leading banks in the world,"" he said. German banking giants abandon merger talks Deutsche Bank raided over money laundering The reorganisation of the business follows the failure of merger talks with rival Commerzbank in April. The German government had supported the tie-up, hoping it would create a national champion in the banking industry. However, both banks concluded that the deal was too risky, fearing the costs of combining might have outweighed the benefits. What's bad for Deutsche Bank could be good for Barclays. The once-mighty German firm's retreat from international investment banking leaves Barclays as the last European bank standing in a sector dominated by US giants like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. As one Barclays insider told the BBC: ""Deutsche is where Barclays was five to 10 years ago. The difference is that we had a successful retail business (loans, mortgages, credit cards) to help us endure the most difficult times. Deutsche Bank hasn't got that."" The structure of the German banking sector is very different from the UK with lots of smaller regional banks grabbing most retail customers. Barclays has been picking up market share from Deutsche and other European banks for over a year now and will see this as a further opportunity to expand into the space vacated by the German retreat. While Barclays may pick up business, the real victors from Deutsche's demise are the US banks who have prevailed after many unsuccessful attempts (RBS, UBS, DB and others) to muscle into the so-called ""bulge bracket"" of international investment banks. Wall Street is arguably more powerful than ever. Deutsche Bank has been struggling for years with the decline of its investment bank and has made several attempts to revamp its business. The latest plan will be the most ambitious so far and it has already prompted the resignation of one top executive. On Friday, the bank announced that its head of investment banking, Garth Ritchie, was leaving. Under the plan, the bank wants to make cost savings of â¬17bn by 2022. It is also creating a new unit to manage assets that belong to businesses it no longer wants. It estimates those assets to be worth â¬74bn.

Labour must 'get on with' changing Brexit policy,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: Labour must reach a Brexit position Labour should 'get on with' changing its Brexit policy to support a second referendum, the shadow chancellor has told the BBC. John McDonnell said Jeremy Corbyn was ""rightfully"" trying to build consensus, but added the party needed to reach a position ""sooner rather than later"". ""I want to campaign for Remain,"" he said. He also denied he had called for the Labour leader's advisors to be sacked, as reported inthe Sunday Times.,external Labour had previously promised a vote on Brexit in certain circumstances, specifically if it could not get its own deal with the EU passed by MPs or if there was no general election. Following the party's poor performance in the European elections in May, Mr Corbyn appeared to go further, suggesting there ""had to be a public vote"" on any deal agreed with Brussels. He has recently come under pressure from his own MPs to confirm that the party would call for another referendum, and would campaign to remain in the EU. Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour How could another Brexit referendum work? 'High price to pay' for Labour ambiguity Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr McDonnell confirmed that he, personally, would campaign to Remain if there was a second referendum. He said he wanted to ""get on with it"", but added that Mr Corbyn was ""much wiser"" and wanted to ""build consensus and then go for it"". ""That's what he's doing at the moment,"" he added. ""Jeremy and I go back 40 years, we're the closest of friends. We've minded each other's back throughout that period. Yes, we'll disagree on things, and then we'll come to an agreement."" Asked if he and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott had called for Mr Corbyn's advisors - Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne - to be sacked, Mr McDonnell replied such stories were ""rubbish"". Meanwhile, Labour's Barry Gardiner told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that his party is in talks with Conservative MPs who might support a no-confidence motion in the government in order to stop a no-deal Brexit. Conservative MP and ex-minister Sam Gyimahsuggested ""30 plus"" Tory MPs would seek to stop a no-deal Brexit. Mr McDonnell was also asked about reports in the Sunday Times that up to half a dozen Labour staff have ignored non-disclosure agreements (NDA) to speak to BBC journalists working on a Panorama programme about Labour and anti-Semitism. According to the Times, Labour, through the law firm Carter Ruck, has warned there could be legal action against those staff members. Mr McDonnell said the Labour Party was ""reminding them of their confidentiality agreement"". He argued this was important in cases where employees ""are dealing with individual cases, individual information and individual members"". However, he added the party would ""always protect anyone subject to harassment"". A number of Labour MPs criticised the reported action, including deputy leader Tom Watson who said ""using expensive media lawyers in an attempt to silence staff members is as futile as it is stupid"". Labour MPWes Streeting,externaltweeted ""Labour opposes NDAs, yet seems to impose them. I'm protected by parliamentary privilege. I'll whistleblow in the House of Commons for anyone who needs me to do so. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. No more excuses or hiding places. You should promise the same Jeremy Corbyn."" Mr Gardiner, shadow international trade secretary, has attacked the forthcoming Panorama programme - which will be aired next week - as neither balanced or impartial. In response the BBC said: ""The Labour Party is criticising a programme they have not seen. ""We are confident the programme will adhere to the BBC's editorial guidelines. In line with those, the Labour Party has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations."" Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour How could another Brexit referendum work?

Centre-right regains power in Greece,"This video can not be played Greece's New Democracy celebrates election win in Athens Greece's centre-right opposition party New Democracy has won the nation's snap general election. With most districts counted, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras admitted defeat to his rival, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. New Democracy has 39.85% of the vote so far, with Mr Tsipras's leftist Syriza party in second place with 31.53%. Current projections give New Democracy an outright majority, as the winner receives 50 extra seats in parliament. Nearly all districts have returned their results,external, official figures show. Young Greeks lean to conservatives for future Mitsotakis and the return of a Greek dynasty Turnout in the election was about 57% â one of the lowest figures in decades. There have been a half dozen elections in recent years and on Sunday, many residents flocked to the beaches or sheltered at home as temperatures exceeded 35C in places. The prime minister-elect told supporters he had been given a strong mandate for change. ""The country proudly raises its head again,"" he told the crowd in the capital Athens, saying he would be a prime minister for all because Greeks were ""too few to stay divided"". A supporter hugs New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis Speaking as the results became clear, Mr Tsipras confirmed he had called Mr Mitsotakis to offer him his congratulations. ""Today, with our head held high we accept the people's verdict. To bring Greece to where it is today we had to take difficult decisions [with] a heavy political cost,"" Mr Tsipras told journalists. Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker congratulated Mr Mitsotakis on his ""clear victory"". The centre-left Movement for Change is on 8.1%, followed by the Communist Party on 5.3%. The far-right Golden Dawn party is short of the 3% minimum needed to enter parliament by the narrowest of margins - at 2.93%. The nationalist pro-Russian Greek Solution and MeRA25, the left-wing party of former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, both crossed the threshold. Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens Back in 2015, Alexis Tsipras seemed like the figure of change. In his firebrand rallies, the left-wing populist vowed to tear up Greece's bailout programme and end austerity. But he hopelessly overpromised. Under pressure from the EU, capital controls on its banks and the threat of ""Grexit"" - departure from the euro - he was forced into a humiliating U-turn, signing up to a third, â¬89bn (Â£80bn; $100bn) bailout, and more austerity. His support base began to ebb away. As the Mitsotakis era begins, one of Europe's iconic leftist leaders of the past four years departs the stage. But he'll regroup in opposition and wait in the wings to seize on any misstep by Greece's new leader. More from Mark Greek media also report a ballot box was stolen by an unidentified group which had forced its way into one polling station. Prime Minister Tsipras, who swept to power in 2015, called the elections after suffering defeat in the local and European votes in May. Mr Tsipras addressed the press after his defeat He had toppled New Democracy from power by campaigning against the austerity policies that had affected Greeks for years. Greek bailout crisis in 300 words How crisis helped Greeks open their eyes to mental illness Love and hate in the EU after two economic rescues Yet within months, he was forced to accept tough conditions in return for Greece's third international bailout. Mr Tsipras faced a revolt from within his partyas a result and responded by calling fresh elections, which he won. However, his party's popularity was dented as unemployment increased, and Greece's economy shrank. This video can not be played Why young people have suffered the most from Greeceâs economic collapse Mr Mitsotakis attacked his rival's record, saying that economic improvement was too slow. He also benefited from widespread anger at a landmark deal with North Macedonia over the name of the country - which it shares with a Greek region. New Democracy has promised to lower taxes and privatise services in the country, which is still feeling the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Greece has been in receipt of a series of bailout programmes over the past decade, which it officially ""exited"" last August as economic growth returned. But youth unemployment remains high, and New Democracy has counted many 18-24 year olds among its supporters. The potential new prime minister comes from one of Greece's long-standing political dynasties. Kyriakos Mitsotakis is the son of former Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis. His sister, Dora Bakoyannis, was mayor of Athens when the city hosted the Olympics in 2004, before becoming Greek foreign minister.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis cast his vote in Athens It is Greece's sixth election since the global financial crisis in 2008. Five issues that matter Why frustrated young voters are turning conservative Mitsotakis and the return of a Greek dynasty The crisis triggered a succession of financial bailouts, with the Greek economy shrinking by 28% between 2008 and 2016, and increasing unemployment has thrown many Greeks into poverty.

Mr Mitsotakis is promising lower taxes, greater privatisation of public services and plans to renegotiate a deal with Greece's creditors that would allow more money to be reinvested in the country. New Democracy party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis (left) and Greek PM Alexis Tsipras Mr Tsipras, who came to power in 2015, has promised more investment and recently boosted pensions.

Iran announces new breach of nuclear deal,"Iranian officials announced they would breach the enrichment limit within a matter of hours Iran has announced it will break a limit set on uranium enrichment, in breach of the landmark 2015 deal designed to curb its nuclear ambitions. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. The US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018. It has since reimposed tight sanctions affecting the Iranian economy. Responding to the latest announcement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would only lead to ""further isolation and sanctions"" for the nation. Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead? Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? In May, Iran announced it would step up its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to make fuel for reactors but also for nuclear weapons. The country has already stockpiled more enriched uranium than permitted under the terms of the deal. Iran has strongly denied that it has any intention of building nuclear weapons. On the anniversary of the US withdrawal, Iran gave a 60-day deadline to the remaining parties to the deal - China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK - to protect it from US sanctions. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday at the end of that deadline, Mr Araqchi said Iran would start enriching uranium above a concentration of 3.67% within a few hours. Iran says the enriched uranium will be used to fuel its power plant at Bushehr Officials previously said this would mean a concentration of about 5%. Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr requires ""low-enriched"" fuel at about this level. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. The ramped-up enrichment programme may be designed to exert pressure on the diplomatic negotiations, as Mr Araqchi said Iran would keep reducing its commitment to the 2015 deal every 60 days. Another reactor in Tehran used for research purposes requires fuel enriched to 20% - the highest level Iran had been producing prior to the nuclear deal. But a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said it already had a sufficient stockpile for that purpose. ""We will enrich uranium based on our needs,"" he said. ""Right now, we don't need to enrich uranium for the Tehran reactor."" Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The nuclear fuel cycle,external Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed that the steps were ""reversible"" if European countries delivered on their commitments. A spokesman for the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said its inspectors would report back to headquarters ""as soon as they verify the announced development"". The demise of the 2015 nuclear accord to contain Iran's nuclear programme seems to be coming ever closer. Iran's policy of progressive breaches of the agreement's terms is seen in Tehran as a way to pressure the Europeans to relieve the impact of US economic sanctions. But there is little they can do in practical terms to mitigate Iran's dire economic situation. The Europeans want the deal to survive but are caught between Tehran and Washington. This has been a slow-motion diplomatic car crash - ever since the US walked out of the agreement a year ago. French President Emmanuel Macron's telephone conversation with his Iranian counterpart on Saturday bought a little more time for consultations. The Europeans are struggling to postpone the moment when they have to declare the nuclear deal dead. But at some point, if Iran continues to chip away at its limits and restrictions, they may have little choice. Mr Pompeo reacted on Twitter, reiterating US objections to the nuclear developments.

European powers said they had been conferring with each other to discuss next steps. Germany said it was ""extremely concerned"" and urged Iran not to make any further moves to endanger the agreement. A spokesman for the UK's Foreign Office said that while Iran had now broken the terms of the nuclear deal, the UK remained ""fully committed"" to it. The UK also called on Iran to stop its activities, and said it was co-ordinating with the other parties on what to do. The announcement comes a day after French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and expressed his ""strong concern"" about what would happen if the agreement was abandoned. A French statement said the two leaders had agreed ""to explore by 15 July the conditions for the resumption of dialogue between all parties"",external. Mr Rouhani called on European countries to act now to save the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the announcement was a ""very, very dangerous step"" for Iran, and repeated his calls for France, Germany and the UK to impose sanctions. Israel's Energy Minister, Yuval Steinitz, had already criticised the move, saying that while the increase was ""moderate"", Iran had ""begun its march... toward nuclear weaponry"".

Tehran agreed to let in international inspectors and to limit its nuclear activities, in exchange for an end to tight economic sanctions. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Under the deal, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235, and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. The deal also restricted Iran to stockpiling no more than 300kg (661lb) of the low-enriched uranium. According to the Arms Control Association, a stockpile of 1,050kg could be further enriched later into enough material to build one bomb. What do Iranians think of US sanctions?

Jeffrey Epstein 'arrested on sex charges',"Jeffrey Epstein registered as a sex offender as part of a widely criticised plea deal Wealthy US financier and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been arrested on new sex trafficking charges connected to allegations from the early 2000s, reports say. Epstein was arrested in New York and will appear in court on Monday, law enforcement officials told US media. It comes amid renewed controversy over a plea deal he once reached to end a federal investigation against him. His lawyer told Reuters news agency he would plead not guilty to any charges. Law enforcement officers have not been authorised to discuss the case, but several have spoken to US media outlets. One told the Associated Press the latest charges stemmed from allegations that Epstein paid underage girls for massages and molested them at his New York and Florida homes. The same claims were made by sources quoted in other outlets, includingThe Daily Beast, which first reported Epstein's arrest.,external The music fans being sexually abused Students go online to report alleged abuse Gangnam: The scandal rocking the playground of K-pop Epstein, 66, was previously accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls. The wealthy financier - who was once friendly with Prince Andrew, former US President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump - reached a plea deal to avoid federal sex trafficking charges in the case. Instead, he pleaded guilty in 2008 to lesser state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under age 18 for prostitution This averted a possible life sentence, and instead saw him spend 13 months in jail and register as a sex offender. Earlier this year, a Florida judge ruled that federal prosecutors broke the law by not informing Epstein's victims of the plea deal at the time. Judge Kenneth Marra is currently deciding whether the non-prosecution agreement that protected Epstein from the more serious charges should still stand. Following the ruling, the White House said it was also ""looking into"" Labour Secretary Alexander Acosta's role in the plea deal, which he approved in his previous role as a US attorney. Epstein in December deprived his alleged victims of the chance to testify against him for the first timeby reaching a last-minute agreement to settle a civil lawsuit. Before the criminal charges, New York-born Epstein was best known as a wealthy financier with connections to the business and political elite. As a young man, he taught mathematics and physics at Manhattan's private Dalton School. He moved into finance in 1976, working as an options trader for investment banking company Bear Stearns. Within four years, he was made a limited partner. He then went on to found his own financial management firm J Epstein & Co, reportedly managing the assets of clients with more than $1bn (Â£798m) in net worth. In 1996, he changed his company's name to The Financial Trust Co and based it in the US Virgin Islands for tax purposes. His lavish lifestyle, along with the secrecy surrounding his client list and other details of his business, earned Epstein a reputation as a mysterious moneyman. One Wall Street insider described him to New York Magazine in 2002 as a ""Gatsbyesque figure"".,external He was also known for his friendships with high-profile people, including Mr Trump and Mr Clinton. ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,"" Mr Trump said in the New York Magazine profile. ""He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" Along with his wealth and high-profile friends, Epstein built a reputation as a philanthropist. In 2003, he hit headlines for making a $30m donation to Harvard University for the founding of a mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics programme. Reports of his current wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. According to Florida court records, cited by NBC News,Epstein maintains properties in the US Virgin Islands, New York, Paris, Mexico and Florida.,externalHe also has numerous luxury cars and motorbikes.

UK ambassador labels Trump administration 'inept',"The Trump administration has been labelled ""inept"", insecure and incompetent in leaked emails from the UK ambassador to Washington. Sir Kim Darroch said that the White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and ""divided"" under Donald Trump. But he also warned that the US president should not be written off. The Foreign Office saidthe leak of the memos to the Mail on Sunday,externalwas ""mischievous"" but did not deny their accuracy. The White House has not yet responded to the revelation of the contents of the memos, but it could test the so-called ""special relationship"" between the US and UK. In the messages, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" He questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"". The UK ambassador in Washington says Trump needs ""simple, even blunt"" arguments Although Sir Kim said Mr Trump was ""dazzled"" by his state visit to the UK in June, the ambassador warns that his administration will remain self-interested, adding: ""This is still the land of America First"". Differences between the US and the UK on climate change, media freedoms and the death penalty might come to the fore as the countries seek to improve trading relations after Brexit, the memos said. To get through to the president, ""you need to make your points simple, even blunt"", he said. The leader of the Brexit party, Nigel Farage, has criticised Sir Kim for his comments, branding the ambassador ""totally unsuitable for the job"" and saying the ""sooner he is gone the better"".

However, Justice Secretary David Guake said it is very important that ambassadors give ""honest and unvarnished advice to their country"". He said: ""It is disgraceful that it's been leaked, but we should expect our ambassadors to tell the truth, as they see it."" In a message sent last month, Sir Kim branded US policy on Iran as ""incoherent, chaotic"". Mr Trump'spublicly stated reason for calling off an airstrike against Tehranwith 10 minutes to go - that it would cause 150 casualties - ""doesn't stand up"", Sir Kim said. Instead, he suggested the president was ""never fully on board"" and did not want to reverse his campaign promise not to involve the US in foreign conflicts. Sir Kim said it was ""unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent any time soon"" because ""this is a divided administration"". The leaked files date from 2017 to the present day, covering the ambassador's early impressions that media reports of ""vicious infighting and chaos"" in the White House were ""mostly true"". They also give an assessment of allegations about collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia, saying ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". Theinvestigation by Robert Mueller has since foundthose claims were not proven. A Foreign Office spokesman said the views of diplomats were ""not necessarily the views of ministers or indeed the government. But we pay them to be candid"". He said ministers and civil servants would handle this advice ""in the right way"" and ambassadors should be able to offer it confidentially. The UK embassy in Washington has ""strong relations"" with the White House and these would continue, despite ""mischievous behaviour"" such as this leak, the spokesman said.

Call for inquiry into email leak criticising Trump,"The government has begun an inquiry into a leak of emails from the UK ambassador in Washington which deemed the Trump administration ""inept"". In the messages, Sir Kim Darroch said the White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and ""divided"" under Donald Trump. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the memos reflected Sir Kim's ""personal view"", not that of the UK government. President Trump said Sir Kim had ""not served the UK well"". Asked about the leak, he told reporters in New Jersey: ""We're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well. ""So I can understand it and I can say things about him but I won't bother."" The Foreign Office said the leakto the Mail on Sunday,externalwas ""mischievous"", but did not deny the accuracy of the memos. A spokesperson confirmed a formal leak investigation would be launched. In the emails, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" He questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned the US president should not be written off. The UK ambassador in Washington says Trump needs ""simple, even blunt"" arguments Mr Hunt - who is fighting to become the next Conservative leader and prime minister - said while it was the UK ambassador's job to give ""frank opinions"", the memos expressed ""a personal view"". ""It is not the view of the British government, it's not my view,"" he said. ""We continue to think that under President Trump the US administration is not just highly effective but the best friend of Britain on the international stage."" Earlier, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said whoever was responsible for the leak must be prosecuted. ""Diplomats must be able to communicate securely with their governments,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. However, he defended Sir Kim, saying the job of the UK's ambassador is ""to represent the interests and wishes of the British people"" and not ""the sensibilities of the United States"". What we've learned from Trump's visit Trump blames 'airports' gaffe on teleprompter Although Sir Kim said Mr Trump was ""dazzled"" by his state visit to the UK in June, the ambassador warned that his administration will remain self-interested, adding: ""This is still the land of America First."" Differences between the US and the UK on climate change, media freedoms and the death penalty might come to the fore as the countries seek to improve trading relations after Brexit, the memos said. To get through to the president, ""you need to make your points simple, even blunt"", he said. The leader of the Brexit party, Nigel Farage, has criticised Sir Kim for his comments, branding the ambassador ""totally unsuitable for the job"" and saying the ""sooner he is gone the better"".

However, Justice Secretary David Gauke said it was very important that ambassadors gave ""honest and unvarnished advice to their country"". He said: ""It is disgraceful that it's been leaked, but we should expect our ambassadors to tell the truth, as they see it."" In a message sent last month, Sir Kim branded US policy on Iran as ""incoherent, chaotic"". Mr Trump'spublicly stated reason for calling off an airstrike against Tehranwith 10 minutes to go - that it would cause 150 casualties - ""doesn't stand up"", Sir Kim said. Instead, he suggested the president was ""never fully on board"" and did not want to reverse his campaign promise not to involve the US in foreign conflicts. Sir Kim said it was ""unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent any time soon"" because ""this is a divided administration"". The leaked files date from 2017 to the present day, covering the ambassador's early impressions that media reports of ""vicious infighting and chaos"" in the White House were ""mostly true"". They also give an assessment of allegations about collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia, saying ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". Theinvestigation by Robert Mueller has since foundthose claims were not proven. A Foreign Office spokesman said the views of diplomats were ""not necessarily the views of ministers or indeed the government. But we pay them to be candid"". He said ministers and civil servants would handle this advice ""in the right way"" and ambassadors should be able to offer it confidentially. The UK embassy in Washington has ""strong relations"" with the White House and these would continue, despite ""mischievous behaviour"" such as this leak, the spokesman said.

"Deutsche Bank could cut up to 20,000 jobs","""We're prepared to make tough cutbacks,"" said CEO Christian Sewing earlier this year Up to 20,000 jobs could be axed at Deutsche Bank in a radical reorganisation of Germany's biggest bank. The investment bank is expected to be particularly hard hit, with many of the cuts set to affect London and New York. The supervisory board of Deutsche Bank is expected to approve the plan on Sunday. The reorganisation of the business follows the failure ofmerger talks with rival Commerzbankin April. The German government had supported the tie-up, hoping it would create a national champion in the banking industry. However, both banks concluded that the deal was too risky, fearing the costs of combining might have outweighed the benefits. German banking giants abandon merger talks Deutsche Bank raided over money laundering Chief executive Christian Sewing, who took on the top job just over a year ago, told shareholders at the annual general meeting in May that he would ""accelerate transformation"" by focusing the bank on ""profitable and growing"" businesses. ""I can assure you: we're prepared to make tough cutbacks,"" he said. The 20,000 job cuts would be equivalent to a fifth of the company's global workforce. With almost 8,000 staff, London is the home of its biggest investment banking operation. Deutsche Bank has been struggling for years with the decline of its investment bank and has made several attempts to revamp its business. It is thought that the latest plan will be the most ambitious so far and it has already prompted the resignation of one top executive. On Friday, the bank announced that its head of investment banking, Garth Ritchie, was leaving. Shares in the firm have fallen by a quarter over the last year. Last month they fell below â¬6 a share, but have recovered a little since then, and on Friday closed at â¬7.17. Deutsche Bank headquarters were raided by prosecutors last year As well as poor financial performance, Deutsche Bank has also been caught up in banking scandals. Late last yearprosecutors raided its headquartersin a money-laundering investigation. They were looking into whether Deutsche Bank staff helped clients set up offshore accounts to transfer money from criminal activities. Deutsche has also been connected with another huge money-laundering scandal at Denmark's Danske Bank. Last year Danske Bank said that it had detected billions of dollars of suspicious payments at its Estonian operation. Deutsche Bank admitted it had processed some of Danske's Estonian transactions, but had terminated its relationship with with the bank in 2015 after ""identifying suspicious activity"".

UK plans Â£3m no-deal medicine transport,"The Department of Health and Social Care plans to spend Â£3m on no-deal Brexit measures to transport medication. It wants to hire an ""express freight service"" to transport medicines, blood and transplant tissue. But experts have warned that the deadline of 1 September set for the deal is a ""tight"" timeframe. The government's current plan is to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a trade deal. It has smartened up its act on procurement after running up a bill of Â£80m trying to arrange ferry contracts in the event of a no-deal exit. Seaborne Freight had been awarded a Â£13.8m deal last year, which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. Gus Tugendhat, founder of Tussell, a data provider on UK government contracts, whichuncovered the latest move,externalsaid timelines were ""still tight"". Some medicines have short shelf lives and may require refrigeration Andrew Dean, director of public law at Clifford Chance, a former government adviser and procurement law expert said there was sufficient time to run a compliant and robust procurement process, but it would be tricky, given the relatively short timeframe. Last weekend, it emerged that the Department for Transport wasasking logistics companies to bidto provide extra freight capacity to be used in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The plan is to set up ""an express freight contingency arrangement to support continuity of supply of medicines and medical products,"" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidingtontold Parliament.,external ""This will be an urgent contingency measure for products requiring urgent delivery, within a 24-48 hour timeframe, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal."" Together with stockpiling and helping companies with paperwork at the border, the department hopes this will allow patients to receive the medicines they need, especially rarer ones with short shelf-lives, which may require specialist transport conditions such as refrigeration. ""Government will only pay for capacity as and when it is needed and used,"" Mr Lidington insisted. It is understood that while larger pharmaceutical companies would have their own plans, smaller ones were likely to need help. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman confirmed that the contract was new, but said that the speed of the contract was ""within the usual guidelines"".

McDonnell: Split claims are 'myths and rubbish',"This video can not be played John McDonnell: Labour must reach a Brexit position Labour should 'get on with' changing its Brexit policy to support a second referendum, the shadow chancellor has told the BBC. John McDonnell said Jeremy Corbyn was ""rightfully"" trying to build consensus, but added the party needed to reach a position ""sooner rather than later"". ""I want to campaign for Remain,"" he said. He also denied he had called for the Labour leader's advisors to be sacked, as reported inthe Sunday Times.,external Labour had previously promised a vote on Brexit in certain circumstances, specifically if it could not get its own deal with the EU passed by MPs or if there was no general election. Following the party's poor performance in the European elections in May, Mr Corbyn appeared to go further, suggesting there ""had to be a public vote"" on any deal agreed with Brussels. He has recently come under pressure from his own MPs to confirm that the party would call for another referendum, and would campaign to remain in the EU. Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour How could another Brexit referendum work? 'High price to pay' for Labour ambiguity Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr McDonnell confirmed that he, personally, would campaign to Remain if there was a second referendum. He said he wanted to ""get on with it"", but added that Mr Corbyn was ""much wiser"" and wanted to ""build consensus and then go for it"". ""That's what he's doing at the moment,"" he added. ""Jeremy and I go back 40 years, we're the closest of friends. We've minded each other's back throughout that period. Yes, we'll disagree on things, and then we'll come to an agreement."" Asked if he and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott had called for Mr Corbyn's advisors - Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne - to be sacked, Mr McDonnell replied such stories were ""rubbish"". Meanwhile, Labour's Barry Gardiner told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that his party is in talks with Conservative MPs who might support a no-confidence motion in the government in order to stop a no-deal Brexit. Conservative MP and ex-minister Sam Gyimahsuggested ""30 plus"" Tory MPs would seek to stop a no-deal Brexit. Mr McDonnell was also asked about reports in the Sunday Times that up to half a dozen Labour staff have ignored non-disclosure agreements (NDA) to speak to BBC journalists working on a Panorama programme about Labour and anti-Semitism. According to the Times, Labour, through the law firm Carter Ruck, has warned there could be legal action against those staff members. Mr McDonnell said the Labour Party was ""reminding them of their confidentiality agreement"". He argued this was important in cases where employees ""are dealing with individual cases, individual information and individual members"". However, he added the party would ""always protect anyone subject to harassment"". A number of Labour MPs criticised the reported action, including deputy leader Tom Watson who said ""using expensive media lawyers in an attempt to silence staff members is as futile as it is stupid"". Labour MPWes Streeting,externaltweeted ""Labour opposes NDAs, yet seems to impose them. I'm protected by parliamentary privilege. I'll whistleblow in the House of Commons for anyone who needs me to do so. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. No more excuses or hiding places. You should promise the same Jeremy Corbyn."" Mr Gardiner, shadow international trade secretary, has attacked the forthcoming Panorama programme - which will be aired next week - as neither balanced or impartial. In response the BBC said: ""The Labour Party is criticising a programme they have not seen. ""We are confident the programme will adhere to the BBC's editorial guidelines. In line with those, the Labour Party has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations."" Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour How could another Brexit referendum work?

Tributes paid to air crash coal tycoon Chris Cline,"Chris Cline (right) was a major Republican donor Tributes have been paid to America's ""King of Coal"", Chris Cline, who died in a helicopter crash in the Bahamas. President Donald Trump described Mr Cline, a major Republican donor, as a ""great businessman and energy expert"". Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia where Mr Cline was born, described the 60-year-old tycoon as a ""WV superstar"" and a ""wonderful"" man. The billionaire, his daughter Kameron, 22, three other women and two men died in the crash on Thursday. The helicopter had been en route from Big Grand Cay, the Bahamas, to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Its wreckage was found on the ocean floor. The cause of the crash is being investigated. Mr Cline began working in the mines of West Virginia in his early twenties. In 1990, he set up his energy development company, the Cline Group, overseeing its rise as one of America's top coal producers. In 2006, Mr Cline formed Foresight Energy to manage coal rights in the Illinois Basin. He later sold most of his shares in the firm for $1.4bn (Â£1.1bn). The billionaire was a major supporter of the Republican Party. He gave $1m to Mr Trump's inauguration committee in 2017. He also donated generously to West Virginia's Marshall University, where he studied.

Trump's UK visit,"Mr Trump praised both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in his joint press conference with Mrs May As President Trump leaves the UK on the final day of the US state visit, what can we say we have learned from the last three days? Whisper it quietly, but the capacity of the president to shock appears to be waning. His visit resulted in much diplomatic carnage - the row with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan; the pre-trip newspaper interviews advising on Brexit - but little seemed unexpected, as if Mr Trump was following a script with which we are now familiar. In pictures: Trump's final day of UK state visit Donald Trump clarifies comments about 'nasty' Meghan Khan: Trump 'acting like an 11-year-old' There were the usual half-lies - the numbers protesting against his visit, about the extent of US-UK trade. There were the abrupt policy changes over whether or not the NHS would be involved in any future trade deal. And there was the unapologetic advice about who our next prime minister should be, and what policy he or she should adopt over Brexit. But few appeared to be surprised by this. People will continue to approve or disapprove of Mr Trump, depending on their viewpoint, but somehow the phenomenon that is Trumpism has become normal. There were fewerprotesters on the streetsthan last time. The president, in turn, showed he could do modest, conducting a news conference with less bombast than usual where he praised Theresa May's handling of Brexit. He even managed to get through an entire day with the royal family without breaking protocol. This visit seemed to show that for all the reservations some may feel, Britain is beginning to realise that Mr Trump is here to stay and it had better get used to him. British diplomats can hardly contain their relief and pleasure that the state visit went off with hardly a foot wrong. ""We showed we can still do it,"" one told me. In pictures: Trump's state visit to the UK The marching bands, the scarlet Grenadiers, the grandeur of the state banquet, the pomp, the pageantry and the royals, the royals! One senior official described the Queen as ""our secret weapon"". She is clearly one of the few people in the world who can inspire awe in President Trump: the sheer weight of her experience, longevity and acquaintance with eleven of his predecessors placing a lid on the braggadocio - at least for a moment or two. The Queen gave a speech at the state banquet on Monday night Only she could have got away with using her banquet speech to deliver a firm message about the importance of the post-war international institutions that Mr Trump distrusts.

Mr Trump sat next to the Queen during the D-Day commemorations But Mr Trump has given no evidence that his transactional, bilateral view of world affairs has changed, and that alliances are based not on past nostalgia but current interests. He made it clear that future trade talks with Britain would be hard. He had no compunction in dismissing Jeremy Corbyn as a ""negative force"", a man who as leader of the opposition could one day face him across the table in Downing Street. It was noticeable, too, how many Conservative leadership contenders were willing to challenge openly Mr Trump's promise - since revoked - to include the NHS in any future trade deal. Trump rows back on NHS trade remarks In other words, for all the talk of a special relationship, our future prime minister (whoever he or she will be) was quite happy to define themselves against the US president, even when Mr Trump was in Britain as an honoured guest of the Queen. Ahead of the state visit, there was much commentary suggesting there would be a row over Britain's attitude towards the Chinese telecoms giant. The US believes the firm is too close to the Chinese state. And when the UK suggested it might be possible for Huawei to provide part of its future 5G phone network, there were grim warnings that the US might as a result restrict the intelligence it shares with Britain. US-China trade war in 300 words How damaging is the Huawei row for the US and China? Yet this seems to have been the dog that did not bark over the last few days. President Trump declared that ""we are going to be able to work out any differences"" and ""we will have no problem with that."" So what reassured him? British officials deny that any decision has been made, let alone communicated to Mr Trump. But clearly the UK's promise that the security of its intelligence network will be paramount in any decision has gone a long way to take the heat out of this row. And the reason this matters is because intelligence is a core element of the UK-US relationship, and any potential threat to that relationship would matter. We should not forget that only recently Mr Trump repeated his claim that British intelligence agencies spied on his election campaign in 2016. Theresa May is prime minister and will remain so until such time that the Conservative party elects her successor at the end of July. Yet her imminent departure hung over this visit like a thin mist.

What we've learned from Trump's visit,"Mr Trump praised both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in his joint press conference with Mrs May As President Trump leaves the UK on the final day of the US state visit, what can we say we have learned from the last three days? Whisper it quietly, but the capacity of the president to shock appears to be waning. His visit resulted in much diplomatic carnage - the row with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan; the pre-trip newspaper interviews advising on Brexit - but little seemed unexpected, as if Mr Trump was following a script with which we are now familiar. In pictures: Trump's final day of UK state visit Donald Trump clarifies comments about 'nasty' Meghan Khan: Trump 'acting like an 11-year-old' There were the usual half-lies - the numbers protesting against his visit, about the extent of US-UK trade. There were the abrupt policy changes over whether or not the NHS would be involved in any future trade deal. And there was the unapologetic advice about who our next prime minister should be, and what policy he or she should adopt over Brexit. But few appeared to be surprised by this. People will continue to approve or disapprove of Mr Trump, depending on their viewpoint, but somehow the phenomenon that is Trumpism has become normal. There were fewerprotesters on the streetsthan last time. The president, in turn, showed he could do modest, conducting a news conference with less bombast than usual where he praised Theresa May's handling of Brexit. He even managed to get through an entire day with the royal family without breaking protocol. This visit seemed to show that for all the reservations some may feel, Britain is beginning to realise that Mr Trump is here to stay and it had better get used to him. British diplomats can hardly contain their relief and pleasure that the state visit went off with hardly a foot wrong. ""We showed we can still do it,"" one told me.

France and Iran to look at conditions for talksThe French president talks to his Iranian counterpart by phone in a bid to rescue the nuclear deal.Middle East,"President Rouhani (R) inspecting nuclear technology earlier this year France and Iran have agreed to look at conditions for resuming talks to try to save Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, President Emmanuel Macron says. During a phone call with President Hassan Rouhani, Mr Macron expressed his ""strong concern"" about the consequences of abandoning the 2015 accord. Mr Rouhani called on European countries to act urgently to save the deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme. The agreement has been in jeopardy since the US pulled out last year. Iran's nuclear deal is on life support. Can it be saved? Why does the enriched uranium stockpile matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The nuclear fuel cycle,external President Donald Trump later imposed punishing sanctions on Iran. In May, Iran responded by stepping up production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs. Iran has already stockpiled more enriched uranium than the country was supposed to. The country has been expected to announce on Sunday that it will breach another limit by taking the enrichment process to a higher level. It is going to be hard - if not impossible - to get the Americans back on board, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Jonathan Marcus writes. The Europeans are struggling to do much to relieve the pressure on Iran from US sanctions and the fate of the nuclear deal itself is now more precarious than ever, he adds. The French presidency published a statement (in French), saying that President Macron had spoken for more than an hour with his Iranian counterpart.,external Mr Macron said he was very concerned about the ""risk of a further weakening"" of the treaty and ""the consequences that would necessarily follow"". The statement said the two leaders had agreed ""to explore by 15 July the conditions for the resumption of dialogue between all parties"" - beyond a Sunday deadline announced by Iran. Mr Rouhani had previously given the five countries still party to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - until Sunday to meet their commitment to shield Iran from the sanctions' effects. The French statement also said Mr Macron would continue consultations with the Iranian side and international partners to reduce tensions. This video can not be played The BBC's James Landale went to Tehran's Grand Bazaar to see what people think of the stringent sanctions President Rouhani urged the European signatories to act to save the deal. ""Lifting all sanctions can be the beginning of a move between Iran and six major powers,"" Mr Rouhani said. Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Prior to enrichment, uranium ore concentrate must be converted into uranium hexafluoride Under the deal, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235, and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. The deal also restricted Iran to stockpiling no more than 300kg (661lb) of the low-enriched uranium. A stockpile of 1,050kg, however, could be further enriched later into enough material to build one bomb, according to the Arms Control Association.

Sculptor calls on gallery to end BP sponsorshipSir Antony Gormley says the oil giant has no place sponsoring the annual portrait prize.Entertainment & Arts,"The sculptor called on BP to put half its profits towards renewable energy research Sculptor Sir Antony Gormley has joined calls for London's National Portrait Gallery to end its sponsorship with BP. BP has sponsored the gallery's annual Portrait Award for 30 years, but the oil company has faced growing criticism over its environmental stance. Sir Antony said BP was ""using culture to make us all feel this is a company that cares about the future of mankind, but it very clearly doesn't"". The gallery said BP's support for the award means public admission is free. It added that government funding only made up a third of its income, so it has to work with corporate partners. Sir Antony is one of almost 80 artists - including five winners of the Turner Prize -to write the letter,externaldemanding an end to BP's sponsorship. In the letter to Nicholas Cullinan, director of the gallery, the artists state that BP's ongoing sponsorship  ""is lending credence to the company's misleading assurance that it's doing all it can, and so we, as artists, feel we must speak up"". ""We believe that, today, the loss of BP as a source of funding is a cost worth bearing, until the company changes course and enables future generations to make art in a world that resembles our own,"" the letter continues. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Antony said: ""Art is about giving a platform for sustainable futures... [it is] very clear that this is not a part of BPs remit"". BP to pay billions for suspicious gas deal New art gallery given Â£1m investment from BP Activists inside boxes block BP's HQ Sir Antony is best known for his Angel of the North sculpture in Gateshead ""We are in a crisis,"" he said, adding he would like to see the energy giant put half its profits towards renewable energy research, ""We are all immersed in a fossil fuel culture, we are all culpable. But there are a few organisations and governments that can do something about it."" The letter calls on the gallery not to renew its contract with BP when it expires in 2022 and, in the immediate future, to remove the BP representative from the award's judging panel. Peter Mather, head of BP in Europe, told the Today programme last week that the company was trying to help both the art world and the environment. He said BP's 70,000 employees did not get up each day ""with the intention of destroying the planet"". He added that BP was ""extremely proud"" of what it did in the arts, as well as what it contributed to the UK economy. ""We are focusing very much on reducing our own emissions. We are also improving - i.e. lowering - the carbon footprint of the produce that we supply."" It comes after artist and judge of this year's Portrait Award by BPGary Hume said it was time to look elsewhere for sponsorship. He said: ""BP could continue to support the National Portrait Gallery without putting their name anywhere, it could be an anonymous gift. ""Without the institutions such as BP making a concerted effort... we haven't got a chance.""

Greeks to vote in snap general election,"This video can not be played Why young people have suffered the most from Greeceâs economic collapse Greeks are going to the polls to elect a new parliament, with the centre-right opposition mounting a strong challenge to the leftist government. The New Democracy party of Kyriakos Mitsotakis is hoping to end more than four years of rule by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's Syriza party. Mr Tsipras called snap elections soon after suffering an electoral defeat in May's European elections. Polling stations opened at 07:00 local time (04:00 GMT). Leader-in-waiting? Kyriakos Mitsotakis cast his vote in Athens It is Greece's sixth election since the global financial crisis in 2008. Five issues that matter Why frustrated young voters are turning conservative Mitsotakis and the return of a Greek dynasty The crisis triggered a succession of financial bailouts, with the Greek economy shrinking by 28% between 2008 and 2016, and increasing unemployment has thrown many Greeks into poverty. This video can not be played Greek bailout: Five numbers that reshaped the country Greece exited the bailout programme in August of last year and growth has returned. But with temperatures hitting 35C in much of the country, many politicians are concerned on the impact the weather may have on turnout, as voters stay cool at home - or head to the beach. Mr Mitsotakis is promising lower taxes, greater privatisation of public services and plans to renegotiate a deal with Greece's creditors that would allow more money to be reinvested in the country. New Democracy party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis (left) and Greek PM Alexis Tsipras Mr Tsipras, who came to power in 2015, has promised more investment and recently boosted pensions. His own investment policies would also have to be renegotiated with creditors as the country remains under eurozone supervision.

The winning party gets a 50-seat bonus and needs 151 seats in the 300-seat parliament to have a majority. At the European elections, New Democracy won 33.11% of the vote against 23.78% for Syriza. The highest percentage of 18-to-24 year olds (30.5%) at that election backed New Democracy. Greece jobless rate Five things that swung the Greek election Greece: Five degrees and still no job.
