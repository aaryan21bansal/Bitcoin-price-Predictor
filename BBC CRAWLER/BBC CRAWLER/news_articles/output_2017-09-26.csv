Bombardier hit by tariff in Boeing row,"This video can not be played About 1,000 jobs in Belfast are linked to the C-Series Boeing's trade dispute with Bombardier ""could jeopardise"" its defence contracts with the UK government, the UK's defence secretary has warned. Sir Michael Fallon made the comments after the US opted to impose a tax on the C-Series jet made by Bombardier. The proposed 220% import tariff could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast. Rival Boeing had complained that Bombardier had received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. It claimed these subsidies helped the firm win a major order. In 2016,Boeing won a contract to supply 50 Apache helicopters,externalto the Army. Reaction to Bombardier tax ruling Analysis: Not the end of Bombardier row Why is company so important to NI? Bombardier-Boeing dispute explained Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK's long-term partnership with Boeing was being undermined by its behaviour towards Bombardier. Mrs May said Boeing's behaviour was no way to operate in terms of such a long-term partnership. Theresa May said she was bitterly disappointed by the US ruling She said the preliminary judgement over Bombardier would cause uncertainty and that the government was doing everything it could to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. The prime minister said she had spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, and would be working with them both. Mrs May said she had spoken to US President Donald Trump ""more than once"" about the issue, as well as raising it during their recent meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Meanwhile, Bombardier said it would fight the ""absurd"" ruling. The firm is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers. Sir Michael said during a visit to Belfast that ""Boeing stands to gain from British defence spending"" but that ""this kind of behaviour could jeopardise our future relationship"" with the firm. The proposed tariff could threaten jobs at Bombardier in Belfast ""We don't want to do that. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom; an important employer in the United Kingdom. ""But we would prefer this kind of dispute to be settled on a negotiated basis and we will be redoubling our efforts with the Canadian government to bring about a negotiated settlement."" The UK government and trade unions fear the imposition of tariffs could make the Canadian firm question whether to remain in Northern Ireland, where it employs 4,100 of its 28,000-strong workforce. The ruling damaged the global aerospace industry and was ""frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK"", said a UK government spokesman, while emphasising this was just the first step in a lengthy process. About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built Â£520m factory at Queen's Island in Belfast. Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"" The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings. The US Department of Commerce ruling, which could triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the United States, could potentially jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta - a $5.6bn (Â£4.15bn) deal for up to 125 of the jets. Bombardier said the decision was ""divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes"". The Canadian firm said Boeing was seeking to use US trade laws ""to stifle competition"". By Julian O'Neill, Northern Ireland business correspondent The outcome was predicted - but not the severity of the penalty. The tariff could triple the cost of C-Series aircraft in the US, effectively killing the market for Bombardier. It also puts a major order with Delta Airlines at risk - and things could get worse before they get better. Washington's Department of Commerce is due to make a second tariff ruling on 5 October. But a more important date is next February when the US International Trade Commission will either uphold the penalty or remove it. This was always the focus for Bombardier and its allies. Bombardier said it had created a ""superior aircraft"" that is more efficient and comfortable but Boeing was trying to prevent ""US passengers from realising these benefits, irrespective of the harm that it would cause to the US aerospace industry and the cost to airlines and consumers"". This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson tells Today that Bombardier tariff may have 'devastating' economic consequences But Boeing said the dispute was about ""maintaining a level playing field"", and said its aim was to make sure that ""aerospace companies abide by trade agreements"". Delta, however, said there was no risk to US businesses as neither Boeing nor any other US firm produced 100-110 seat aircraft to compete with the C-Series. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said one reason for the tariff ruling was Bombardier's failure to cooperate with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

""The evidence we have to rely on is evidence not coming from Bombardier but evidence being proposed by Boeing and other outside parties,"" he said. The US government was ""not necessarily"" targeting Bombardier's Northern Ireland factory, he said, but added: ""If you're building wings for a plane that doesn't get built, that's a problem."" Analysts say that the ruling will increase tensions between the US government and Canada and the UK, both countries have dealsto supply military aircraft,externalworth billions of dollars with Boeing. The UK government and Northern Ireland Executive pledged to invest almost Â£135m in the establishment of the C-Series manufacturing site. The programme received Â£750m from Quebec's provincial government in 2015 when its fortunes appeared to be ailing. Critics say Boeing's complaints are unfounded as it does not make 100-110 seat aircrafts with which the C-Series would compete On Wednesday, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard called the tariffs ""unfair"" and an attack on the Canadian province where Bombardier has its headquarters and employs more than 17,000 people. ""Quebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist,""  he told journalists, adding that that Quebec remained committed to manufacturing the C-Series. ""Boeing may have won the battle but the war is far from over,"" he said. In 2016, Quebec invested US$1bn in the passenger jet. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to cancel the purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jet fighters from the US in retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a Boeing order from the US Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday that the government was disappointed in the decision. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers - a machinists union - called the countervailing duty ""a protectionist and dangerous measure for the stability of the aerospace industry"". In Northern Ireland, CBI director Angela McGowan said the ruling put an important driver of Northern Ireland's economic growth at risk. Northern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government for nine months, and Ms McGowan said the situation reinforced the need for a return of a power-sharing executive. ""With jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected,"" she said.

Corbyn: Labour on threshold of power,"This video can not be played Highlights of Jeremy Corbyn speech at Labour conference Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour now stands ""on the threshold of power"" because its policies are ""what most people in our country actually want"". ""We are now the political mainstream,"" he told Labour members in his 75-minute speech at their party conference. In what at times had the air of a victory rally, the Labour leader said they were a ""government-in-waiting"". He promised rent controls, attacked ""forced gentrification"" and said only Labour could unite the UK after Brexit. Laura Kuenssberg: Has centre ground moved Corbyn's way? What now for Labour MPs who criticised Corbyn? Recap: How Jeremy Corbyn's speech unfolded Reality Check: Decoding Corbyn's Brexit policy The Labour leader - who was greeted by a chorus of the football terrace-style chant of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" as he made his way to the podium - lavished praise on party activists who he said had ""stopped the Tories in their tracks"" at the general election. He mocked the hostile coverage of his campaign, saying attacks by newspapers like the Daily Mail had actually helped his party's polling. ""Never have so many trees died in vain,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the ""centre ground"" in British politics had shifted from where it was ""20 or 30 years ago"" and his Labour Party now stood for the things most people ""actually want"", even if a ""still broader consensus"" was needed for the party to win power. In his third keynote conference speech as party leader - Mr Corbyn also: Said only Labour could unite EU Leave and Remain voters Promised to ""repair the damage done by austerity"" Said his principles come from his parents and the North London community he lives in Urged Theresa May to call another snap election: ""Take another walking holiday and make another impetuous decision."" Condemned the ""intolerable"" abuse aimed at Diane Abbott - and sang Happy Birthday to the shadow home secretary from the stage Highlighting Labour's pledge to curb rents in the private sector, Mr Corbyn said young people's housing costs were three times those of their grandparents. This video can not be played Highlights of Jeremy Corbyn speech at Labour conference ""Rent controls exist in many cities across the world. And I want our cities to have those powers too and tenants to have those protections."" He added: ""Regeneration is a much abused word. Too often what it really means is forced gentrification and social cleansing, as private developers move in and tenants and leaseholders are moved out."" A Labour government would require any redevelopment of a housing estate to be backed by a council ballot of residents, he said. And anyone living there would be able to get a home on the same site on the same terms. He described the Grenfell Tower fire as ""an entirely avoidable human disaster,"" with the ruined tower standing as a ""chilling"" monument to privatisation and ""yawning inequality"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Labour must be ""government-ready"" On Brexit, Mr Corbyn pointed the finger at divisions in Tory ranks, saying the Conservatives are ""more interested in posturing for personal advantage than in getting the best deal for Britain"". ""Never has the national interest been so ill-served on such a vital issue. If there were no other reason for the Tories to go, their self-interested Brexit bungling would be reason enough,"" he said. ""So I have a simple message to the cabinet: for Britain's sake pull yourself together or make way."" He backed Theresa May's call for a two-year transition period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019 but claimed Labour was the only party that could ""unite everyone in our country around a progressive vision of what our country could be"" after Brexit. Labour would push for ""unimpeded access to the single market"" and fight to protect jobs and wages, while rejecting immigration targets, he told delegates. This video can not be played In full: Jeremy Corbyn's 75 minute speech He said the ""the capitalist system still faces a crisis of legitimacy"" after 2008's financial crash and the time had now come for a new economic model, with a bigger role for the public sector, renationalised utilities and more investment in infrastructure and skills. For much of his tenure, Mr Corbyn has faced heavy criticism from many of his MPs, including a no-confidence vote and a leadership challenge - but after the party's election gains he said this week had showed his party was now united and ""ready"" to take power. Mr Corbyn spent the summer touring marginal seats, and Labour aides said the party was currently selecting candidates in 76 Labour-Tory marginals, who would be in place by the end of the year. Responding to his speech for the Conservatives, First Secretary of State Damian Green said: ""Jeremy Corbyn's speech summed up the problem with Labour: lots of big promises, but no explanation of how they would deliver them."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said Mr Corbyn's speech had ""once again confirmed he is one of Brexit's biggest cheerleaders"".

'Husband-proof' shopping list goes viral,"An Indian woman left little to chance by creating an illustrated 'dummy-proof' shopping list to aid her husband for their weekly food shop - and it struck a chord with thousands of social media users on LinkedIn and Twitter. 29-year-old IT specialist Era Golwalkar told BBC Trending that the list was created to ""solve a weekly problem.""

""After Gaurav and I got married three years ago we decided to split the household chores,"" she says, ""Gaurav was very supportive and was ready to learn cooking (which is not common for a lot of men in India). But there was one problem. I wasn't aware of back then - he had no experience with anything related to cooking."" ""When I first sent him to purchase vegetables, it was an epic fail and an argument ensued between us. The second time was no better. Nor was the third."" Era says vegetable vendors soon picked up on her husband's naivety and began selling him substandard and spoiled products. The confusion led to the task becoming increasingly cumbersome when it was her husband's turn to visit the supermarket. ""He would keep sending photos on Whatsapp to get my approval. So I had to get to the bottom of the problem,"" she says. Era and Gaurav would have ""epic arguments"" over the spoiled fruit and vegetables he would purchase. Era did so by writing a meticulous list with detailed drawings of each item, so as to eliminate any potential confusion. She even explained how to pick the right veggies - by illustrating what she meant by a medium-sized potato and told him not to opt for palak (spinach) with holes in. It worked. Gaurav returned with the right shopping and the arguments stopped. So Era decided to share her list on social media. ""Looking at the reactions on social media. I've noticed that most married women globally are able to relate to this,"" Era says. ""Even kids can relate to when their mothers tell them to go and get something from the market and gives similar instructions."" She adds that men on social media generally ""had a good laugh over the list, although a few found it to be a bit condescending."" But she is keen to point out that she knows that not all men would need a ""husband-proof"" list like this. ""But mine did, so we found a solution,"" she says. But what does Era's husband, 31-year-old Guarav, a video lecturing executive at BuyTestSeries in the west Indian city of Pune, think about the list? ""It did reduce our arguments is what I can definitely say,"" he tells BBC Trending. ""Now, if I get something wrong, I have proof that it wasn't in the specification and she can't deny it."" ""Earlier, I used to lose all arguments hands down where veggie/fruit shopping was concerned, now I can put up a fight.""

Saudi to lift driving ban on women,"This video can not be played Saudi women's driving activist Manal al-Sharif: 'I cried' Saudi Arabia's King Salman has issued a decree allowing women to drive for the first time, to the joy of activists. The Gulf kingdom is the only country in the world that bans women from driving. Until now, only men were allowed licences and women who drove in public risked being arrested and fined. Praise for the move has been pouring in from inside Saudi Arabia, as well as around the world. US President Donald Trump said it was a ""positive step"" towards promoting women's rights. Campaigner Sahar Nassif told the BBC from Jeddah that she was ""very, very excited - jumping up and down and laughing"". ""I'm going to buy my dream car, a convertible Mustang, and it's going to be black and yellow!"" A ministerial body will be set up to give advice within 30 days The royal order will be implemented by 24 June 2018 The country's US ambassador, Prince Khaled bin Salman, confirmed that women would not have to get male permission to take driving lessons, and would be able to drive anywhere they liked. He said it was ""an historic and big day"" and ""the right decision at the right time"". Rights groups in the kingdom have campaigned for years to allow women to drive, and some women have been imprisoned for defying the rule. Saudi woman live-tweets her arrest for driving Is Saudi Arabia on the cusp of change? Because of the law, many families have had to employ private drivers to help transport female relatives. Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul, who wasdetained for 73 days in 2014for flouting the ban, tweeted ""thank God"" following the announcement. This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's permanent representative to the UN confirmed the change in policy The move was welcomed by the US state department, which called it ""a great step in the right direction"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterresechoed that sentiment,external. Manal al-Sharif, an organiser of the Women2Drive campaign who has also been imprisoned for driving, said on Twitter that Saudi Arabia would ""never be the same again"". The hashtags ""I am my own guardian"" and ""Saudi Women Can Drive"" quickly gained traction on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Not everyone reacted positively, however, with conservative voices accusing the government of ""bending the verses of Sharia"". ""As far as I remember, Sharia scholars have said it was haram (forbidden) for women to drive. How come it has suddenly become halal (permissible)?"" one critic tweeted. Others emphasised that despite the latest development, Saudi Arabia remains a long way off gender equality. Amnesty International's Philip Luther said it was ""just one step"", adding: ""We also need to see a whole range of discriminatory laws and practices swept away in Saudi Arabia."" By Frank Gardner, BBC News This decree is huge for Saudi Arabia. For decades now, Saudi women, many of whom are extremely well-educated and ambitious, have been waiting for their chance to participate fully in their country's economy. For all this time families have had to stretch their budgets to the limit, as they have had to hire in imported chauffeurs from south and south-east Asia, house them, feed them and insure them. An estimated 800,000 foreign chauffeurs currently ferry Saudi women around. The reason it has taken so long is the long-standing opposition from religious conservatives, who have expressed views varying from ""they are too stupid to drive"" to ""it will lead to intolerable mingling of the sexes"". Yet this decree is in line with a programme called Vision 2030, promoted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, to modernise Saudi society and bring it more into line with the rest of the world. Saudi law enforces a strict form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism and is known for its gender segregation rules. Saudi girls' council launched - by men Saudi women's rights video goes viral Women have to adhere to strict dress codes, must not associate with unrelated men, and if they want to travel, work or access healthcare they must be accompanied by - or receive written permission from - a male guardian. Saudi women were recently allowed inside King Fahd Stadium to celebrate for the first time The kingdom recently faced a backlash from conservatives on social media after allowing women to participate inSaturday's National Day celebrationsfor the first time.

'Instant' blood test for heart attacks,"A blood test that could rule out a heart attack in under 20 minutes should be used routinely, say UK researchers. A team from King's College London have tested it on patients and say the cMyC test could be rolled out on the NHS within five years. They claim it would save the health service millions of pounds each year by freeing up beds and sending well patients home. About two-thirds of patients with chest pain will not have had a heart attack. A heart trace, called an ECG, can quickly show up major heart attacks, but it is not very good at excluding more common, smaller ones that can still be life-threatening. Currently, patients with suspect chest pain and a clear ECG can have a different heart-attack blood test, called troponin, when they arrive at A&E. But it needs to be repeated three hours later to pick up signs of heart muscle damage. Alison Fullingham ended up having coronary bypass surgery Alison Fullingham, 49 and from Bolton, did not realise she was having a heart attack when she experienced pain in her upper chest, neck and jaw. Despite a small change in her ECG, doctors initially suspected she was having a simple panic attack. It was only hours later when her troponin tests came back that the correct diagnosis was reached. Levels of cMyC (cardiac myosin-binding protein C) in the blood rise more rapidly and to a higher extent after a heart attack than troponin proteins, studies suggest. That means doctors can use the new test to rule out a heart attack in a higher proportion of patients straightaway, according to the researchers who report their trial findings in the journalCirculation,external. They carried out troponin and cMyC blood tests on nearly 2,000 people admitted to hospitals in Switzerland, Italy and Spain with acute chest pain. The new test was better at giving patients the all-clear within the first three hours of presenting with chest pain. Dr Tom Kaier, one of the lead researchers, funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) at St Thomas' Hospital, London, said: ""Our research shows that the new test has the potential to reassure many thousands more patients with a single test, improving their experience and freeing up valuable hospital beds in A&E departments and wards across the country."" He says if the test were to be used routinely, it could provide doctors with reliable results within 15 to 30 minutes. It is only being used for research at the moment, however. Dr Kaier's hospital carries out around 7,800 troponin blood tests each year. By his calculations, switching to cMyC would save his hospital Â£800,000 through reduced admissions. Extrapolate that to other NHS hospitals and the savings could be millions of pounds, he says. Prof Simon Ray, from the British Cardiovascular Society, said more research was needed before the new test could replace the troponin test. ""Unlike currently available blood tests which need to be repeated at least three hours after pain it looks as though a single test is enough to make a confident decision on whether a patient has or has not suffered a heart attack. Not only can it be done earlier after the onset of symptoms but it also seems to be better at discriminating between heart attacks and other causes of chest pains. This is very important.""

'Lung cancer mass' was toy traffic cone,"The patient reported he regularly played with and even inhaled the toy pieces during his childhood Doctors removed a toy traffic cone from a patient's lung - 40 years after he inhaled it by accident. The 47-year-old man, from Preston, was referred to a respiratory clinic after having a cough for over a year. Medics suspected the patient - a long-term smoker - had a tumour when scans showed something on his lung. However, when they removed the mass they discovered it was the ""long lost Playmobil traffic cone"" he had received on his seventh birthday. A report in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) said the postman told doctors he ""regularly played with and even swallowed"" the toy pieces during his childhood. But, on one occasion, he believes he inhaled a tiny plastic traffic cone. He did not report any ill-effects for decades, doctors said, until the persistent cough which caused him to seek medical advice. Because the man was so young when he inhaled the toy, the report said, his airway may have been able to remodel and adapt to the presence of a foreign body. It was not unusual for children to ingest or inhale small toys, it said, but ""a case in which the onset of symptoms occurs so long after initial aspiration is unheard of"". X-rays taken after the cone was removed showed an improvement in the patient's lungs Four months after the removal of the tiny traffic cone, the patient's cough had almost gone and his symptoms had improved markedly, the report said.

Twitter trials 280-character tweet limit,"Social media site Twitter is trialling longer character limits to help users ""easily express themselves"". Twitter currently limits tweets to 140 characters, but has doubled that to 280 characters for a small group of users. The current character limit was ""a major cause of frustration"" for some users, the firm saidin a blog post,external. The firm has been suffering from slowing growth and the shift could be one way for the firm to widen its appeal and attract new users. ""Trying to cram your thoughts into a Tweet - we've all been there, and it's a pain,"" Twitter product manager Aliza Rosen wrote. Ms Rosen said the longer character limit was being tested in all languages bar Japanese, Chinese and Korean which she said could convey more information in a single character. ""We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters - we felt it, too. ""But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint,"" she said. With constant concerns over hate speech, propaganda bots, and trolling - you might wonder why Twitter is spending its time worrying about doubling the character limit. Me too, if I'm honest. But whatever - Jack Dorsey is right to point out that the 140 limit was only ever a technical limitation owing to the limits of text messages, something the service hasn't had to worry about for a long time. So why not make it a little longer? It won't be a dramatic change. Twitter will hope it increases the engagement and attention times of its users. Marketers will have more characters with which to get their message across, which might make Twitter a bit more cash. @DaveLeeBBC Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey was one of the first to try the new limit out, saying it was ""a small change, but a big move for us"".

'Someone will kill a child': School run parking,"This video can not be played The moment a teacher is run down outside a school A parent who drove into a teacher at the school gates has been given a 10-month jail sentence. Dramatic CCTV footage of the incident in Woking prompted you to share some of your stories and concerns about dangerous driving at school pick-up and drop-off. Andy has been a site manager at a primary school in Southampton since January. He says he never realised drop-off time would be quite as bad as it is. ""One of my duties is to stand at the school gates in the morning and try and keep some semblance of safety. There seems to be a distinct lack of consideration for anyone at this time of day. People can't be bothered to get up early enough to walk so they just drive in. ""When I started I wanted to get control, now I just try and make sure nobody gets run over. I've reminded people that they can't park on the zigzags or in the school entrance. I have had to ask people not to drive into school as this is a staff car park only, some people several times. ""I've seen people abandon the car in the middle of road and then walk their kids into class. Cars are parked over driveways and pavements. ""There's no lack of support from school itself, but outside school we have no authority.  I've spoken to the local police community support officers about this and they are starting to make random visits to enforce the rules."" Sian lives in a street with a primary and infant school at the end of it. Her children went to school there. She says parents are putting lives at risk - but don't like being challenged. ""Parents - usually the same offenders every day - are constantly putting the lives of other children, parents and pets at risk by parking illegally on a junction, up on the pavements and double yellow lines. ""They even turn cars round in the small Victorian street by backing their vehicle into the school gateway itself. If challenged you just get abuse. They feel the importance of their own children getting into the school gates on time or in the rain is more important than anything else. ""One woman even left her passenger window open and her little dog was about to climb out to run after her in the midst of all the traffic. When I tried to stop it from doing this she came back embarrassed but just swore at me."" Hannah works in a school and has noticed that people who are usually very reasonable can become quite the opposite around drop-off time. She posted this comment on the BBC's Facebook page: ""Having worked in schools for 15 years I have to say that normal, pleasant people who are parents turn onto self-obsessed, blinkered idiots come the school run. I have been knocked off my bike by some kid opening the car door because his dad had parked where he (knew) he wasn't meant to. ""They only see their child and can't be bothered to walk for five minutes when picking up or dropping off. Every new parent is told the same. You don't use the staff car park except in emergency or if your child has mobility issues. I have heard of a child being knocked down by a selfish, lazy parent in the staff car park. ""In this incident, the parent was trying to sneak in and quite rightly the teacher was having none of it. Whatever the teacher should/should not have done that driver should not have driven into him and shouldn't have been there in the first place. I'm glad he/she got their just deserts and I hope the poor teacher is OK."" Christopher has two children at college in Liverpool. Both are autistic and need to be driven to and from school. He says it's a matter of time before a tragedy happens. ""I have always had issues with parents illegally parking however, reporting this has got me nowhere. People park illegally and although the schools do their best the only solution I can see after witnessing years of this negligent impatience is a sustained period of parking tickets as well as fines for those drivers who choose to break the law. ""I have suffered abuse for simply asking people who are illegally parked to move to a legal parking place. One woman just screamed profanities at me. I now have cameras in my car so I record what's happening. ""At the end of the day, someone will kill a child. Then we will get the usual spiel of 'lessons need to be learned' but it will be too late."" Tony lives opposite a private school in Leeds and says parent parking has been a problem for years. He says when parents park on the yellow zigzag lines outside the school, he can't get into his drive easily. ""We have been sworn at by the mothers of the children, threatened with violence by fathers, told to go and find somewhere else to live or that we should avoid the area during school hours. ""Parents have parked up our drives and then gone for a coffee while waiting for their children and been very aggressive when their exit from our drive was blocked. Their excuse was there was nowhere else to park. ""Parking on double yellow lines, pavements, drive entrances and residents' allotted parking areas are no obstacle to illegal parking by the parents. ""And parents are allowed to park absolutely anywhere they choose when it rains, in case their children get wet. ""This is astonishing anti-social behaviour and we are not alone in this but the schools and councils do not enforce the parking regulations."" Julia fears her grandson will never be able to walk to school on his own, because it is too dangerous. ""Where I live, parents insist on parking on the pavements near the school, so they can drop their children as close as possible to the gates. ""They could park in the nearby pub or community centre but choose not to. People walking to school like me get abused for daring to remonstrate. I have to struggle with the pram and have to walk in the road. ""I would love to let my grandson walk there on his own one day, great for his confidence and independence, but I can't see that happening. One day there will be a horrendous accident, maybe then something will get done."" Produced by Katherine Sellgren and Patrick Evans CCTV shows 'school run rage' incident.

Clinton pans Trump team email 'hypocrisy',"Hillary Clinton has called reports that six Trump White House officials used private email accounts for official business the ""height of hypocrisy"". President Donald Trump repeatedly attacked Mrs Clinton's use of personal email while she was secretary of state during the 2016 campaign. Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner admitted to using his email while five other aides reportedly did so as well. Congress has asked the White House to provide details on the practice. Speaking to Sirius XM radio on Monday, Mrs Clinton said: ""It's just the height of hypocrisy."" She said the Trump administration ""knew that there was no basis for all their hyperventilating"" about her emails. ""It is something that if they were sincere about it, I think you'd have Republican members of Congress calling for an investigation,"" she added. The former Democratic presidential candidate added that her use of a private server at the State Department was ""a dumb mistake but a dumber scandal"". She said she regretted the country ""had to go through it"". Mr Kushner, a senior White House adviser, has been asked to preserve all his emails. TheNew York Times,externalhas named the other staffers implicated as Steve Bannon, the former chief White House strategist; Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff; and advisers Gary D Cohn and Stephen Miller. Meanwhile, Newsweek magazine says it hasdetails of an email Ivanka Trump sent,externalabout collaboration with a business organisation, copying in two federal officials. What was Clinton FBI probe about? The long list of who Hillary Clinton blames Trump son-in-law denies Russia collusion The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has a responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness and accountability of federal government, has sent aletter,externalto the White House demanding more information. The letter was signed jointly by Republican Trey Gowdy, who chairs the committee, and Democrat Elija Cummings, the second most senior member. Addressed to White House Counsel Donald McGahn, it says: ""Have you or any non-career official at the White House ever used a personal email account to conduct official business? ""If so, please identify the individual and the account used, and provide evidence of measures to ensure compliance with federal law."" The letter sets a deadline of 9 October for the disclosure of more information. It is not illegal for White House officials to use personal email accounts for government business. However, under the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, government officials must forward any official correspondence to a work account within 20 days for preservation. If this is not done reliably, the use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers and others who seek publicly available information. Newsweek claims Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, used a private account in the first months of her father's administration when she was an unpaid adviser In a statement Mr Kushner's lawyer said: ""Fewer than 100 emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account."" He said most were news articles or political commentary and ""all have been preserved in any event"". There are also rules against sharing classified or privileged information on personal email accounts. However, there is no suggestion that Mr Kushner or any of the others named did this.

There are some key differences between the two cases. Mrs Clinton had set up a private email server from her New York home - and used an email hosted by the server for all her emails, including at least 30,000 official emails, during her four years as secretary of state. She did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government. The FBI said that ""several thousand"" work-related emails were not turned over to the State Department, and that Mrs Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information. However, an investigation into the matter was closed without charges. It is not clear how many official emails Ms Trump, Mr Bannon, Mr Priebus, Mr Cohn and Mr Miller sent from their personal accounts. However, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that all White House employees had been told ""if they receive work-related communication on personal accounts, they should be forwarded to official email accounts"".

Is it the last call for plastic straws?,"Pubs are calling time on ""wasteful"" plastic drinking straws, which campaigners say are used only once yet take centuries to decompose. So is it time to refuse the straw and get used to sipping our drinks instead? JD Wetherspoon is the latest pub to stop automatically putting straws in drinks, effective this week, saying eco-friendly paper straws will be offered in its 900 pubs by the end of the year. ""It's a waste,"" says Su Cacioppo, Wetherspoon's personnel and legal director. ""Personally I like a straw but a lot of people don't even want them."" Designer Vivienne Westwood recently backed an online campaign for people to refuse straws and start drinking from the glass - known asRefuse the Straw,external- which began in the US and is encouraging pubs and restaurants to follow suit. Most straws are made from plastics such as polypropylene and polystyrene, which unless recycled take hundreds of years to decompose. It means small plastic items like straws, coffee cup lids and plastic bottle tops are strewn in the ocean and on landfill sites - even though they may only have been used for the time it takes to finish a drink. Ms Westwood'sFacebook post,external, which warned that ""the straw in your cocktail or coffee will be on this planet forever"", has been shared nearly 300,000 times. ""Very little is recycled, and much ends up on the ocean,"" it read. Wetherspoon, which hands out 70 million straws a year, says bar staff had complained about chucking vast quantities of used straws away during their shifts. ""This subject was coming up more and more often,"" says Ms Cacioppo. Kate Dell, All Bar One's assistant marketing manager, a chain which gets through 4.7 million straws a year but has vowed to reduce its straw usage by one-third, says she is confident customers would be ""happy to enjoy their drinks straw-free"". Simon Ellin, chief executive of the UK Recycling Association, says ""nobody would be bothered"" if bartenders stopped automatically putting straws in drinks and it is free for companies to implement. ""I had a pint of soda water the other day and not only did they put two straws in it but a stirrer, and I asked why they had done that - I'd imagine most people wouldn't query it,"" he says. Paper straws are another alternative to cut waste - although Wetherspoon's Ms Cacioppo says the business will face ""extra costs"" for introducing them and admits they ""feel a tiny bit different - but I don't think it's a big deal"". But Mark Hall, commercial director at BusinessWaste.co.uk, says it is not enough for pubs to simply phase out straws - saying people should be expected to pay tax for their straws, similar to the5p carrier bag charge. ""Why on earth do you need a straw in your gin and tonic anyway?"" he says. ""The industry can do something about it, but so can we as consumers - it's easy to say 'no straw please'."" From adding a flourish to a cocktail to apparently making a drink taste better, straws have been commonplace in almost every restaurant and bar in the UK for decades. Rye grass straws were used for hundreds of years before the first old-style paper straw was patented in the US in 1888 by inventor Marvin Stone - which since the 1970s has gradually been replaced by plastic alternatives. McDonald's has even claimed its Coca-Cola tastes better when drunk through one of its straws - which are slightly wider than in other fast food chains. The chain, which hands out free straws with its drinks, and serves 3.5 million people in the UK every day, says it has invested in recycling units in its restaurants to cut waste. ""This includes our straws, which are made from recyclable plastic,"" a spokesman said. But what about the damage to your teeth? Dentists say sipping through a straw can reduce the amount of liquid with which your teeth come in contact - potentially preventing tea and coffee stains, as well as erosion from fizzy drinks. Experts have even advised Prosecco-lovers to drink the wine through a straw to protect their teeth from the high acid and sugar content. But Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the Oral Health Foundation, says people can protect their teeth by having a drink during mealtimes rather than on its own. ""However, if we are to consume them outside of these times, using a straw really can help to reduce some of the damage,"" he says.

Tennis ball-sized diamond sold for $53m,"A model displays the ""Lesedi La Rona"" diamond at Sotheby's in New York The world's second-largest gem-quality diamond has been sold to a London jeweller for $53m (Â£39.5m). Laurence Graff, chairman ofGraff Diamonds,external, bought the diamond privately after it failed to meet itsreserve price at an auction last year. The 1,111-carat stone was recovered by Canadian firm Lucara Diamond Corp in Botswana two years ago. Lucara said the price was an improvement on the highest bid received atSotheby's,externalin June 2016. The diamond is named ""Lesedi La Rona"", which means ""our light"" in Botswana's Tswana language. The stone was first formed between 2.5 and three billion years ago and is roughly the size of a tennis ball. A team of cutters will work out the best way to maximize the stone's potential As well as its size, the diamond has been certified as being of ""exceptional quality and transparency"" by the Gemological Institute of America. Mr Graff said ""The stone will tell us its story, it will dictate how it wants to be cut."" The company says it will be scanned using state-of-the-art 3D equipment that searches for inclusions - small imperfections in the heart of the stone - to decide how the diamond will be polished. Then an expert team will examine the diamond using microscopes to pick up and navigate any further pinpoint inclusions. They will then work out how to cut the diamond and into how many individual stones. Graff acquired another 373-carat diamond that was originally part of ""Lesedi La Rona"" earlier this year. The Lesedi la Rona is the largest gem-quality rough diamond to be discovered in more than a century The company says it will cut the smaller diamond first and with the knowledge gained from that, they will decide how to work on the larger gem. The ""Lesedi La Rona"" is the largest gem-quality diamond discovered in more than a century, and the second-largest ever. The largest was the 3,106-carat Cullinan Diamond, discovered in South Africa in 1905. Graff described the stone as ""the world's most valuable rough diamond"".

Dyson to make electric cars from 2020,"Sir James Dyson accused the mainstream car industry of polluting the world with diesel emissions Dyson, the engineering company best known for its vacuum cleaners and fans, plans to spend Â£2bn developing a ""radical"" electric car. The battery-powered vehicle is due to be launched in 2020. Dyson says 400 staff have been working on the secret project for the past two years at its headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. However, the car does not yet exist, with no prototype built, and a factory site is yet to be chosen. Sir James declined to give further details of the project. ""Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential,"" he told staff in an email. Important points that are undecided or secret include the firm's expected annual production total, the cost of the car, or its range or top speed. Sir James said about Â£1bn would be spent on developing the car, with another Â£1bn on making the battery. It was a slightly unusual launch, but then, Sir James Dyson likes to be different. In a small room above his swanky London shop he told us about his vision for a clean car. First up, we were treated to an old clip of Blue Peter, from the 90s, where Anthea Turner interviewed him about his new device to clean soot from the exhaust of diesel vehicles... it was the cyclone from his vacuum cleaner, put to a different use. ""That is how long I have wanted to do this,"" he told us. In fact he first hatched the idea in the late 1980s. Since then, he has developed motors and batteries and now he is able to bring all that expertise together in a new, electric car. He promised that it will be radical and different, because, as he put it, what is the point of making it like any other car? And he promised that it will not be cheap. I did ask how much it would be to put down a deposit... he told me he would have to think about it. Further development work will take place at a former RAF base at Hullavington in Wiltshire, where staff will move to in February. Sir James also said that his firm's car would look ""radical and different"", but will not be aimed at the mass market. The motor is designed and ready to go, he said, but the firm is still designing the car. Dyson's decision means it is joining the rush within the global car industry to develop and make electric cars. Dyson hopes to challenge other electric car manufacturers such as Tesla Some manufacturers such as Nissan, Tesla, Renault, BMW and Hyundai already manufacture them. Others such as VW, Volvo, Mercedes, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover have announced plans to sell electric or hybrid versions of their existing petrol and diesel engine ranges. VW, for instance, plans to spend 20bn euros (Â£17.5bn) by 2030 to develop its battery powered vehicles. Sir James said he had been interested since 1990 in developing filtration technology to stop vehicle diesel emissions polluting the environment. But as the motor industry had shown no interest in adopting this idea, he would instead join the fast-growing trend to make electric vehicles. The electric car market is growing rapidly, but it is also about to become a lot more crowded. Within the next few years, many new models are due to come on to the market, including Jaguar's Ipace, Porsche's Mission E, Volkswagen's I.D. family and Mercedes' EQ range. Tesla also has big plans for its recently launched Model 3. They will be joining established models such as the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Renault Zoe and the Tesla Model S. Dyson clearly sees an opportunity here. As new designs become available, and prices come down, more consumers will be willing to try electric vehicles. Policymakers, concerned about air pollution, want them to do just that. The big question is whether Dyson can muscle in on territory that the major manufacturers are already trying to make their own. And let's not forget Google's designs on the electric/self-driving market. Tesla was able to build a new car brand from scratch, but only by producing a design which effectively moved the goalposts and changed people's expectations of what an electric car could provide. If Dyson wants to play with the big boys, it may have to pull off a similar trick. Why switching to fully electric cars will take time VW plans electric option for all models Luxury carmakers unveil electric plans Electric Nissan Leaf revamp goes further BMW unveils electric Mini car design Renault-Nissan electrifies China push How electric is Volvo's future?

'We are Generation Z and we're not lazy',"Newsbeat has commissioned the BBC's biggest ever survey of the attitudes of 16 to 22-year-olds and found a generation wanting to fight back against a perception from older people that they're ""lazy"" and ""social media obsessed"". In fact, it's a group which believes it prioritises family and education over going out and the internet. It's a generation more optimistic about its future than older generations think it should be - and one which sees itself as hard-working and creative. We've talked to four people from Generation Z to see what they believe, what drives them and what they fear. Charlotte Danks, who's from Newquay in Cornwall, says she decided to start her own business selling cut-price food to locals after being laid off repeatedly. The 22-year-old says she always wanted a career where she could help her community - but it hasn't been easy. ""I've had a lot of stick,"" she says. ""I've had people spit in my face. I've had people throw products at me. ""But at the end of the day I'm helping my community and I've got a lot of support behind me."" Charlotte's local community describes her as ""a godsend"". #GenZ,external Charlotte opened her first 25p Affordable Foods store in Newquay but now has others in St Austell, Bude, Bodmin and Truro. She says older generations who think her generation is lazy are wrong. ""If our generation's lazy, then every generation is lazy. We all want something, but we're all fighting for the same thing. ""I think people my age need to get more of an opportunity and a chance to prove ourselves."" Eighteen-year-old Ife, from Hackney in east London, was a member of England's winning team at last year's World Schools Debating Championships in Germany and used to be the youth MP for Shoreditch. Despite his achievements, he says he still suffers from anxiety. And he says many people in Generation Z have mental health issues because they're unsure what the future will bring. ""We grew up in a generation which felt really insecure for a number of reasons. ""We're constantly told things are going badly. So you're aware there's a housing crisis, you're aware you're going to be in debt and you have no idea how you're going to find success. ""I feel like I can't plan my life."" Declan James is from Selby in North Yorkshire, is in the merchant navy and lives with his mum and dad, his gran and granddad and his girlfriend. His grandfather has Alzheimer's and he takes him to a singing group which helps him cope with the disease. Declan's grandad has Alzheimer's but he won't let it change his relationship with him #GenZ,external ""It cheers him up and puts him in a good mood. It's something he enjoys doing and I don't know whether you'd call it a coping strategy, but all we know is that he likes it, so we'll do it. ""[But] the banter is still there and it's great to grow up with that. I'd like to think of myself as a good person and it comes from the whole family unit."" Jack Raynsford is a cosplay enthusiast from Surrey and says they became Jack just under three years ago. ""I think what non-binary means to me, is distancing myself from the expectations. So if you're male you should be one way, if you're female you should be another. ""It's me going, 'I'm not either of those. I don't want to be either of those. I'm just going to be here in the middle being me.' ""Our expectations and our roles of, 'This is what women do, this is what men do. We can't go outside that' is incredibly limiting. ""It's quite useful to have this shift and this understanding of non-binary genders so people can really think about what their gender means to them and what makes them happy, rather than what they're expected to do.""

Kuenssberg: Buoyant Labour ponders route to power,"This video can not be played In full: Jeremy Corbyn interview at Labour's conference Even before John McDonnell told activists last night in Brighton that Labour had to prepare for the possibility of a run on the pound if they win the next election, however unlikely, there was a question drifting around the Labour conference this week. Labour made huge progress in June, but didn't win, however buoyant they feel this week. How radical should they be next time round? Would victory be secured by being more, or less radical? There are different answers to that question and different answers among senior MPs. There's huge energy and excitement among Jeremy Corbyn's supporters here. The shadow chancellor's bold promise to bring PFI contracts back into public control was given a rapturous reception on the conference floor. But then this morning, the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth suggested that perhaps there is only a problem with a ""handful"" of the contracts, and that they could be renegotiated, rather than taken back into public control. It's only one policy area, but it does sum up the quandary. How radical should Labour really be? Would they win the next time if they move further to the left, be even bolder than many of Mr Corbyn's backers would desire? Or as one member of the shadow cabinet suggested to me yesterday, they have to put pragmatism first. Live: Labour conference latest Labour 'war-gaming for run on pound' Labour demands Â£500m NHS bailout There's a risk, they said, that the ""Corbynistas all get carried away with themselves"". Should it be more, or less? The election showed that in some parts of the country, particularly in London and in university towns with large populations of young people, Mr Corbyn's left-wing credentials had huge appeal. But a study by John Healey, the shadow housing minister, outlines the next big challenge. Labour can't just win in big cities, they have to reach other parts of the country, and other demographics. Healey's analysis shows that Labour gets to govern when they win in the 16 New Towns dotted around England - constituencies like Milton Keynes, Stevenage, Bracknell, Corby - the list goes on. In 1997 they won all but one of the New Towns. By 2010 they held only one, Telford. As Healey writes, ""the New Towns are a lens to give a fine-resolution focus on Labour's big electoral challenge in Middle England"". Their concerns, he says, are ""immigration, the economy and competence"". Having talked to Labour activists in those towns, he found that while Labour picked up support from young people, they had to do more for what's described as ""stable families and older voters"". There was concern that ""Labour has become a party that represents the London boroughs only"". One supporter in a focus group said ""Labour has to position itself as the party that understands and will deliver on working class aspirations"" while another said ""this manifesto was perceived as a bit of a 'free-for-all' with many self employed and small business owners sceptical"". Most revealingly perhaps, Labour activists said, ""white working class voters feel Labour has become young, idealist and cosmopolitan"". Those ""young, idealistic and cosmopolitan"" voters are in huge evidence here this week and gave Labour a dramatic bounce at the election. And it's Mr Corbyn's radical policies that pulled them in. But those voters in New Towns described in Healey's report, genuine voices of Middle England, are still hesitant. Labour has made progress but many MPs believe they can't win convincingly if they pursue 'more', not 'less'. Perhaps the challenge for Mr Corbyn and Labour now is to live by his slogan, and create policies that talk to the many, rather than the comparative few.

Reality Check: Can good mood boost flu jab effect?,"Can being in a positive mood really make the flu vaccination more effective? Researchers at the University of Nottingham have suggested there is a link between the two. But we don't yet know whether it's being happy that causes the flu jab to work better, or if there's something else at play. A group of 138 adults between the ages of 65 and 85 were given a flu jab and asked to record their psychological state for two weeks before and four weeks after the vaccine. They had to answer questions like, ""How energised do you feel?"" and, ""How out of control do you feel?"" on a scale of one to five. The researchers found a link between those who recorded a good mood throughout the six-week observation period, and levels of flu protection detected in a person's blood four months later. But there was an even stronger link found between the jab's effectiveness and being in a good mood on the day of the vaccine itself. It's important to note we only know that people in a good mood on the day of their jab were more likely to have more antibodies in their blood afterwards, not whether it's the good mood itself causing this effect. Establishing causation rather than just correlation is a constant challenge faced by researchers. One often-cited example used to explain this is the link between ice-cream sales and murder rates: as ice-cream sales go up, so do murder rates. But Mr Whippys aren't causing people to commit crimes - there is another variable: heat. In hot weather, more people buy ice-creams and they are also more likely to commit crimes. And it's the same in this study - it's possible something else is causing the improved vaccine response. In this case, it might be that happier people are more likely to take care of their health, for example eating better and exercising, and this may cause their immune systems to be stronger. It could be the resulting stronger immune system that's causing that group of people to have more antibodies after a flu jab, not the good mood itself. And although the researchers tested flu-specific antibodies, they didn't look at what proportion were actually virus-killing. Amount of antibodies in the blood gives a good indication but not a definitive guarantee that someone might then be better able to fight off flu. There may be other factors influencing a vaccine's effectiveness, too. Some research has suggested vaccines administered in the morning are more effective than those received later in the day. And researchers at Yale University have found evidence that our genes influence how well we will respond to flu vaccines. The effectiveness of flu vaccinations varies widely among individuals. Older people, who are most vulnerable to complications from flu, seem to gain the least benefit from the vaccine. One of the striking things about the University of Nottingham study is it tested a number of other factors - nutrition, exercise, sleep - and found none of these influenced people's response to the vaccine. Of the things they tested, only participants' psychological state seemed to predict how well they would respond. But the study is potentially flawed in that it used the same vaccine in its trial as had been administered in the general population the year before. This meant the majority of the participants already had some residual immunisation. One of the study's authors, Prof Kavita Vedhara says diet and exercise may have had a greater effect if participants had been given a new strain of vaccination, or it may be that mood really is the dominant factor in predicting how effective a flu jab will be. But we can't know without further testing. There is a larger body of research suggesting low mood is linked to poorer response to vaccines, and to poorer health in general. That feeling depressed suppresses your immune system is fairly well-documented. An analysis of 13 studies published in 2009 found that people with higher stress levels had a decreased antibody response to the flu vaccine. But Prof Vedhara says these are not two sides of the same coin, although they are highly correlated. The effect of a good mood in improving a person's response to vaccines is independent of the effect of a negative mood in lowering vaccination response, she says. The team involved in this study now plan to conduct clinical trials, to attempt to show whether good moods actually cause flu jabs to work better in older people.

Why are sexual offences increasing in Scotland?,"The number of sexual offences reported to the police in Scotland hasreached its highest level since comparable records beganin 1971. The latest statistics showed that more than 10,800 sexual offences were recorded last year, an increase of 5% since the previous year and 60% more than the 6,552 crimes recorded in 2007/08. There were just 4,611 reported sexual offences in 1971, and sexual crimes have been on a long-term upward trend since 1974. The numbers have increased in each consecutive year since 2008/09. But what is behind the rise? The rise in recorded sexual offences is partly due to the increasing number of victims coming forward several years or even decades after the crimes were committed against them. Of the 4,281 sexual assault offences recorded by police last year, more than a third - 1,705 - were committed before December 2010, when the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act came into force. Campaigners believe that the successful outcome of many of these historical cases gives other survivors confidence that they will be listened to and believed by the police, regardless of how long ago the offences happened. Media coverage may also have led to the identification of further survivors who previously may not have reported crimes to the police. Similarly, the authorities and campaigners believe that awareness-raising campaigns and changes in social attitudes, as well as changes in the law, mean victims of more recent rapes and sexual assaults are also more likely to contact the police than they had been in the past. However, even with those advances, sexual offences continue to be under reported - with astudy last year suggestingthat fewer than one in five people in Scotland who say they have been a victim of rape have reported it to the police. So the 1,878 rapes and attempted rapes, and 4,281 sexual assaults, recorded by the police last year are likely to be merely the tip of the iceberg. Victims of online sexual offences are most likely to be teenage girls New technology has led to a sharp increase in the number of ""cyber enabled"" offences - where the internet is used to commit the crime - in recent years. Many of these online offences involve the perpetrator sending unwanted explicit messages or images to their victim, often through mobile phones. Researchers have estimated that online offences were responsible for about half of the growth in all sexual crimes recorded by the police between 2013/14 and 2016/17, and now account for 20% of all recorded sexual crimes. Three-quarters of victims are under the age of 16, with perpetrators also likely to be teenagers - with more than half aged under 20. The vast majority of victims are female - and the vast majority of perpetrators male. Cyber enabled crimes are most likely to be reported by a relative or guardian (38%), followed by the victim themselves (34%). The police also point to their relative success in identifying people who download or share child abuse images online - with 649 cases recorded in Scotland last year, compared with just 69 in 2009/10. And online child sexual abuse, which includes grooming and exploitation, has also seen an increase in reporting, not only from victims but concerned members of the public. The Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act, which came into force on 1 December 2010, widened the definition of rape - making comparisons with rape and attempted rape statistics before and after that year difficult. The act also saw crimes such as indecent communication and voyeurism, which had previously often been recorded as breach of the peace, reclassified as sexual offences. Crimes associated with prostitution now account for just 3% of sexual crimes, and have decreased dramatically over the past decade. However, there was a 23% increase from 247 in 2015/16 to 303 in 2016/17. The majority of crimes in this category (87%) are recorded in Aberdeen City and Glasgow City. The number of prostitution-related crimes in both of these council areas has more than halved in the past ten years, but both recorded an increase last year -  from 76 to 105 in Aberdeen and from 137 to 158 in Glasgow. Recorded crime in Scotland is not directly comparable with England and Wales or Northern Ireland due to differences in legislation and counting rules. But there is an upward trend for sexual crimes across the UK. Between 2015/16 and 2016/17, sexual crimes in England and Wales increased by 14% compared with 5% in Scotland and 4% in Northern Ireland. In the five years from 2011/12 to 2016/17, sexual crimes in England and Wales increased by 130% compared with 47% in Scotland and 74% in Northern Ireland. Like their colleagues in Scotland, the authorities in England and Wales believe that the increase in recent years is likely to reflect a greater willingness of victims to come forward to report such crimes. And they say it may also reflect changes in recording practice rather than actual victimisation. Officials in Northern Ireland have suggested that the rise there may in part be due to improved recording of sexual offences as a result of clarification from the Home Office in relation to the issue of consent.

The disorder that makes people unable to feel love,"This video can not be played During one episode, Sarah remembers seeing her hands in 2D For people living with depersonalisation disorder the world appears unreal, as if through a haze or fog - or even in 2D. One in 100 people is thought to have the condition, but experts are warning it is not included in any GP training. ""Relationships you know you value deeply lose their essential quality,"" Sarah tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""You know you love your family, but you know it academically - rather than feeling it in the normal way."" Sarah is an actress. She's used to playing roles and projecting emotion. Yet for long stretches of her own adult life, she herself has been emotionally numb - unable to feel. This is the result of a little-known mental-health condition called depersonalisation disorder. Sarah has had three chronic episodes of the disorder. The first came while studying for her final exams. It is characterised by a sense of disconnect from the world around you, and your own body, and is believed to start as a defence mechanism - helping people to cope in periods of acute anxiety or trauma by switching off reality. It can also be triggered by drugs such as cannabis. Sarah says, with depersonalisation disorder, familiar places feel like film sets For those with it, the world can change in an instant. ""It was a sudden flick of a switch. Things felt really alien and threatening,"" says Sarah. ""Suddenly your flat or somewhere that is very, very familiar to you will suddenly feel like a film set, and your possessions feel like props."" Others have terrifying out-of-body experiences, feel like their own body parts don't belong to them and even see the world in 2D - as if it were flat. For Sarah, this is what happened during her second episode. ""I was reading, holding a book, and suddenly my hands looked like a picture of a pair of hands. ""I felt this separation between the physical world and my perception of it."" Watch Adam Eley's full filmon depersonalisation disorder on the Victoria Derbyshire programme's website. This isn't, however, a rare disorder. One in 100 people is estimated to have it as a mental health condition, according to three separate studies. Experts say it is as widespread as conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, and it has been a medically recognised disorder for decades. Some patients, if untreated, can have it for their entire lives. Yet few medical professionals have heard of it. One newly qualified doctor - who has the condition - says there was no mention of depersonalisation disorder in either his GP training or at medical school. He admits to wrongly diagnosing at least two of his own patients in the past, and says he would be ""very surprised"" if any of his colleagues had heard of the condition. Sarah says she has seen ""possibly up to 20 people over the years who haven't known what I was talking about - community psychiatric nurses, GPs, therapists, counsellors"". Dr Elaine Hunter runs the only specialist clinic for depersonalisation disorder in the UK The Royal College of GPs said mental health was a ""key part"" of its ""extensive training curriculum"". Areas of training ""including complex mental health problems... are being developed,"" it added. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said ""we must ensure that knowledge of this condition is improved"". Poor diagnosis rates, however, are only one part of the problem. Another is access to treatment. There is only one specialist clinic in the UK, and it has limited resources - seeing fewer than 80 patients a year, compared with the 650,000 people estimated to be living with the condition. Access to the clinic on the NHS requires funding from the local clinical commissioning group, but even with a diagnosis this can take months or even longer. After a year of waiting, Sarah decided her only choice was to self-fund. ""I was having panic attacks regularly. I was really, really scared. ""I felt like I was in crisis,"" she says. The specialist clinic - the Depersonalisation Disorder Service at South London and Maudsley NHS Trust - is also limited to over-18s, having been designated an adult-only service. This is despite the condition often forming in adolescence. Dr Elaine Hunter, who runs it, is concerned that she is having to turn children and young people away. ""We sometimes get very distressed and upset patients who have a 15-year-old who is terrifiedâ¦ and there's not very much we can do."" One patient she has recently seen as an adult developed the condition aged 13, and was unable to leave the house for two years - having 10 or more panic attacks a day as a result of the anxiety depersonalisation disorder caused. At first she was unable to recognise her own parents. Dr Hunter hopes in time services for under-18s will become available. She also wants treatment to be made available to patients locally, by training ""depersonalisation disorder leads"" at each NHS mental health trust, who can then share their knowledge with others. She has also developed a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specifically designed for depersonalisation disorder, which she believes medical professions with a grounding in the talking therapy would be able to learn with training. Sarah Ashley ""couldn't eat, couldn't sleep"" before she began her CBT with Dr Hunter One of Dr Hunter's patients, Sarah Ashley, a sales manager, says she has noticed a ""huge, huge difference"" in her mental health, despite being initially sceptical. ""[Before CBT] I'd look down at my hands or parts of my body and feel they're not mine. I'd look in the mirror and it would be like looking at someone else,"" she says. ""I couldn't eat, couldn't sleepâ¦ [weighed] six and a half stone from all the anxiety from it. ""Whereas now, I do get a bit of depersonalisation, but I can deal with it really quickly."" Treatment, then, is available, but currently limited in scope and difficult to access. Dr Hunter says it should not be the case that people are ""finding their symptoms through Google"" and having to tell their GP: ""This is what I've got"", rather than the other way round.

"Lazy and selfish? Not us, say Gen Z","Sexuality, jobs and hope for the future were the big topics at Newsbeat's debate in Birmingham. Eighty 16 to 22-year-olds shared their views on life as Generation Z. It followed a survey carried out by Ipsos for Newsbeat, which revealed some in older generations view them as lazy and selfish. But more than 1,000 people from Generation Z told us they care most about family and education, not celebrity and social media. Newsbeat also asked 2,004 23 to 71-year-olds how they view people younger then them. Here are some of the main findings and reactions from the debate, hosted by Newsbeat's Tina Daheley and Nick Rotherham. The survey suggests a difference in attitudes to sexuality - with two-thirds of 16 to 22-year-olds saying they're ""only attracted to the opposite sex"". That's compared with 88% of baby boomers and 85% of Generation X. ""This is the first time I've ever admitted it in public. I'm bisexual,"" said 16-year-old Andy, who came out during the debate. ""It's been really difficult for me because there is so much stereotyping."" Like Andy, almost one in 10 in Generation Z say they're ""equally attracted to both sexes"". ""It's not something I can change,"" he explains. ""I truly believe it's the way I was born, and I'm sick of people telling me I have to be a different way."" See Andy coming out as bisexual during Newsbeat's debate in Birmingham.,external While older people think social media, going out and the internet are the most important things to 16 to 22-year-olds right now, Generation Z has a different set of priorities. The Newsbeat research suggests family, partners and education are the most important things to them. The cost of going to university is a big concern for many. ""It's shocking the amount of money we have to pay to be educated in this country,"" Chidera Eggerue, who blogs as The Slumflower, said at the debate. ""I studied fashion design and development at uni. It was going great until I got to final year and realised my mental health just wasn't up to par any more. ""I ended up failing the course, but I've got to pay all that money back, and the money accumulated comes to the cost of a brand new shiny Range Rover, that I can't afford."" Despite older people being pessimistic about the future for Generation Z, the people most positive about their own future are 16 to 22-year-olds. Among baby boomers, 54% thought their lives will be worse. But only 41% of people actually in Generation Z agreed. ""I'm super optimistic [because] as soon as I graduated on Friday I was in a job,"" 22-year-old Michelle said during the debate. ""I work hard. Through uni I did two, three jobs in retail, I did bar work, and then did placements. ""It's so competitive. It's not luck, it's grafting."" But 17-year-old Faye says low wages make it difficult to plan for her future. ""It's so disheartening with the minimum wage being lower for 16 and 17-year-olds.  I work at a children's theme park and I get paid Â£4.60 an hour. ""I'd like to say I'm optimistic, but it's very unclear and we don't get a lot of guidance."" The different generations were asked about the most important issues which need to be addressed in Britain. All ranked improving the NHS, preventing acts of terrorism and making the economy work after Brexit in their top three. But there were notable issues which under-22s listed as more important - including prejudice towards LGBTQ+ people, gender equality and racism. The research suggests three-quarters of Generation Z uses Facebook with Twitter way behind on 44%. Emily, 17, says it's not just for connecting with friends - but also building your career. ""A lot of people use social media to plug their businesses. We're not just using social media for our own vain reasons."" YouTuber Elias Riadi agrees. ""Social media is a positive. It's shaped my career. I don't have a CV. I use Instagram as a CV."" While most 16 to 22-year-olds use Facebook, they're much more likely than older generations to use Instagram (59% compared to 21%), Snapchat (56% compared to 9%), Tumblr (17% compared to 3%) and Twitch (13% compared to 2%). ""We're making ourselves more creative to find those ways to get into work,"" says 22-year-old Adrian. ""So if it's not the traditional ways, we're going to get more creative and go to Instagram, Twitter, we're going to go to Facebook. ""I don't think we're lazy, we're innovative."" The Ipsos research is based on replies from 3,007 people,external- 1,003 from Generation Z, 660 people in Generation Y, 667 in Generation X and 677 baby boomers.

Corbyn: It's right to plan for run on pound,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: We have to scenario-plan so people know we're ready Jeremy Corbyn says it is ""right to look at all these scenarios"" after his shadow chancellor suggested that there could be a run on the pound if Labour went into government. John McDonnell said Labour was doing ""war-game-type scenario-planning"" for events such as ""a run on the pound"". He made the comments at a fringe event at the Labour conference. A party spokesman said the preparations were for events that could occur under any government. Labour gained 30 seats in June's general election, helping deprive the Conservatives of a majority, and the party says it is preparing for another snap poll. Mr Corbyn backed Mr McDonnell in an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, telling her that his colleague was ""making the point that you've got to look at all these things and all these scenarios"". ""John is right to look at all these scenarios because if we're going to move into government we need to know what we're going to doâ¦ but also look at all the scenarios we might face,"" he said. Conference Live: Tuesday as it happened Labour members back anti-Semitism action Labour proposes new tax on bookmakers Labour demands Â£500m NHS bailout Mr McDonnell had suggested a ""radical"" Labour government determined to do things differently would face a range of challenges and was seeking to ""answer the question about what happens when, or if, they come for us"". Asked about the ""they"" his colleague was referring to, Mr Corbyn said he thought Mr McDonnell was ""talking about the people John doesn't like"", before adding: ""I think he's looking back again to the experience of the past Labour governments."" Labour governments during the 1960s and 1970s came under financial pressure in the markets, leading them to devalue the pound, by lowering the exchange rate, on more than one occasion. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Got to look at all scenarios A run on the pound refers to a situation in which international investors and market speculators sell sterling and sell sterling assets en masse, forcing its value down. It last occurred in September 1992 when, on a day known as Black Wednesday, the falling value of sterling forced the then Conservative government to pull out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism after its attempts to support the currency failed. Mr Corbyn claimed there had ""effectively"" been a run on the pound since the Leave vote in the 2016 Brexit referendum, a result which led to a sharp drop in the value of sterling the next day - the pound has remained more than 10% below its pre-referendum levels. Labour's last election manifesto contained pledges to bring rail and water companies and Royal Mail back into public ownership as well as a number of other large spending commitments - to be funded by borrowing and higher taxes on business and the better-off. Speaking on Monday, Mr McDonnell said a future Labour administration would not be ""traditional"" and ""people want to know we're ready, and they want to know we've got a response to anything that could happen"". Labour, he argued, must ""scenario-plan"" for all kinds of potential challenges it might face in government ""bringing the relevant expertise together at every level to talk through what happens if there is such and such a reaction"". ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? I don't think there will be, but you never know. ""We've got to start work nowâ¦ how exactly are we going to manage these industries when we take them back into public ownership? And let's start doing the detailed work now. Let's start doing the consultations with consumers or passengers or whoever and also with local authorities and local councils or whoever."" A Labour spokesman said: ""This was an exercise not done by us but by members. The scenarios were to deal with numerous events such as national disasters and acts of terror that could occur under any government."" Speaking at the same conference fringe event as Mr McDonnell, former broadcaster Paul Mason warned the first six months of a Corbyn government would be ""like Stalingrad"", with attacks from the establishment. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Jeremy Corbyn Mark Serwotka, of the PCS union representing civil servants, said Labour would face ""huge"" opposition if it won power, predicting that ""all the usual arms of the ruling class will be brought to bear"". This included using financial markets to bring ""economic pressures"" including ""the flight of capital"" and trying to destabilise the economy, he said at a fringe event organised by the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group. He also said Labour would have to resist pressure from senior civil servants, ""Sir Humphreys"", who wanted to preserve the status quo. ""We have got to be prepared,"" he said. But the Conservatives said Labour's nationalisation plans, as well as its intention to buy out PFI contracts for the running of schools, hospitals and other public services, would result in ""a collapse in business investment and a crash in the value of the pound"". ""Labour's plans would go too far, and ordinary working people will end up footing the bill,"" Chancellor Philip Hammond said. And the Lib Dems said it was Labour's support for Brexit which risked an ""economic collapse"".

By Frank Gardner, BBC News This decree is huge for Saudi Arabia. For decades now, Saudi women, many of whom are extremely well-educated and ambitious, have been waiting for their chance to participate fully in their country's economy.

Bill Gates switches to Android phone,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed he uses an Android-powered smartphone, rather than a Windows one. ""Recently, I actually did switch to an Android phone,"" he said, speaking on Fox News Sunday. Microsoft's own Windows-powered phones have failed to make a significant impact on the smartphone market, which is dominated by devices running Google's Android operating system. However, Mr Gates said he had installed lots of Microsoft apps on his phone. When asked whether he also had an iPhone, perhaps as a secondary device, he replied: ""No, no iPhone."" He did not reveal which particular smartphone he currently uses. Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system was not widely adopted Microsoft struggled to make a success of its own mobile operating system, Windows Phone. In 2014, the software giant paid $7.2bn (Â£5.5bn) for Nokia's handset business, but Windows-powered phones accounted for fewer than 1% of global smartphone sales in 2016. Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, can power smartphones in addition to laptops, tablets and desktop computers. However, few Windows 10 smartphones have been released. In April, Microsoft started selling a customised version of Samsung's Galaxy 8 smartphone in its US stores. ""Microsoft's strategy under its current chief executive Satya Nadella is to make Microsoft apps and services widely available on Android and iPhone,"" said Ian Fogg, an analyst at the tech consultancy IHS Markit. ""That's where their customers are these days."" The ""Microsoft Edition"" phone comes with the firm's apps such as Office, Outlook email and its voice assistant Cortana included. ""It used to be putting the Windows operating system on everyone's phone was a priority, but now it's about selling services such as Office and Outlook email,"" said Mr Fogg. ""To do that, you have to make those services available on every device."" HP phone thinks it's a Windows PC.

Jaffa quake as McVitie's cuts pack sizes,"The number of Jaffa Cakes has been cut from 12 to 10 in the latest example of packaged food ""shrinkflation"". The packs weigh 122 grams rather than 150 grams, but McVitie's has cut the recommended price from Â£1.15 to 99p. Twin packs, which now have 20 cakes rather than 24, are now Â£1.89 rather than Â£2.19. ""These changes represent the same price per cake, however, pricing ultimately remains at the sole discretion of retailers,"" the firm said. Tesco and Sainsbury were both selling a box of 10 for Â£1. On online provider Ocado, the boxes were priced at Â£1.19. A McVitie's spokesman added: ""There is no change in the size, shape or weight of individual cakes in the McVitie's Jaffa Cake range."" That, of course, did not stop aficionados taking to Twitter to express their feelings about the ""Jaffa quake"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier this year McVitie's reduced the size of its dark chocolate digestive biscuits from 332g to 300g - a 10% reduction. It is far from the only company cutting the size of its products rather than raise prices following increases in costs. In July, the Office for National Statistics saidas many as 2,529 products had shrunk in sizeover the past five years, but were being sold for the same price. As well as confectionery, these included toothpaste, orange juice and toilet roll. Jaffa cakes were first produced by McVitie's in 1927. Contrary to popular belief, the main flavouring in the jam insert is apricot, with an added note of tangerine oil, although they are named after the Jaffa orange. The company was challenged by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise that a Jaffa cake was a biscuit and therefore subject to VAT. McVitie's says on its website that it ""successfully proved to the courts that a Jaffa cake is indeed a cake, and it is still VAT free to this day"".

Tusk: Not enough progress in Brexit talks,"European Council president Donald Tusk has said not enough progress has been made to move to the next phase of Brexit talks in Brussels. He said Theresa May's ""realistic"" speech on Friday showed the UK's ""philosophy of having a cake and eating it is finally coming to an end"". But he said ""there is not sufficient progress yet"". Mrs May had hoped her offer of a two-year transition period after Brexit would unblock talks in Brussels. 'No excuses' over Brexit progress - Davis 'Too early' to assess Brexit progress No deal in latest Scots-UK Brexit talks Emerging from Downing Street after talks with Mrs May, Mr Tusk said: ""I feel cautiously optimistic about the constructive and more realistic tone in the prime minister's speech in Florence and of our discussion today. ""This shows that the philosophy of having a cake and eating it, is finally at an end. At least I hope so. That's good news. ""But of course no-one will ever tell me that Brexit is a good thing because as I have always said, in fact, Brexit is only about damage control. ""And I didn't change my opinion.  I feel now we will discuss our future relations with the UK once there is so-called sufficient progress. ""The two sides are working and we will work hard at it. But if you ask me and if today member states ask me, I would say there is no sufficient progress yet. But we will work on it."" His words come a month before the European Council will decide whether sufficient progress has been made to begin trade talks, as the UK wants. Hesitant, understated, but with a very clear message. In fact, so quietly spoken those of us listening here, crouched beneath the cameras, a metre from his shoes, could barely hear his words. Two pieces of imagery have been frequently leaned on in updates on the Brexit negotiations. The EU has a love of noisy timepieces; all those references to ticking clocks. And the desire of some in the UK to have our cake and eat it crops up quite a bit too. Mr Tusk's ""hope"" that the references to gorging on confectionery are over stood out. But so too did his blunt assessment that more has to be achieved before the talks move on to the future relationship. So, for the prime minister, did her Florence speech do the business? From her perspective, it looks like it has worked a bit, but not yet enough. The council says it first wants more detail on citizen's rights, a financial settlement and the Irish border before turning to the kind of trade deal the UK will have with the EU after it leaves. Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is taking part in the fourth round of Brexit talks in Brussels, said that Mrs May had shown ""leadership and flexibility"" in her Florence speech and given reassurances on financial issues. There were ""no excuses for standing in the way of progress"", he insisted. But the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier called for a ""moment of clarity"" from the UK. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said he was ""keen and eager"" for the UK to translate the ""constructive"" sentiments in Mrs May's speech into firm negotiating positions on issues such as citizens' rights, the Irish border and financial issues, including the UK's so-called divorce bill. Remarking that it had been six months since the UK triggered Article 50, he said progress on these three fronts was essential to allow talks to move on to the future of the bilateral trade relationship, as the UK would like. ""We are six months into the process,"" he said. ""We are getting closer to the UK's withdrawal. I think this moment should be a moment of clarity."" This video can not be played Phillippe Lamberts: ""Sometimes I think this might be the factor that derails the Brexit negotiations even more than money"" Speaking ahead of her meeting with Mr Tusk, Mrs May said that ""by being creative"" the UK and the EU can maintain cooperation and partnership when the UK leaves the EU. And she said that ""things have moved on"" in terms of the discussions and negotiations in the Brexit talks.

Rapper raising funds to see if Earth is flat,"Spoiler: The Earth is not flat. But US rapper B.o.B. is crowd-funding the launch of satellites to see if he can get some evidence to the contrary. The rapper, whose real name is Bobby Ray Simmons Jr, has been a vocal proponent of the Flat Earth theory - the claim the Earth is, in fact, a disc and not spherical. Some proponents of the Flat Earth theory claim NASA employees guard the edge of the world to prevent people falling off. Seeking to raise $200,000 (Â£150,000)on the GoFundMe crowd-funding website,external, B.o.B refers to himself as ""Flat Earth Bob"". At the time of writing he had raised a little over $650, but the campaign was trending on the GoFundMe site. ""I'm starting this GoFundMe because I would like to send one, if not multiple satellites, as far into space as I can, or into orbit as I can, to find the curve,"" he said in a video on the page. ""I'm looking for the curve,"" he added. The curve which B.o.B refers to is a recurring theme in Flat Earthers' conspiracy theories. Adherents believe that, were the Earth actually round, then the curvature of the Earth would be more visible to the naked eye. BBC Bitesize: How do we know the Earth is spherical?

Shania Twain on new album - and voice,"Twain's last studio album was 2002's Up! After years out of the limelight, Shania Twain is back with her fifth studio album. We caught up with the 52-year-old country star during a hectic week of promo. Back in July 2003, Shania Twain performed in London's Hyde Park. I know because I was there, reporting on the gigfor this very website,external. If you'd have told either of us then it would take 14 years for her to sing there again, I doubt we would've believed you. Back then Shania - no surname required - was riding the crest of a wave. She'd had hit after hit, recorded the best-selling country album of all time (1997's Come On Over) and been the half-time act at the Super Bowl. Not long afterwards, though, it began to go wrong. Her marriage to producer Robert ""Mutt"" Lange collapsed, and she developed debilitating vocal problems that forced her to temporarily give up recording and performing. The comeback trail began in Las Vegas with a two-year residency at Caesars Palace that paved the wayfor a ""final"" tourin 2015. The singer has sold more than 90 million albums worldwide Now, 20 years on from Come On Over, Shania is back - with a new husband, a new album (called Now) and a new voice. ""It is different,"" she says of the celebrated purry twang that brought us tracks like You're Still The One, That Don't Impress Me Much and Man! I Feel Like A Woman. ""I've got smokier sounds I never had before, and I've got a lower register than I used to have before."" The singer blames Lyme disease for her dysphonia, an ailment that causes the vocal cords to seize up when speaking or singing. ""It'll never be solved,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's a permanent problem. ""But with a lot of physical and vocal therapy, I've got better at understanding my voice and better at managing it."" Our interview takes place towards the end of a hectic week that also includes appearances on The One Show, Strictly Come Dancing andRadio 2 Live in Hyde Park. If Shania is feeling the strain, though, it's not showing on a face once adjudged to havea perfect set of geometric measurements,external. Shania will be seen next year making her film acting debut Now, she insists, is not a break-up album - despite having songs that specifically reference the extramarital affair Lange had with her best friend. ""Can't believe he'd leave me to love her,"" she sings on Pour Me, the record's most transparently autobiographical number. ""That's my divorce low moment,"" she admits. ""That's me indulging and just feeling sorry for myself. But there are so many songs on the album that have nothing to do with my divorce at all. ""It's about the journey of my whole life and all the disappointments I've been through. It's about the ups as well as the downs."" The former are perhaps best illustrated by Life's About To Get Good, a breezy singalong that serves as the album's lead single. Thevideo for the song,externalwas shot in the Dominican Republic -thankfully before Hurricane Irma- and required the loan of a certain piece of headgear. ""I actually borrowed the Man! I Feel Like A Woman outfit for the video, top hat and all,"" she says of a costume that now has pride of place at Nashville'sCountry Music Hall of Fame,external. Earlier this month she appeared on the Strictly Come Dancing launch show ""It was really fun for me to revisit that image, but we had to rush it back for the display before anyone missed it."" It's a busy time for Shania, who'll be seen next year making her big-screen acting debut opposite John Travolta in racing car drama Trading Paint. ""John reached out and asked me to do it,"" she says of the Grease and Pulp Fiction star. ""I play a schoolteacher, so it's a whole new zone."" The new husband, by the way, is Frederic Thiebaud, the former husband of the same best friend with whom her ex had that affair. While we chat in an adjoining hotel room, the genial Swiss sits with a computer on his lap, hunting online for a vegetarian restaurant where they can have dinner later. I am sorely tempted to make a comment about Twains never meating, but I fear my pun may get lost in translation. Now is released on Virgin EMI on 29 September.

Victims win contaminated blood ruling,"Victims of the contaminated blood scandal in the 1970s and 1980s have won a ruling allowing them to launch a High Court action to seek damages. It was ""appropriate"" to issue an order allowing about 500 claimants to seek compensation, a court official said. But lawyers for the Department of Health argued this was ""premature"" as there was a public inquiry pending. At least 2,400 people died after they were given blood products that were infected with hepatitis C and HIV. Thousands of NHS patients were given the products, which came from abroad, including the US. In July, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a UK-wide inquiry into the scandal, which has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Contaminated blood scandal inquiry announced Blood Disaster: Families search for the truth Many of those affected believe recipients were not told of the risks involved and say there was a cover-up. The claimants allege that the Department of Health failed in its duty to take reasonable care to prevent injury or loss to NHS patients when the blood products were imported into the UK. The court official, Senior Master Fontaine, was told that more than 4,500 people contracted hepatitis C and/or HIV in the 1970s and 80s as a result of the blood products. Steven Snowden QC, appearing for the claimants, told the court it had recently transpired that information and documents which could have helped the victims and families in cases brought earlier had not been disclosed. He said that because of this, it would be ""unconscionable"" for the Department of Health to rely on earlier settlement agreements. Chris Smith, whose father Ray died aged 32 in 1986 as a result of blood contamination, was in court and welcomed the order. The 39-year-old from Bedford said: ""I have been dealing with this for 31 years. Now we have this information we want to see something done about it. ""This is more about truth than anything else - my dad is in his grave, for what?"" After the hearing, the Department of Health said in a statement that the scandal was ""an appalling tragedy which should simply never have happened"" and the government was ""committed to a full and transparent inquiry"". The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym said the ruling in favour of the surviving victims and families of the deceased was ""the beginning of a long process"". A recentparliamentary report,externalfound about 7,500 patients were infected by imported blood products. Many were patients with an inherited bleeding disorder called haemophilia. They needed regular treatment with a clotting agent Factor VIII, which is made from donated blood. The UK imported supplies and some turned out to be infected. Much of the plasma used to make Factor VIII came from donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. Jason Evans was just four years old when his father Jonathan, a haemophiliac, died after being infected with HIV through contaminated Factor VIII treatment. This video can not be played Jason Evans' father died of Aids after being infected with contaminated blood Jason recently discovered that in late 1984 his father had raised concerns with his doctors about Factor VIII, but he says he was told ""there was nothing to worry about, this is sensationalism and not to pay attention to it. And he trusted his doctor."" Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, Des Collins of Collins Solicitors, which represents Factor 8 - one of the campaign groups involved - said the public inquiry had ""at last indicated some willingness on the part of government to address the claimant's concerns"". ""Against this background it is regrettable that the secretary of state (for health) has not chosen to do so in these civil proceedings,"" he said. ""We welcome this opportunity to present the claimant's case to the court for the first time in over 25 years."" Families of those who died are being consulted about what form the inquiry should take. It could be a public Hillsborough-style inquiry or a judge-led statutory inquiry.

The family of strangers who fled Boko Haram,"Mohamed said he lost count of the number of people he was forced to kill Mohamed was forced to fight for Boko Haram until a commander's wife, Aisha, persuaded him to escape and a four-year-old boy tagged along. The BBC's Stephanie Hegarty met them in an army base in north-east Nigeria. A young boy is sitting under the shade of a wide neem tree, playing with sticks in the sand. A man, not his father, is watching him closely. And a woman, not his mother, picks him up to go inside. This mismatched family of three has been brought together by the most tragic of circumstance. Until very recently they were total strangers. But they have one thing in common, they were living with Boko Haram in a camp deep in the Sambisa forest before they escaped, just over a month ago. We came to this army base in the north-east to meet the man, Mohamed (not his real name). He was a member of Boko Haram until he decided to run away from the group and surrender to the Nigerian army. From what he tells me, Mohamed must be in his 30s but the wrinkled frown fixed around his eyes makes him look older. He is small with a sturdy frame and wearing a new stripy blue polo shirt given to him by the army - who have facilitated our meeting. When he came out of the forest he said he had nothing. Mohamed joined Boko Haram three years ago, when they took his home town of Banki. He had a small business there buying, selling and repairing mobile phones. As the militants approached, he ran hundreds of miles away towards the border with Cameroon. But a friend convinced him to come back to take care of his business, assuring him it would be OK. When he came back, the friend forced him to join the group. ""He made me carry his rifle,"" he said. ""I knew he was Boko Haram. I didn't want to join him but I didn't have a choice. I knew he would kill me."" For three weeks they rode around attacking villages in the area. He said he disagreed with what they were doing but he feared for his life. ""We were just roaming around from village to village to round up women to marry."" Soon afterwards, they were pushed out of Banki by the Nigerian army, to a base deep in the Sambisa forest - a vast area on the border between Nigeria and Cameroon. Much of Nigeria's north-east is still insecure ""Our camp was located deep inside the bush where there are big, big trees and we used aluminium roofing sheets to build big houses from mud where we all stayed,"" he said. ""There were about 500 in each camp. Each camp was named for a town. I counted at least 12 camps."" But the marauding continued. In his time with Boko Haram, Mohamed said he fought in six battles. ""When we captured a town, the emir that led the conquest would be the leader of that town. People were in their houses and we would go house-to-house collecting the women. ""Some of the men ran, but if they were members of the vigilante we would kill them. ""When we went out to attack, we shot indiscriminately, I have no way of knowing how many people I killed."" For the first few years, the militants seemed to be well funded. They paid foot soldiers a wage but when the army bombed the place where they kept the money those salaries dried up. So Mohamed set up shop in the forest, buying and selling phones. ""Everybody had a phone. If we go to war, they collected people's phones, they gave them to me and I would sell them."" Soon, he was appointed as a bodyguard to a senior commander and had some insight into the workings of the upper echelons of Boko Haram, although he didn't know where the money came from. He told me that as an ordinary soldier he never met the group's leader, Abubaker Shekau. But Shekau would send one of many emissaries from his hiding place to give orders to commanders. As a bodyguard, Mohamed was tasked with guarding the commander's young wife, Aisha (not her real name). In her desperation, Aisha persuaded Mohamed to run away Aisha was captured with her young daughter three years ago in the town of Mubi. She was forced to marry three times, each time chosen by a senior commander. ""The commander taught me how to shoot,"" Aisha told me. A few years into her detention, her two-year-old daughter got sick and died. She was desperate to escape. When we spoke, she shielded her lips with her headscarf. She was shy and soft-spoken but defiant. ""My husband knew I wanted to run away,"" she said. ""That's why he told his bodyguard to follow me everywhere"". But Aisha saw something in this bodyguard that she didn't see in other Boko Haram members. ""I knew he was a nice, kind-hearted man,"" she said. She decided to convince him to escape. The man who brought back the Chibok girls The town that lost its girls Torment of a freed Boko Haram 'bride' 'How I almost became a suicide bomber' They started plotting but Mohamed was afraid. He thought the military would punish him if they surrendered. But Aisha had listened to BBC Hausa radio programmes in the bush and heard that the army was offering amnesty to Boko Haram members who defected and she told him it would be OK. They were caught meeting late at night, the commander thought they were having an affair and they were tied up. But Aisha managed to loosen the rope around her wrists, she freed Mohamed and they ran. ""I knew the area very well so we just followed the bush,"" Mohamed explained. They reached a military roadblock and raised their hands in the air to surrender. Since the surrender they said the army has been treating them well. Though we spoke to them in the presence of an army spokesperson, they seemed relaxed. The Nigerian army has been waging a war against Boko Haram in the Sambisa forest Aisha and Mohamed put their escape down to the fact that Boko Haram was in disarray. One of the group's senior commanders and a founding member, Mamman Nur, defected last year to form his own faction. He took with him many militants and a lot of the arms, ammunition and even tanks that the group had amassed in attacks on the Nigerian army. According to Mohamed, the defection was the result of a profound ideological difference. ""Mamman Nur abhors Shekau's use of bombs in towns - the use of suicide bombers, especially women, to attack towns, churches, mosques and markets,"" he said. As I spoke to Aisha and Mohamed, the little boy who was with them roamed around under their watchful eyes - making the random exclamation of a happy four year old as he kicked about in the sand. When they ran out of the bush that night he had followed them, they explained. They didn't know his name but Aisha recognised his face - she had met him once with his mother in her life before Boko Haram. She doesn't know where his parents are now. We were told by the soldiers accompanying them that Aisha, Mohamed and the boy will be enrolled in a ""deradicalisation programme"", run by the Nigerian government. The government is hesitant to share any details of that programme. Now their future lies in the hands of the authorities and it is up to them whether this small family of strangers will be allowed to stay together or not. Boko Haram's founding leader Mohammed Yusuf was killed in police custody in 2009 Founded in 2002 Official Arabic name, Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, means ""People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad"" Initially focused on opposing Western education Launched military operations in 2009 to create Islamic state Designated a terrorist group by US in 2013 Who are Boko Haram?

Spanish holiday prices 'set to rise',"Travel company Thomas Cook has said it expects the price of Spanish holidays to rise by another 5% to 10% next year because of the weak pound. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser told the BBC that Spain's renewed popularity because of safety fears elsewhere was also driving prices higher. ""We have not enough beds for all the demand,"" he said. But he added that the firm was also seeing evidence that people were turning back to Egypt and Turkey. Last month, Thomas Cook said it hadresumed selling holidays in Tunisiato Britons for the first time since the attack at a resort in Sousse in 2015. Trips will resume in February 2018, after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)eased its travel advice,external. The FCO previously advised avoiding all but essential visits following the June 2015 beach attack, which killed 38 people, including 30 British tourists. Mr Fankhauser was speaking as the firm issueda trading statement,externalshowing bookings by UK holidaymakers had risen by 8% over the summer, while overall group bookings had gone up by 11%. The company said its winter programme was 37% sold so far, with UK bookings up 5%. Mr Fankhauser told the Today programme that both Egypt and Turkey were ""wonderful destinations"" that offered ""great value for money"". He said Thomas Cook tried to inform customers ""as best we can"" about the potential risks and let them make up their own minds about whether they wanted to go. Mr Fankhauser said Spanish hoteliers were ""taking a bit of an advantage"" of increased demand, but they were also investing their higher profits to improve their facilities.

Ouissem Medouni, 40, and Sabrina Kouider, 34, both of Wimbledon Park Road, Wandsworth, appeared at the Old Bailey for a preliminary hearing. The body was found in a garden in Southfields, south-west London. The victim has been named locally as Sophie Lionnet, 21, a nanny from Troyes, in north-eastern France. The pair are charged with murdering a ""person unknown"". The body - not yet formally identified - was discovered in the back garden of the house last Wednesday afternoon after police were called to reports of a fire. Police have been unable to tell the age or gender of the victim because the body was so badly charred. Ms Kouider sobbed throughout the hearing and shouted repeatedly ""I haven't done anything"" in French. An unidentified body was discovered last Wednesday afternoon Both Mr Medouni and Ms Kouider spoke to confirm their identities, assisted by a French interpreter in court. The pair were remanded in custody by Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC to appear at the Old Bailey for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 12 December. The trial is expected to start in March.

Ex-Newcastle United chairman Shepherd dies,"Mr Shepherd sold his share in Newcastle United to current owner Mike Ashley Former Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd has died at the age of 75, his family have said in a statement. The multi-millionaire was involved in a number of regeneration projects through his company Shepherd Offshore. He sold his stake in the club to current owner Mike Ashley in June 2007. He was the subject of a Sunday newspaper expose in the 1990s in which he and fellow director Douglas Hall were recorded calling female football supporters ""dogs"". Reaction to this and other stories from across the North East. The family statement said: ""Freddy Shepherd, former chairman of Newcastle United and chairman of Shepherd Offshore Group and Triple S Sports & Entertainment Group, sadly passed away peacefully at his home last night. ""At this difficult time the family have asked that their privacy be respected."" Born and bred in the North East, Mr Shepherd was the owner and managing director of the Shepherd Offshore Group for more than 40 years. He set up the Triple S group in 2008, but is best known for his influential role at Newcastle United. A director of the Magpies from 1992 until 2007, he served as vice-chairman to Sir John Hall as the club finished Premier League runners-up in both 1996 and 1997. He also played a key role in appointing Kevin Keegan as manager and signing Alan Shearer from Blackburn for a then world-record fee of Â£15m. The former Newcastle striker posted on Twitter: ""So sad to hear my great friend and former @NUFC chairman Freddy Shepherd has passed away. I owe him a huge debt for bringing me home. RIP."" Mr Shepherd's family paid for a Â£250,000 statue of Shearer to be erected outside St James' in September last year. This video can not be played Shearer pays tribute to former Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd A short club statement said: ""We are saddened to hear of the passing of former Newcastle United chairman, Freddy Shepherd. Our thoughts are with his family and friends."" Mr Shepherd and Mr Hall's comments, which were reported by the News of the World, sparked a furious reaction from fans and fellow board members, who urged them to resign. Both stepped down in 1998 amid threats from other directors to quit if they refused to go. Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said: ""Freddy was an extraordinarily successful self-made millionaire who never forgot his roots in the east end of the city. ""Along with his brother Bruce he worked tirelessly to create jobs on the North Bank of the Tyne, bringing industries and skills back to life. ""He was a great entrepreneur and business leader, very forthright in his views and never shy to express an opinion, a real Geordie at heart.""

Laura Kuenssberg: Buoyant Labour ponders route to power,"This video can not be played In full: Jeremy Corbyn interview at Labour's conference Even before John McDonnell told activists last night in Brighton that Labour had to prepare for the possibility of a run on the pound if they win the next election, however unlikely, there was a question drifting around the Labour conference this week. Labour made huge progress in June, but didn't win, however buoyant they feel this week. How radical should they be next time round? Would victory be secured by being more, or less radical? There are different answers to that question and different answers among senior MPs. There's huge energy and excitement among Jeremy Corbyn's supporters here. The shadow chancellor's bold promise to bring PFI contracts back into public control was given a rapturous reception on the conference floor. But then this morning, the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth suggested that perhaps there is only a problem with a ""handful"" of the contracts, and that they could be renegotiated, rather than taken back into public control. It's only one policy area, but it does sum up the quandary. How radical should Labour really be? Would they win the next time if they move further to the left, be even bolder than many of Mr Corbyn's backers would desire? Or as one member of the shadow cabinet suggested to me yesterday, they have to put pragmatism first. Live: Labour conference latest Labour 'war-gaming for run on pound' Labour demands Â£500m NHS bailout There's a risk, they said, that the ""Corbynistas all get carried away with themselves"". Should it be more, or less? The election showed that in some parts of the country, particularly in London and in university towns with large populations of young people, Mr Corbyn's left-wing credentials had huge appeal. But a study by John Healey, the shadow housing minister, outlines the next big challenge. Labour can't just win in big cities, they have to reach other parts of the country, and other demographics. Healey's analysis shows that Labour gets to govern when they win in the 16 New Towns dotted around England - constituencies like Milton Keynes, Stevenage, Bracknell, Corby - the list goes on. In 1997 they won all but one of the New Towns. By 2010 they held only one, Telford. As Healey writes, ""the New Towns are a lens to give a fine-resolution focus on Labour's big electoral challenge in Middle England"". Their concerns, he says, are ""immigration, the economy and competence"". Having talked to Labour activists in those towns, he found that while Labour picked up support from young people, they had to do more for what's described as ""stable families and older voters"". There was concern that ""Labour has become a party that represents the London boroughs only"". One supporter in a focus group said ""Labour has to position itself as the party that understands and will deliver on working class aspirations"" while another said ""this manifesto was perceived as a bit of a 'free-for-all' with many self employed and small business owners sceptical"". Most revealingly perhaps, Labour activists said, ""white working class voters feel Labour has become young, idealist and cosmopolitan"". Those ""young, idealistic and cosmopolitan"" voters are in huge evidence here this week and gave Labour a dramatic bounce at the election. And it's Mr Corbyn's radical policies that pulled them in. But those voters in New Towns described in Healey's report, genuine voices of Middle England, are still hesitant. Labour has made progress but many MPs believe they can't win convincingly if they pursue 'more', not 'less'. Perhaps the challenge for Mr Corbyn and Labour now is to live by his slogan, and create policies that talk to the many, rather than the comparative few.

Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea,"As North Korea and the United States continue to trade threats, we have little idea how the war of words is perceived to the people of North Korea because the regime of Kim Jong-un maintains an iron grip over the population, carefully controlling access to the outside world. The country is often depicted as isolated and thoroughly out of step with the 21st century. Statistics are hard to get and often based on estimates, but what can they tell us about life in the North? Kim Il-sung effectively founded North Korea in 1948 and his family dynasty has ruled the country ever since, with control passing from father to son. In the same period South Korea has managed six republics, a revolution, a couple of coups and the transition to free and fair elections. In total 12 presidents have led the country, covering 19 terms of office. Three million mobile phones might seem like a lot - but in a country of 25 million it amounts to just over one out of every ten people. Most mobile users are likely to be concentrated in the capital Pyongyang. By contrast, with a population of some 51 million there are more mobile phone subscriptions than people in South Korea. With effectively a single network, Koryolink, North Korea's mobile market is limited but growing. Originally established as a partnership with Egyptian telecom firm Orascom, it was for many years the only option. However, in 2015 Orascom discovered that North Korea was setting up a rival network, Byol, and was forced to disclose to investors that it had effectively lost control over the service's three million plus subscribers. There's reason to be sceptical about those subscriber numbers though. Research by theUS-Korea Institute at SAIS,externalsuggests that some growth might be down to North Koreans calculating that it's cheaper to buy an additional subscription than additional air time. As well as a scarcity of mobiles, the vast majority of North Koreans are only permitted access to the country's 'private internet' - effectively a closed intranet operating on a national scale. Reports in 2016 suggested that North Korea has just 28 registered domains. It may sound like an urban myth, but there is some research to suggest that North Korean men are on average shorter than their South Korean counterparts. Professor Daniel Schwekendiek from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul studied the heights of North Korean refugees measured when they crossed the border into South Korea and found an average 3-8cm (1.2 -3.1 inch) difference. Schwekendiek points out that the height difference cannot be attributed to genetics, because the two populations are the same. He also rejects criticism that suggests that refugees are more likely to be impoverished, and therefore of smaller stature. Food shortages are thought to be the main factor in why North Koreans are generally shorter. Read more: Are North Koreans really shorter than South Koreans? Images from North Korea's capital Pyongyang often show stretches of wide, pristine motorway  unoccupied by traffic, but outside the city it's another story. North Korea has some 25,554 km of roads, according to 2006 figures, but just 3% are actually paved,  amounting to a meagre 724km (449 miles). It's also estimated that only about 11 out of every 1,000 North Koreans owns a car, which means a long queue at the bus stop for most people who need to travel. Public transport is ubiquitous in North Korea North Korea relies on coal exports to keep its economy above water - but it's hard to measure their true value as the data comes from countries receiving the coal. Much of North Korea's coal is exported to China, which banned imports in February 2017. However some analysts question the nature of the sanction. ""There are folks who track ships and have seen North Korean ships docking at coal terminals at Chinese ports even after the ban. I do believe that China has disrupted coal imports, but not completely,"" says Kent Boydston, research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Until 1973 North and South Korea were pretty evenly matched in terms of wealth. Since then, South Korea has rocketed ahead to become one of the world's leading industrial producers, with companies like Samsung and Hyundai becoming global household names. North Korea stagnated in the 1980s as the country stuck rigidly to its state-run system. While North Korea is the 52nd largest country by population, it is considered to have the world's fourth largest army. Military spending is estimated to account for as much as 25% of GDP, and almost every North Korean man undergoes some form of military training. Read more about North Korea's military strength A series of famines in the late 1990s caused a sharp drop in life expectancy in North Korea, but even without that factor, the North lags nearly 12 years behind. Food shortages persist and are one of many reasons why South Koreans generally live longer. In 2017South Korea's birth rate hit a record lowas the country continued a decade-long struggle to boost the country's birth rate. It has spent about $70bn (Â£53bn) handing out baby bonuses, improving paternity leave and paying for infertility treatment. Produced by Alex Murray and Tom Housden.

Sadistic killer jailed for 39 years,"This video can not be played Webcam footage captures killer Jason Marshall with his victim Sadistic killer Jason Marshall, who was filmed murdering a man during a bondage sex session, has been jailed for 39 years. Marshall, 28, posed as an MI5 agent before torturing Peter Fasoli, 58, in his home in Northolt, west London. Following the January 2013 attack, he set fire to the bungalow. Mr Fasoli's death was thought to be due to the fire until a seven-hour recording of the night was found on his computer. Man 'murdered by fantasist in sex game' 'Bondage killer' murdered man in Italy 'PC fantasist' guilty of sex game murder Marshall was sentenced to life with a minimum of 39 years at the Old Bailey. He tortured his vulnerable victim for ""sexual gratification"" Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said in sentencing. Jason Marshall told the jury he had no memory of what happened The judge described it as a ""sadistic"" killing. ""You tortured him for so long because you enjoyed it so much,"" he said. ""I'm sure that you can have felt no remorse whatsoever for what you have done."" After the murder, Marshall fled to Rome using money and credit cards stolen from Mr Fasoli. In a further attempt to cover his tracks, Marshall continued sending messages over dating app Badoo - on which the pair had met - accusing Mr Fasoli of ignoring him and apologising for not turning up, police said. He was extradited after beingfound guilty of strangling a man to death and attacking another man in Italy. Less than three weeks after Mr Fasoli died, Marshall killed Vincenzo Iale, 67, using an electrical flex in his flat in Rome. Peter Fasoli's death was filmed on a computer in his north London bungalow Jurors were shown video recorded on Mr Fasoli's hard drive of Marshall tying him up, gagging him and smothering him with cling film. After killing Mr Fasoli, Marshall is seen ""calmly smoked a cigarette"". He then gathers his belongings, splashes a liquid round the bungalow and sets it alight, police said. The harrowing footage was found by the victim's nephew Christopher Murgatroyd, who examined his uncle's fire-damaged computer in November 2014 as part of research into his family tree. It was originally believed Mr Fasoli died in a fire in his bungalow Themurder trial heardhow former male escort Marshall stalked victims on Badoo. He arranged to meet Mr Fasoli on the pretext of a bondage sex session but planned to rob him. Marshall arrived dressed as a law enforcement agent, complete with handcuffs, holster and latex gloves. He ""arrested"" Mr Fasoli ""for being a spy"" and during his fake interrogation he threatened to cut his tongue with a large hunting knife to extract his PIN numbers. Marshall, from East Ham, east London, who is already serving 16 years for the attacks in Italy, claimed to be suffering from amnesia. Mitigating, Tomas Quinn said his client had a ""bizarre history"" of impersonating police officers, ticket inspectors and special constables. But he was not sophisticated, deliberate, long-term targeted or focused in his crimes, he said.

Labour 'war-gaming for run on pound',"This video can not be played John McDonnell: We have to scenario-plan so people know we're ready Jeremy Corbyn says it is ""right to look at all these scenarios"" after his shadow chancellor suggested that there could be a run on the pound if Labour went into government. John McDonnell said Labour was doing ""war-game-type scenario-planning"" for events such as ""a run on the pound"". He made the comments at a fringe event at the Labour conference. A party spokesman said the preparations were for events that could occur under any government. Labour gained 30 seats in June's general election, helping deprive the Conservatives of a majority, and the party says it is preparing for another snap poll. Mr Corbyn backed Mr McDonnell in an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, telling her that his colleague was ""making the point that you've got to look at all these things and all these scenarios"". ""John is right to look at all these scenarios because if we're going to move into government we need to know what we're going to doâ¦ but also look at all the scenarios we might face,"" he said. Conference Live: Tuesday as it happened Labour members back anti-Semitism action Labour proposes new tax on bookmakers Labour demands Â£500m NHS bailout Mr McDonnell had suggested a ""radical"" Labour government determined to do things differently would face a range of challenges and was seeking to ""answer the question about what happens when, or if, they come for us"". Asked about the ""they"" his colleague was referring to, Mr Corbyn said he thought Mr McDonnell was ""talking about the people John doesn't like"", before adding: ""I think he's looking back again to the experience of the past Labour governments."" Labour governments during the 1960s and 1970s came under financial pressure in the markets, leading them to devalue the pound, by lowering the exchange rate, on more than one occasion. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Got to look at all scenarios A run on the pound refers to a situation in which international investors and market speculators sell sterling and sell sterling assets en masse, forcing its value down. It last occurred in September 1992 when, on a day known as Black Wednesday, the falling value of sterling forced the then Conservative government to pull out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism after its attempts to support the currency failed. Mr Corbyn claimed there had ""effectively"" been a run on the pound since the Leave vote in the 2016 Brexit referendum, a result which led to a sharp drop in the value of sterling the next day - the pound has remained more than 10% below its pre-referendum levels. Labour's last election manifesto contained pledges to bring rail and water companies and Royal Mail back into public ownership as well as a number of other large spending commitments - to be funded by borrowing and higher taxes on business and the better-off. Speaking on Monday, Mr McDonnell said a future Labour administration would not be ""traditional"" and ""people want to know we're ready, and they want to know we've got a response to anything that could happen"". Labour, he argued, must ""scenario-plan"" for all kinds of potential challenges it might face in government ""bringing the relevant expertise together at every level to talk through what happens if there is such and such a reaction"". ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? I don't think there will be, but you never know. ""We've got to start work nowâ¦ how exactly are we going to manage these industries when we take them back into public ownership? And let's start doing the detailed work now. Let's start doing the consultations with consumers or passengers or whoever and also with local authorities and local councils or whoever."" A Labour spokesman said: ""This was an exercise not done by us but by members. The scenarios were to deal with numerous events such as national disasters and acts of terror that could occur under any government."" Speaking at the same conference fringe event as Mr McDonnell, former broadcaster Paul Mason warned the first six months of a Corbyn government would be ""like Stalingrad"", with attacks from the establishment. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interviews Jeremy Corbyn Mark Serwotka, of the PCS union representing civil servants, said Labour would face ""huge"" opposition if it won power, predicting that ""all the usual arms of the ruling class will be brought to bear"". This included using financial markets to bring ""economic pressures"" including ""the flight of capital"" and trying to destabilise the economy, he said at a fringe event organised by the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group. He also said Labour would have to resist pressure from senior civil servants, ""Sir Humphreys"", who wanted to preserve the status quo. ""We have got to be prepared,"" he said. But the Conservatives said Labour's nationalisation plans, as well as its intention to buy out PFI contracts for the running of schools, hospitals and other public services, would result in ""a collapse in business investment and a crash in the value of the pound"". ""Labour's plans would go too far, and ordinary working people will end up footing the bill,"" Chancellor Philip Hammond said. And the Lib Dems said it was Labour's support for Brexit which risked an ""economic collapse"".

Where will the deadly floods strike next?,"Flooding in the Dominican Republic continues long after Hurricane Maria has passed With hundreds dead and millions either left homeless, or facing huge damage to their properties, catastrophic flooding has devastated many parts of the world. Nature's fury may seem unstoppable, but can technology at least help us to cope better? Savage hurricanes and record rains have struck around the world, bringing chaos to many countries and regions, including Bangladesh, India, the Caribbean, China and Texas in the US. Each year on average, flooding affects 96.9 million people worldwide, and causes $13.7bn (Â£10bn) in damage, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Those figures are likely to rise dramatically after this year's deluges. ""There are now many indications that the incidence of storms and persistent rainfall events is increasing with climate change,"" says Dr Justin Butler, chief executive of Brighton-based flood risk assessment firm Ambiental. But more accurate data from satellites and ground-based sensors, coupled with supercomputer modelling and machine learning, are giving us a clearer picture of which areas are likely to be most affected, says Mr Butler. ""Tens of thousands of simulations need to be run to capture a range of possible events,"" he explains, ""so the number of calculations that have to be carried out every second runs into the billions."" This kind of modelling is helping authorities plan flood defences more effectively, insurers price risk more accurately, emergency services improve how they respond, and homeowners take better protective measures. Ambiental's ""digital terrain models"", built up using Lidar (light distance and ranging) laser technology and other data, map how water flows across urban and rural landscapes. Highly detailed satellite data is helping to improve flood map modelling Its Flowroute modelling engine crunches all the data from sensors on land and in the sky - as well as historic data - to simulate complex flood flow patterns and make predictions. All this extra data and computing power is helping insurance companies improve their pricing. Liz Mitchell, founder of flood insurance specialist Flood Assist, says: ""Recent flood events have seen insurers invest in more sophisticated data, which is allowing them to assess the flood risk of an individual property rather than that of a postcode. ""You can have many properties registered at a postcode, and some could literally be at the top of a hill and others at the bottom - they would represent very different risks."" In the 2011 Brisbane floods, Ambiental's model was 95% accurate, claims Mr Butler, correctly predicting flooding in 19 out of every 20 flooded properties. More accurate modelling means some householders in previously ""high risk"" areas could see their premiums coming down. But other householders, of course, could see their premiums rising after a reassessment. Puerto Rico was also badly hit by Hurricane Maria, but the people were forewarned ""The use of data varies greatly from insurer-to-insurer. The more sophisticated the data the more accurate - theoretically - their pricing should be,"" says Ms Mitchell. Given that the cost of winter flooding in the UK last year was estimated to be Â£1.3bn, insurers are desperate to get a clearer picture of their likely liabilities. More extreme weather needs more sophisticated monitoring, which is why Nasa has funded the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS), an experimental online computer program run by the University of Maryland. It can make almost real-time flood analysis by combining data from satellites with a sophisticated land surface model that incorporates vegetation cover, soil type, and terrain. If water cannot soak away into the land, flood surges are more probable, and knowing where these are likely to hit is crucial for saving lives. Organisations like the Red Cross and the UN World Food Program are already using GFMS before, during, and after floods to supplement other on-the-ground intelligence they may have. Japan's H-2A rocket carried the Himawari 8 weather satellite into orbit in 2014 Dr Robert Adler, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland and one of the system's developers, says new Nasa satellite data has helped increase the accuracy of the model significantly - particularly useful during the recent Hurricane Harvey. But he is not complacent. ""We've made a lot of progress and have had success,"" he says, ""but there is still far to go. Improvements in the satellite rainfall estimates will lead directly to improved flood analysis."" Computational power is useless without accurate data to work with, so groundbreaking new satellites, such as the Japanese Himawari-8, are making a big difference. How 'the invisible network' poses a major security threat Why switching to fully electric cars will take time How to make money the Instagram way Why Sweden is close to becoming a cashless economy It generates about 50 times more data than previous satellites, and can analyse average rainfall using thermal infrared images that read the temperature of cloud tops. As well as advances in satellites, more sophisticated ground-based sensors are also improving modern flood prediction. For example, the UK's Flood Network is harnessing the ""internet of things"" with the aim of creating an extensive, localised, early-warning system for flood-prone areas. It uses wireless sensors monitoring water levels in streams, groundwater and river basins. The data is transmitted over a Low-Power Wide-Area Network designed for long-range communications at a low bit rate. Flood Network's sensors send water level data wirelessly The initiative between Oxford-based Nominet and the Oxford Flood Network was launched in 2015, less than a year after the city was hit by floods that cut off major routes and homes for days. ""Although the Environment Agency provides blanket warnings, it has limited resources and uses just a few, expensive, professional sensors,"" says Adam Leach, Nominet's head of research and development. ""We thought that a higher density of sensors with more detailed data would make a real difference to monitoring water levels in flood-prone areas, particularly in small waterways. ""It's still relatively early days for the Flood Network,"" he adds, ""but it demonstrates the huge potential the internet of things has to deliver the 'smart city' projects we've all heard so much about."" Forewarned is forearmed, they say, but a future Technology of Business feature will look at the technologies helping protect householders and businesses from the damage such floods can cause.

Therapy 'wakes' vegetative-state patient,"Tests show the man's brain activity before (L) and after (R) the treatment A man in France has regained some degree of consciousness after being in a vegetative state for 15 years. Doctors treated the 35-year-old, injured in a car accident, with an experimental therapy that involved implanting a nerve stimulator into his chest. Within a month, he could respond to simple instructions, turning his head and following an object with his eyes. Experts saythe results,externalare potentially very exciting, but need repeating. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) may not work as effectively in patients with different patterns of brain damage. But Angela Sirigu, from the Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc Jeannerod, in Lyon, said it had chosen a really challenging patient to test the treatment. The vagus nerve connects the brain to many parts of the body and helps control automatic or subconscious functions, including alertness and wakefulness. After one month of vagal nerve stimulation, the patient's mother reported he had an improved ability to stay awake when listening to his therapist reading a book. And brain scans reflected this improvement, Current Biology journal reports. He also started responding to ""threat"". For instance, when the doctor's head suddenly approached the patient's face, he reacted with surprise, opening his eyes wide. Ms Sirigu said: ""Brain plasticity and brain repair are still possible even when hope seems to have vanished. ""After this case report, we should consider testing larger populations of patients. ""This treatment can be important for minimally conscious patients by giving them more chances to communicate with the external world."" Dr Vladimir Litvak, from The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, at University College London's Institute of Neurology, said: ""This might be an interesting new lead, but I would suggest to be cautious about these results until they are reproduced in more patients. ""It is hard to know based on a single case how likely this treatment is to work in the general patient population."" A vegetative state is when a person is awake without signs of awareness; they may open their eyes, wake up and fall asleep at regular intervals and have basic reflexes; they can also regulate their heartbeat and breathing without assistance A person in a vegetative state does not show any meaningful responses, such as following an object with their eyes or responding to voices; they also show no signs of experiencing emotions A continuing - or persistent - vegetative state is when this happens for more than four weeks A permanent vegetative state is defined as more than six months if caused by a non-traumatic brain injury, or more than 12 months if caused by a traumatic brain injury such as a blow to the head If a person is in a permanent vegetative state, recovery is extremely unlikely but not impossible Source: NHS Choices,external Follow Michelleon Twitter,external An agonising wait Current Biology Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles LA fires in maps: Thousands of acres, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Woman 'may have been killed by wolves',"Celia Hollingworth was reported missing on Thursday A British woman who died in northern Greece after apparently being mauled by a pack of stray dogs may have been attacked by wolves, a coroner has said. Celia Hollingworth, from Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire was reported missing on Thursday after visiting an archaeological site near Maroneia. Coroner Nikolaos Kifinidis suggested she may have been attacked by other wild animals such as wolves or jackals. Wiltshire Police said it was supporting the 64-year-old's family. 'I was attacked by stray dogs in Athens' A spokesman added the force was in contact with Greek police regarding formal identification of the body. The recently retired University of Bristol staff member took a taxi to a local archaeological site on Thursday, according to Greek police. It is thought she tried to walk back along a coastal path when she was attacked. Her body was found on Friday. Ms Hollingworth's body was found near Maroneia in northern Greece BBC Athens producer Kostas Kallergis, said the reason it was believed to be dogs was because she had reportedly been on the phone to relatives at the time and told them they were attacking her. ""But the attack seems so ferocious it may as well have been wolves,"" he said. ""I did speak with the local coroner and he told me it was almost impossible to tell for sure. ""He also told me he expected the help of veterinary experts today, and we expect the final coroner's report by tomorrow."" He added the Greeks were shocked by what had happened. This video can not be played Celia Hollingworth can be seen on CCTV in a shop hours before her death ""There are thousands of stray dogs in Greece and there have been attacks to humans but it's many years since any led to a fatality,"" Mr Kallergis said. ""There have also been attacks by wolves in remote mountainous areas but they are usually on sheep or other animals but rarely against humans."" According to animal welfare campaigners there are an estimated one million stray dogs in Greece. However, wolves are common to the wooded regions. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was in contact with Greek police and ""was also providing consular assistance"" to Ms Hollingworth's family.

US dismisses N Korea war allegations,"This video can not be played Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Frankly the suggestion is absurd The US has said a statement from North Korea accusing Washington of declaring war on it was ""absurd"". The White House also warned Pyongyang to stop provocations after it said it had the right to shoot down US bombers. A UN spokesman said fiery talk could lead to fatal misunderstandings. South Korea has called for a level-headed response, warning that accidental clashes in the region could quickly spiral out of control. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told reporters on Monday that ""the whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country"". His comments were a response toa tweet from President Donald Trump,externalsuggesting North Korea would not ""be around much longer"" if its leaders continued their rhetoric. Two days agoUS warplanes flew closeto North Korea's coast in a show of force. Speaking as he left New York after the UN General Assembly, Mr Ri said his country had the right to shoot down US warplanes even if they were not in North Korea's airspace. North Korea-US tension: Should you worry? North Korea crisis in 300 words Twitter says Trump tweet did not break rules' BBC launches Korean news service This video can not be played Ri Yong-ho says Donald Trump ""declared a war on our country"" Later on Monday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US had ""not declared war against North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd"". Pentagon spokesman Col Robert Manning reacted by saying: ""If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions, you know, we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea."" North Korea frequently calls foreign action against it ""a declaration of war"". Here are just a few of the occasions it has used the expression: July 2016: When US imposed sanctions on Kim Jong-un and several other officials over human rights abuses - North Korea said that was ""a hideous crime"". February 2016: When South Korea withdrew from the shared economic zone at Kaesong - North Korea said this was ""an end to the last lifeline"" of inter-Korean relations. October 2014: It said if balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets were allowed to drift across the border from the South it would be ""a de facto declaration of war. October 2006: It said UN Security Council sanctions passed in response to North Korea's first nuclear test meant a war declaration. South Korea - technically at war with North Korea since the 1950s - called for ""astuteness and steadfastness"" in responding to what it describes as continued provocations by Pyongyang. Speaking in New York, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha called for the prevention of any ""further escalation of tensions, or any kind of accidental military clashes in the region which can quickly spiral out of control"". South Korea's intelligence service said Pyongyang was readjusting the position of its military aircraft and strengthening its coastal defences, according to the South's news agency Yonhap. This video can not be played What would a war look like? What weapons does North Korea have? How a Pacific nuclear test might happen Kim's 'dotard' insult explained StÃ©phane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres, said that ""fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings"" and that ""the only solution for this is a political solution"". ""We want things to calm down,"" China's ambassador to the UN, Liu Jieyi, told Reuters. ""It's getting too dangerous and it's in nobody's interest."" Despite weeks of tension, experts have played down the risk of direct conflict. North Korea has continued to carry out nuclear and ballistic missile tests in recent weeks, in defiance of successive rounds of UN sanctions. It says nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it. After the North's latest and most powerful nuclear test earlier this month, the UN Security Council approved new sanctions on the country. Should you worry?

Alabama election pits Trump against his base,"A Republican Senate primary in Alabama is twisting Donald Trump and his party in knots and turning the president's supporters against each other. Mr Trump has put his power and reputation on the line for the kind of Washington insider he used to rail against - a former corporate lobbyist who was appointed to the Senate by a governor who subsequently resigned in disgrace, no less. Meanwhile erstwhile White House aides, rabble-rousing former Trump surrogates and even a member of the president's own Cabinet are lining up behind an upstart insurgent who almost no one in Washington wants to see roaming the halls of the Senate. The president's man is Luther Strange, the former Alabama attorney general named to the seat Jeff Sessions vacated when he became US attorney general earlier this year. Despite his Dickensian name and remarkably tall stature (6 feet, 9 inches), Mr Strange is an otherwise unremarkable politician, reserved in manner and unenthusiastic on the stump - a replacement-level senator from a reliably conservative state. For an incumbent with his party's support, that's usually good enough to ensure a smooth nomination. Not this time, however. Luther Strange has relentlessly touted that he has Donald Trump's endorsement With just a day left before a run-off vote for the Republican nomination, Mr Strange trails in opinion polls to Roy Moore, a man who has been called many things, but unremarkable and unenthusiastic are not among them. The former Alabama chief justice and tireless evangelical firebrand once lost his job on the state's Supreme Court because he refused to obey a federal order to remove a massive sculpture of the biblical Ten Commandments from his courthouse. He was elected by the people of Alabama to the court again, then was suspended - and subsequently resigned - for failing to enforce the US Supreme Court's 2015 ruling legalising gay marriage. Mr Moore is a lawyer who says the laws of man are superseded by those of God; a politician campaigning to make life miserable for politicians in Washington. Judge Moore and Senator Strange, a political odd couple if there ever were one, held an unusual, unmoderated hour-long debate in the state capital of Montgomery on Thursday night, and within minutes the gist of their campaigns was clear. This video can not be played Roy Moore: 'Sexual perversion and sodomy sweep this land' Mr Strange found a way every five minutes to note he had the backing of Mr Trump - who packed tens of thousands of supporters into a southern Alabama football stadium in August 2015. The senator positioned himself as the experienced hand who could help enact Mr Trump's agenda. Mr Moore, on the other hand, was all fire and brimstone. He opened with a warning about the threat of ""transgender troops in our bathrooms"" - and went on from there. ""I want to see virtue and morality return to our country,"" he said. ""Crime, corruption, immorality, abortion, sodomy, sexual perversion sweep our land."" When Mr Moore did talk about Mr Trump, it was to suggest that the president was being misled into supporting a man who was a rubber stamp for the hated powers in Washington. This is the conundrum at the heart of the Alabama special election. Why is Mr Trump fighting on the side of the Washington establishment? Why, in particular, is he making league with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who the president - and many Alabama conservatives - hold most responsible for legislative failings in Congress this year? The question perplexed Mr Moore's supporters at a post-debate rally just a handful of blocks away from Thursday night's debate site in Montgomery. As a sign held up by Mobile resident Chu Green put it: ""Mr President and Mr VP I love you, but you are WRONG! America needs Judge Moore."" ""Judge and Trump, to me, are hand in hand,"" said Boyd Wainwright, a registered nurse from nearby Prattville. ""It's a no-brainer."" Janet Oglesby, a retiree from Mobile, said the president is an ""honourable"" man who is being sabotaged by the members of his own party and even his own administration who are telling him to support Mr Strange. Janet Oglesby and her husband Omer think Donald Trump is being misled into supporting Luther Strange ""I think that someone gave him advice that they knew would hurt him,"" she says. The crowd's angst gave way to joy upon arrival of Mr Moore's campaign bus, carrying an assortment of political celebrities from the fringes of power. Siran Stacy, a former star running back for the Alabama Crimson Tide college football team, lashed out at the hundreds of thousands of dollars Mr McConnell and Washington-based groups have poured into Alabama to support the Strange campaign. ""We're not going to allow any outside influences to tell us who we ought to see in the Senate,"" he said. ""We don't mind you coming to our house. You can come down, and we can fix you some grits and scramble some eggs, but don't tell us how to run our house."" Former White House aide Sebastian Gorka - introduced as the ""rock star"" behind the president's best speeches - cast Mr Moore as the true keeper of Mr Trump's anti-establishment flame. ""Let's remember what we all did in November,"" he said. ""We elected a man who I worked for, who had never ever held political office or senior military rank. Why? Because the political establishment on the left and the right have betrayed us for too long."" And finally, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin drove the point home, accusing the establishment of trying to ""hijack"" the Trump presidency. ""On Tuesday, you get to tell them, 'Hey, our movement isn't over, and it's not slowing down,"" she said. Several days later Moore would host another rally, with Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson, recently ousted Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon and former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage. As Mr Strange quipped during their debate, Mr Moore's advocates look like ""the unemployment line at the White House"". Then again, they also look a lot like the vanguard of Trump's political revolution. A Moore rally - its enthusiastic crowds, its homemade signs, its unscripted political edginess - looks a lot like a small-scale Trump event. Of course, if Mr Moore's campaign get-togethers seemed like ersatz Trump circa 2016, on Friday night Mr Strange had the real thing - a packed, 10,000 seat arena of adoring, Make America Great Again hat-wearing supporters there to hear the president's in-person pitch for the senator. Sort of. In a speech that lasted nearly an hour and a half, the president said Mr Strange ""works hard"" and ""shares our agenda"". He said he's backing the senator because, unlike some other politicians, he never asked for anything in exchange for his support. In true Trump fashion, however, the praise was sometimes backhanded. He noted - as he had in earlier tweets - that Mr Strange had been trailing badly in the polls and only ""pulled even"" after the president's endorsement. And, perhaps most concerning for the embattled senator, he said that if Mr Moore wins, he'd come back to Alabama and campaign ""like hell"" for him. Peter Grove decorates an old bicycle with anti-Strange, pro-Moore signs That line will be welcome news to the pro-Moore supporters, including those who had gathered outside the Huntsville venue to show support for their man. Peter Grove, a retiree from Cloverdale, said he didn't think Mr Trump cared whether Mr Moore or Mr Strange won - he was just endorsing the incumbent (whom he called ""Lucifer Strange"") to collect some political capital. Eva Dastrow, a recent high-school graduate now working at a Christian ministry, said many in the Trump crowd were telling her they were pro-Moore and just there to see the president. Eva Dastrow has travelled across Alabama to campaign for ""godly"" Roy Moore ""Moore has proven to Alabama and the nation that he'll stand on God's word,"" she said. After the rally, the verdict was mixed. Kenny Minyar said he was on the fence, but Mr Strange's loyalty to the president won him over. Melissa Hotz, on the other hand, said she came into the evening ""all for Moore"". Did the president change her mind? She shook her head and smiled. According to a Cygnal Political poll released on Monday, 31% of Alabamans were more likely to vote for Mr Strange based on the president's endorsement, while 30% were less likely. Overall, Mr Moore led the senator 52% to 41%. If there's any hope for Mr Strange it won't come from opinion surveys, which paint an increasingly dark picture. Or from the sometimes conflicted thousands who flocked to the arena in Huntsville, Alabama, to hear the president speak. Or from the millions of dollars in anti-Moore advertising that have saturated the Alabama airwaves for months. The senator's fate, rather, could be decided by the kind of folks having lunch in Charlie's Place, in Selma, Alabama, on Friday afternoon. Just a block from the Edmund Pettis Bridge, where a violent clash between police and anti-segregation protesters became a rallying cry for the 1960s civil rights movement, diners munched on burgers and fried green tomatoes and largely avoided discussing state politics, which owner Charlie Morgan called ""a mess"". Cullen Wiggens (left), Emily Rogers and friends talk Alabama politics over lunch When pressed, most of the customers said they were reluctantly going to vote for Mr Strange. ""I'm going to hold my nose and do it,"" said James McNeill, a lawyer who went to school with Mr Moore and wants nothing to do with him. Cullen Wiggins, a chemical company sales executive, said he was also going to opt for Mr Strange - but would cast a ballot for Democrat Doug Jones in December. He said Mr Strange is corrupt but ""Moore is crazy"". And that's how Mr Strange might win. Mr Moore has enthusiasm on his side but if enough Alabama Republicans object to his extreme evangelical politics, they could opt for the more traditional pick. The key will be getting those less-than-inspired Alabama Republicans to the polls. That's where an organised get-out-the-vote effort comes in - something the Strange campaign has more than enough funds to pull off. Even the best outreach programmes can only do so much to inspire lethargic voters, however. Emily Rogers said she had received a robo-call from presidential daughter-in-law Lara Trump - but it did nothing to convince her to head to the polls for Mr Strange. In fact, she admitted, she still didn't even know when the vote takes place. On Friday night, Mr Trump expressed his doubts about whether he was doing the right thing by coming down to Alabama to push for Mr Strange. He said he ""might have made a mistake"" and fretted that if Mr Strange were to lose on Tuesday, the media would say the president had failed to ""pull his candidate across the line"". Donald Trump has embraced Luther Strange - but will it be enough? If the president is a bit concerned, however, others in Washington are downright scared. Mr Moore's success raises the possibility that while Republican Party loyalists have sought a means to work with the president, the forces that swept him to power could be beyond even Mr Trump's control. If an upstart judge can take down a sitting senator with a wealth of resources at his disposal, is anyone in the establishment safe? If Trump's stardom can't pump voltage into Mr Strange's campaign, what will protect Republican members of Congress from a bloodbath in next year's mid-term elections? For some, the possibility that the recent conservative populist revolt is a storm that has not yet been spent is their greatest fear. For those on the outside, however - the ones who are rallying around an upstart judge in the heart of Dixie -  a bigger, stronger tempest to come is their dearest wish. And the sooner the president returns to the fold, the better.

Do referendums bring about change?,"Referendums have allowed couples in Ireland to divorce, given Uruguayans ownership of their water supply and split Sudan into two separate countries. But are they always so effective at bringing about change? With controversial independence votes in Iraqi Kurdistan and Catalonia in Spain, some are hoping that the ballot box might create new countries. The trouble is, history has shown that in only half of the cases where people have voted for independence, did they get it without violence. More often than not, when faced with a yes/no choice at the polls, people are more likely to choose change. Dr Alan Renwick, from University College London, and Prof Stephen Fisher, of the University of Oxford, looked at 284 nationwide referendums, which took place in democratic countries between 1990 and 2016. A majority of voters chose the change option over the status quo in 186 of them. But a simple majority is not always enough. Spain's constitutional court has said a planned independence poll in Catalonia is illegal Sometimes the threshold for success is higher than 50% or voter turnout has to reach a certain level before the result of the referendum ""passes"". Once you take that into account, only 111 of those 284 referendums ""passed"" in favour of change. For the referendums they examined, the government's opinion mattered. When the government actively supported change, it passed 53% of the time. If it didn't, then success dropped to 26%. And how the referendum came about also seemed to make a difference. For citizen-initiated referendums, the change option passed only a quarter of the time, but when parliament called the referendum, it passed 45% of the time. That went up to 56% when the referendum was required by the constitution to make the change in question. Independence referendums are even more likely to pass. Since the early 1800s there have been 54 independence votes, of which 43 have passed. Of those, peaceful independence followed in 22 of them, while in the rest independence either did not happen or did occur after a period of violence. The Kurdish independence referendum is going ahead despite opposition from the Iraqi government and the US However, in some cases, such as this week in Kurdistan, the referendum is ""advisory"" and non-binding. Sometimes, there's the question of whether the result will be honoured by the government, or the international community - as Kosovo (1991) and South Ossetia (1992) found out. And of course, matters can turn violent. Conflict in the former Yugoslavia followed several declarations of independence after referendums in the early 1990s.

Newmarket music events 'not for children',"More than 20,000 people were at Little Mix's gig at Newmarket Racecourse A racecourse which received complaints about aggression and drunkenness after it staged a Little Mix gig says it will no longer sell children's tickets for evening music events. Newmarket Racecourse denied the change in policy was prompted bycomplaints from parents following the summer gig. Instead it said ""customer feedback"" had driven the change, as first reported in theCambridge News,external. The venue apologised to fans ""for the mindless actions"" after the concert. More than 20,000 people, many of them young children, went to see Little Mix at the racecourse in June. But after the event some took to social media to complain, saying it was unsafe for children and described people being drunk, lewd and aggressive. Kaitlyn suffered bruises after being trampled on at the racecourse Little Mix gig, her mother said Chloe Price posted pictures on Facebook of her eight-year-old daughter Kaitlyn with bruises, claiming she had been trampled on. ""There's drunk people falling over people. Women being sick. people pushing and shoving. Kids crying everywhere,"" she told the BBC. Chantelle Skinner described ""drunken behaviour. Really not suitable for children at all"". Newmarket Racecourse told the BBC evening events were largely not suitable for under-16s Newmarket Racecourse said changes to its Newmarket Nights events were based on customer feedback. Amy Starkey, from the racecourse, said: ""One of the changes to be implemented will be that children's tickets will not be available for any evening music events next year."" Ms Starkey told the BBC evening events were largely not suitable for under-16s. Parents however, could still buy adult tickets for their children, but the racecourse would not be responsible for the youngsters. The venue was also renaming the Family Enclosure to the Garden Enclosure ""as another example of how we would like to position Newmarket Nights going forward"". Children's tickets would still be sold for family daytime events, the racecourse added. Little Mix concert draws complaints.

Liz Dawn: A life of drama and laughter,"For more than 30 years, Liz Dawn played the loud and flighty Vera Duckworth in ITV soap Coronation Street. Her turbulent relationship with husband Jack proved to be one of the Street's most enduring storylines and Vera became one of Weatherfield's most popular characters. The episode featuring Vera's peaceful death in 2008 attracted more than 12 million viewers. Coronation Street star Liz Dawn dies In pictures: Vera Duckworth's best bits Co-stars remember 'amazing' actress Liz Dawn was born Sylvia Butterfield on 8 Nov 1939 in Leeds, where her father worked as an engineer. At the age of eight, she fell in the street, gashing her mouth so badly that doctors feared she could be left with a hare lip. But by chance, a skilled plastic surgeon was in Leeds at the time and a series of skin grafts repaired the damage. She said: ""The other kids used to run after me and say, 'Can I see your plastic face?' But I just felt so lucky to have been treated and put back to normal."" After leaving school, Liz took a series of jobs including working in a garment factory and as a cinema usherette. She was also a shoe salesgirl and a light bulb seller in Woolworths. She married Walter Bradley in Leeds in 1957. The union produced a son, Graham, but the marriage collapsed after less than two years. Her second marriage, to electrician Donald Ibbertson in 1965, resulted in the births of three daughters. Appearing in Leeds United in 1974 She began singing in nightclubs and then started auditioning for small acting parts in TV programmes and commercials. Already a heavy cigarette user, the smoke-filled clubs in which she performed would have a serious effect on her health later in life. Liz's breakthrough came when she was cast in Colin Welland's 1974 drama Leeds United, which appeared in the BBC's Play for Today slot. Based on real events, the play documented the struggle by a group of female textile workers to get equal pay with men, only to be thwarted by their own trade union. Although her role was a small one, it did lead to her being offered a bit part as factory machinist Vera Duckworth in an episode of Coronation Street. She continued to take parts in other TV programmes until the arrival of the character Jack Duckworth in 1979 saw her role as Vera greatly enhanced. Vera and screen husband Jack became a legendary Coronation Street double act The marital strife between the two became a major feature of the soap. They argued frequently, seemingly the epitome of a couple who cannot live with each other but fear being apart. Both engaged in extramarital affairs. This led to one of the high spots of the drama when Vera confided in barmaid Bet Lynch about Jack's infidelities, unaware at the time that he was having a fling with Bet herself. Liz and Bill Tarmey, who played Jack, had a close friendship. She said he was her best friend and that they had never argued in all their years acting together. Liz's appearances on Coronation Street began to be hampered by her increasing bouts of illness and she was forced to quit the soap in 2008 after her health worsened. She had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) four years previously. The illness meant she only had a third of her lungs working, and she spent a lot of time in a wheelchair after she left the soap. Liz said she wished she had never smoked but also blamed performing in smoke-filled clubs for the illness. Her on-screen demise saw her character found lifeless in her armchair having died in her sleep. Liz said her time spent on the soap had been ""the best time of my life"". She famously returned to the cobbles in 2010 when she played her own ghost in the episode in which Jack Duckworth died. She received an MBE in 2000 for her charity work After leaving Coronation Street, she campaigned on behalf of the British Lung Foundation and became the public face of a campaign to raise awareness of chronic lung disease and the importance of early diagnosis. Liz served as Lady Mayoress of her home city of Leeds in 2000 and in the same year was awarded an MBE for her charity work at hospitals in Manchester and Leeds. She was asked to be Lady Mayoress in recognition of her charity work, having raised more than Â£500,000 for a breast cancer appeal in her name. The actress said she was ""thrilled and honoured"" to be asked. ""It's my home city and this means so much to me."" She played a feisty guest at the B&B in the Christmas episode of Emmerdale in 2015 Liz suffered a heart attack in 2013 while on holiday with her husband in Spain. She subsequently had a pacemaker fitted. In 2015, she came out of retirement to make a cameo appearance in Coronation Street's rival soap Emmerdale. She appeared in the Christmas Day episode as a demanding guest named Mrs Winterbottom, who stayed at Eric Pollard's B&B. ""There's only one show I'd come out of retirement for and it's Emmerdale, particularly as I've celebrated my 76th birthday this week so I wanted to mark the occasion,"" she said.

'Quarter of adoptive families' in crisis,"This video can not be played 'Rob': 'My wife now shows the sort of symptoms of someone who's suffered domestic abuse' More than a quarter of adoptive families are in crisis, according to a survey by the BBC and Adoption UK. More than half of those surveyed reported living with a child who was violent, including being punched, kicked or threatened with knives. More serious incidents included hospital visits and sexual assault. Despite the challenges, most families said they were glad they adopted. Adoption UK said families needed skilled help and support. Almost 3,000 subscribers to Adoption UK's newsletter responded to the survey by BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4programme. More than a quarter of families, when asked to describe their adoption, said they were facing serious challenges that had an impact on the wider family, were at risk of breakdown or disruption, or had already been disrupted. Almost half said their adoption was ""challenging but stable"" and just over a quarter described it as ""fulfilling and stable"". Jane knew adopting a little girl from care would not be easy, but nothing prepared her for what came next. ""She was developmentally delayed, so when she was three and a half, all the severe behaviour started to come out"", she said. ""She could be lovely one minute and very violent and aggressive the next."" Jane, not her real name, and her husband said they asked their local authority for help, but it was not forthcoming. ""The whole time we were saying, 'We're in trouble, she needs help; we need help.' But getting anything was a struggle."" As the years went by, their daughter's behaviour became more extreme. Her husband, Keith, found it difficult to manage. ""She became obsessed with blood,"" he said. ""She was self-harming and would write on the walls with her own blood. She would pull her own baby teeth out. We reached such a stage that our daughter had become unparentable - she was only six or seven. I couldn't cope."" In the end, Keith made the decision to send their daughter back to care. The couple say it was the most difficult decision of their lives. ""She's in such turmoil, but her behaviour is not her fault,"" Jane added. ""She needs help from professionals to make sense of what happened to her. You should be able to get that help."" The family's local authority would not comment on their case, but said they were committed to supporting all adoptive families throughout their journey and they ""seek to learn lessons"" when adoptions do break down. In the UK, around 5,500 children are adopted every year. The majority of adoptions involve children over the age of one, siblings and children with disabilities, who have been taken into care. Many have suffered trauma, neglect and abuse which can result in a range of complex developmental and psychological difficulties. Research suggests almost three-quarters of adopted children have significant mental health problems of one kind or another. Parents who deal with the fallout of these problems, say family life can be extremely difficult. Many parents described being punched, kicked or threatened with knives. But some reported more serious incidents, including hospital visits and sexual assault. Dr Sue Armstrong Brown from Adoption UK said it was important not to demonise children. ""We're talking about trauma-fuelled violence from children who will have witnessed the unthinkable in their early lives,"" she said. ""Adoption is not a silver bullet.

Labour demands Â£500m NHS bailout,"Labour is calling on the government to spend an extra Â£500m on a winter bailout fund for the NHS in England. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the cash was needed to increase capacity in struggling hospitals and pay for extra staff. He also said it was Labour's ""ambition"" to return NHS funding increases to the same level as during the 1997-2010 Labour governments. The Department for Health says it has ""robust"" plans in place for the winter. Labour 'would bring existing PFI contracts in-house' Live: Labour Party conference Labour proposes new tax on bookmakers And it will pump ""an extra Â£100m for [accident and emergency] departments and Â£2bn funding for the social care system"" to get it through the cold season. But Mr Ashworth said: ""We've had no clear explanation from [Health Secretary] Jeremy Hunt and [Prime Minister] Theresa May about how the NHS will be prepared this winter. ""We are hearing that we could have a serious flu outbreak this winter. ""So if the government have robust plans, we need them to come forward."" Extra money is needed to boost the capacity of hospitals, allow the NHS to hire extra non-agency staff and improve the transfer of patients to social care, Mr Ashworth said in a speech to the party's conference in Brighton later. He told delegates the prime minister must not stick her ""head in the sand"" because a ""collapse"" on the same scale as last year's winter crisis would lead to thousands of people waiting longer for A&E treatment. Labour has pledged to boost spending on the NHS through a 5% hike in income tax for the highest earners and changes to corporation tax. Mr Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Â£7bn extra promised for the NHS in Labour's general election manifesto was a ""substantial investment"". But he said it fell short of what was needed in the long-term, which was a return to the increases seen during the last Labour governments. ""We should be giving the NHS 4% a year, and I want us to work towards getting back to that 4% increase,"" he told Today. ""But what I cannot do is say on day one of a Labour government it will definitely be 4% because we have to manage the public finances prudently."" Asked about shadow chancellor John McDonnell's announcement that Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts would be brought ""in-house"" if Labour won power, he said it would ""take time"" and not happen ""overnight"". ""NHS experts generally accept that it is only a handful which are causing hospital trusts across the country a significant problem, but let's look at every single one in detail,"" Mr Ashworth said. ""I am not going to make a sort of hypothetical guess of how many contracts will be [brought back in-house]. ""There are a handful of hospital trusts who have got a problem with their deficits and their financing which is because of the PFI contract they are in.""

We are Generation Z and 'we're not lazy',"Newsbeat has commissioned the BBC's biggest ever survey of the attitudes of 16 to 22-year-olds and found a generation wanting to fight back against a perception from older people that they're ""lazy"" and ""social media obsessed"". In fact, it's a group which believes it prioritises family and education over going out and the internet. It's a generation more optimistic about its future than older generations think it should be - and one which sees itself as hard-working and creative. We've talked to four people from Generation Z to see what they believe, what drives them and what they fear. Charlotte Danks, who's from Newquay in Cornwall, says she decided to start her own business selling cut-price food to locals after being laid off repeatedly. The 22-year-old says she always wanted a career where she could help her community - but it hasn't been easy. ""I've had a lot of stick,"" she says. ""I've had people spit in my face. I've had people throw products at me. ""But at the end of the day I'm helping my community and I've got a lot of support behind me."" Charlotte's local community describes her as ""a godsend"". #GenZ,external Charlotte opened her first 25p Affordable Foods store in Newquay but now has others in St Austell, Bude, Bodmin and Truro. She says older generations who think her generation is lazy are wrong. ""If our generation's lazy, then every generation is lazy. We all want something, but we're all fighting for the same thing. ""I think people my age need to get more of an opportunity and a chance to prove ourselves."" Eighteen-year-old Ife, from Hackney in east London, was a member of England's winning team at last year's World Schools Debating Championships in Germany and used to be the youth MP for Shoreditch. Despite his achievements, he says he still suffers from anxiety. And he says many people in Generation Z have mental health issues because they're unsure what the future will bring. ""We grew up in a generation which felt really insecure for a number of reasons. ""We're constantly told things are going badly. So you're aware there's a housing crisis, you're aware you're going to be in debt and you have no idea how you're going to find success. ""I feel like I can't plan my life.""

His grandfather has Alzheimer's and he takes him to a singing group which helps him cope with the disease.

It's something he enjoys doing and I don't know whether you'd call it a coping strategy, but all we know is that he likes it, so we'll do it. ""[But] the banter is still there and it's great to grow up with that. I'd like to think of myself as a good person and it comes from the whole family unit."" Jack Raynsford is a cosplay enthusiast from Surrey and says they became Jack just under three years ago. ""I think what non-binary means to me, is distancing myself from the expectations. So if you're male you should be one way, if you're female you should be another. ""It's me going, 'I'm not either of those. I don't want to be either of those. I'm just going to be here in the middle being me.' ""Our expectations and our roles of, 'This is what women do, this is what men do. We can't go outside that' is incredibly limiting. ""It's quite useful to have this shift and this understanding of non-binary genders so people can really think about what their gender means to them and what makes them happy, rather than what they're expected to do.""

Female US Marine smashes glass ceiling,"The lieutenant will lead a platoon of 40 Marines in combat A female US Marine has made history by becoming the first woman to complete the Corps' famously gruelling infantry officer training. The lieutenant, who wants to keep her identity private, graduated in Quantico, Virginia, on Monday. She will soon be assigned to lead a 40-strong platoon. Marine Corps commandant Gen.

The disorder that stops people loving their family,"This video can not be played During one episode, Sarah remembers seeing her hands in 2D For people living with depersonalisation disorder the world appears unreal, as if through a haze or fog - or even in 2D. One in 100 people is thought to have the condition, but experts are warning it is not included in any GP training. ""Relationships you know you value deeply lose their essential quality,"" Sarah tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""You know you love your family, but you know it academically - rather than feeling it in the normal way."" Sarah is an actress. She's used to playing roles and projecting emotion. Yet for long stretches of her own adult life, she herself has been emotionally numb - unable to feel. This is the result of a little-known mental-health condition called depersonalisation disorder. Sarah has had three chronic episodes of the disorder. The first came while studying for her final exams. It is characterised by a sense of disconnect from the world around you, and your own body, and is believed to start as a defence mechanism - helping people to cope in periods of acute anxiety or trauma by switching off reality. It can also be triggered by drugs such as cannabis. Sarah says, with depersonalisation disorder, familiar places feel like film sets For those with it, the world can change in an instant. ""It was a sudden flick of a switch. Things felt really alien and threatening,"" says Sarah. ""Suddenly your flat or somewhere that is very, very familiar to you will suddenly feel like a film set, and your possessions feel like props."" Others have terrifying out-of-body experiences, feel like their own body parts don't belong to them and even see the world in 2D - as if it were flat. For Sarah, this is what happened during her second episode. ""I was reading, holding a book, and suddenly my hands looked like a picture of a pair of hands. ""I felt this separation between the physical world and my perception of it."" Watch Adam Eley's full filmon depersonalisation disorder on the Victoria Derbyshire programme's website. This isn't, however, a rare disorder. One in 100 people is estimated to have it as a mental health condition, according to three separate studies. Experts say it is as widespread as conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, and it has been a medically recognised disorder for decades. Some patients, if untreated, can have it for their entire lives. Yet few medical professionals have heard of it. One newly qualified doctor - who has the condition - says there was no mention of depersonalisation disorder in either his GP training or at medical school. He admits to wrongly diagnosing at least two of his own patients in the past, and says he would be ""very surprised"" if any of his colleagues had heard of the condition. Sarah says she has seen ""possibly up to 20 people over the years who haven't known what I was talking about - community psychiatric nurses, GPs, therapists, counsellors"". Dr Elaine Hunter runs the only specialist clinic for depersonalisation disorder in the UK The Royal College of GPs said mental health was a ""key part"" of its ""extensive training curriculum"". Areas of training ""including complex mental health problems... are being developed,"" it added. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said ""we must ensure that knowledge of this condition is improved"". Poor diagnosis rates, however, are only one part of the problem. Another is access to treatment. There is only one specialist clinic in the UK, and it has limited resources - seeing fewer than 80 patients a year, compared with the 650,000 people estimated to be living with the condition. Access to the clinic on the NHS requires funding from the local clinical commissioning group, but even with a diagnosis this can take months or even longer. After a year of waiting, Sarah decided her only choice was to self-fund. ""I was having panic attacks regularly. I was really, really scared. ""I felt like I was in crisis,"" she says. The specialist clinic - the Depersonalisation Disorder Service at South London and Maudsley NHS Trust - is also limited to over-18s, having been designated an adult-only service. This is despite the condition often forming in adolescence. Dr Elaine Hunter, who runs it, is concerned that she is having to turn children and young people away. ""We sometimes get very distressed and upset patients who have a 15-year-old who is terrifiedâ¦ and there's not very much we can do."" One patient she has recently seen as an adult developed the condition aged 13, and was unable to leave the house for two years - having 10 or more panic attacks a day as a result of the anxiety depersonalisation disorder caused. At first she was unable to recognise her own parents. Dr Hunter hopes in time services for under-18s will become available. She also wants treatment to be made available to patients locally, by training ""depersonalisation disorder leads"" at each NHS mental health trust, who can then share their knowledge with others. She has also developed a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) specifically designed for depersonalisation disorder, which she believes medical professions with a grounding in the talking therapy would be able to learn with training. Sarah Ashley ""couldn't eat, couldn't sleep"" before she began her CBT with Dr Hunter One of Dr Hunter's patients, Sarah Ashley, a sales manager, says she has noticed a ""huge, huge difference"" in her mental health, despite being initially sceptical. ""[Before CBT] I'd look down at my hands or parts of my body and feel they're not mine. I'd look in the mirror and it would be like looking at someone else,"" she says. ""I couldn't eat, couldn't sleepâ¦ [weighed] six and a half stone from all the anxiety from it. ""Whereas now, I do get a bit of depersonalisation, but I can deal with it really quickly."" Treatment, then, is available, but currently limited in scope and difficult to access. Dr Hunter says it should not be the case that people are ""finding their symptoms through Google"" and having to tell their GP: ""This is what I've got"", rather than the other way round.

'Quarter of adopted families' in crisis,"This video can not be played 'Rob': 'My wife now shows the sort of symptoms of someone who's suffered domestic abuse' More than a quarter of adoptive families are in crisis, according to a survey by the BBC and Adoption UK. More than half of those surveyed reported living with a child who was violent, including being punched, kicked or threatened with knives. More serious incidents included hospital visits and sexual assault. Despite the challenges, most families said they were glad they adopted. Adoption UK said families needed skilled help and support. Almost 3,000 subscribers to Adoption UK's newsletter responded to the survey by BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4programme. More than a quarter of families, when asked to describe their adoption, said they were facing serious challenges that had an impact on the wider family, were at risk of breakdown or disruption, or had already been disrupted. Almost half said their adoption was ""challenging but stable"" and just over a quarter described it as ""fulfilling and stable"". Jane knew adopting a little girl from care would not be easy, but nothing prepared her for what came next. ""She was developmentally delayed, so when she was three and a half, all the severe behaviour started to come out"", she said. ""She could be lovely one minute and very violent and aggressive the next."" Jane, not her real name, and her husband said they asked their local authority for help, but it was not forthcoming. ""The whole time we were saying, 'We're in trouble, she needs help; we need help.' But getting anything was a struggle."" As the years went by, their daughter's behaviour became more extreme. Her husband, Keith, found it difficult to manage. ""She became obsessed with blood,"" he said. ""She was self-harming and would write on the walls with her own blood. She would pull her own baby teeth out. We reached such a stage that our daughter had become unparentable - she was only six or seven. I couldn't cope."" In the end, Keith made the decision to send their daughter back to care. The couple say it was the most difficult decision of their lives. ""She's in such turmoil, but her behaviour is not her fault,"" Jane added. ""She needs help from professionals to make sense of what happened to her. You should be able to get that help."" The family's local authority would not comment on their case, but said they were committed to supporting all adoptive families throughout their journey and they ""seek to learn lessons"" when adoptions do break down. In the UK, around 5,500 children are adopted every year. The majority of adoptions involve children over the age of one, siblings and children with disabilities, who have been taken into care. Many have suffered trauma, neglect and abuse which can result in a range of complex developmental and psychological difficulties. Research suggests almost three-quarters of adopted children have significant mental health problems of one kind or another. Parents who deal with the fallout of these problems, say family life can be extremely difficult. Many parents described being punched, kicked or threatened with knives. But some reported more serious incidents, including hospital visits and sexual assault. Dr Sue Armstrong Brown from Adoption UK said it was important not to demonise children. ""We're talking about trauma-fuelled violence from children who will have witnessed the unthinkable in their early lives,"" she said. ""Adoption is not a silver bullet. These children's problems don't just disappear overnight. Both adoptive parents and adopted children need skilled help and support. ""Despite the challenges, adopters are resilient and these results reinforce that adoption can work for the vast majority.""

Labour proposes new tax on bookmakers,"Labour has said it would force bookmakers to pay a compulsory levy to help treat problem gamblers. Deputy leader Tom Watson said the cash would be used for treatment to end the ""destructive cycle of addiction"". Speaking at the party conference in Brighton, he urged gambling firms to ""stop targeting vulnerable people and start acting properly"". The Association of British Bookmakers said it wouldn't oppose an ""appropriate levy"" to help treat gambling addicts. The tricky issue of problem gambling Labour pledges to ban gambling ads on football kits Labour 'would bring existing PFI contracts in-house' Labour has vowed to tackle Britain's ""hidden epidemic of gambling addiction"", and earlier this month proposed a ban on adverts for betting firms on football shirts. Mr Watson returned to the theme in his speech to delegates on Tuesday, saying some companies are ""deliberately targeting our poorest communities even as hundreds of thousands of lives are ruined by addiction"". ""Gambling addiction is an illness and it's about time it was taken seriously,"" he said. He announced a review which will also examine the ability of the NHS to offer mental health services to gambling addicts. A 2015report,externalby the Gambling Commission estimated the number of ""problem gamblers"" to be between 300,000 to 430,000 people. It defined this as ""gambling to a degree that compromises, disrupts or damages family, personal or recreational pursuits"". Currently, gambling companies make voluntary contributions to the charity GambleAware to help pay for education, research, and treating gambling addiction. But Labour will consider replacing this with a compulsory system. The Association of British Bookmakers said it backed an ""evidence-based approach to helping problem gambling in the UK and would support Mr Watson's idea of a review, if it facilitated this"". A spokesman added: ""We also would not oppose an appropriate, compulsory levy on the gambling industry to fund problem gambling treatment, as we have long argued that the gambling industry needs to work together to reduce the number of problem gamblers and address the fact that most problem gamblers move between different forms of gambling."" Also on day three of Labour's conference in Brighton, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for a Â£500m winter bailout for the NHS. Labour say the extra money is needed to boost the capacity of hospitals, allow the NHS to hire extra non-agency staff and improve the transfer of patients to social care. The party has pledged to boost spending on the NHS through a 5% hike in income tax for the highest earners and says a winter bailout could be paid for through this. The government said it has ""robust plans in place"" for winter which are supported by ""an extra Â£100m for A&E departments and Â£2bn funding for the social care system"".

Sir Terry Wogan named top BBC radio DJ,"Sir Terry did two stints as Radio 2's breakfast show presenter Sir Terry Wogan has been named the greatest BBC radio presenter of the last 50 years in a Radio Times poll of broadcasting experts.

Fighting the floods: Is forewarned forearmed?,"Flooding in the Dominican Republic continues long after Hurricane Maria has passed With hundreds dead and millions either left homeless, or facing huge damage to their properties, catastrophic flooding has devastated many parts of the world. Nature's fury may seem unstoppable, but can technology at least help us to cope better? Savage hurricanes and record rains have struck around the world, bringing chaos to many countries and regions, including Bangladesh, India, the Caribbean, China and Texas in the US. Each year on average, flooding affects 96.9 million people worldwide, and causes $13.7bn (Â£10bn) in damage, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Those figures are likely to rise dramatically after this year's deluges. ""There are now many indications that the incidence of storms and persistent rainfall events is increasing with climate change,"" says Dr Justin Butler, chief executive of Brighton-based flood risk assessment firm Ambiental. But more accurate data from satellites and ground-based sensors, coupled with supercomputer modelling and machine learning, are giving us a clearer picture of which areas are likely to be most affected, says Mr Butler. ""Tens of thousands of simulations need to be run to capture a range of possible events,"" he explains, ""so the number of calculations that have to be carried out every second runs into the billions."" This kind of modelling is helping authorities plan flood defences more effectively, insurers price risk more accurately, emergency services improve how they respond, and homeowners take better protective measures. Ambiental's ""digital terrain models"", built up using Lidar (light distance and ranging) laser technology and other data, map how water flows across urban and rural landscapes. Highly detailed satellite data is helping to improve flood map modelling Its Flowroute modelling engine crunches all the data from sensors on land and in the sky - as well as historic data - to simulate complex flood flow patterns and make predictions. All this extra data and computing power is helping insurance companies improve their pricing. Liz Mitchell, founder of flood insurance specialist Flood Assist, says: ""Recent flood events have seen insurers invest in more sophisticated data, which is allowing them to assess the flood risk of an individual property rather than that of a postcode. ""You can have many properties registered at a postcode, and some could literally be at the top of a hill and others at the bottom - they would represent very different risks."" In the 2011 Brisbane floods, Ambiental's model was 95% accurate, claims Mr Butler, correctly predicting flooding in 19 out of every 20 flooded properties. More accurate modelling means some householders in previously ""high risk"" areas could see their premiums coming down. But other householders, of course, could see their premiums rising after a reassessment. Puerto Rico was also badly hit by Hurricane Maria, but the people were forewarned ""The use of data varies greatly from insurer-to-insurer. The more sophisticated the data the more accurate - theoretically - their pricing should be,"" says Ms Mitchell. Given that the cost of winter flooding in the UK last year was estimated to be Â£1.3bn, insurers are desperate to get a clearer picture of their likely liabilities. More extreme weather needs more sophisticated monitoring, which is why Nasa has funded the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS), an experimental online computer program run by the University of Maryland. It can make almost real-time flood analysis by combining data from satellites with a sophisticated land surface model that incorporates vegetation cover, soil type, and terrain. If water cannot soak away into the land, flood surges are more probable, and knowing where these are likely to hit is crucial for saving lives. Organisations like the Red Cross and the UN World Food Program are already using GFMS before, during, and after floods to supplement other on-the-ground intelligence they may have. Japan's H-2A rocket carried the Himawari 8 weather satellite into orbit in 2014 Dr Robert Adler, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland and one of the system's developers, says new Nasa satellite data has helped increase the accuracy of the model significantly - particularly useful during the recent Hurricane Harvey. But he is not complacent. ""We've made a lot of progress and have had success,"" he says, ""but there is still far to go. Improvements in the satellite rainfall estimates will lead directly to improved flood analysis."" Computational power is useless without accurate data to work with, so groundbreaking new satellites, such as the Japanese Himawari-8, are making a big difference. How 'the invisible network' poses a major security threat Why switching to fully electric cars will take time How to make money the Instagram way Why Sweden is close to becoming a cashless economy It generates about 50 times more data than previous satellites, and can analyse average rainfall using thermal infrared images that read the temperature of cloud tops. As well as advances in satellites, more sophisticated ground-based sensors are also improving modern flood prediction. For example, the UK's Flood Network is harnessing the ""internet of things"" with the aim of creating an extensive, localised, early-warning system for flood-prone areas. It uses wireless sensors monitoring water levels in streams, groundwater and river basins. The data is transmitted over a Low-Power Wide-Area Network designed for long-range communications at a low bit rate. Flood Network's sensors send water level data wirelessly The initiative between Oxford-based Nominet and the Oxford Flood Network was launched in 2015, less than a year after the city was hit by floods that cut off major routes and homes for days. ""Although the Environment Agency provides blanket warnings, it has limited resources and uses just a few, expensive, professional sensors,"" says Adam Leach, Nominet's head of research and development. ""We thought that a higher density of sensors with more detailed data would make a real difference to monitoring water levels in flood-prone areas, particularly in small waterways. ""It's still relatively early days for the Flood Network,"" he adds, ""but it demonstrates the huge potential the internet of things has to deliver the 'smart city' projects we've all heard so much about."" Forewarned is forearmed, they say, but a future Technology of Business feature will look at the technologies helping protect householders and businesses from the damage such floods can cause.

Palestinian gunman kills three Israelis,"The attack happened as Palestinian workers waited to enter the settlement Three Israelis have been shot dead by a Palestinian at the entrance to the Jewish settlement of Har Adar in the occupied West Bank, Israeli police say. The gunman, a 37-year-old from a nearby village, was also shot and died later. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the attack on Palestinian incitement. It came as Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt arrived in Jerusalem to try to revive Israel-Palestinian peace talks. The White House has tried to lay the groundwork for a resumption of negotiations since Donald Trump took office in January, but there has been no sign of progress. Peace talks between the two sides broke down amid acrimony in April 2014. What are Jewish settlements? Police say the gunman, identified in Israeli media as Nimer Jamal, struck after he raised suspicions of security personnel at a rear gate at Har Adar. He shot his victims - two security guards and a border policeman - at close-range and seriously wounded another person, before being shot by security forces. The gunman was a father-of-four who had an Israeli permit to work in Jewish settlements along the boundary of the West Bank, Israel's internal security agency said. The gunman opened fire at guards as he approached a checkpoint Three were killed, and another seriously injured He came from the village of Beit Surik, about a mile east of Har Adar. The area is about 18km (11 miles) north-west of Jerusalem. No group has taken responsibility for the attack, although Gaza-based Palestinian militant organisations Hamas and Islamic Jihad welcomed it. The head of the Information Office of Fatah, the political faction of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said Israel bore responsibility for the attack, because of its ""continuous aggression"" against the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said the attacker's home would be demolished and relatives' work permits revoked. He called on Mr Abbas to condemn the attack unequivocally. About 36,000 Palestinians have permits to work in Jewish settlements, where security to guard against attacks is tight. The issue of settlements is one of the most contentious between Israel and the Palestinians, who see them as an obstacle to peace. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Israeli police released a photo of the gun used Tuesday's attack is the latest in a wave of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings of Israelis predominantly by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since late 2015. Since then, some 50 Israelis and five foreign nationals have been killed in such attacks in Israel and the Occupied Territories. Around 300 Palestinians - most of them assailants, Israel says - have also been killed in that period, according to AFP news agency. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops. Israel says Palestinian incitement has fuelled the attacks. The Palestinian leadership has blamed frustration rooted in decades of Israeli occupation. Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved?

Court blames 'promiscuous' rape survivor,"A recent Indian court order suspending the jail terms of three young men guilty of gang-rape and blackmail, even labelling the victim as ""promiscuous"", stands out for being regressive, writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi. A two-judge bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court awarded bail to three law students from the elite Jindal Global Law School who had been convicted by a lower court in March for blackmailing and gang-raping a fellow student. Hardik Sikri and Karan Chhabra were sentenced to 20 years in prison, while their friend Vikas Garg was handed a seven-year term. They were all also found guilty of other crimes and given smaller terms, but these were to run concurrently. According to court documents, the young woman had a consensual relationship with Sikri in November 2013 which lasted a month, after which she broke up with him. But for the next 18 months, he used her nude photographs to blackmail her and rape her. Not just that, he also forced her to have sex with his two friends and on one occasion, Sikri and Chhabra gang-raped her. The convicts appealed in the high court and asked to be freed on bail while the case was being heard - and the court agreed. How myths and stereotypes colour rape sentencing in India Delhi rapist says victim shouldn't have fought back In a country where thousands of people under trial languish in prison for decades, often for minor crimes, it is shocking that men convicted of crimes as serious as gang-rape and blackmail were freed on bail. What is worse is that the short 12-page court order is littered with statements that have been described by the Indian media as some of the ""worst examples of victim shaming"". The young woman was castigated for drinking beer, smoking, taking drugs, keeping condoms in her room and not confiding in her parents that she was being abused. The victim's testimony ""offers an alternate story of casual relationship with her friends, acquaintances, adventurism and experimentation in sexual encounters"". Her ""allegations regarding her being threatened into submission and blackmail lend sufficient diabolism to the offence, but a careful examination of her statement again offers an alternate conclusion of misadventure stemming from a promiscuous attitude and a voyeuristic mind"". Her ""narrative does not throw up gut wrenching violence that normally precede or accompany such incidents"". Read the full court order,external In their order, Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Raj Shekhar Attri said they intended ""to balance the concerns of the victim, demands of the society and law and the element of reformatory and rehabilitative justice"". ""It would be a travesty if these young minds are confined to jail for an inordinate long period which would deprive them of their education, opportunity to redeem themselves and be a part of the society as normal beings,"" they added. Predictably, the court order has been greeted with howls of protest in India. Many took to social media to express their anger and the victim's friends started apetition,externalonchange.org,externalcondemning the judgement. Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy told the BBC that the order ""implies she had no right not to be raped"". A judgement like this, she says, takes away hard-won victories for women's legal equality. ""This order seems to be innocent of the legal definition of consent and of the judgements of the Supreme Court that are quite clear that even a woman of 'easy virtue' may well withhold consent. Any sex after that is rape,"" Ms Nundy says. In a society steeped in patriarchy, it's not uncommon for women to be blamed for inviting sexual assault and rape. Victims are often blamed for wearing short skirts or jeans, having boyfriends, being out late at night, or even talking on mobile phones. In fact, until 2003, we even had a law that allowed victim shaming. Under Section 155(4) of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872, it was essentially the rape victims who were put on trial and the accused were often allowed to go scot-free if they could prove that ""the victim was of generally immoral character"". In 1980, the Law Commission suggested that the archaic law be amended and in 2000, the Commission recommended its deletion, saying that it could destroy a victim's reputation and self-respect. Decades later, however, victims continue to be shamed.

PM to meet Donald Tusk for Brexit talks,"European Council president Donald Tusk has said not enough progress has been made to move to the next phase of Brexit talks in Brussels. He said Theresa May's ""realistic"" speech on Friday showed the UK's ""philosophy of having a cake and eating it is finally coming to an end"". But he said ""there is not sufficient progress yet"". Mrs May had hoped her offer of a two-year transition period after Brexit would unblock talks in Brussels. 'No excuses' over Brexit progress - Davis 'Too early' to assess Brexit progress No deal in latest Scots-UK Brexit talks Emerging from Downing Street after talks with Mrs May, Mr Tusk said: ""I feel cautiously optimistic about the constructive and more realistic tone in the prime minister's speech in Florence and of our discussion today. ""This shows that the philosophy of having a cake and eating it, is finally at an end. At least I hope so. That's good news. ""But of course no-one will ever tell me that Brexit is a good thing because as I have always said, in fact, Brexit is only about damage control. ""And I didn't change my opinion.  I feel now we will discuss our future relations with the UK once there is so-called sufficient progress. ""The two sides are working and we will work hard at it. But if you ask me and if today member states ask me, I would say there is no sufficient progress yet. But we will work on it."" His words come a month before the European Council will decide whether sufficient progress has been made to begin trade talks, as the UK wants. Hesitant, understated, but with a very clear message. In fact, so quietly spoken those of us listening here, crouched beneath the cameras, a metre from his shoes, could barely hear his words. Two pieces of imagery have been frequently leaned on in updates on the Brexit negotiations. The EU has a love of noisy timepieces; all those references to ticking clocks. And the desire of some in the UK to have our cake and eat it crops up quite a bit too. Mr Tusk's ""hope"" that the references to gorging on confectionery are over stood out. But so too did his blunt assessment that more has to be achieved before the talks move on to the future relationship. So, for the prime minister, did her Florence speech do the business? From her perspective, it looks like it has worked a bit, but not yet enough. The council says it first wants more detail on citizen's rights, a financial settlement and the Irish border before turning to the kind of trade deal the UK will have with the EU after it leaves. Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is taking part in the fourth round of Brexit talks in Brussels, said that Mrs May had shown ""leadership and flexibility"" in her Florence speech and given reassurances on financial issues. There were ""no excuses for standing in the way of progress"", he insisted. But the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier called for a ""moment of clarity"" from the UK. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said he was ""keen and eager"" for the UK to translate the ""constructive"" sentiments in Mrs May's speech into firm negotiating positions on issues such as citizens' rights, the Irish border and financial issues, including the UK's so-called divorce bill. Remarking that it had been six months since the UK triggered Article 50, he said progress on these three fronts was essential to allow talks to move on to the future of the bilateral trade relationship, as the UK would like. ""We are six months into the process,"" he said. ""We are getting closer to the UK's withdrawal. I think this moment should be a moment of clarity."" This video can not be played Phillippe Lamberts: ""Sometimes I think this might be the factor that derails the Brexit negotiations even more than money"" Speaking ahead of her meeting with Mr Tusk, Mrs May said that ""by being creative"" the UK and the EU can maintain cooperation and partnership when the UK leaves the EU. And she said that ""things have moved on"" in terms of the discussions and negotiations in the Brexit talks.
