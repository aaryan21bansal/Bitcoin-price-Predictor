Dame Kelly Holmes shares relief at coming out,"Dame Kelly Holmes says she is ""getting rid of that fear"" as the Olympic champion reveals she is gay. In an interviewwith the Sunday Mirror,external, the 52-year-old said she was both nervous and excited about coming out. ""I needed to do this now, for me. It was my decision. I'm nervous about saying it. I feel like I'm going to explode with excitement,"" she said. ""Sometimes I cry with relief. The moment this comes out, I'm essentially getting rid of that fear."" Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the Athens games in 2004. She has achieved seven gold, eight silver and four bronze Olympic, Commonwealth and European medals throughout her athletic career. She shared the news during Pride month, which celebrates and raises awareness about LGBTQ+ communities and will this year commemorate 50 years since the UK's first Pride march. Writing on Instagramas the interview was published,externalonline, Dame Kelly said: ""I can finally breathe. ""Yes I have been petrified of putting this out - you have no idea. ""This journey has been the hardest part of life. Living with any kind of fear is debilitating"". Several celebrities posted supportive comments, including comedian Alan Carr, professional dancer Oti Mabuse, music producer Naughty Boy, and drag queen Baga Chipz. Dame Kelly said she had also filmed a documentary for ITV about helping people ""live their authentic lives"" - it airs later this month. In her interview with the Mirror, Dame Kelly spoke of her concern that she would be punished for being gay and serving in the Army. ""I was convinced throughout my whole life that if I admitted to being gay in the Army I'd still be in trouble,"" she said. She described an incident where the Royal Military Police searched her accommodation in what she believed to be an attempt to uncover her sexuality. ""They pulled everything out of your cupboard, turned out the beds and drawers, read letters - everything - trying to catch us out, so we could be arrested, court martialled and potentially go to jail,"" she said. Dame Kelly left professional running at 18 to join the Army in the late 1980s, becoming an HGV driver and a physical training instructor. She was awarded an MBE for services to the Army in 1998, and in 2018, she became the first person to be appointed Honorary Colonel to a regular unit, the Royal Armoured Corps. Gay, transgender and bisexual people in the military faced prison if their sexuality or gender identity was discovered. The law was changed in 2000 after four servicemen and women, who were sacked for being gay, won a case in the European Court of Human Rights.

Workers take to streets amid cost of living crisis,"Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of London to demand action from the government on the cost of living crisis. Workers marched to Parliament to call for better pay and conditions as part of the event organised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The union has called for a ""decent pay rise for public sector workers"" and a Â£15 minimum wage. A Treasury spokesman said it had ""stepped in to ease the burden"". The spokesman added that the government was ""helping eight million of the most vulnerable British families through at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year -  and giving every household Â£400 to help pay their energy bills"". Protesters set off from Portland Place and headed towards Parliament Square at about 12:00 BST as part of the We Demand Better march. The TUC said its research suggested workers have lost almost Â£20,000 since 2008 because pay has not kept pace with inflation. General secretary Frances O'Grady told BBC News that ordinary working people were saying ""enough is enough"" after over 10 years of stagnant pay. ""We want government to listen - workers are not the cause of inflation, they are suffering the impact of inflation,"" she said. Ben Robinson, 25, who works for a housing charity in Brixton, south London, was at the protest. He said some residents faced a choice ""between feeding their own kids, not themselves, their own kids, and paying rent and heating, and that is just not a choice that anyone should have to face"". Teachers joined the Trade Union Congress protest to call for better pay Members of NASUWT, the Teachers' Union, were among those who attended the march and called for the profession to receive a ""pay uplift and an urgent rebalancing of workload"". The union said that with living expenses surging ahead of wages, the value of teachers' pay had fallen by 19% over the last 12 years. Teacher Stephen Brown said he was attending the march because many of those in his profession were now leaving - piling on the pressure for those who stay in classrooms. ""We've had a pay freeze for the past few years... teachers are leaving the profession because they are struggling so much, they just think it's not worth it,"" he said. The Department for Education (DfE) said it was ""incredibly grateful for the continued efforts of teachers and school leaders in supporting pupils"" and work was ongoing to ""deliver pay increases and pay awards for new and experienced teachers"". A Treasury spokesman added: ""As part of our Â£37bn support package we're also saving the typical employee over Â£330 a year through the imminent National Insurance tax cut, are allowing universal credit claimants to keep Â£1,000 more of what they earn and have made the biggest cut to all fuel duty rates ever.""

Rwandan Anglican archbishop defends UK asylum plan,"Rwandan cleric Laurent Mbanda spent most of his childhood living in neighbouring Burundi Rwanda's Anglican Archbishop says he disagrees with senior Church of England leaders over the UK's asylum plan. Earlier this week, they had said the policy to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda ""shames Britain"". But Archbishop Laurent Mbanda said it was not immoral and Rwanda was ready to welcome people needing a home. He said many Rwandans had lived in exile because of the genocide in the 1990s, so they understood the issues faced by people fleeing their homes. Under the terms of the five-year deal, Rwanda becomes responsible for the asylum seekers who had travelled to the UK. They will be accommodated and supported while their claim is processed - and if granted permanent refugee status, will remain in Rwanda. If unsuccessful, they will be offered the chance to apply for other immigration routes, but could face removal from the country. So far no-one has been sent to Rwanda from the UK. A flight that was due to take asylum seekers was cancelled before take-off, following a last-minute intervention by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion Rwanda's 100 days of slaughter The Anglican Churches in Africa have an increasingly tense relationship with their mother church over Biblical interpretations of issues like same-sex marriage. Archbishop Mbanda says he believes that as colonial days are over, the African churches have to think and speak for themselves. The Anglican Church, the cleric says, is led by one among equals, and that it is time for the African churches to challenge their mother church, not waiting for the Archbishop of Canterbury to tell them what to do. During his Easter sermon at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Reverend Justin Welby had suggested the UK's asylum plan was ""ungodly"". This was followed by a joint letter signed by the UK Anglican bishops, which said the country could not outsource its ethical responsibilities. It was published in the UK's Times newspaper on Tuesday - the day the first flight to Rwanda was cancelled. The bishops said those to be removed to Rwanda have had no chance to appeal, or reunite with family in the UK But Archbishop Mbanda says accepting the asylum seekers in Rwanda will help alleviate a global crisis and the whole issue of migration and people without a home. He said that was not a burden of one person but a burden that countries should share. Having spent most of his life as a refugee before returning to Rwanda to live, the archbishop says he knows what it is like to be without a home. The asylum plan has also been privately criticised by Prince Charles,according to reports last week in the Times and Daily Mail. The heir to the British throne is to travel to Rwanda's capital, Kigali, next week for a big Commonwealth gathering. Ahead of the meeting, Amnesty International has urged the Commonwealth leaders to remind the UK about its international responsibility under the Refugee Convention. ""Commonwealth leaders must take a firm and clear stance to force the UK government to rescind its misguided, cruel and racist policy that shifts its responsibility towards refugees and asylum seekers to Rwanda,"" the rights group said.

"Firms must help cut living costs, says No10 adviserThe new cost of living tsar says he wants ""old friends and colleagues... to help the British people"".UK Politics","Private companies must ""come to the party and help"" with rising living costs, Boris Johnson's new cost-of-living tsar has said. David Buttress was appointed earlier this week, and his job is to tackle the problems faced by households amid soaring prices in food, fuel and essentials. The Just Eat co-founder told the BBC he would use his position to encourage ""old friends and colleagues... to help the British people"". He will have six months in the role, but no budget to increase spending or ministerial powers to cut taxes. So what does he think he can deliver in the unpaid role? In his first media interview, he said: ""People will see if I succeed or fail."" Living costs tsar called for Boris Johnson to go Why are prices rising so quickly? People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise He said his three measures of success would be making real practical interventions to get food shops, utilities and leisure businesses to cut costs. ""If you think about all the money that's spent on marketing and doing deals to promote some of the big leisure activities that the British people enjoy - let's take some of that money. ""Let's refocus it on what really matters to people which is making their prices more competitive so their money goes further and they can still enjoy a good day out as a family."" Mr Buttress has been appointed as cost-of living-tsar amid a sharp increase in prices. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at a 40-year high of 9%, and the Bank of England warned it could surpass 11% later this year. David Buttress has been critical of Boris Johnson's leadership Expert advisers to government, tsars tend to draw up reports and attempt to bring fresh thinking to ingrained social problems like homelessness, drug abuse and anti-social behaviour. Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown loved appointing tsars. During David Cameron's premiership, Lord Sugar, Jamie Oliver and Mary Portas were among the familiar faces from TV moonlighting as policy advisers. The latest tsar - Mr Buttress - is a proud Welshman. He is chairman of Dragons rugby union club in Newport, and a prominent supporter of Welsh independence. He has also has been a harsh critic of the Westminster government - and called for Mr Johnson to resign over Partygate. On his personal Twitter account in the past he has criticised a ""total absence"" of investment in the country and called voting Conservative an ""act of self-harm"". He also said that one in three children in Wales growing up in poverty took ""decades of neglect to create and no party in the last 100 years has done more damage to Wales than Conservatives."" Asked if he stood by these views he said: ""You have to bear in mind I had never met any of the team in No 10, least of all obviously the prime minister. ""I've always been very colourful on social media. I've always enjoyed the banter of Twitter. ""There's a really important job to do here - I think it says everything about this government and the prime minister that actually they're putting someone like me in place, who really cares about it, who wants to make a big impact in this area."" Last year, the government's education catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins resigned after ministers did not commit to nearly the amount of funding he thought was necessary to fix the problem. So, how will Mr Buttress convince ministers to back his ideas so ""tsar"" isn't just a title to look like action is being taken? ""I don't think I have to convince anyone. I think what I have to do is get off my backside and offer some practical things in place around those areas we've discussed that hit people's real lives. ""None of us should be sat here looking around the room thinking who else can take responsibility for this. ""All of us are in it together, which is why I want my old colleagues in business and industry to come to the party in the next six months and help."" Mr Buttress is a multimillionaire and successful venture capitalist, but insists that he ""knows what tough looks like"". ""I wasn't born into any kind of charmed existence - I grew up in South Wales in the 1980s and early 90s in a single parent family with three brothers. ""It was a pretty challenging environment. My mum had a part-time job at Sainsbury's, so I know how tough it is. ""At 11 years old, I went and got a paper round so I could make a contribution to help my mum out in the weekly shop. ""I like to think I'm still connected to that in reality both in terms of my family and friends - I've got the same friendship group I've always had since I was a young child - and I like to think I have a real empathy with what people are facing right now. ""That's what drives the passion inside me to do something about it. Frankly, if I didn't have that passion and desire to do something about it I wouldn't have to do it. I really think this matters."" The government is desperate to be seen to be doing everything it can to fight rising prices, with opinion polls suggesting the issue affect the Conservative vote at the next general election. Food prices have risen sharply in recent months and are expected to climb further Chancellor Rishi Sunak last month announced a Â£15bn package to help the most vulnerable cope with rising costs. But ministers have admitted they cannot help everybody all the time - and to some extent they are at the mercy of global markets. Asked what areas Mr Buttress would work on, his new bosses at the Cabinet Office highlighted ""price-locking"" campaigns by retailers Asda, Sainsbury's and Boots, where the prices of staple items are cut and kept in place for a limited period, as an example of what the private sector is already doing to help. Critics have suggested that such campaigns are a marketing gimmick, with the price of other items going up to pay for it. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were ""working hard to support customers struggling due to the rising cost of living"". ""Many are expanding their value ranges, keeping the price of essentials down and introducing discounts for vulnerable groups but this is putting pressure on them to find cost savings elsewhere."" The Cabinet Office also points to ""hardship funds"" set up by some energy suppliers, as something Mr Buttress could get involved in. How are rising prices affecting you?

Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were ""working hard to support customers struggling due to the rising cost of living"". ""Many are expanding their value ranges, keeping the price of essentials down and introducing discounts for vulnerable groups but this is putting pressure on them to find cost savings elsewhere."" The Cabinet Office also points to ""hardship funds"" set up by some energy suppliers, as something Mr Buttress could get involved in. How are rising prices affecting you?

LiveLiveZelensky visits front-line city in south Ukraine2 minutes ago,"Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Staff unable to drive new ambulances due to height,"Staff more than 6ft tall have experienced problems fitting into the Fiat ambulance cabs, the BBC has found Dozens of staff at an ambulance trust claim they cannot drive its Â£54m fleet of new vehicles due to their height or body shape. Documents reveal a string of problems with converted Fiats, which replaced the ageing Mercedes vans at the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST). The vehicles are part of an NHS drive to standardise its fleet and are being adopted by trusts across the country. An EEAST spokesperson said it had been working to address the issues. The trust brought in a specialist to assess 160 staff members who, due to their height and body shape, had come forward having experienced a range of problems. Ninety-four have now been identified as being unable to drive the vehicles. Entries from the trust's risk management system - and obtained via the Freedom of Information Act - reveal how taller staff in particular experienced difficulties fitting into the cabs of the modified Fiat Ducatos. Complaints ranged from back pain, not being able to see out of the windscreen properly to knees and shins scraping the dashboard. Other entries detail instances of: The engine cutting out when driving over potholes and speed bumps, due to a vehicle safety feature which has since been improved. In one instance, a critically ill child's transfer to hospital was delayed while a replacement vehicle was called Drivers in work boots finding pedals too close together, resulting in the accelerator being pressed instead of the brake Hands and fingers becoming trapped in the sliding door, with one staff member breaking two fingers. Mandatory training on this has now been rolled out One emergency medical technician told the BBC: ""I was told that anyone over 5ft 9in (1.75m) would be unable to drive it as they would not be able to achieve a comfortable and safe driving position. ""I did try to get into the driver's seat but I couldn't adjust the seat to allow me to operate the pedals properly and the steering wheel was pressed against my legs, making it difficult to steer safely."" They added there had been long delays when trying to book an alternative vehicle when starting a shift. An alert issued by the East of England Ambulance Service warning of a burn risk due to the proximity of a heating outlet An alert was also issued to staff after someone escorting a patient was severely burned on the leg by a heater outlet in the back of the ambulance. However, the trust said this was not an issue confined to the Fiats and is a known danger for floor vent type heating. The adapted Fiat Ducatos have been rolled out across the country as ambulance services standardised their vehicle procurement followinga report by Lord Carter of Coles in 2019,,externalwhich led to a national specification. In it, he stated ""it is simply unacceptable that trusts purchase different ambulances and stock them with different equipment and medicines"". EEAST uses a box design for its Fiats, whereas most trusts use the panel van version, though the cabs are the same. This is because it was ahead of the national specification work. It followed extensive testing with different trial vehicles, staff engagement and a board review that approved the purchase of the Fiats in 2018. The trust branch of the union Unison is now working with colleagues around the UK to challenge the national specification. EEAST has raised concerns with NHS England and Improvement (NHSE&I). EEAST chief executive Tom Abell is now in talks with other ambulance bosses and NHSE&I to learn from the experience in the East of England. The trust serves Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. An EEAST spokesperson said the fleet was rolled out three years ago, following ""extensive trials with colleagues and consultation with staff, trade unions, patients and carer groups"". ""Since the rollout, a small number of colleagues raised concerns about the cab area, which is the same as the current national ambulance specification,"" he said. ""We have been working to address these issues, which affect a small proportion of our colleagues, through assessment by an independent ergonomist to identify potential modifications to the vehicles."" It said some of its older Mercedes ambulances had been retained for staff unable to drive the Fiats, and it was ""exploring further options for a more permanent solution"". There have also been issues with the cabs at another ambulance service. Taller staff at the South East Coast Ambulance Trust said they also had problems with seatbelts not fitting properly. A spokeswoman for Fiat said: ""The Fiat Professional Ducato, alongside all vehicles, must adhere to a European type approval as well as Euro NCAP, a rigorous set of safety tests. ""The installation of seat belts is carried out in accordance with rules set by the ECE14 and ECE16 standards. ""If these standards are not adhered to, the vehicle cannot be approved and therefore sold. Fiat Professional's vehicles, including the Ducato, fully comply with all legislation.""

People told not to travel by train,"Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during strikes next week, with only a fifth of services due to run. Network Rail said about half of all rail lines will be closed when thousands of workers walk out across Britain on 21, 23 and 25 June. The services that run will start and finish earlier, from 07:30 to 18:30. There will be no trains at all in many places including north from Glasgow or Edinburgh and to Penzance in Cornwall. ""Make no mistake, the level of service we will be able to offer will be significantly compromised and passengers need to take that into account and to plan ahead and only travel if it's really necessary to do so,"" Network Rail boss Andrew Haines said. Network Rail, which owns and maintains the country's railways, said there would also be no passenger services to locations including Bournemouth in Dorset, Swansea in south Wales, Holyhead in north Wales, Chester in Cheshire and Blackpool in Lancashire. Open lines include the West Coast Main Line from London to Scotland via locations such as Birmingham and Manchester. However, with trains running for shorter hours on strike days, final departures will be much earlier than usual. For example, the last train from Manchester to London will leave at 14:47 and the last from Norwich to London at 16:00, with the last train from London to Edinburgh at 14:00. Rural and district lines will be most affected by the action. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? The timetable from 20 June to 26 June is still being finalised, but the number of services is expected to be around 4,500 compared with 20,000 normally, Network Rail said. Disruption is also expected to carry over into non-strike days during the week, when only about 60% of services are expected to run. This is due to not enough staff being on shift overnight to get services ready for the following day. A number of train operators including Southeastern, TransPennine and Avanti West Coast have urged passengers to only travel by rail if necessary, while Northern has asked people ""not to travel"" on trains between Tuesday and Sunday. Several large events could be affected by the strikes, ranging from Glastonbury Festival, which runs from 22 to 26 June, to a cricket Test match between England and New Zealand taking place from 23 to 27 June. Pensioner Linda is supposed to be travelling by train from Great Yarmouth to London for a Rolling Stones concert on 25 June. She paid Â£100 per ticket but she is now unsure if there is any way for her to get there now. ""If I was to book a coach, it would cost a lot more - plus increase the travel time; two-and-a-half hours on the train becomes five to six hours on a coach,"" she told the BBC. ""And there's no way we'd get to the concert in time."" Elsewhere, Megan, a 15-year-old pupil at Bradford Grammar School, doesn't know how she will get to school. ""Both my parents work. My mum is a doctor so she's got to be in [work] really early,"" she said. ""I think we'll just have to organise lifts with someone."" ""It's just stressful. With traffic and everyone getting a lift in, it's going to be a nightmare,"" she added. Megan is worried how she'll get to school The school's bursar Homera Najib said about 300 pupils travel in by train from across Yorkshire and Leeds using the nearby Frizinghall station. She has contacted parents who have to make their own alternative arrangements to get their children to school, she said. ""We know this is going to be a real inconvenience for our pupils, especially at a time when we've got public examinations going on,"" she said. ""These are the first public examinations in two years so something like this that really throws a spanner in the works doesn't help the levels of stress."" More than 40,000 RMT union members from Network Rail and 13 train firms plan to walk out. The industrial action, which has been described as the ""biggest rail strike in modern history"", involves union members which include railway staff such as guards and signalling operators. RMT announced the strike action last week after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. On the first day of the planned strike on 21 June, London Underground RMT workers plan to walk out in a separate dispute over pensions and job losses. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said talks with the union had ""not progressed as far as I had hoped"" and so preparations had begun for a strike. The strikes may be less disruptive for commuters, with more people now able to work from home since the pandemic. But the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said ""millions of people"", including those who cannot work remotely, students sitting exams and others travelling for summer events, would still be affected. The mood music right now is that not enough progress has been made in negotiations to stop next week's walkouts. Assuming they go ahead, there will be disruption across the whole week. The involvement of Network Rail signalling staff means the number of trains that can run is particularly limited. On strike days, the signallers' replacements can only cover 12 hours, hence services will start late and finish early - where they run at all. Busy, key routes have been prioritised, meaning vast swathes of the country will be left with no services at all. Network Rail says next week's action will cost up to Â£150m in lost revenue and aborted work. The RMT union has claimed Network Rail plans to cut up to 2,500 jobs as part of a Â£2bn reduction in spending, with the proposed job cuts including workers who maintain tracks, signals and overhead lines. It also said train operators had been subject to pay freezes and changes to their terms and conditions. The RMT has called for a meeting with the transport secretary and chancellor, saying it had become clear that the Treasury was ""calling the shots and not allowing rail employers to reach a negotiated settlement"". But a deal is ""unlikely at the moment"", said RMT's Eddie Dempsey, who accused the government of ""relishing the thought of having a dispute to distract from some other issues"". A Department for Transport spokesperson said unions had ""gone on the record saying they don't negotiate with this government"", adding: ""They're right: they must negotiate with the employers."" The rail industry is under pressure to save money due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and Network Rail has said it wants to modernise working practices. It estimated between 1,500 and 2,000 fewer staff would be needed, but insists this could be achieved through voluntary means. As part of a separate strike, Aslef, a union representing train drivers, has announced walkouts at three companies in rows over pay on 26 June at Hull Trains, at Greater Anglia on 23 June, and on Croydon Tramlink on 28, 29 June and 13 and 14 July.

"Workers take to streets amid cost of living crisisThousands of workers marched to Parliament to demand better pay, in an event organised by the TUC.London","Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of London to demand action from the government on the cost of living crisis. Workers marched to Parliament to call for better pay and conditions as part of the event organised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The union has called for a ""decent pay rise for public sector workers"" and a Â£15 minimum wage. A Treasury spokesman said it had ""stepped in to ease the burden"". The spokesman added that the government was ""helping eight million of the most vulnerable British families through at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year -  and giving every household Â£400 to help pay their energy bills"". Protesters set off from Portland Place and headed towards Parliament Square at about 12:00 BST as part of the We Demand Better march. The TUC said its research suggested workers have lost almost Â£20,000 since 2008 because pay has not kept pace with inflation. General secretary Frances O'Grady told BBC News that ordinary working people were saying ""enough is enough"" after over 10 years of stagnant pay. ""We want government to listen - workers are not the cause of inflation, they are suffering the impact of inflation,"" she said. Ben Robinson, 25, who works for a housing charity in Brixton, south London, was at the protest. He said some residents faced a choice ""between feeding their own kids, not themselves, their own kids, and paying rent and heating, and that is just not a choice that anyone should have to face"". Teachers joined the Trade Union Congress protest to call for better pay Members of NASUWT, the Teachers' Union, were among those who attended the march and called for the profession to receive a ""pay uplift and an urgent rebalancing of workload"". The union said that with living expenses surging ahead of wages, the value of teachers' pay had fallen by 19% over the last 12 years. Teacher Stephen Brown said he was attending the march because many of those in his profession were now leaving - piling on the pressure for those who stay in classrooms. ""We've had a pay freeze for the past few years... teachers are leaving the profession because they are struggling so much, they just think it's not worth it,"" he said. The Department for Education (DfE) said it was ""incredibly grateful for the continued efforts of teachers and school leaders in supporting pupils"" and work was ongoing to ""deliver pay increases and pay awards for new and experienced teachers"". A Treasury spokesman added: ""As part of our Â£37bn support package we're also saving the typical employee over Â£330 a year through the imminent National Insurance tax cut, are allowing universal credit claimants to keep Â£1,000 more of what they earn and have made the biggest cut to all fuel duty rates ever.""

"Woman gives birth in UK after fleeing Ukraine warStaff arranged a call so Lesia Husar could introduce her husband, who is still in Ukraine, to their son.","Lesia Husar said it was a ""big relief"" to be at the City Hospital in Nottingham A Ukrainian mother has thanked staff at a hospital after they arranged a WhatsApp call so her husband could meet their new child. Lesia Husar, 41, fled the city of Chernivtsi just weeks ago to escape the danger from Russian military action. She gave birth to Richard on Sunday with the father 1,200 miles away. Mrs Husar said it was a ""big relief"" to be at City Hospital in Nottingham and that her husband Taras, who is still in Ukraine, could share in the birth. Mrs Husar said she left Ukraine due to the constant fear of Russian air raids Staff at the hospital said Mrs Husar, who travelled with her 14-year-old daughter Renatta, did not want to leave her home when pregnant but she was constantly in fear of air raids. She was welcomed by a host family in Woodthorpe, Nottinghamshire, and found her room stacked with supplies, a pram, cot and clothes, ready for the baby. Richard weighed 4.5lb after a trouble-free birth. Mr Husar, 41, who was wounded while fighting Russian forces in 2014, is serving as a voluntary policeman. Mrs Husar said: ""I am so grateful to everyone - my host family and their neighbours and the staff at the hospital here in Nottingham. ""I was so stressed during my pregnancy, which doctors have said might explain why Richard was so small when he was born, but it has been a big relief to be cared for in Nottingham by such kind and supportive doctors and midwives. ""I love my country and want to go back to Ukraine soon, hopefully by the summer, but the war must end first before I can take my children back there."" They had decided to call their son Richard before the war started but Mr Husar said the baby having an English name now felt right.

Why do migrants leave France?,"Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024, figures released on New Year's Day show. Last year was the deadliest on record for people trying to make the crossing, according to a United Nations agency. In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. That's higher than in 2023, when29,437 people arrived. However, the highest recorded figures are for 2022, when 45,755 people made the crossing. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than23,000 did so after Labour won the July general election. Sir Keir said the UK's new Border Security Command would trace suspected people smugglers and shut down their bank accounts. They will also facetravel bans, social media blackouts and phone restrictionsunder new laws, the government has announced. Net migration hit record 906,000 last year Immigration cuts: Why prime ministers keep failing to meet their targets The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency,tracks the number of people who die crossing the Channel,external. It estimates that at least 78 migrants died trying to cross the Channel in 2024. The Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, withmore people crammed into less seaworthy boats,external.

Applications peaked at about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. Asylum applications have risen again in recent years, more than doubling from 45,318 in the year to September 2021 to 92,776 just one year later, followed by smaller increases since then. In the year to September 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 9,500 applications.

Deadly explosion rocks Sikh temple in Kabul,"Taliban members secured the scene An assault on a Sikh prayer site in Afghanistan has left one worshipper and a Taliban member dead as well as the unidentified attackers. The site in the capital Kabul was hit by a bomb early in the morning when up to 30 people were inside. It is the last remaining Sikh place of worship, or Gurdwara, in the capital. Community leaders recently estimated that just 140 Sikhs remained in predominantly Muslim Afghanistan, down from 100,000 in the 1970s. India, which is home to most of the world's Sikh population, said it was ""deeply concerned"" at news of the attack. A local official at the scene, Gornam Singh, told Reuters news agency that the Taliban were not allowing Sikhs to enter the site after the attack. The attackers reportedly initially used hand grenades to try and enter the compound of the Gurdwara TV footage showed grey plumes of smoke rising from the area. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters news agency the attackers had attempted to drive a car laden with explosives into the area but they detonated before they reached their target. The Taliban, which took control of Afghanistan last year, said a clearance operation was still under way although the attack had ended. The BBC's Secunder Kermani was interviewing relatives of victims outside a hospital when two Taliban militants stopped his crew, trying to delete their footage. Since the Taliban took power, the country has seen continuing attacks by rival Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State: In April,a bomb attack killed 31 peopleand injured 87 at a Shia Muslim mosque in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif In December,an assault on a military hospital in Kabul killed more than 20 peopleand injured 16 By Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan and Pakistan correspondent Afghanistan once had a thriving Sikh and Hindu population, but years of conflict and instability saw the community drastically shrink in size. By the time the Taliban took power last year, there were only fewer than 300 Sikhs left in Afghanistan.

"Rwandan Anglican archbishop defends UK asylum planLaurent Mbanda disagrees with senior Church of England clerics who have called the policy ""immoral"".Africa","Rwandan cleric Laurent Mbanda spent most of his childhood living in neighbouring Burundi Rwanda's Anglican Archbishop says he disagrees with senior Church of England leaders over the UK's asylum plan. Earlier this week, they had said the policy to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda ""shames Britain"". But Archbishop Laurent Mbanda said it was not immoral and Rwanda was ready to welcome people needing a home. He said many Rwandans had lived in exile because of the genocide in the 1990s, so they understood the issues faced by people fleeing their homes. Under the terms of the five-year deal, Rwanda becomes responsible for the asylum seekers who had travelled to the UK. They will be accommodated and supported while their claim is processed - and if granted permanent refugee status, will remain in Rwanda. If unsuccessful, they will be offered the chance to apply for other immigration routes, but could face removal from the country. So far no-one has been sent to Rwanda from the UK. A flight that was due to take asylum seekers was cancelled before take-off, following a last-minute intervention by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion Rwanda's 100 days of slaughter The Anglican Churches in Africa have an increasingly tense relationship with their mother church over Biblical interpretations of issues like same-sex marriage. Archbishop Mbanda says he believes that as colonial days are over, the African churches have to think and speak for themselves. The Anglican Church, the cleric says, is led by one among equals, and that it is time for the African churches to challenge their mother church, not waiting for the Archbishop of Canterbury to tell them what to do. During his Easter sermon at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Reverend Justin Welby had suggested the UK's asylum plan was ""ungodly"". This was followed by a joint letter signed by the UK Anglican bishops, which said the country could not outsource its ethical responsibilities. It was published in the UK's Times newspaper on Tuesday - the day the first flight to Rwanda was cancelled. The bishops said those to be removed to Rwanda have had no chance to appeal, or reunite with family in the UK But Archbishop Mbanda says accepting the asylum seekers in Rwanda will help alleviate a global crisis and the whole issue of migration and people without a home. He said that was not a burden of one person but a burden that countries should share. Having spent most of his life as a refugee before returning to Rwanda to live, the archbishop says he knows what it is like to be without a home. The asylum plan has also been privately criticised by Prince Charles,according to reports last week in the Times and Daily Mail. The heir to the British throne is to travel to Rwanda's capital, Kigali, next week for a big Commonwealth gathering. Ahead of the meeting, Amnesty International has urged the Commonwealth leaders to remind the UK about its international responsibility under the Refugee Convention. ""Commonwealth leaders must take a firm and clear stance to force the UK government to rescind its misguided, cruel and racist policy that shifts its responsibility towards refugees and asylum seekers to Rwanda,"" the rights group said.

Man who died in pig feed tanker 'was a superhero',"Gavin Rawson (pictured) died trying to rescue his 19-year-old colleague Nathan Walker The family of a man who drowned in a pig feed tanker while trying to save a teenager say he had no hope of escape. Gavin Rawson, 35, died trying to rescue Nathan Walker, 19, at the site of food waste company Greenfeeds Limited in Leicestershire, in December 2016. Mr Rawson's family demanded to know why the company had been allowed to continue operating, following a previous death at the site in 2005. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said firms needed to be responsible. Nathan Walker's son was born 15 days after his death At a hearing at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday,Greenfeeds co-owner Gillian Leivers was jailed for 13 years, with her husband also sentenced and the firm fined Â£2m. Leivers was convicted of two counts of gross negligence manslaughter and a health and safety offence. Ian Leivers was jailed for 20 months after being found guilty of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Manager Stewart Brown was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, for a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act. Mr Rawson's mother Linda and brother Gareth are demanding to know why the company was allowed to continue operating Speaking after the case, Mr Rawson's mother Linda said her son and Mr Walker had ""no hope whatsoever"" of escaping the tanker, due to the lack of ladders inside the tank and breathing equipment on the site. ""It was inevitable somebody was going to get hurt,"" she said. ""The place was disgusting with no health and safety. ""There was a little ladder outside the tanker but then you had to hold on to the rim and drop down into it."" She said Mr Walker had been asked to unblock the tanker's pump. The court heard when he tried to do so, he had been overcome by carbon dioxide fumes, leading him to collapse and drown in the pig feed. As a child, Mr Rawson loved to wear Superman pyjamas - his family say he became a real-life hero She said her son had been driving a forklift truck at the time but, when he had heard what happened, he had run to help, before he too had been overcome. ""If only there had been ladders inside the tank, that would have saved them,"" she said. ""It's hard to pull yourself out of a swimming pool. You imagine if you had all those gases taking your oxygen away."" The family say there were no ladders inside the tanker to help the men escape She said Mr Rawson had worked at the site on a casual basis for a year. She described her son as a hero and recalled how, growing up, he had worn Superman pyjamas. ""On that day, he was a superhero,"" she said. ""People said Gavin helped them in situations. He always had their back. ""He wouldn't have thought about the gases; he would just have wanted to get [Nathan] out."" Mr Rawson's death has broken his family, they say She demanded to know why the company was allowed to continue, following an incident in 2005 that saw Greenfeeds convicted for breaches after the death of an employee involved in tanker cleaning. She said: ""Why was there no other enforcement to stop them? ""If the food industry was stricter, they should go in, check them and close them down. Why weren't they closed down after 2005? Why were they allowed to get away with it?"" The firm is now in liquidation. Mr Rawson's brother Gareth said the deaths had devastated the two families. ""I don't think we will ever be the same again,"" he said. ""It's destroyed us as a family. I haven't seen my parents as broken as they are. ""We can't ever be the same. There's a massive void."" He added the Leivers had never shown remorse. ""I'm so glad they have sent them to prison. Hopefully they will have time to think about what they have done,"" he said. The deaths occurred three days before Christmas in 2016 Speaking after the case, HSE principal inspector Samantha Wells said: ""This incident could have been easily prevented by those in control by assessing the risks and putting appropriate control measures in place. ""It should serve as a reminder of the importance of an effective health and safety management system and the devastating consequences where these are not implemented and monitored. ""HSE encourages all directors and senior managers to understand their duties to manage health and safety across their business and to take their responsibilities seriously. ""Those who do not will be held to account for their failings as in this tragic case."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"LiveLiveRussia looking to advance in Donetsk region, UK says18 minutes ago","Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a ""front-line city,"" Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says the conflict could last for years In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Stoltenberg adds that the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the Donbas region Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the Sunday Times that ""we need to steel ourselves for a long war"" Ukrainian authorities say their air defence systems in the Kyiv Region shot down a Russian âair objectâ on Sunday morning Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre, but no casualties were reported Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© We are now wrapping up our day of live coverage of events in Ukraine. This is what's been happening today:  Germany says it will take emergency measures to guarantee the supply of energy in case Russia further cuts or stops its gas deliveries. This would include increased use of coal, the government says. ""To reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,"" the economy ministry said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency. ""It's bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption,"" Habeck said in the statement. Berlin is proposing to make â¬15bn ($15.8bn) available to fill storage facilities, a key requirement for next winter, according to German press reports. Other measures include cutting the use of gas in industry and power generation. Economy Minister RobertHabeck is quoted as saying,externalthat the situation is serious, and that gas consumption must continue to fall, so more gas must be stored, otherwise things will get ""really tight"" in winter. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe andhalf its supply to Germany. Gazprom blamed repair work for cutting the supply of gas through the Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 40% of its usual capacity, but German officials believe it was a political move to punish Germany for its support of Ukraine. Chris PartridgeBBC News A Belgian F16 based in Talinn, Estonia Ukraine
has made no secret of wanting to move towards an armed forces made of up Western
developed weapons. That
includes getting away from Soviet-era aircraft such as the Mig-29, Su-27 and
Su-25. While
Ukraineâs pilots have secured notable successes against their Russian
counterparts,Western planes would offer them greater capability.,external Ukraineâs
Mig-29 (Fulcrum) is getting old, parts are scarce and development hasnât kept
pace with that of the F-16 (Viper) for example. The Fulcrum lacks âfire-and-forgetâ active-radar homing missiles - something
Russian Su35s have in abundance for âBeyond Visual Rangeâ fights. In
comparison, F-16s are armed with AIM-120 missiles for BVR and have more capable
radar. They are equally capable in air-to-ground attack too. So
whatâs the problem? In short, time. To
train a US pilot, for example, from a Western F-15 to the latest F-35, takes
around four to six months. Different cockpit, different avionics, different
systems. While
the war continues, any training for Ukrainian pilots would have to be done
outside of the country. That takes highly-skilled assets out of the fight. Then
the question of supply. A Nato country could send the jets in, but then those
aircraft would need to be backfilled, as they also form a primary defence role. There
is little doubt Ukraine could move to a western supplied military - both on the
ground and the air. But that will take time, planning and resources. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Hollywood actor Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for UN refugee agency the UNHCR, has visited Poland and as part of the trip also visited Ukraine, the UNHCR has told the BBC. He arrived in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Saturday, and is visiting the region to highlight the needs of those who have fled the war
in Ukraine, the UNHCR says. While in Poland, he met refugee families
forced to flee the war in Ukraine. In an Instagram statement,external, he said: âMillions have been forced to flee
their homes, with over 90% being women and children. Iâm here to
learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify
calls for solidarity...  Everyone has the right to
seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever.â Previous celebrities who have visited Ukraine include Angelina Jolie, who is also a UN goodwill ambassador andvisited Lviv in April. Some residents of Lviv have posted images of Stiller, saying they had spotted him in the western city Joe InwoodReporting from Irpin The language in the UK military chief's letter was really remarkable; it was talking about the need to engage on the battlefield, it mentioned Russia by name. This letter was not intended for public consumption, but it was sent very widely, so they must have known this might have come out. In terms of how this will be received in Ukraine, they have been calling for Nato involvement in this war, but I don't think they're going to view this as a clear indication that the British Army will be getting involved. On how the Russians might view it, they will probably take it much the same way, but if this is seen as something of a threat - and it could be - then maybe Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov would echo the sentiment he expressed in an interview last week when he was talking about Britain's desire to bring Russia to its knees, and he said: ""Go on then, do itâ. The mood music we're getting from Western capitals is that this is a conflict that is going on for the long term and that they need - Boris Johnson said it himself today - to offer military support in an ongoing basis to the Ukrainians if they're going to be able to hold on and win this war in the east. So what's been happening so far
today? Russia's defence ministry says over the past 10 days its forces have destroyed 10 howitzers and up to 20 military vehicles supplied by Western countries in Mykolaiv, according to the Russian state-owned RIA news agency. The southern city wasvisited by Ukraine's President Zelensky yesterdaywhen he made a rare trip away from the capital Kyiv. The BBC is unable to independently confirm these reports. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent The
new head of the British Army has set out a rallying cry to his troops: to be ready to confront the renewed threat from Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. In
a letter addressed to âall ranks and our civil servantsâ, Gen Sir
Patrick Sanders highlights the threat posed by Russia following its invasion of
Ukraine. He notes that he is the first Chief of the General Staff âsince 1941
to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a
major continental powerâ. Gen Sanders says âRussiaâs invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose - to protect the UK and to be ready to fight and win wars on land - and reinforces
the requirement to deter Russian aggression with the threat of forceâ. He adds: âThe world has changed since 24 February and there is now a
burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies
and defeating Russia in battleâ. Gen Sanders sets out his goal to âaccelerate the mobilisation and modernisation of
the Army to reinforce Nato and deny Russia the chance to occupy any more of
Europe... We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once
againâ. A
defence source said that it was not surprising the new head of the army had
addressed his troops in such a way, highlighting the deteriorating security
situation in Europe. Armies, he said, âtrain to fightâ. The letter, which
has been seen by the BBC, was sent on 16 June via the Ministry of Defence's internal internet. In itslatest intelligence update,external, the UK's Ministry of Defence says Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Severodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line. They believe combat units on both fighting sides in the Donbas are likely to be experiencing variable morale, and that Ukrainian forces are likely to have seen desertions in recent weeks. They also note cases of Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continuing to happen. They also say the Russian authorities are likely to struggle to put legal pressure on military dissenters because of the fact that the Russian presence in Ukraine is described as a ""special military operation"" rather than a war. Russian morale is likely to be low because of perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics and problems with pay - plus the fact that Russian soldiers are likely to remain confused about the war's objectives, it adds. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukrainian authorities say the air defence systems in the Kyiv region shot down a Russian âair objectâ this morning. Explosions were heard in Vyshhorod District, north of the city centre.
They did not give details as to the nature of the target, although in recent weeks the west and centre of the country have generally been targeted by cruise missiles. The Kyiv Regional Military Administration wrote on social media that no smoke was detected, there was no fire and no casualties were currently reported. The situation north of Kharkiv,
Ukraine's second largest city, is quite difficult as Russian
forces have been trying to get closer to shell the city again, Reuters news agency quotes a Ukrainian official as saying. ""Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a front-line city,"" Vadym
Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, has told Ukraine's
national television.  On what is Father's Day in many countries around the world, President Zelensky has put out a message celebrating fatherhood. ""Being a father is a great responsibility and a great happiness. It is strength, wisdom, motivation to go forward and not to give up. ""And no matter how difficult it is - to protect and defend the most precious. The future of your  family, your children, and therefore the whole of Ukraine,"" he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Western leaders are emphasising a consistent message -this war will not be over quickly. Both the British prime minister and the head of Nato are warning of the danger of fatigue. After his visit to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday, Boris Johnson set out what he called a four-point plan for Ukraine in the Sunday Times, involving training, weapons and ensuring the countryâs economy doesnât collapse. Meanwhile, Nato's Jens Stoltenberg has told a German newspaper that Ukraine must be supported âeven if the costs are highâ, not only for military support, he adds, but also rising food and energy prices. Look to the east of Ukraine and we can see why both men are talking about a long war. The battle for the city of Severodonetsk is slowly grinding on, with heavy losses reported on both sides. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest updates: We're now pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine - thank you for joining us. Here's a summary of some of Saturday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan and Alexandra FouchÃ© Three Russian missiles have reportedly hit an oil depot in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk, says the regional governor. Writing on Telegram,external, Valentyn Renichenko says the missiles destroyed an oil depot near the town of Novomoskovsk, leading to a large fire that injured three people. A picture posted along with the Telegram message shows thick black smoke rising from the site. Mr Renichecnko says fire fighters have since put out the fire. The BBC hasn't verified the incident. Lithuanian authorities have announced that from today they will ban goods which are subject to EU sanctions from passing through their territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. News of the ban had initially came on Friday, through a video posted by the Russian region's governor Anton Alikhanov. He had urged Lithuania to reconsider the move, adding he was seeking clarification from the European Union about the apparent blockade. But the freight arm of Lithuania's state railways service confirmed the immediate start to the blockade on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. The EU sanctions list includes coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology - and Alikhanov said the ban would cover around 50% of the items that Kaliningrad imports. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the
right to free transit into and out of Kaliningrad region,"" he said. The western-most exclave is home
to Russia's Baltic Fleet and was where Russia has previously deployed nuclear-capable
missiles, but it has no land border with Russia. In February,Lithuania, along with the rest of the EU, closed its airspace to flights from Russia to Kaliningrad. As we reported earlier, President Zelensky visited the city of Mykolaiv near the front lines of the fighting with Russia forces. From there, the head of state proceeded to the Odesa region, his office announced. It posted pictures of Zelensky visiting the trauma department and talking to wounded soldiers undergoing treatment at a medical facility. Since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, Zelensky has not left Ukraine, but has defied the Russians with visits to areas close to intense fighting. He has also constantly received Western leaders in the capital, Kyiv - the latest UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday. Russia are throwing all of their reserves around the embattled city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region, according to regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said Russian soldiers are being sent from other battle zones with the intention of gaining full control of the city, according to remarks made on Ukrainian television cited by Reuters. ""Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have... because there are so many of them there already, they're at a critical mass,"" he said. He added that Russian forces already control most of the city. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson says Ukraine should be given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. Speaking to journalists after returning from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, he said they had won the contest and deserved to hold it. As winners of the contest in May, Ukraine should normally host the show, but organisers said on Friday they thought it would be too unsafe. Read more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Woman gives birth in UK after fleeing Ukraine warStaff arranged a call so Lesia Husar could introduce her husband, who is still in Ukraine, to their son.Nottingham","Lesia Husar said it was a ""big relief"" to be at the City Hospital in Nottingham A Ukrainian mother has thanked staff at a hospital after they arranged a WhatsApp call so her husband could meet their new child. Lesia Husar, 41, fled the city of Chernivtsi just weeks ago to escape the danger from Russian military action. She gave birth to Richard on Sunday with the father 1,200 miles away. Mrs Husar said it was a ""big relief"" to be at City Hospital in Nottingham and that her husband Taras, who is still in Ukraine, could share in the birth. Mrs Husar said she left Ukraine due to the constant fear of Russian air raids Staff at the hospital said Mrs Husar, who travelled with her 14-year-old daughter Renatta, did not want to leave her home when pregnant but she was constantly in fear of air raids. She was welcomed by a host family in Woodthorpe, Nottinghamshire, and found her room stacked with supplies, a pram, cot and clothes, ready for the baby. Richard weighed 4.5lb after a trouble-free birth. Mr Husar, 41, who was wounded while fighting Russian forces in 2014, is serving as a voluntary policeman. Mrs Husar said: ""I am so grateful to everyone - my host family and their neighbours and the staff at the hospital here in Nottingham. ""I was so stressed during my pregnancy, which doctors have said might explain why Richard was so small when he was born, but it has been a big relief to be cared for in Nottingham by such kind and supportive doctors and midwives. ""I love my country and want to go back to Ukraine soon, hopefully by the summer, but the war must end first before I can take my children back there."" They had decided to call their son Richard before the war started but Mr Husar said the baby having an English name now felt right.

Explosion rocks Sikh temple in Kabul,"Taliban members secured the scene An assault on a Sikh prayer site in Afghanistan has left one worshipper and a Taliban member dead as well as the unidentified attackers. The site in the capital Kabul was hit by a bomb early in the morning when up to 30 people were inside. It is the last remaining Sikh place of worship, or Gurdwara, in the capital. Community leaders recently estimated that just 140 Sikhs remained in predominantly Muslim Afghanistan, down from 100,000 in the 1970s. India, which is home to most of the world's Sikh population, said it was ""deeply concerned"" at news of the attack. A local official at the scene, Gornam Singh, told Reuters news agency that the Taliban were not allowing Sikhs to enter the site after the attack. The attackers reportedly initially used hand grenades to try and enter the compound of the Gurdwara TV footage showed grey plumes of smoke rising from the area. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters news agency the attackers had attempted to drive a car laden with explosives into the area but they detonated before they reached their target. The Taliban, which took control of Afghanistan last year, said a clearance operation was still under way although the attack had ended. The BBC's Secunder Kermani was interviewing relatives of victims outside a hospital when two Taliban militants stopped his crew, trying to delete their footage. Since the Taliban took power, the country has seen continuing attacks by rival Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State: In April,a bomb attack killed 31 peopleand injured 87 at a Shia Muslim mosque in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif In December,an assault on a military hospital in Kabul killed more than 20 peopleand injured 16 By Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan and Pakistan correspondent Afghanistan once had a thriving Sikh and Hindu population, but years of conflict and instability saw the community drastically shrink in size. By the time the Taliban took power last year, there were only fewer than 300 Sikhs left in Afghanistan. They have been repeatedly attacked by the local branch of the Islamic State group, with suicide bombers targeting the community in major attacks in 2018 and 2020. The Taliban had assured the community of their right to remain in Afghanistan and to practise their religion, but over the past year dozens more fled to India. Speaking outside the Emergency Hospital in Kabul, where he had brought an injured relative, one Sikh man told us those the majority of those who remained in the country also wanted to leave, but had been struggling to secure visas.

Explosion rocks Sikh temple in KabulIt is believed that up to 30 people may have been in the temple when the blast happened.Asia,"Taliban members secured the scene An assault on a Sikh prayer site in Afghanistan has left one worshipper and a Taliban member dead as well as the unidentified attackers. The site in the capital Kabul was hit by a bomb early in the morning when up to 30 people were inside. It is the last remaining Sikh place of worship, or Gurdwara, in the capital. Community leaders recently estimated that just 140 Sikhs remained in predominantly Muslim Afghanistan, down from 100,000 in the 1970s. India, which is home to most of the world's Sikh population, said it was ""deeply concerned"" at news of the attack. A local official at the scene, Gornam Singh, told Reuters news agency that the Taliban were not allowing Sikhs to enter the site after the attack. The attackers reportedly initially used hand grenades to try and enter the compound of the Gurdwara TV footage showed grey plumes of smoke rising from the area. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters news agency the attackers had attempted to drive a car laden with explosives into the area but they detonated before they reached their target. The Taliban, which took control of Afghanistan last year, said a clearance operation was still under way although the attack had ended. The BBC's Secunder Kermani was interviewing relatives of victims outside a hospital when two Taliban militants stopped his crew, trying to delete their footage. Since the Taliban took power, the country has seen continuing attacks by rival Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State: In April,a bomb attack killed 31 peopleand injured 87 at a Shia Muslim mosque in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif In December,an assault on a military hospital in Kabul killed more than 20 peopleand injured 16 By Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan and Pakistan correspondent Afghanistan once had a thriving Sikh and Hindu population, but years of conflict and instability saw the community drastically shrink in size. By the time the Taliban took power last year, there were only fewer than 300 Sikhs left in Afghanistan. They have been repeatedly attacked by the local branch of the Islamic State group, with suicide bombers targeting the community in major attacks in 2018 and 2020. The Taliban had assured the community of their right to remain in Afghanistan and to practise their religion, but over the past year dozens more fled to India. Speaking outside the Emergency Hospital in Kabul, where he had brought an injured relative, one Sikh man told us those the majority of those who remained in the country also wanted to leave, but had been struggling to secure visas.

Boris Johnson visits Ukraine to meet Zelensky,"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson offers military training for Ukrainian forces Boris Johnson has announced a training programme for Ukrainian forces he said could ""change the equation"" of the war. The prime minister met President Volodymyr Zelensky during a surprise trip to the nation's capital Kyiv. He pulled out of a conference of northern Tory MPs at the last minute and before the Wakefield by-election. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said PM's Kyiv trip had been ""important"", adding he was not ""affronted"" by him cancelling speaking at the conference. But Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership business group, told the BBC it was a ""missed opportunity"" to engage with his MPs and people from the region. ""As much as I value and think the importance of him being in Ukraine is significant, the issue is timing. The prime minister could have done that potentially another time."" Ukraine moves one step closer to EU membership Ukraine's president: I'm happy Johnson is still PM What weapons are being given to Ukraine by the UK? Mr Johnson was making his second visit to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in February. He had been due to speak at a conference in Doncaster ahead of the by-election in Wakefield, which was triggered after Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Mr Berry, the leader of the Northern Research Group group of Conservative MPs, said Mr Johnson's decision not to attend the conference was ""not a snub"". But he later told Channel 4 News: ""Clearly, people were disappointed. We had 30-plus colleagues here and 400 members."" Mr Wallace said such visits had to be organised in ""total secrecy"" and it was important for Mr Johnson to show support for an ally that was at war. ""Helping Ukraine win and trying to help at home are linked. Part of the inflation we see comes from gas and food prices which are partly driven upwards because of this conflict,"" Mr Wallace tweeted. Before turning up in Kyiv, Boris Johnson had been due in Doncaster to address some of his MPs from across the north of England. They were poised to press the prime minister for more investment and local powers, and possibly pose tricky questions on taxation levels and the cost of living. Jake Berry, the group's chair, insisted the decision to head to Ukraine instead of Yorkshire wasn't seen as a snub, saying the prime minister's plans can understandably change. But there was clear disappointment from some MPs at the last-minute cancellation - and a warning that Boris Johnson had to deliver for those in the midlands and north of England. Boris Johnson's response to the war in Ukraine is regarded within his party as something he has handled well. But with questions over his leadership and two difficult by-elections in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton taking place next week, his domestic woes aren't going anywhere. The prime minister said the programme would use British expertise to rebuild Ukrainian forces and scale up their resistance Speaking at a joint press conference earlier with President Zelensky, Mr Johnson outlined the UK's training programme for Ukrainian troops, saying it would harness ""that most powerful of forces, the Ukrainian determination to win"". ""Two months on from my last visit, the Ukrainian grit, determination and resilience is stronger than ever, and I know that unbreakable resolve will long outlive the vain ambitions of President Putin,"" he said. Downing Street said the UK-led training scheme would have the potential to train up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers every 120 days and would allow them to ""accelerate their deployment, rebuild their forces and scale-up their resistance"". Soldiers would learn ""battle-winning skills for the front line, as well as basic medical training, cyber-security and counter explosive tactics"". The government added international partners would also be invited to host the programme. If the offer is accepted by Mr Zelensky there would be discussions about the size of the training operation, which is expected to take place outside of Ukraine. The previous Operation Orbital saw the UK train more than 22,000 Ukrainian personnel from 2015 up until the Russian invasion of Ukraine. No 10 said the leaders also discussed how the UK could ""play a pivotal role in ending the blockade of grain"". Mr Zelensky's Telegram account posted a message saying: ""Many days of this war have proved that Great Britain's support for Ukraine is firm and resolute. ""Glad to see our country's great friend Boris Johnson in Kyiv again."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
