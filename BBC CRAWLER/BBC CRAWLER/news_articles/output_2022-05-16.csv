Speaking to the BBC's political editor, Chris Mason, the prime minister insisted the Northern Ireland Protocol ""had a lot to be said for it"", but that it needed to be fixed as it is currently ""unbalanced"" in the way it's interpreted. Mr Johnson was at Hillsborough Castle to encourage Northern Ireland's parties to re-form institutions after the assembly election. So far, the Democratic Unionist Party has withheld its support until the government takes ""decisive action"" on post-Brexit trade arrangements. Johnson accepts NI impasse down to Brexit deal.

Turkey could block Finland and Sweden Nato bids,"""Sweden will strengthen Nato,"" Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson says Turkey's president has restated his opposition to Finland and Sweden joining Nato - just hours after they said they would seek membership. Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the two Nordic nations should not bother sending delegations to convince Turkey, a key Nato member, of their bids. He is angered by what he sees as their willingness to host Kurdish militants. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. On Monday, Sweden said Europe was living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move by Finland and Sweden to join the 30-member military alliance did not threaten Moscow directly - but stressed that any expansion of military infrastructure would trigger a response from the Kremlin. How do you join Nato? Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? Russia's invasion not going to plan, Nato says At a news conference on Monday, Mr Erdogan said Turkey opposed the Finnish and the Swedish bids to join Nato, describing Sweden as a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. ""Neither of these countries have a clear, open attitude towards terrorist organisation. How can we trust them?"" the Turkish president said. Turkey accuses the two Nordic nations of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. All member states must agree that a new country can join Nato, therefore Sweden and Finland require Turkey's support in their bid to join the military alliance. Mr Erdogan said Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother going to Ankara, Turkey's capital, to convince it to approve their Nato bid. His government has also pledged to block applications from countries that have imposed sanctions on it. In 2019, both Nordic nations slapped an arms embargo on Ankara afterits incursion into Syria. Speaking in parliament in Helsinki on Monday, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said he was surprised by Turkey's stance, but added that his government was not interested in ""bargaining"" with Mr Erdogan. Finland formally announced its bid to join Nato last week. It was joined by neighbour Sweden on Saturday in a move that will end the Scandinavian country's centuries-long military non-alignment. ""Nato will strengthen Sweden, Sweden will strengthen Nato,"" Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a briefing on Monday. She said Europe was now living in a dangerous new reality, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We are leaving one era behind us and entering a new one,"" Ms Andersson told lawmakers during a debate in Stockholm, also on Monday. She said a formal application could be handed in within several days and would be synchronised with Finland. Nato has signalled its willingness to admit the two new members. On Tuesday, Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde signed the formal application to join Nato However, Ms Andersson stressed that Sweden did not want permanent Nato bases or nuclear weapons on its territory. Norway, Denmark and Iceland - all Nato members - immediately said they were ready to support Sweden and Finland by all means necessary if they came under attack. The UK, also a Nato member, has already given security guarantees to Sweden and Finlandto cover the transition period. Monday's announcement by Sweden came asNato began one of its biggest exercises in the Baltic region, involving some 15,000 troops.Named ""Hedgehog"", the drills in Estonia involve 10 countries, including Finland and Sweden. For Finland and Sweden to join Nato, all 30 existing members must say yes. But for now, one is saying no. President Erdogan says he won't agree to admit countries which apply sanctions on Turkey. Sweden suspended arms sales to Turkey three years ago, following Ankara's military intervention in Syria. And according to the official Turkish news agency, both Finland and Sweden have rejected dozens of requests to extradite Kurdish militants who Turkey describes as terrorists. Both countries are sending delegations to Ankara to try and solve the problem, but President Erdogan says they shouldn't bother. He seems determined to extract a price for his precious vote. On Sunday, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he was confident that Finland and Sweden would both join, despite Turkish objections. The issue is likely to dominate discussions between Mr Blinken and his Turkish opposite number in Washington on Wednesday. Having encouraged the two Nordic countries to apply, Washington won't want to let them down at the 11th hour. Do you live in Finland or Sweden?  What are your thoughts about possible Nato expansion?

McDonald's to leave Russia for good after 30 years,"This video can not be played Watch: Moscow residents react to McDonald's leaving Russia after 30 years McDonald's has said it will permanently leave Russia after more than 30 years and has started to sell its restaurants. The move comes after it temporarily closed its 850 outlets in March. The fast food giant said it made the decision because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war. The opening of McDonald's first restaurant in Moscow in 1990 came to symbolise a thaw in Cold War tensions. A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out. ""This is a complicated issue that's without precedent and with profound consequences,"" said McDonald's chief executive Chris Kempczinski in a message to staff and suppliers. ""Some might argue that providing access to food and continuing to employ tens of thousands of ordinary citizens, is surely the right thing to do,"" he added. ""But it is impossible to ignore the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. And it is impossible to imagine the Golden Arches representing the same hope and promise that led us to enter the Russian market 32 years ago."" McDonaldâs, Coca-Cola, Starbucks halt Russia sales McDonald's and Coca-Cola boycott calls grow McDonald's said it would sell all its sites to a local buyer and would begin the process of ""de-arching"" the restaurants which involves removing its name, branding and menu. It will retain its trademarks in Russia. The chain said its priorities included seeking to ensure its 62,000 employees in Russia continued to be paid until any sale was completed and that they had ""future employment with any potential buyer"". McDonald's said it would write off a charge of up to $1.4bn (Â£1.1bn) to cover the exit from its investment. It really is the end of an era. I was in the queue when the first Russian McDonald's opened on Moscow's Pushkin Square in January 1990 - way back in the USSR. There were so many people outside the restaurant, it took three hours to get inside. But what a sense of excitement. Those American burgers, fries and pies were a symbol of Moscow embracing the West. Hot food to help end a Cold War. These are very different times. Russia and the West have lost their appetite for one another. Russia's attack on Ukraine has sparked international condemnation and sanctions, turning Moscow into a pariah. Meanwhile, the Kremlin - as it always does - points the finger back, accusing the West of plotting Russia's downfall. Back in March lots of international companies announced they were pausing operations in Russia, hoping the situation would resolve itself and they could then reopen. But McDonald's decision to sell up and pull out shows the fast food giant recognises things will not return to normal and that what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine has changed things long term. Big Macs are only the beginning. I predict we're going to see a lot more global brands leaving Russia. The opening of McDonald's in Moscow in 1990 saw queues of Russians keen to try the American fast food chain The move comes afterRenault announced it was selling its business in the country. The French firm said its 68% stake in carmaker Avtovaz would be sold to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow. Moscow said Renault's Russian assets had now become state property - marking the first nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine. Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's global sales. The chain's 108 restaurants in Ukraine remain closed due to the conflict but the company is continuing to pay full salaries to all its employees there. McDonald's initially faced criticism for being slow to halt its business in Russia, withsome calling for a boycott of the companybefore it suspended operations in March. Hundreds of international brands, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple, have left Russia or suspended sales there since the country invaded Ukraine in February. Other firms, including Burger King and Marks and Spencer, say they are unable to close storesdue to complex franchise deals.

"Buffalo gunman planned second attack, police say","This video can not be played Watch: US President Joe Biden says ""we must work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America"" A gunman who killed 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, planned further attacks after the mass shooting on Saturday, police have said. The suspect, 18, drove more than 320km (200 miles) to carry out what is believed to be a racially-motivated crime. He planned to keep driving and ""shoot more black people,"" Buffalo's police chief told US media. A pensioner, a former policeman and a grandmother were among the victims. Mayor Byron Brown said the suspect arrived in Buffalo intending to take ""as many black lives as possible"". A 180-page document seemingly authored by the alleged attacker Payton Gendron has emerged, in which he describes himself as a fascist and a white supremacist. Questions are being asked about how he was able to carry out the shooting when concerns had already been raised. ""I want to know what people knew and when they knew it,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul told ABC News. FBI officials have confirmed that the gunman spent a day and a half in hospital undergoing a mental health evaluation last year after he wrote that he wanted to commit a murder/suicide in a high school project. No criminal charges resulted from the incident, and Buffalo police chief Joseph Gramaglia told reporters the gunman had only made ""generalised threats"". He does not appear to have remained under watch by authorities. Mr Gramaglia told US media that there was evidence to suggest he wanted to targeted a second store on Saturday if he had not been stopped. On Monday, police said he had visited Buffalo in March and then again one day before the deadly mass shooting Residents held a candlelight vigil on Sunday near the site of the shooting Meanwhile, the gun store owner who sold the semi-automatic used in the attack told several US outlets that no alert came up when he ran the suspect's name through a government background check system. New York's Attorney General Letitia James said her office would focus on extremist material online. ""This event was committed by a sick, demented individual who was fuelled [by a] daily diet of hate,"" she said. The shooting has stunned the local community. One of those attending a vigil on Sunday told Reuters: ""It just hurts, why somebody would do that."" Ten died and  three others were injured. Of the 13 people shot, 11 were black. Among those reported killed were a man buying cupcakes for his son's birthday and a woman who had gone shopping after visiting her husband at a nursing home. By Mike Wendling, BBC Trending Christchurch, El Paso, Pittsburgh and now Buffalo - all places where racially-motivated assailants, radicalised online, have taken their ideology to deadly extremes. The gunman in Buffalo, like ones before, live-streamed his violent rampage and left a so-called ""manifesto"" online. It details his extremist beliefs and is packed with cherry-picked statistics, conspiracy theories and internet memes. The file contains reams of racist and anti-Semitic sludge along with straightforward admissions that the author is a fascist and a white supremacist. If the author can be believed - as the document also clearly contains disinformation and attempts to trick reporters into reporting false stories - he was radicalised early on during the Covid pandemic, on extremist websites and message boards. Like after the 2019 mosque shootings in Christchurch, big social media companies will struggle to remove footage of the attack. And surely the American debate over gun control will be reignited, however briefly. But the underlying problem seems as intractable as ever: a worldwide network of young violent extremists, some of whom are motivated to launch deadly attacks against innocent people. The attacker, dressed in military gear, drove into the car park at Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo - an area in which police said he had done ""reconnaissance"" the day before - at about 14:30 EST (19:30 BST) and began livestreaming the rampage. A security guard fired several shots back but the gunman's bulletproof vest stopped one that hit him, police said. He then killed the guard and stalked through the store firing at other people. Witnesses described horrific scenes. ""It's like a nightmare... you see this on TV, you hear about it on TV... but I never thought I would be one of them,"" said one. Among the victims was Katherine Massey, 72, who hadwritten in favour of federal gun legislation,externalfor her local paper less than a year ago. The gunman was arrested after the attack and has pleaded not guilty to murder charges. US President Joe Biden said facts were still being established but strongly condemned racist extremism. ""We must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America,"" he said. The White House said Mr Biden and the First Lady would travel to Buffalo on Tuesday to meet with the community. Saturday's attack is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides - and mass shooting events occur frequently. Less than a day after the attack in New York state, one person was killed and five were injured in a shooting at a church in Orange County, in southern California. The gunman was a Chinese immigrant apparently motivated by hatred for Taiwanese people, authorities said on Monday. Churchgoers tackled him and tied him up by the ankles using an extension cord.

COP26 chief: Leaders must honour climate promises,"This video can not be played COP26 climate summit president Alok Sharma says world leaders must deliver on the promises they made Global leaders have not done enough to honour commitments made at the COP26 climate summit, its president has said. Alok Sharma said more must be done to hit the targets agreed in Glasgow, warning that failure would be ""an act of monstrous self-harm"". Six months on from the event, he said countries needed to ""up the pace"" in the push towards carbon-neutral energy. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also issued a warning over climate change, during a trip to the US. She said that a failure to hit targets agreed at COP26 would be ""catastrophic"" for the planet. Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? What was agreed at COP26? UN scientists: It's 'now or never' to fix climate change Mr Sharma, a minister in the UK government's cabinet office, was in Glasgow to mark six months from last year's UN conference. He said it was understandable that climate change was no longer on the front pages, amid the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis. But he said these issues ""should increase, not diminish, our determination to deliver on what the world agreed in Glasgow"". Glasgow was the host of the COP26 summit The summit was aimed at hammering out agreements that would hold average global temperature rises under 1.5C. However, scientists warn that there is a 6-10% chance of meeting this threshold, and that even if pledges are fully delivered the temperature rise will be closer to 2C. Mr Sharma said ""the window of time we have left to act is closing fast"", with climate change ""already wreaking havoc"". He said: ""Progress is of course welcome, but frankly we need to up the pace. Leaders have not done enough to deliver on their Glasgow commitments, and that must change. ""We need every nation to pick up the pace. We need every leader to show that their words were not hollow, that their commitments were made with integrity, and that they recognise that though the immediate challenges we face are grave, we will only inflame them if we falter. ""It is leaders who made promises, it is leaders who must honour them."" It isn't surprising Alok Sharma is worried about the world honouring the climate promises made in Glasgow in November. Food, energy and finance costs are soaring around the world. Sri Lanka and Peru have already seen protests prompted by rising fuel, fertilizer and food costs. A United Nations insider told me last week it has a watchlist of 35 other countries it fears are also on the verge of widespread unrest, even uprisings. The worry is climate promises will be put on the backburner while leaders deal with more immediate crises. Many countries which had made net zero pledges are now considering licensing new oil and gas projects - including the UK. At the same time, oil and gas companies are enjoying bumper profits. It has put paid - at least in the short run - to the idea that tumbling renewable energy prices would see the returns on fossil fuel investments collapse. Mr Sharma's message today was that these headwinds must not derail the Glasgow Pact. Leaders have to honour their commitments and show, he said, that the international system is still taking the world towards ""a cleaner, safer and more prosperous future."" Mr Sharma told BBC Scotland that in the final moments of the Glasgow talks ""I genuinely thought there was a point where we weren't going to get a deal"". He said ""we have to be hopeful"" that global temperature rises can be held down, while warning that ""we need to act now"". Ms Sturgeon also highlighted her fears about the climate emergency when she addressed the Brookings Institute in Washington DC. She said: ""Six months on from COP26, the world looks very different, but many of the challenges we faced then remain. ""As things stand, the world is on course to exceed both 1.5C of global warming and the 2C threshold - and scientific consensus is overwhelming that this will be catastrophic. ""We need to move at pace to develop clean energy sources and act in a way which shows solidarity with communities in our countries who might otherwise get left behind, and with the global south."" Nicola Sturgeon is focusing on climate change as part of her trip to the US Last weekUS climate envoy John Kerrysaid the war in Ukraine had not wrecked the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed in November. Both Mr Sharma and Ms Sturgeon referenced the Russian invasion, with the Scottish first minister saying it is ""forcing countries in Europe to rethink long-held assumptions about energy policy and energy security"". And Mr Sharma highligted the ""danger of energy systems powered by foreign fossil fuel"", calling instead for a focus on ""low cost home grown renewables the price of which cannot be manipulated from afar"". According to a UN report,the world is on track to warm by 3.2C this centuryif countries only follow through on commitments made before the Glasgow summit. This would lead to ""unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages"". To avoid that fate, the world must keep the rise in temperatures at or under 1.5C this century, researchers have said, and reach peak CO2 emissions by 2025.

"Help must come, says ex-PM on cost of living crisis","""Help must come"" for those struggling to pay their bills amid rising prices, ex-Prime Minister John Major has said. Addressing a conference, Sir John said providing support would help bring ""trust and respect back to politics"". He also warned that government couldn't raise spending while reducing tax and that ""hard choices"" had to be made. Minister Rachel MacLean said the government was putting help in place to ease short-term pressures, including through the Household Support Fund. She also said that, over the long-term, government wanted ""to grow the economy and make sure that people are able to protect themselves better, whether that is by taking on more hours or moving to a better-paid job"". She acknowledged these options might not work for everyone such as those ""already working three jobs"". There's been criticism of her words, and Labour's shadow cabinet minister Ian Murray said her advice was ""ludicrous"" and ""out of touch"". No 10 later defended the minister and accused critics of ""seeking to twist the words unhelpfully"". How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Labour to call vote on energy firm windfall tax How high could my energy bills go? Meanwhile some Conservative MPs have urged the government to adopt opposition proposals to raise money to help those struggling by implementing a windfall tax on energy companies. Treasury Committee chair Mel Stride said he would normally oppose it but that current ""extraordinary circumstances"" meant there was a case for looking at ""a one-off windfall tax"". He said the companies had made ""supra-normal profits"" and some of that money should be ""channelled to those who are really struggling"". His Conservative colleague Simon Hoare later tweeted his agreement. Labour has said it will call for a vote to introduce the tax on Tuesday. Ministers have previously rejected introducing a one-off tax on the profits of energy companies, arguing it would deter investment. However, recently the government has been hinting that it could change its mind withTreasury officials sayingthe idea was not off the table. A number of Tory MPs have privately expressed concerned that the government will make a U-turn - with one senior Tory saying they are ""really irritated"" about being made to vote against it on Tuesday. Making a speech in Newcastle, Sir John - who led the Conservatives from 1990 to 1997 - joined in the debate saying that rising prices meant people would be ""utterly unable to meet the bills"". Address the National Cathedrals Conference, he said: ""Help must come - and I hope it will come soon,"" adding that a lack of support would damage people's trust in government. ""Everyone needs to believe that The State cares about them - and not just the interests of the powerful, the motivators, and the elite. ""If the week lasts longer than the money, do the penniless believe The State cares about them?"" Sir John also warned that the government's levelling up agenda - aimed at reducing regional inequalities - would demand ministers making ""hard choices"". He said the policy needed money and had to be paid for either by higher taxes, borrowing or cuts to other budgets. ""It is an unwelcome truth that lower taxes for everyone - and higher spending - do not go together."" The former prime minister concluded his speech by praising the younger generation who he said were ""a force for good"" despite ""their habit of cutting holes in the knees of new jeans for the sake of fashion"".

Probe after man wrongly diagnosed with Alzheimer's,"Alex Preston said the diagnosis completely destroyed his life A hospital trust is investigating after a patient was incorrectly diagnosed and treated for Alzheimer's disease for seven years. Alex Preston, from Anstey, Leicestershire, was 54 at the time and said the diagnosis completely destroyed his life and made him feel suicidal. He was then re-examined in the pandemic and told that diagnosis was a mistake. Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (LPT) said it was undertaking an independent review of the case. Mr Preston said he was having problems concentrating at work in 2014. ""The doctor thought I had low mood and anxiety,"" he said. Mr Preston, now 62, was sent to the Bradgate Mental Health Unit where he underwent a series of tests and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. ""That's when my life was completely destroyed. ""As soon as we were told that diagnosis, everything me and Susan had planned just went,"" he said. Mr Preston's wife Susan died of cancer in 2019 For seven years he said he thought he was living with the disease and took part in fundraising for Alzheimer's charities. In 2019 his wife Susan died from cancer and at the time Mr Preston said doctors would not talk to him about it because of his condition. But when the pandemic hit, he said he heard less from the hospital and was able to get on with life without having anyone around to reinforce this false diagnosis. ""Friends would ring me and say 'you seems like you're doing well' and I thought it was just them being nice,"" he said. He had a visit from a nurse who suggested he went to see a consultant again. Friends would tell Mr Preston how well he was doing before he was re-examined More tests were carried out and he was finally told the original diagnosis was wrong. Mr Preston said: ""It was good but it was terrible at the same time because my wife wasn't there to see it. ""Since I've come off the medication I've become a completely different person - I now want answers."" LPT said it was investigating Mr Preston's complaint and carrying out a review. In a statement it said: ""The trust has been liaising closely with Mr Preston since the complaint was first raised. ""We are currently undertaking an independent review of the case, with an independent clinical witness from outside of our trust; it would be inappropriate to comment further until this review has been concluded and shared with Mr Preston.""

Diesel prices reach record of over Â£1.80 a litre,"UK diesel prices rose to a record of just over Â£1.80 a litre as efforts to stop importing fuel from Russia pushed up costs for retailers, the RAC said. After the previous record of Â£1.79 was set in March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks. The RAC said petrol prices went up by nearly 3p a litre since the start of May and were Â£1.66 a litre on average. It said if EU members agreed to ban Russian oil, prices could rise further. The EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian energy and has plans to phase out Russian crude oil over six months. However, countries are split on how soon they wind down dependence - Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period. How much will the fuel duty cut on petrol save you? Drivers cut back on journeys as fuel costs bite The UK is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, however, almost a fifth of all UK diesel consumption was provided by Russian imports in 2020. The UK is also affected when global prices rise, despite its plans to stop Russian oil imports by the end of the year. ""Efforts to move away from importing Russian diesel have led to a tightening of supply and pushed up the price retailers pay for diesel,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""Unfortunately, drivers with diesel vehicles need to brace themselves for yet more pain at the pumps."" In recent weeks, fuel sales have fallen as drivers have cut back on the number of journeys they make due to higher pump prices Petrol station operator Ascona Group, which owns 60 UK petrol stations, said the amount of fuel it sold had dropped by 200,000 litres a week compared to pre-pandemic levels. Managing director Darren Briggs said customers were making Â£20 to Â£30 fuel purchases""last a little bit longer"". The Office for National Statistics revealed last week that the UK's economy shrank by 0.1% in March and said higher prices, including those at the petrol pumps, were ""really beginning to bite"". The downturn came ahead of the impact of higher energy bills in April, which has sparked fears from analysts that the UK economy is at risk of a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - later this year. Cutting diesel imports is tough Analysis by Ben King, BBC business reporter Cutting energy imports from Russia is a vital part of the West's plan to put the squeeze on the Putin regime and its war machine. But when it comes to diesel, it's particularly tough - not least for the UK. Diesel is produced by refining crude oil, and before the war, much of the UK's diesel supply was made in Russia and shipped to Britain in tankers. Diesel supplies across the world were low before the crisis began, and the uncertainty surrounding the latest round of EU sanctions is helping to push those prices higher. Most European countries are already reducing their imports of Russian oil and diesel - and imports from the Middle East and elsewhere are taking up some of the slack. But securing those extra supplies means paying higher prices. The latest figures from the data firm Vortexa showed that just over half Europe's diesel imports were still coming from Russia. And the Asian head of the major oil trading firm Vitol, Mike Muller, warned earlier this month that EU rules which came into force on Sunday could make trading with Russia even harder, for instance by making it impossible to pay Russian suppliers. That's not likely to mean pumps running dry in the UK, says analyst Neil Crosby, who follows the diesel market for OilX. ""The UK itself may manage more or less to get by, but retail prices are not liable to cool any time soon,"" he said. In a bid to curb rising fuel prices, Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut the fuel duty by5p a litre after previous record prices were seen in March. The RAC said then the cut was ""a drop in the ocean"" and now claimed drivers would be better off if had Mr Sunak reduced VAT on fuel. ""Had Mr Sunak reduced VAT to 15% as we called on him to do instead of cutting duty by 5p, drivers of diesel vehicles would be around 2p a litre better off, or Â£1 for every full tank,"" Mr Williams said. ""As it is, drivers are still paying 27p VAT on petrol and 29p on diesel, which is just the same as before the Spring Statement."" The Treasury said it had introduced the ""biggest ever cut to all fuel duty rates - worth Â£5bn when taken together with the fuel duty freeze"". ""It will save the average UK car driver around Â£100, van driver around Â£200 and haulier over Â£1,500, based on average fuel consumption,"" a statement said. The government said businesses in general pay VAT on their sales but recover the tax on their purchases, meaning many can reclaim any VAT incurred when buying fuel. The price of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - has soared in recent months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of potential global supply issues. Ahead of the invasion, fuel prices had already been rising after demand increased following the reopening of economies from coronavirus lockdowns. Why are petrol prices going back up?

Legislative solution on NI protocol needed - PM,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks about ""unnecessary barriers"" on goods coming into Northern Ireland. Stormont's political parties have criticised the prime minister after a series of ""robust"" meetings on Monday. Boris Johnson was at Hillsborough Castle to encourage the parties to re-form Northern Ireland's institutions after the assembly election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has withheld its support until the government takes ""decisive action"" on post-Brexit trade arrangements. Mr Johnson said a ""legislative solution"" was needed. Unionist politicians have protested against theNorthern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. This ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has introduced some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The assembly election on 5 May cemented a majority for those who accept the protocol, A majority of politicians elected in the NI Assembly election on 5 May - including those of the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in - accept the protocol,but it is opposed by unionist politicians. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to make a statement on the government's plans to act on the protocol on Tuesday, with the government poised to introduce legislation that could override parts of the Brexit deal. This video can not be played The UK government is to introduce legislation that will allow it to override parts of the Brexit deal ""We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west,"" Mr Johnson said about the protocol after meeting Stormont's five main parties. ""But to get that done, to have the insurance we need, we need to proceed with a legislative solution at the same time. ""We don't want to scrap it (the protocol), but we think it can be fixed."" Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, whose party delegation was the first to meet the prime minister, accused Mr Johnson of unacceptable and obstructionist tactics in relation to the protocol. She said the government was placating the DUP and that Mr Johnson gave ""no straight answers"" during a ""very tough meeting"" at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. ""The British government is in a game of brinkmanship with the European institutions, indulging a section of political unionism which believes it can frustrate and hold society to ransom,"" she said. Following his party's meeting, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not have details of the government's proposals for dealing with the protocol, but that he would judge Mr Johnson's plan by actions, not words. On the return of Northern Ireland's political institutions, he said: ""We cannot have power-sharing unless there is a consensus. That consensus doesn't exist."" When asked if he had appealed to the DUP to return to Stormont, the prime minister replied: ""You bet, I said to the DUP in particular we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a Speaker in the assembly."" A number of protesters gathered in Hillsborough, County Down, on Monday ahead of Boris Johnson's visit Mr Johnson was booed and jeered by about 200 people as his cavalcade arrived at Hillsborough. Among them were campaigners forIrish language legislation, anti-Brexit activists and victims' campaigners objecting to the government's proposed legislation fordealing with legacy cases from the Troubles. The DUP, which supported Brexit, has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution was built on and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. Despite signing up to the deal himself, Mr Johnson agreed changes were needed. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph,external, the prime minister said the protocol was out of date and did not reflect the reality of a post-Covid era with a European war and a cost of living crisis. He added that he was open to dialogue but warned the UK would have to act if the EU did not change its position. On Monday, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said there were solutions to ""many of the issues that are being raised particularly from the unionists and the business communities"" about the protocol. ""This is not a time for unilateral action, announcing legislation which would essentially breach international law, undermine an international treaty and create a lot of unnecessary tensions between Brussels and London,"" he added. US Congressman Bill Keating, chair of the House sub-committee on Europe, said the government's action on the protocol had been ""a grave concern"" in the US and it ""undercuts the Good Friday Agreement"". ""You don't get round international agreements you were party toâ¦ by undercutting it with domestic unilateral legislation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight. This video can not be played NI protocol: What do young people think? The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal:It means goods can pass freely between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the European Union) Basically, lorries don't have to stopand prove their goods follow EU rules when they cross the border Instead, checks are donewhen goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) The border is a sensitive issue because ofNorthern Ireland's violent pastand politicians do not want new checkpoints there Butthe protocol is unpopular with unionist politicians(who support Northern Ireland being part of the UK). They say it means Northern Ireland is treated differently from England, Scotland and Wales The UK government has hinted that itcould drop parts of the protocol, but the EU says it could retaliate Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Northern Ireland Protocol What do voters think of NI Protocol? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed A senior UK government source said that barring any last minute changes, the government would introduce the legislation to strip away parts of the protocol to enable easier trade. Such legislation would have to go through parliament however, which could take months. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said she received no straight answers from the prime minister on the NI Protocol Some fear that should the UK act unilaterally, it could spark retaliation from European countries and ultimately a trade war - the last thing many businesses and households want at the time of a cost of living crisis. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill also met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin on Monday. Herparty won the most seats in May's historic electionbut cannot take up that power-sharing role without the DUP agreeing to enter government in Northern Ireland. After meeting Boris Johnson, Ms McDonald said he had indicated there were plans ""to fix rather than scrap the protocol"". The DUP was among the parties to meet Boris Johnson in Hillsborough on Monday Mr Donaldson said he had waited ""a long time for this moment"" for government proposals and said the EU had harmed the Good Friday Agreement by not respecting Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said his meeting with Mr Johnson had been a frustrating engagement with ""robust exchanges"". ""We've seen a lot of soft words from the prime minister, an attempt at some sort of consensual way forward, but those words belie the fact that tomorrow Liz Truss is set to make a statement to parliament setting out the basis of the UK taking unilateral action on the protocol,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the prime minister had ""made it clear"" to him that he intended to bring forward legislation to deal with protocol concerns. ""The protocol really does need to be dealt with so we can move forward,"" he said. Mr Beattie said the assembly and executive should be restored if the government signalled in the next week that it would bring forward measures. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said his meeting with Mr Johnson had also been ""robust"". ""If the British government tomorrow signal their intent to break international law by legislating to rip up the protocol at Westminster he will not have the support of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Eastwood said. The UK government and unionist parties have made the case that the protocol is damaging the Northern Ireland economy but the evidence for that is inconclusive. A free market think-tank has repeated the claim the protocol is costing Â£850m a year. The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) is based on a previous estimate by the Ulster University economist Esmond Birnie. Read more: How the protocol affects NI's economy That research has previously been used by the DUP to bolster its case against the protocol but the research used a limited dataset and then added the cost of what the UK government is spending on mitigation measures. Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchsuggested Northern Ireland's economy has slightly outperformed the UK average, partially due to the protocol.

"UK cuts funding to UN in change of aid strategyA new strategy cutting funding to the UN is more focused on trade than poverty relief, charities say.UK","The government is to give billions of pounds less in foreign aid to international organisations such as the United Nations. Instead, the Foreign Office will spend the aid money on individual projects and countries that are UK priorities. The change is part of a new strategy designed to ensure aid spending does more to promote foreign policy. Aid charities criticised the strategy for focusing more on boosting UK trade than ending extreme poverty. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""In an increasingly geopolitical world, we must use development as a key part of our foreign policy."" She said the new strategy will ensure the UK's international development work has benefits across the globe and in the UK, improving economic security worldwide and increasing jobs and growth at home. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Aid cuts to stay for at least three years - Sunak Charities accuse chancellor of stealth raid on aid The UK currently spends about Â£11.5bn each year on aid - after cutting the budget by Â£3bn last year. Almost 40% of the aid budget is currently given to the UN, the World Bank, European Union and other global bodies to spend on their own aid budgets. The advantage is that these international organisations benefit from economies of scale by pooling the resources of many countries. But under the new strategy, the Foreign Office will cut the percentage of UK aid spent on multilateral organisations down to just 25% by 2025. The Foreign Office said the approach will mean it can ""focus funding on UK priorities and control exactly how taxpayers' money is used to support these"". The UK will also offer developing countries what the Foreign Office called more ""reliable investment"" so they can be less dependent on the ""unsustainable debt"" of ""malign actors"". The document does not mention China, but this is a reference to the increasing reliance of some developing countries on loans handed out by Beijing. The Foreign Office said the aim was to bring ""more countries into the orbit of free-market economies"". It added: ""This will help low and middle-income countries become our trade and investment partners of the future."" Ms Truss said: ""Malign actors treat economics and development as a means of control, using patronage, investment and debt as a form of economic coercion and political power. ""We won't mirror their malign tactics, but we will match them in our resolve to provide an alternative."" Funding for girls' education in places such as Kenya is being restored after a year of cuts However, the Foreign Office was unable to say how the UK could compete with China's much bigger aid budgets. The strategy also says a UK priority will be supporting women and girls with greater education, help with reproductive health and rights, and more protection from violence. ""We intend to restore funding for this vital work,"" the strategy says, a reference to the impact of last year's general aid cuts. Humanitarian aid will also be made a priority, with the Foreign Office promising to spend Â£3bn over the next three years. The Foreign Office said it also aimed to cut bureaucracy in the way it delivered development aid, in particular giving greater autonomy to UK ambassadors to make decisions on the ground. Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the House of Commons International Development Committee, said the new strategy document was ""a double whammy against the global poor"". She said: ""Supporting the poorest in the world should not be conditional on a trade deal or agreeing to investment partnerships. ""The UK has rightly been hugely critical of China for such an approach, so I fail to see why we are following down the same road. It is depressing and disappointing that the UK would devise a strategy like this."" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran said the strategy barely mentions the ""callous decision to slash aid spending"" which she said was ""harming the most vulnerable around the world"". ""The government's misguided new focus on 'aid for trade' is yet another blow for the world's poorest,"" she said. Bond, the umbrella group for aid charities, criticised the Foreign Office strategy for failing to prioritise health, climate change and open societies. Stephanie Draper, CEO at Bond, said: ""Though this strategy contains some positive elements, it seems largely driven by short-term political and economic interests rather than the attempt to tackle the root causes of global crises such as inequality, conflict and climate change, which impact us all. ""It's worrying that 'aid for trade' is at the heart of this strategy as this not only diverts money away from life-saving programmes but could see investors benefit at the expense of the marginalised communities it's supposed to serve."" Christine Allen, director at international development charity Cafod, accused the government of ""raiding"" the foreign aid budget to bolster the UK's trade and investment: ""Britain's role on the global stage does not mean abdicating from our responsibilities to those who are suffering - whether that's responding to the looming famines in the Horn of Africa or the impacts of the climate crisis in Bangladesh,"" she said. ""It is definitely not reneging on existing aid commitments for a narrow self-interest on UK trade and business.

Names of US supermarket shooting victims released,"Mourners gathered outside the supermarket The rainy, grey weather in Buffalo certainly suited the mood on the ground on Monday. The black community is grieving and they are scared after 10 people - now named by officials - were gunned down in a racially-motivated attack in a New York supermarket. The victims, aged between 32 and 86, were shot dead by the suspected gunman on Saturday afternoon. Three others were injured. Buffalo gunman planned second attack, police say Among those killed were a former police officer, a woman who helped feed the poor and a man who drove shoppers to and from the market. Eleven out of the 13 people killed or injured at Tops Friendly Market were black, and Buffalo's police chief has described the attack as a ""racist hate crime"". The neighbourhood where the attack was carried out is predominantly black. Lakisha Chambers lives a few blocks away from the Tops grocery store - one of the few markets available to residents in the area - and walked over to the scene for the first time since the shooting on Monday. There is still a police presence, the area is taped off and memorials with balloons and candles dot the area. Seeing it in person makes it more real, she tells BBC. ""We all could've been in here"". Black Americans can't shop, can't go to church, can't just live in this country without fear of being killed, she says. What struck her, as well, was the age of the gunman, who is just 18 years old. To her, it suggests that the US must do better to stop racism once by addressing the underlying causes leading to attacks like this. Details of the victims were officially released on Monday by the local police. The names of the 10 who died were: Roberta A. Drury, 32, who had moved to Buffalo to be with her brother, who had had a bone marrow transplant Margus D. Morrison, 52, Andre Mackneil, 53 Aaron Salter, 55, a retired police officer who was working as a security guard in Top Friendly Mart grocery store Geraldine Talley, 62 Celestine Chaney, 65, a devoted grandmother Heyward Patterson, 67, a dedicated church-goer who drove people to and from the supermarket Katherine Massey, 72, a community activist with a ""beautiful soul"", according to her sister Pearl Young, 77, who dedicated her Saturdays to working in a soup kitchen Ruth Whitfield, 86, who had just been to visit her husband in a care home Zaire Goodman, left, was shot in the neck but miraculously survived The youngest victim, store worker Zaire Goodman, 20, was released from hospital after being shot in the neck. Jennifer Warrington, 50, has also been treated and released, while Christopher Braden, 55, is in a stable condition. The Buffalo Urban League is also on site, working in the community to help provide counselling services. Thomas Beauford Jr, its president and chief executive, calls what happened it trauma on top of trauma. This densely populated area already suffers from all the ills of unequal policies and problems caused by lack of investment and devalued properties, he tells BBC. The Tops supermarket is the only large resource for fresh food and products for miles in this area. Its closure will amplify the food desert that exists in the community, adding further to their hardship, he says. Questions are now being asked about whether red flags were missed in the run-up to the attack. ""I want to know what people knew and when they knew it,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul told ABC News. The suspect had already been flagged at least once to authorities, spending a day-and-a-half in hospital undergoing a mental health evaluation after making a ""generalised threat"" while at school in June last year. Despite this, he was not on any FBI or state-wide watchlists, and no red flags reportedly came up on a background check when buying a gun. A 180-page document seemingly authored by the suspect has also emerged, in which he describes himself as a fascist and a white supremacist. He was arrested after the attack and has pleaded not guilty to murder charges. He is next due in court on 19 May. Buffalo police chief Joseph Gramaglia told reporters the evidence uncovered in the case so far indisputably suggests that it was racially motivated. ""This is an absolute racist hate crime that will be prosecuted as a hate crime"" he said. Saturday's attack is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides - and mass shooting events occur frequently.

"Help must come, says ex-PM on cost of living crisisSir John Major warns about rising prices, as a minister is criticised for advocating people working more hours.UK Politics","""Help must come"" for those struggling to pay their bills amid rising prices, ex-Prime Minister John Major has said. Addressing a conference, Sir John said providing support would help bring ""trust and respect back to politics"". He also warned that government couldn't raise spending while reducing tax and that ""hard choices"" had to be made. Minister Rachel MacLean said the government was putting help in place to ease short-term pressures, including through the Household Support Fund. She also said that, over the long-term, government wanted ""to grow the economy and make sure that people are able to protect themselves better, whether that is by taking on more hours or moving to a better-paid job"". She acknowledged these options might not work for everyone such as those ""already working three jobs"". There's been criticism of her words, and Labour's shadow cabinet minister Ian Murray said her advice was ""ludicrous"" and ""out of touch"". No 10 later defended the minister and accused critics of ""seeking to twist the words unhelpfully"". How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Labour to call vote on energy firm windfall tax How high could my energy bills go? Meanwhile some Conservative MPs have urged the government to adopt opposition proposals to raise money to help those struggling by implementing a windfall tax on energy companies. Treasury Committee chair Mel Stride said he would normally oppose it but that current ""extraordinary circumstances"" meant there was a case for looking at ""a one-off windfall tax"". He said the companies had made ""supra-normal profits"" and some of that money should be ""channelled to those who are really struggling"". His Conservative colleague Simon Hoare later tweeted his agreement. Labour has said it will call for a vote to introduce the tax on Tuesday. Ministers have previously rejected introducing a one-off tax on the profits of energy companies, arguing it would deter investment. However, recently the government has been hinting that it could change its mind withTreasury officials sayingthe idea was not off the table. A number of Tory MPs have privately expressed concerned that the government will make a U-turn - with one senior Tory saying they are ""really irritated"" about being made to vote against it on Tuesday. Making a speech in Newcastle, Sir John - who led the Conservatives from 1990 to 1997 - joined in the debate saying that rising prices meant people would be ""utterly unable to meet the bills"". Address the National Cathedrals Conference, he said: ""Help must come - and I hope it will come soon,"" adding that a lack of support would damage people's trust in government. ""Everyone needs to believe that The State cares about them - and not just the interests of the powerful, the motivators, and the elite. ""If the week lasts longer than the money, do the penniless believe The State cares about them?"" Sir John also warned that the government's levelling up agenda - aimed at reducing regional inequalities - would demand ministers making ""hard choices"". He said the policy needed money and had to be paid for either by higher taxes, borrowing or cuts to other budgets. ""It is an unwelcome truth that lower taxes for everyone - and higher spending - do not go together."" The former prime minister concluded his speech by praising the younger generation who he said were ""a force for good"" despite ""their habit of cutting holes in the knees of new jeans for the sake of fashion"".

PM criticised after Stormont crisis talks,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks about ""unnecessary barriers"" on goods coming into Northern Ireland. Stormont's political parties have criticised the prime minister after a series of ""robust"" meetings on Monday. Boris Johnson was at Hillsborough Castle to encourage the parties to re-form Northern Ireland's institutions after the assembly election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has withheld its support until the government takes ""decisive action"" on post-Brexit trade arrangements. Mr Johnson said a ""legislative solution"" was needed. Unionist politicians have protested against theNorthern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. This ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has introduced some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The assembly election on 5 May cemented a majority for those who accept the protocol, A majority of politicians elected in the NI Assembly election on 5 May - including those of the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in - accept the protocol,but it is opposed by unionist politicians. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to make a statement on the government's plans to act on the protocol on Tuesday, with the government poised to introduce legislation that could override parts of the Brexit deal. This video can not be played The UK government is to introduce legislation that will allow it to override parts of the Brexit deal ""We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west,"" Mr Johnson said about the protocol after meeting Stormont's five main parties. ""But to get that done, to have the insurance we need, we need to proceed with a legislative solution at the same time. ""We don't want to scrap it (the protocol), but we think it can be fixed."" Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, whose party delegation was the first to meet the prime minister, accused Mr Johnson of unacceptable and obstructionist tactics in relation to the protocol. She said the government was placating the DUP and that Mr Johnson gave ""no straight answers"" during a ""very tough meeting"" at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. ""The British government is in a game of brinkmanship with the European institutions, indulging a section of political unionism which believes it can frustrate and hold society to ransom,"" she said. Following his party's meeting, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not have details of the government's proposals for dealing with the protocol, but that he would judge Mr Johnson's plan by actions, not words. On the return of Northern Ireland's political institutions, he said: ""We cannot have power-sharing unless there is a consensus. That consensus doesn't exist."" When asked if he had appealed to the DUP to return to Stormont, the prime minister replied: ""You bet, I said to the DUP in particular we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a Speaker in the assembly."" A number of protesters gathered in Hillsborough, County Down, on Monday ahead of Boris Johnson's visit Mr Johnson was booed and jeered by about 200 people as his cavalcade arrived at Hillsborough. Among them were campaigners forIrish language legislation, anti-Brexit activists and victims' campaigners objecting to the government's proposed legislation fordealing with legacy cases from the Troubles. The DUP, which supported Brexit, has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution was built on and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. Despite signing up to the deal himself, Mr Johnson agreed changes were needed. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph,external, the prime minister said the protocol was out of date and did not reflect the reality of a post-Covid era with a European war and a cost of living crisis. He added that he was open to dialogue but warned the UK would have to act if the EU did not change its position. On Monday, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said there were solutions to ""many of the issues that are being raised particularly from the unionists and the business communities"" about the protocol. ""This is not a time for unilateral action, announcing legislation which would essentially breach international law, undermine an international treaty and create a lot of unnecessary tensions between Brussels and London,"" he added. US Congressman Bill Keating, chair of the House sub-committee on Europe, said the government's action on the protocol had been ""a grave concern"" in the US and it ""undercuts the Good Friday Agreement"". ""You don't get round international agreements you were party toâ¦ by undercutting it with domestic unilateral legislation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.

The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal:It means goods can pass freely between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the European Union) Basically, lorries don't have to stopand prove their goods follow EU rules when they cross the border Instead, checks are donewhen goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) The border is a sensitive issue because ofNorthern Ireland's violent pastand politicians do not want new checkpoints there Butthe protocol is unpopular with unionist politicians(who support Northern Ireland being part of the UK).

How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed A senior UK government source said that barring any last minute changes, the government would introduce the legislation to strip away parts of the protocol to enable easier trade. Such legislation would have to go through parliament however, which could take months. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said she received no straight answers from the prime minister on the NI Protocol Some fear that should the UK act unilaterally, it could spark retaliation from European countries and ultimately a trade war - the last thing many businesses and households want at the time of a cost of living crisis. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill also met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin on Monday. Herparty won the most seats in May's historic electionbut cannot take up that power-sharing role without the DUP agreeing to enter government in Northern Ireland. After meeting Boris Johnson, Ms McDonald said he had indicated there were plans ""to fix rather than scrap the protocol"". The DUP was among the parties to meet Boris Johnson in Hillsborough on Monday Mr Donaldson said he had waited ""a long time for this moment"" for government proposals and said the EU had harmed the Good Friday Agreement by not respecting Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said his meeting with Mr Johnson had been a frustrating engagement with ""robust exchanges"". ""We've seen a lot of soft words from the prime minister, an attempt at some sort of consensual way forward, but those words belie the fact that tomorrow Liz Truss is set to make a statement to parliament setting out the basis of the UK taking unilateral action on the protocol,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the prime minister had ""made it clear"" to him that he intended to bring forward legislation to deal with protocol concerns. ""The protocol really does need to be dealt with so we can move forward,"" he said. Mr Beattie said the assembly and executive should be restored if the government signalled in the next week that it would bring forward measures. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said his meeting with Mr Johnson had also been ""robust"". ""If the British government tomorrow signal their intent to break international law by legislating to rip up the protocol at Westminster he will not have the support of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Eastwood said. The UK government and unionist parties have made the case that the protocol is damaging the Northern Ireland economy but the evidence for that is inconclusive. A free market think-tank has repeated the claim the protocol is costing Â£850m a year.

His Conservative colleague Simon Hoare later tweeted his agreement. Labour has said it will call for a vote to introduce the tax on Tuesday. Ministers have previously rejected introducing a one-off tax on the profits of energy companies, arguing it would deter investment. However, recently the government has been hinting that it could change its mind withTreasury officials sayingthe idea was not off the table. A number of Tory MPs have privately expressed concerned that the government will make a U-turn - with one senior Tory saying they are ""really irritated"" about being made to vote against it on Tuesday. Making a speech in Newcastle, Sir John - who led the Conservatives from 1990 to 1997 - joined in the debate saying that rising prices meant people would be ""utterly unable to meet the bills"". Address the National Cathedrals Conference, he said: ""Help must come - and I hope it will come soon,"" adding that a lack of support would damage people's trust in government. ""Everyone needs to believe that The State cares about them - and not just the interests of the powerful, the motivators, and the elite. ""If the week lasts longer than the money, do the penniless believe The State cares about them?"" Sir John also warned that the government's levelling up agenda - aimed at reducing regional inequalities - would demand ministers making ""hard choices"". He said the policy needed money and had to be paid for either by higher taxes, borrowing or cuts to other budgets. ""It is an unwelcome truth that lower taxes for everyone - and higher spending - do not go together."" The former prime minister concluded his speech by praising the younger generation who he said were ""a force for good"" despite ""their habit of cutting holes in the knees of new jeans for the sake of fashion"".

PM in Northern Ireland for Stormont crisis talks,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks about ""unnecessary barriers"" on goods coming into Northern Ireland. Stormont's political parties have criticised the prime minister after a series of ""robust"" meetings on Monday. Boris Johnson was at Hillsborough Castle to encourage the parties to re-form Northern Ireland's institutions after the assembly election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has withheld its support until the government takes ""decisive action"" on post-Brexit trade arrangements. Mr Johnson said a ""legislative solution"" was needed. Unionist politicians have protested against theNorthern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. This ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has introduced some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The assembly election on 5 May cemented a majority for those who accept the protocol, A majority of politicians elected in the NI Assembly election on 5 May - including those of the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in - accept the protocol,but it is opposed by unionist politicians. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to make a statement on the government's plans to act on the protocol on Tuesday, with the government poised to introduce legislation that could override parts of the Brexit deal. This video can not be played The UK government is to introduce legislation that will allow it to override parts of the Brexit deal ""We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west,"" Mr Johnson said about the protocol after meeting Stormont's five main parties. ""But to get that done, to have the insurance we need, we need to proceed with a legislative solution at the same time. ""We don't want to scrap it (the protocol), but we think it can be fixed."" Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, whose party delegation was the first to meet the prime minister, accused Mr Johnson of unacceptable and obstructionist tactics in relation to the protocol. She said the government was placating the DUP and that Mr Johnson gave ""no straight answers"" during a ""very tough meeting"" at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. ""The British government is in a game of brinkmanship with the European institutions, indulging a section of political unionism which believes it can frustrate and hold society to ransom,"" she said. Following his party's meeting, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not have details of the government's proposals for dealing with the protocol, but that he would judge Mr Johnson's plan by actions, not words. On the return of Northern Ireland's political institutions, he said: ""We cannot have power-sharing unless there is a consensus. That consensus doesn't exist."" When asked if he had appealed to the DUP to return to Stormont, the prime minister replied: ""You bet, I said to the DUP in particular we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a Speaker in the assembly."" A number of protesters gathered in Hillsborough, County Down, on Monday ahead of Boris Johnson's visit Mr Johnson was booed and jeered by about 200 people as his cavalcade arrived at Hillsborough. Among them were campaigners forIrish language legislation, anti-Brexit activists and victims' campaigners objecting to the government's proposed legislation fordealing with legacy cases from the Troubles. The DUP, which supported Brexit, has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution was built on and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. Despite signing up to the deal himself, Mr Johnson agreed changes were needed. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph,external, the prime minister said the protocol was out of date and did not reflect the reality of a post-Covid era with a European war and a cost of living crisis. He added that he was open to dialogue but warned the UK would have to act if the EU did not change its position. On Monday, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said there were solutions to ""many of the issues that are being raised particularly from the unionists and the business communities"" about the protocol. ""This is not a time for unilateral action, announcing legislation which would essentially breach international law, undermine an international treaty and create a lot of unnecessary tensions between Brussels and London,"" he added. US Congressman Bill Keating, chair of the House sub-committee on Europe, said the government's action on the protocol had been ""a grave concern"" in the US and it ""undercuts the Good Friday Agreement"". ""You don't get round international agreements you were party toâ¦ by undercutting it with domestic unilateral legislation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.

The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal:It means goods can pass freely between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the European Union) Basically, lorries don't have to stopand prove their goods follow EU rules when they cross the border Instead, checks are donewhen goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) The border is a sensitive issue because ofNorthern Ireland's violent pastand politicians do not want new checkpoints there Butthe protocol is unpopular with unionist politicians(who support Northern Ireland being part of the UK). They say it means Northern Ireland is treated differently from England, Scotland and Wales The UK government has hinted that itcould drop parts of the protocol, but the EU says it could retaliate Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Northern Ireland Protocol What do voters think of NI Protocol? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed A senior UK government source said that barring any last minute changes, the government would introduce the legislation to strip away parts of the protocol to enable easier trade. Such legislation would have to go through parliament however, which could take months. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said she received no straight answers from the prime minister on the NI Protocol Some fear that should the UK act unilaterally, it could spark retaliation from European countries and ultimately a trade war - the last thing many businesses and households want at the time of a cost of living crisis. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill also met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin on Monday. Herparty won the most seats in May's historic electionbut cannot take up that power-sharing role without the DUP agreeing to enter government in Northern Ireland. After meeting Boris Johnson, Ms McDonald said he had indicated there were plans ""to fix rather than scrap the protocol"". The DUP was among the parties to meet Boris Johnson in Hillsborough on Monday Mr Donaldson said he had waited ""a long time for this moment"" for government proposals and said the EU had harmed the Good Friday Agreement by not respecting Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said his meeting with Mr Johnson had been a frustrating engagement with ""robust exchanges"". ""We've seen a lot of soft words from the prime minister, an attempt at some sort of consensual way forward, but those words belie the fact that tomorrow Liz Truss is set to make a statement to parliament setting out the basis of the UK taking unilateral action on the protocol,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the prime minister had ""made it clear"" to him that he intended to bring forward legislation to deal with protocol concerns. ""The protocol really does need to be dealt with so we can move forward,"" he said. Mr Beattie said the assembly and executive should be restored if the government signalled in the next week that it would bring forward measures. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said his meeting with Mr Johnson had also been ""robust"". ""If the British government tomorrow signal their intent to break international law by legislating to rip up the protocol at Westminster he will not have the support of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Eastwood said. The UK government and unionist parties have made the case that the protocol is damaging the Northern Ireland economy but the evidence for that is inconclusive. A free market think-tank has repeated the claim the protocol is costing Â£850m a year. The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) is based on a previous estimate by the Ulster University economist Esmond Birnie. Read more: How the protocol affects NI's economy That research has previously been used by the DUP to bolster its case against the protocol but the research used a limited dataset and then added the cost of what the UK government is spending on mitigation measures. Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchsuggested Northern Ireland's economy has slightly outperformed the UK average, partially due to the protocol.

Over a million Covid cases feared in North Korea,"Employees spray disinfectant and wipe surfaces in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has lambasted health officials and ordered the army to help distribute medicine, as a wave of Covid cases sweeps through the country. More than a million people have now been sickened by what Pyongyang is calling a ""fever"", state media said. Some 50 people have died, but it's unclear how many of those suspected cases tested positive for Covid. North Korea has only limited testing capacity, so few cases are confirmed. North Koreans are likely to be especially vulnerable to the virus due to lack of vaccinations and a poor healthcare system. A nationwide lockdown is in place in the reclusive country. State media said Mr Kim led an emergency politburo meeting at the weekend where he accused officials of bungling the distribution of the national medicine reserves. He ordered that the ""powerful forces"" of the army's medical corps step in to ""immediately stabilise the supply of medicines in Pyongyang City"". What will the pandemic look like in North Korea? Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? How dangerous is the situation in North Korea? The countryannounced its first confirmed Covid cases last week- although experts believe the virus has likely been circulating for some time. Mr Kim has imposed ""maximum emergency"" virus controls, including lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces. The international community offered to supply North Korea with millions of AstraZeneca and Chinese-made jabs last year, but Pyongyang claimed it had controlled Covid by sealing its borders early in January 2020. It seems North Korea is where much of the world was back in early 2020. Covid is spreading rapidly through the population which is not vaccinated, has no built-up immunity, and has limited options to treat the virus. The difference of course is that North Korea has had time to prepare for this and has seemingly done little to do so. Instead, it has focussed on its strategy of preventing the virus from entering the country. It has turned down vaccines in the past saying it didn't need them. Now it does need them, but it might be too late. Health experts say the urgent priority is getting antiviral drugs into the country to treat people who are suffering. But in order for this to happen, North Korea needs to accept help, and it is yet to ask for any. South Korea's offers of vaccines and aid have gone unanswered. It is extremely unlikely the North would ever accept help from South Korea. It will be far more palatable if the offer comes from an international organisation such as the United Nations, even if that means South Korea's supplies need to be redirected and packaged up in this way. It is a risk for North Korea to accept aid and medical care because it means they would have to let people into the country to distribute and administer it. But the fact that it is reporting its daily deaths and case numbers is seen as an indication that it needs and wants help. Professor Hazel Smith of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London says those strict quarantines have been a key strategy for North Korea in its bid to control epidemics in the past - such as for Sars or Ebola. Now that the borders have been breached, the country lacked organisational infrastructure and was struggling with basic necessities like ""enough disinfectant and electricity and running water"", she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Once an epidemic has started, they've got difficulties in controlling and treating people who are ill,"" Prof Smith added. North Korea shares land borders with South Korea and China, which have both battled outbreaks. China is now struggling to contain an Omicron wave with lockdowns in its biggest cities. South Korea has offered to send unlimited aid to the North if requested, including vaccine doses, health workers, and medical equipment. On Saturday Mr Kimcalled the rapidly spreading Covid-19 outbreak a ""great disaster"". ""The spread of the malignant epidemic is [the greatest] turmoil to fall on our country since the founding,"" the official KCNA news agency quoted him as saying. As well as the direct health impact, fears have been raised for food production in North Korea. It suffered a brutal famine during the 1990s, and today the World Food Programme estimates that 11 million of the country's 25 million people are undernourished. If agricultural workers are unable to tend the fields, analysts say, the implications are extremely serious.

Goldman Sachs offers senior staff unlimited holiday,"Investment bank Goldman Sachs has said its senior staff will be allowed to take as much holiday as they want. There will be no cap on paid leave under the bank's new ""flexible vacation"" plans which are designed to promote ""rest and recharge"". Junior bankers, however, will still only be entitled to a fixed amount of holiday. The bank has been accused of overworking younger staff in the past. In a memo sent to staff globally, the bank said workers would be required to spend at least three weeks on leave annually from next year, with at least one week of consecutive days off. ""As a firm, we are committed to providing our people with differentiated benefits and offerings to support wellbeing and resilience,"" the firm wrote. Ex-Goldman Malaysia boss convicted in 1MDB trial Goldman raises pay after 95-hour week complaint Ex-Goldman banker: 'Bribes' made business possible ""As we continue to take care of our people at every stage of their careers and focus on the experience of our partners and managing directors, we are pleased to announce enhancements and changes to our global vacation programme designed to further support time off to rest and recharge."" Very few employers currently offer unlimited leave, but the policy is gaining in popularity. LinkedIn, Bumble and Netflix now offer the perk. And the bank Citigroup has offered junior workers in Malaga eight hour days with no weekend work for half of the $100,000 starting salary offered for the same roles in London and New York. Claire McCartney, inclusion and resourcing adviser for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), said that unlimited leave could be a way to ""empower"" employees and ""may help to attract and retain talent"". However, she said the policy needs ""careful"" management and could be ""open to abuse"". ""There's a risk that it could prove counter-productive, some people could take less leave which could lead to stress and burnout,"" she added. ""It's also important for it to be fair. If it is only open to certain employees, for instance, senior staff, that could lead to the rest of the workforce feeling undervalued and resentful."" Last year, people who had recently joined Goldman though its graduate recruitment scheme said they would quit unless their gruelling working conditions improved. An internal survey among 13 employees showed they averaged 95 hours of work a week and slept just five hours a night. In the survey, all of the respondents said the job had negatively affected their relationships with friends and family, while 77% said they had been victims of workplace abuse. Working conditions were described as ""inhumane"" and ""abusive"" in the survey, which was seen by the BBC. At the time, a spokeswoman for the bank told the BBC it was ""listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them"". The bank also said it had reinforced its ""Saturday Exception"" policy - which means that employees cannot work from 9 pm on Friday to 9am on Sunday except in certain circumstances - and was moving to automate certain tasks for junior staff.

Aid to be targeted at UK foreign policy priorities,"The government is to give billions of pounds less in foreign aid to international organisations such as the United Nations. Instead, the Foreign Office will spend the aid money on individual projects and countries that are UK priorities. The change is part of a new strategy designed to ensure aid spending does more to promote foreign policy. Aid charities criticised the strategy for focusing more on boosting UK trade than ending extreme poverty. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""In an increasingly geopolitical world, we must use development as a key part of our foreign policy."" She said the new strategy will ensure the UK's international development work has benefits across the globe and in the UK, improving economic security worldwide and increasing jobs and growth at home. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Aid cuts to stay for at least three years - Sunak Charities accuse chancellor of stealth raid on aid The UK currently spends about Â£11.5bn each year on aid - after cutting the budget by Â£3bn last year. Almost 40% of the aid budget is currently given to the UN, the World Bank, European Union and other global bodies to spend on their own aid budgets. The advantage is that these international organisations benefit from economies of scale by pooling the resources of many countries. But under the new strategy, the Foreign Office will cut the percentage of UK aid spent on multilateral organisations down to just 25% by 2025. The Foreign Office said the approach will mean it can ""focus funding on UK priorities and control exactly how taxpayers' money is used to support these"". The UK will also offer developing countries what the Foreign Office called more ""reliable investment"" so they can be less dependent on the ""unsustainable debt"" of ""malign actors"". The document does not mention China, but this is a reference to the increasing reliance of some developing countries on loans handed out by Beijing. The Foreign Office said the aim was to bring ""more countries into the orbit of free-market economies"". It added: ""This will help low and middle-income countries become our trade and investment partners of the future."" Ms Truss said: ""Malign actors treat economics and development as a means of control, using patronage, investment and debt as a form of economic coercion and political power. ""We won't mirror their malign tactics, but we will match them in our resolve to provide an alternative."" Funding for girls' education in places such as Kenya is being restored after a year of cuts However, the Foreign Office was unable to say how the UK could compete with China's much bigger aid budgets. The strategy also says a UK priority will be supporting women and girls with greater education, help with reproductive health and rights, and more protection from violence. ""We intend to restore funding for this vital work,"" the strategy says, a reference to the impact of last year's general aid cuts. Humanitarian aid will also be made a priority, with the Foreign Office promising to spend Â£3bn over the next three years. The Foreign Office said it also aimed to cut bureaucracy in the way it delivered development aid, in particular giving greater autonomy to UK ambassadors to make decisions on the ground. Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the House of Commons International Development Committee, said the new strategy document was ""a double whammy against the global poor"". She said: ""Supporting the poorest in the world should not be conditional on a trade deal or agreeing to investment partnerships. ""The UK has rightly been hugely critical of China for such an approach, so I fail to see why we are following down the same road. It is depressing and disappointing that the UK would devise a strategy like this."" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran said the strategy barely mentions the ""callous decision to slash aid spending"" which she said was ""harming the most vulnerable around the world"". ""The government's misguided new focus on 'aid for trade' is yet another blow for the world's poorest,"" she said. Bond, the umbrella group for aid charities, criticised the Foreign Office strategy for failing to prioritise health, climate change and open societies. Stephanie Draper, CEO at Bond, said: ""Though this strategy contains some positive elements, it seems largely driven by short-term political and economic interests rather than the attempt to tackle the root causes of global crises such as inequality, conflict and climate change, which impact us all. ""It's worrying that 'aid for trade' is at the heart of this strategy as this not only diverts money away from life-saving programmes but could see investors benefit at the expense of the marginalised communities it's supposed to serve."" Christine Allen, director at international development charity Cafod, accused the government of ""raiding"" the foreign aid budget to bolster the UK's trade and investment: ""Britain's role on the global stage does not mean abdicating from our responsibilities to those who are suffering - whether that's responding to the looming famines in the Horn of Africa or the impacts of the climate crisis in Bangladesh,"" she said. ""It is definitely not reneging on existing aid commitments for a narrow self-interest on UK trade and business. ""Aid money is precious and transformative, it must be valued for the good that it does.""

Energy bills shake-up plans to avoid price shocks,"Household energy bills could change every three months under new plans aimed at avoiding price shocks. Currently gas and electricity bills are updated every six months. The plans, proposed by the energy regulator Ofgem, would mean price falls and rises would be passed on to customers more quickly. It comes as the UK cost of living is expected to rise further, prompting calls by Labour for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms to help households. The price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - is updated twice a year in April and October. Last month, a typical energy bill jumped from Â£1,277 to Â£1,971 and is forecast to soar a further 32% when the cap is revised again in October. How high could my energy bills go? Energy boss urges Â£1,000 bill cut for millions For people on prepayment meters, the price of energy has now risen by an average Â£708 to Â£2,017 a year. Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: ""The proposed change would mean the price cap is more reflective of current market prices and any price falls would be delivered more quickly to consumers. ""It would also help energy suppliers better predict how much energy they need to purchase for their customers, reducing the risk of further supplier failures, which ultimately pushes up costs for consumers."" Since early last year, more than 30 UK energy companies have gone bust after firms found themselves unable to pass on the full cost of soaring wholesale gas to customers because of the price cap. Irrespective of whether Ofgem's plan is rubber-stamped, the next time your domestic energy price will change is in October - and it will be another rise. Industry estimates suggest another Â£600 a year increase for a typical household, taking the annual bill to Â£2,600. After that, prices are expected to fall back, but not by much. Analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted a drop to Â£2,300 in the spring, summer and winter of 2023-24. These proposals do not mean that fall would be any greater, but it could come sooner. There was discussion and debate about the frequency of changes to the price cap when it was first introduced. Now a more frequent price cap looks inevitable. But how households manage to pay their bill, what support they receive to do so, and how long those bills stay high remain far more pressing issues. International wholesale gas prices jumped last year as demand outstripped supply. But they have remained elevated due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Energy bills shake-up plans to smooth price rises,"Household energy bills could change every three months under new plans aimed at avoiding price shocks. Currently gas and electricity bills are updated every six months. The plans, proposed by the energy regulator Ofgem, would mean price falls and rises would be passed on to customers more quickly. It comes as the UK cost of living is expected to rise further, prompting calls by Labour for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms to help households. The price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - is updated twice a year in April and October. Last month, a typical energy bill jumped from Â£1,277 to Â£1,971 and is forecast to soar a further 32% when the cap is revised again in October. How high could my energy bills go? Energy boss urges Â£1,000 bill cut for millions For people on prepayment meters, the price of energy has now risen by an average Â£708 to Â£2,017 a year. Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: ""The proposed change would mean the price cap is more reflective of current market prices and any price falls would be delivered more quickly to consumers. ""It would also help energy suppliers better predict how much energy they need to purchase for their customers, reducing the risk of further supplier failures, which ultimately pushes up costs for consumers."" Since early last year, more than 30 UK energy companies have gone bust after firms found themselves unable to pass on the full cost of soaring wholesale gas to customers because of the price cap. Irrespective of whether Ofgem's plan is rubber-stamped, the next time your domestic energy price will change is in October - and it will be another rise. Industry estimates suggest another Â£600 a year increase for a typical household, taking the annual bill to Â£2,600. After that, prices are expected to fall back, but not by much. Analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted a drop to Â£2,300 in the spring, summer and winter of 2023-24. These proposals do not mean that fall would be any greater, but it could come sooner. There was discussion and debate about the frequency of changes to the price cap when it was first introduced. Now a more frequent price cap looks inevitable. But how households manage to pay their bill, what support they receive to do so, and how long those bills stay high remain far more pressing issues. International wholesale gas prices jumped last year as demand outstripped supply. But they have remained elevated due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is a major gas supplier to many countries, but some have announced plans to wind down their dependence on the country for energy in response to its assault. Ofgem said, following a consultation, it hopes to introduce quarterly price cap reviews from October to ""support the sector through a potentially challenging winter"".

Russia nationalises Renault's Moscow plantIt is the first Russian nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine.Business,"Renault has announced it is selling its majority stake in Russian carmaker Avtovaz, following pressure over its continued presence in the country. The French carmaker said it would sell its 68% interest to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow. Moscow said Renault's Russian assets had now become state property. It is the first Russian nationalisation of a major foreign business since the invasion of Ukraine. ""Agreements were signed on the transfer of Russian assets of the Renault Group to the Russian Federation and the government of Moscow,"" Russia's industry and trade ministry said. Financial details of the deal were not provided, but in April Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Renault planned to sell its Russian assets for ""one symbolic rouble"". Shell strikes deal to sell Russian petrol stations The Western brands unable to leave Russia In a statement on Monday, Renault Group said its board of directors had approved agreements to sell Renault Russia to the Moscow city entity, as well as its 67.69% stake in Avtovaz to the Russian Central Research and Development Automobile and Engine Institute (Nami). The deal also included Renault's Moscow plant, Avtoframos, which makes Renault and Nissan models. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said production at the plant would now resume under the Soviet-era Moskvich brand. Renault boss Luca de Meo said: ""Today, we have taken a difficult but necessary decision; and we are making a responsible choice towards our 45,000 employees in Russia, while preserving the group's performance and our ability to return to the country in the future, in a different context."" The agreement, which Renault said would cost the company an estimated â¬2.2bn ($2.29bn), includes an option for the group to buy back its interest in Avtovaz for six years. Avtovaz is Russia's largest carmaker and makes the country's popular Lada brand. In March, Renault announced it was suspending operations at its Moscow factory. It came after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Renault and other French companies to leave Russia, accusing them of ""financing the murders of women and children"". Renault's chief executive Luca de Meo said the firm was making a responsible choice - but just how much choice did it actually have? In the early stages of the conflict, the company prevaricated, choosing to remain in Russia while other international brands were leaving. But after being name-checked by Ukraine's President Zelensky, who said Western firms in Russia were helping to finance Vladimir Putin's war, it suspended its operations in late March. Abandoning its Russian business will be costly - Renault's own estimate is $2.3bn. It will lose a major market once seen as a key avenue for growth. And it will lose Lada as well - a brand that was central to Renault's strategy for affordable cars. Arguably, Renault could not remain in Russia. Yet the damage to its reputation has already been severe. Hundreds of international brands including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple have left Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in February, with many now looking to sell their businesses in the country. Last weekenergy giant Shell announced it had agreed to sell more than 400 of its petrol stations in Russiato the country's second largest oil producer, Lukoil. Moscow has previously warned it may nationalise production plants or factories where work has been suspended.

Global wheat prices jump after India export ban,"The price of wheat has jumped on international markets after India banned the export of the staple cereal. The benchmark wheat index rose as much as 5.9% in Chicago, the highest it has been in two months. The export ban comes after a heatwave hit India's wheat crops, taking domestic prices to a record high. The cost of everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has risen in recent months as wheat prices soared on world commodity markets. India's government said it would still allow exports backed by letters of credit that have already been issued, and to countries that request supplies ""to meet their food security needs"". Government officials also said the ban was not permanent and could be revised. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries However, the decision has been criticised by agriculture ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations meeting in Germany. ""If everyone starts to impose export restrictions or to close markets, that would worsen the crisis,"" German food and agriculture minister Cem Ozdemir said. The G7 is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Britons skip meals as food prices rise - charity Shoppers could face Â£271 rise in annual food bills Ukraine war causes 'giant leap' in food prices Although India is the world's second-biggest wheat producer, it has not previously been a major exporter as most of its crop is sold on domestic markets. But Ukraine's wheat exports plunged after the Russian invasion. And with droughts and floods threatening crops in other major producers, commodity traders were expecting supplies from India to make up for part of the shortfall. Before the ban, India had aimed to ship a record 10 million tonnes of wheat this year. Vikas Pandey, India editor, BBC News Just a week ago, senior officials from India's commerce ministry told me that they were bullish about increasing the country's wheat exports to meet the surge in global demand. They echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that ""India was ready to feed the world"". So, the ban does seem like a major policy U-turn. It also hints at the government's concerns over rising prices at home. But the decision could cause what one expert described as a foreign policy challenge for India. Delhi had been making noises to get a waiver from a World Trade Organization rule that makes it difficult for countries to export grains that - as the Indian government routinely does - are bought at a fixed price from farmers for official reserves. And some countries seemed willing to help India find a way to export wheat to the world. The same countries are now likely to be upset. Global food prices hit a fresh record high in March after the Ukraine war caused a ""giant leap"", according to the United Nations (UN). That came as the conflict cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil - Ukraine - which means the costs of alternatives also climbed. The country is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat, which have risen sharply in price too. The UN said that global food prices eased slightly in April but remain almost 30% higher than the same time last year. Rising food prices, along with a jump in the cost of energy, have been pushing up inflation around that world. That has forced major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, to raise interest rates in an attempt to rein in rising prices. That, in turn, has triggered concerns that the higher cost of borrowing could hit global economic growth, with some high-profile commentators warning of a recession. On Sunday, Lloyd Blankfein, the senior chairman of Wall Street investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, said there is a ""very, very high risk"" of recession in the US, the world's biggest economy. Mr Blankfein's comments on CBS's Face the Nation came on the same day as Goldman Sachs economists cut their US economic growth forecasts for this year and next.

How events at Stormont will pause political life,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his party will not support the election of a Speaker and deputy speakers Friday the 13th was originally a well-known cult movie, one that has become a film franchise synonymous with being a horror show. To some, the events at Stormont on Friday the 13th will also be difficult viewing. The DUP saysit will not support the election of a Speaker and deputy speakers at Stormont. This was meant to be a fresh start, instead events on Friday will simply pause political life here. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, says his party will not support the election of Speaker and deputy speakers. It is part of the party's ongoing opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol.The move aims to put pressure on the UK government and the European Commission in the ongoing dispute over the protocol. Without a Speaker, the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot meet or function. It basically means, in the words of my colleague BBC Political Correspondent Jayne McCormack, that we have a ""silent assembly"". In other words, it exists on paper but cannot operate. It is one of the few moves left open to the DUP to try and apply pressure. In other words, the party is saying to London and Brussels you can have the protocol or Stormont  - but you can't have both. This is a big gamble for the DUP in the hope there will be movement on the protocol to allow the party to return to Stormont. What if there is no change? How long will the party stay away from the assembly and the executive? How will the public react? What of the fact that a majority of MLAs support the protocol and does this look like the DUP are holding people to ransom? Edwin Poots, a former DUP leader, told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show that ""sometimes when you have a problem and it is not being dealt with you have to bring it to a head"". This is the DUP moving things up a gear. Already their political opponents, who make up the majority in Stormont, have attacked this strategy and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson will also have to calculate whether public opinion will accept delays to the establishment of a fresh assembly and a new executive. DUP threatens to stop assembly functioning UK rejects EU plans to deal with NI Protocol A simple guide to the Brexit border problem We have been here before. There was much anger and criticism during the previous Stormont suspension from 2017 until 2020 after Sinn FÃ©in left the executive. The DUP are also gambling that after last week's election this is the most opportune moment to strike. Emma Little-Pengelly arrives at Stormont The party also hopes the political moves in London will assist them in their fight against the protocol. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who is an MP and was elected to the assembly last week, originally said he would give up his Westminster role to concentrate on Stormont matters. But he has now said that will not take place. He says he will remain as an MP until the protocol is sorted to his party's liking. His party colleague Emma Little-Pengellywill now take his place in the assembly. It is a move that has been roundly criticised. Friday was meant to be a new beginning for politics. Instead, for seasoned political watchers, Friday the 13th - resembles another movie - Groundhog Day. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next?

Here's a recap of the day's key developments: As we reported earlier, Ukrainians are marking Vyshyvanka Day - a celebration of Ukrainian folk culture, particularly the wearing of traditional embroidered shirts. Here are some images taken as people came out to celebrate, despite the continuing war in the country. The designs on some vyshyvankas have meanings such as hope, fertility and protection Children were among those who gathered in Lviv Once traditionally white, vyshyankas are now made in a wide range of colours This performance took place in the western city of Lviv Sewing lessons were on offer in Odesa Three refugee sisters, together with friends and their host, marked the occasion with a giant shirt in Cambridge in the UK A famous cat from Kharkiv who raised thousands for Ukrainian animal shelters through his Instagram account has been given a prestigious award for his efforts.

Russian forces have ""completely destroyed"" the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said,in a late night video address,external. He also accused Moscow of carrying out ""senseless bombardments"" as it intensified its offensive in the region. Russia has shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, after pulling back its forces from near the capital Kyiv. ""In the Donbas, the occupiers are trying to exert even more
pressure,"" Zelensky says. ""It is hell there - and that is not an exaggeration,""
he adds. Read more on why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east.

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information. This video can not be played Ukrainian soldiers blow up a bridge connecting cities in the Luhansk region Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's National Guard released a video it said shows the destruction of a bridge connecting Sievierodonetsk to Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. The special operation between Ukraine's security forces aims to slow down the advance of Russian troops in the Luhansk region. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the images. We'll turn now to the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, where some Ukrainian fighters are still believed to be holed up - although it's unclear how many. The Deputy Commander of the Azov unit, Sviatoslav Palamar hasposted a video message on Telegram,,externalin which he says: âGlory to Ukraine! It is day 85 of the war. The leadership and I are on the premises of the Azovstal plant. There is a certain operation happening, details of which I am not going to share. I thank the whole world and Ukraine for the support. I will be seeing you.â It is not clear what the operation he refers to is. We will bring you more information if it becomes available. Russia says more than 1,700 fighters from the plant have been taken to Russian-controlled areas since Monday. You canread about what has been happening to them here. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and
strategically. We thank our allies."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT.

PM poised for protocol change ahead of NI crisis talks,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks about ""unnecessary barriers"" on goods coming into Northern Ireland. Stormont's political parties have criticised the prime minister after a series of ""robust"" meetings on Monday. Boris Johnson was at Hillsborough Castle to encourage the parties to re-form Northern Ireland's institutions after the assembly election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has withheld its support until the government takes ""decisive action"" on post-Brexit trade arrangements. Mr Johnson said a ""legislative solution"" was needed. Unionist politicians have protested against theNorthern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. This ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has introduced some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The assembly election on 5 May cemented a majority for those who accept the protocol, A majority of politicians elected in the NI Assembly election on 5 May - including those of the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in - accept the protocol,but it is opposed by unionist politicians. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to make a statement on the government's plans to act on the protocol on Tuesday, with the government poised to introduce legislation that could override parts of the Brexit deal. This video can not be played The UK government is to introduce legislation that will allow it to override parts of the Brexit deal ""We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west,"" Mr Johnson said about the protocol after meeting Stormont's five main parties. ""But to get that done, to have the insurance we need, we need to proceed with a legislative solution at the same time. ""We don't want to scrap it (the protocol), but we think it can be fixed."" Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, whose party delegation was the first to meet the prime minister, accused Mr Johnson of unacceptable and obstructionist tactics in relation to the protocol. She said the government was placating the DUP and that Mr Johnson gave ""no straight answers"" during a ""very tough meeting"" at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. ""The British government is in a game of brinkmanship with the European institutions, indulging a section of political unionism which believes it can frustrate and hold society to ransom,"" she said. Following his party's meeting, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not have details of the government's proposals for dealing with the protocol, but that he would judge Mr Johnson's plan by actions, not words. On the return of Northern Ireland's political institutions, he said: ""We cannot have power-sharing unless there is a consensus. That consensus doesn't exist."" When asked if he had appealed to the DUP to return to Stormont, the prime minister replied: ""You bet, I said to the DUP in particular we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a Speaker in the assembly."" A number of protesters gathered in Hillsborough, County Down, on Monday ahead of Boris Johnson's visit Mr Johnson was booed and jeered by about 200 people as his cavalcade arrived at Hillsborough. Among them were campaigners forIrish language legislation, anti-Brexit activists and victims' campaigners objecting to the government's proposed legislation fordealing with legacy cases from the Troubles. The DUP, which supported Brexit, has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution was built on and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. Despite signing up to the deal himself, Mr Johnson agreed changes were needed. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph,external, the prime minister said the protocol was out of date and did not reflect the reality of a post-Covid era with a European war and a cost of living crisis. He added that he was open to dialogue but warned the UK would have to act if the EU did not change its position. On Monday, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said there were solutions to ""many of the issues that are being raised particularly from the unionists and the business communities"" about the protocol. ""This is not a time for unilateral action, announcing legislation which would essentially breach international law, undermine an international treaty and create a lot of unnecessary tensions between Brussels and London,"" he added. US Congressman Bill Keating, chair of the House sub-committee on Europe, said the government's action on the protocol had been ""a grave concern"" in the US and it ""undercuts the Good Friday Agreement"". ""You don't get round international agreements you were party toâ¦ by undercutting it with domestic unilateral legislation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight. This video can not be played NI protocol: What do young people think? The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal:It means goods can pass freely between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the European Union) Basically, lorries don't have to stopand prove their goods follow EU rules when they cross the border Instead, checks are donewhen goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) The border is a sensitive issue because ofNorthern Ireland's violent pastand politicians do not want new checkpoints there Butthe protocol is unpopular with unionist politicians(who support Northern Ireland being part of the UK). They say it means Northern Ireland is treated differently from England, Scotland and Wales The UK government has hinted that itcould drop parts of the protocol, but the EU says it could retaliate Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Northern Ireland Protocol What do voters think of NI Protocol? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed A senior UK government source said that barring any last minute changes, the government would introduce the legislation to strip away parts of the protocol to enable easier trade. Such legislation would have to go through parliament however, which could take months. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said she received no straight answers from the prime minister on the NI Protocol Some fear that should the UK act unilaterally, it could spark retaliation from European countries and ultimately a trade war - the last thing many businesses and households want at the time of a cost of living crisis. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill also met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin on Monday. Herparty won the most seats in May's historic electionbut cannot take up that power-sharing role without the DUP agreeing to enter government in Northern Ireland. After meeting Boris Johnson, Ms McDonald said he had indicated there were plans ""to fix rather than scrap the protocol"". The DUP was among the parties to meet Boris Johnson in Hillsborough on Monday Mr Donaldson said he had waited ""a long time for this moment"" for government proposals and said the EU had harmed the Good Friday Agreement by not respecting Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said his meeting with Mr Johnson had been a frustrating engagement with ""robust exchanges"". ""We've seen a lot of soft words from the prime minister, an attempt at some sort of consensual way forward, but those words belie the fact that tomorrow Liz Truss is set to make a statement to parliament setting out the basis of the UK taking unilateral action on the protocol,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the prime minister had ""made it clear"" to him that he intended to bring forward legislation to deal with protocol concerns. ""The protocol really does need to be dealt with so we can move forward,"" he said. Mr Beattie said the assembly and executive should be restored if the government signalled in the next week that it would bring forward measures. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said his meeting with Mr Johnson had also been ""robust"". ""If the British government tomorrow signal their intent to break international law by legislating to rip up the protocol at Westminster he will not have the support of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Eastwood said. The UK government and unionist parties have made the case that the protocol is damaging the Northern Ireland economy but the evidence for that is inconclusive. A free market think-tank has repeated the claim the protocol is costing Â£850m a year. The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) is based on a previous estimate by the Ulster University economist Esmond Birnie. Read more: How the protocol affects NI's economy That research has previously been used by the DUP to bolster its case against the protocol but the research used a limited dataset and then added the cost of what the UK government is spending on mitigation measures. Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchsuggested Northern Ireland's economy has slightly outperformed the UK average, partially due to the protocol.

Over a million Covid cases feared in North KoreaThe military has been ordered to intervene as a wave of Covid cases sweeps the unvaccinated country.Asia,"Employees spray disinfectant and wipe surfaces in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has lambasted health officials and ordered the army to help distribute medicine, as a wave of Covid cases sweeps through the country. More than a million people have now been sickened by what Pyongyang is calling a ""fever"", state media said. Some 50 people have died, but it's unclear how many of those suspected cases tested positive for Covid. North Korea has only limited testing capacity, so few cases are confirmed. North Koreans are likely to be especially vulnerable to the virus due to lack of vaccinations and a poor healthcare system. A nationwide lockdown is in place in the reclusive country. State media said Mr Kim led an emergency politburo meeting at the weekend where he accused officials of bungling the distribution of the national medicine reserves. He ordered that the ""powerful forces"" of the army's medical corps step in to ""immediately stabilise the supply of medicines in Pyongyang City"". What will the pandemic look like in North Korea? Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? How dangerous is the situation in North Korea? The countryannounced its first confirmed Covid cases last week- although experts believe the virus has likely been circulating for some time. Mr Kim has imposed ""maximum emergency"" virus controls, including lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces. The international community offered to supply North Korea with millions of AstraZeneca and Chinese-made jabs last year, but Pyongyang claimed it had controlled Covid by sealing its borders early in January 2020. It seems North Korea is where much of the world was back in early 2020. Covid is spreading rapidly through the population which is not vaccinated, has no built-up immunity, and has limited options to treat the virus. The difference of course is that North Korea has had time to prepare for this and has seemingly done little to do so. Instead, it has focussed on its strategy of preventing the virus from entering the country. It has turned down vaccines in the past saying it didn't need them. Now it does need them, but it might be too late. Health experts say the urgent priority is getting antiviral drugs into the country to treat people who are suffering. But in order for this to happen, North Korea needs to accept help, and it is yet to ask for any. South Korea's offers of vaccines and aid have gone unanswered. It is extremely unlikely the North would ever accept help from South Korea. It will be far more palatable if the offer comes from an international organisation such as the United Nations, even if that means South Korea's supplies need to be redirected and packaged up in this way. It is a risk for North Korea to accept aid and medical care because it means they would have to let people into the country to distribute and administer it. But the fact that it is reporting its daily deaths and case numbers is seen as an indication that it needs and wants help. Professor Hazel Smith of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London says those strict quarantines have been a key strategy for North Korea in its bid to control epidemics in the past - such as for Sars or Ebola. Now that the borders have been breached, the country lacked organisational infrastructure and was struggling with basic necessities like ""enough disinfectant and electricity and running water"", she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Once an epidemic has started, they've got difficulties in controlling and treating people who are ill,"" Prof Smith added. North Korea shares land borders with South Korea and China, which have both battled outbreaks. China is now struggling to contain an Omicron wave with lockdowns in its biggest cities. South Korea has offered to send unlimited aid to the North if requested, including vaccine doses, health workers, and medical equipment. On Saturday Mr Kimcalled the rapidly spreading Covid-19 outbreak a ""great disaster"". ""The spread of the malignant epidemic is [the greatest] turmoil to fall on our country since the founding,"" the official KCNA news agency quoted him as saying. As well as the direct health impact, fears have been raised for food production in North Korea. It suffered a brutal famine during the 1990s, and today the World Food Programme estimates that 11 million of the country's 25 million people are undernourished. If agricultural workers are unable to tend the fields, analysts say, the implications are extremely serious.

How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed,"Boris Johnson has said he will find it ""very difficult"" to vote for Rishi Sunak's new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland (NI). Rishi Sunakhas announced changesto the protocol - the agreement which Mr Johnson negotiated with the EU and which came into force in NI at the start of 2021. It introduced checks on goods arriving in NI from the rest of the UK and became a source of political tensions. Mr Johnson,in a speech in Westminster,external, said ""I thought those checks would not be onerous"" and went on to say ""it's all my fault, I fully accept responsibility"". This is in marked contrast to what he said about his deal before it came into force. Northern Ireland Brexit deal: At-a-glance Brexit: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked Northern Ireland: Did anyone warn about Brexit checks? In August 2020, Mr Johnson made this pledge - one he repeated several times. But Northern Ireland has been treated differently to the rest of the UK for the trade in goods, as the protocol said it would be. So, there has indeed been a trade border in the Irish Sea. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been deeply unhappy about this, using the slogan: ""No border in the Irish Sea"". Mr Johnson said this on Sky News in response to a question abouta leaked internal Treasury document,external. On the impact of the protocol, the document warned ""customs declarations and documentary and physical checks... will be highly disruptive to the NI economy"". It highlighted potential constitutional implications, saying Northern Ireland (NI) could be ""symbolically separated"" from Great Britain (GB). Mr Johnson's dismissal of the document's main findings ran counter to the facts of his own deal. Parts of the Treasury document are now out of date (the possibility that tariffs or taxes could be charged on many goods crossing from GB to NI, for example, was removed by the signing of the new EU-UK free trade agreement in December 2020). But it set out clearly that there would be a range of bureaucratic measures affecting GB-NI trade, including customs declarations, food safety checks, security checks, and regulatory checks on product standards. The NI Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) says that SPS checks (controls to protect animal, plant or public health) were carried out between 1 January 2021 and 19 February 2023 at NI ports on: 275,955 products of animal origin (mainly food) 14,853 consignments of live animals 19,627 consignments of plants and plant products 1,233 consignments of high risk food (not of animal origin) 319 consignments were rejected or refused entry And this was despite grace periods being in place during which the full implementation of EU rules was suspended. Mr Johnson was asked by an NI businessman whether he could tell his staff that they wouldn't have to complete customs declarations for goods going from NI to GB. Mr Johnson said he could. At the time, the terms of the protocol suggested export declarations would have to be filled in - a pointacknowledged by then Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay. In subsequent negotiations, though, the need for formal NI-GB customs forms was waived - so this part of the prime minister's promise was met. However, in 2021 there weremore than a million,externalfull customs declarations for goods coming the other way - from GB-NI - with each declaration comprising multiple forms and steps. Boris Johnson asserted this in response to a question in Parliament from Nigel Dodds of the DUP who said the protocol ""drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement"" and urged Mr Johnson to reconsider the plan. He reminded the prime minister that he had told the DUP conference in 2018 that ""no British Conservative government could or should sign up"" to an arrangement with regulatory checks and customs controls between GB and NI. What is the Good Friday Agreement? On 11 May 2022, at a press conference in Sweden, Mr Johnson said that the Good Friday Agreement meant that ""things have got to command cross-community support. Plainly the Northern Ireland Protocol fails to do that and we need to sort it out."" The protocol has a consent mechanism that means assembly members are asked to vote on it. The first consent vote is due in 2024. Mr Johnson gave this assessment in the House of Commons shortly after agreeing the terms of the deal, urging MPs to back it. But annexes to the protocol set out a long list of EU laws that would apply to NI, including laws dealing with products of animal origin and the EU customs code. In addition to the leaked Treasury document,the government's own impact assessment,,externalpublished at the time, was clear. ""Goods arriving in Northern Ireland, including from Great Britain,"" it said, ""would undergo regulatory checks in accordance with EU rules."" One year on from the changes coming into effect,the NI Chambers of Commerce found,externalthat a very high proportion of members had experienced increases in prices of goods and services and the amount of time taken to transport goods.

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information. This video can not be played Ukrainian soldiers blow up a bridge connecting cities in the Luhansk region Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's National Guard released a video it said shows the destruction of a bridge connecting Sievierodonetsk to Rubizhne in the Luhansk region.

We'll turn now to the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, where some Ukrainian fighters are still believed to be holed up - although it's unclear how many.

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate.

McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT. Asked about Shishimarin at a news briefing on 18 May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovsaid he did not have enough information,externalabout the soldier captured by Ukraine. You can read our correspondent Sarah Rainsford'sstory on the trial here. Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post. At least eight houses have been damaged and rescuers were unable to reach places on fire for two hours because of the shelling, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sturgeon in climate change warning during US trip,"This video can not be played COP26 climate summit president Alok Sharma says world leaders must deliver on the promises they made Global leaders have not done enough to honour commitments made at the COP26 climate summit, its president has said. Alok Sharma said more must be done to hit the targets agreed in Glasgow, warning that failure would be ""an act of monstrous self-harm"". Six months on from the event, he said countries needed to ""up the pace"" in the push towards carbon-neutral energy. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also issued a warning over climate change, during a trip to the US. She said that a failure to hit targets agreed at COP26 would be ""catastrophic"" for the planet. Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? What was agreed at COP26? UN scientists: It's 'now or never' to fix climate change Mr Sharma, a minister in the UK government's cabinet office, was in Glasgow to mark six months from last year's UN conference. He said it was understandable that climate change was no longer on the front pages, amid the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis. But he said these issues ""should increase, not diminish, our determination to deliver on what the world agreed in Glasgow"". Glasgow was the host of the COP26 summit The summit was aimed at hammering out agreements that would hold average global temperature rises under 1.5C. However, scientists warn that there is a 6-10% chance of meeting this threshold, and that even if pledges are fully delivered the temperature rise will be closer to 2C. Mr Sharma said ""the window of time we have left to act is closing fast"", with climate change ""already wreaking havoc"". He said: ""Progress is of course welcome, but frankly we need to up the pace. Leaders have not done enough to deliver on their Glasgow commitments, and that must change. ""We need every nation to pick up the pace. We need every leader to show that their words were not hollow, that their commitments were made with integrity, and that they recognise that though the immediate challenges we face are grave, we will only inflame them if we falter. ""It is leaders who made promises, it is leaders who must honour them."" It isn't surprising Alok Sharma is worried about the world honouring the climate promises made in Glasgow in November. Food, energy and finance costs are soaring around the world. Sri Lanka and Peru have already seen protests prompted by rising fuel, fertilizer and food costs. A United Nations insider told me last week it has a watchlist of 35 other countries it fears are also on the verge of widespread unrest, even uprisings. The worry is climate promises will be put on the backburner while leaders deal with more immediate crises. Many countries which had made net zero pledges are now considering licensing new oil and gas projects - including the UK. At the same time, oil and gas companies are enjoying bumper profits. It has put paid - at least in the short run - to the idea that tumbling renewable energy prices would see the returns on fossil fuel investments collapse. Mr Sharma's message today was that these headwinds must not derail the Glasgow Pact. Leaders have to honour their commitments and show, he said, that the international system is still taking the world towards ""a cleaner, safer and more prosperous future."" Mr Sharma told BBC Scotland that in the final moments of the Glasgow talks ""I genuinely thought there was a point where we weren't going to get a deal"". He said ""we have to be hopeful"" that global temperature rises can be held down, while warning that ""we need to act now"". Ms Sturgeon also highlighted her fears about the climate emergency when she addressed the Brookings Institute in Washington DC. She said: ""Six months on from COP26, the world looks very different, but many of the challenges we faced then remain. ""As things stand, the world is on course to exceed both 1.5C of global warming and the 2C threshold - and scientific consensus is overwhelming that this will be catastrophic. ""We need to move at pace to develop clean energy sources and act in a way which shows solidarity with communities in our countries who might otherwise get left behind, and with the global south."" Nicola Sturgeon is focusing on climate change as part of her trip to the US Last weekUS climate envoy John Kerrysaid the war in Ukraine had not wrecked the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed in November. Both Mr Sharma and Ms Sturgeon referenced the Russian invasion, with the Scottish first minister saying it is ""forcing countries in Europe to rethink long-held assumptions about energy policy and energy security"". And Mr Sharma highligted the ""danger of energy systems powered by foreign fossil fuel"", calling instead for a focus on ""low cost home grown renewables the price of which cannot be manipulated from afar"". According to a UN report,the world is on track to warm by 3.2C this centuryif countries only follow through on commitments made before the Glasgow summit. This would lead to ""unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages"". To avoid that fate, the world must keep the rise in temperatures at or under 1.5C this century, researchers have said, and reach peak CO2 emissions by 2025.

Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information.

The special operation between Ukraine's security forces aims to slow down the advance of Russian troops in the Luhansk region. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the images. We'll turn now to the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, where some Ukrainian fighters are still believed to be holed up - although it's unclear how many. The Deputy Commander of the Azov unit, Sviatoslav Palamar hasposted a video message on Telegram,,externalin which he says: âGlory to Ukraine! It is day 85 of the war. The leadership and I are on the premises of the Azovstal plant. There is a certain operation happening, details of which I am not going to share. I thank the whole world and Ukraine for the support. I will be seeing you.â It is not clear what the operation he refers to is. We will bring you more information if it becomes available. Russia says more than 1,700 fighters from the plant have been taken to Russian-controlled areas since Monday. You canread about what has been happening to them here. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and
strategically. We thank our allies."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT. Asked about Shishimarin at a news briefing on 18 May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovsaid he did not have enough information,externalabout the soldier captured by Ukraine. You can read our correspondent Sarah Rainsford'sstory on the trial here. Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post. At least eight houses have been damaged and rescuers were unable to reach places on fire for two hours because of the shelling, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sweden confirms Nato hopes in historic shiftTraditionally both countries favour neutrality but the shift comes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Europe,"Sweden joining Nato is supported by most of the country's political parties Sweden and Finland have confirmed they will apply for Nato membership in a historic shift that comes as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Sweden, the governing Social Democrats said they backed joining the Western security alliance, paving the way for the country to apply. The announcement came soon after Finland formally announced it too would apply to join the grouping. Russia sees Nato as a security threat and has warned of ""consequences"". Sweden stayed neutral in World War II and for more than two centuries has avoided joining military alliances. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? In a statement, Sweden's Social Democrats said they would ""work toward"" membership, something supported by the public and most opposition parties. A formal application is likely within days. But the Social Democrats added that they were opposed to stationing nuclear weapons or hosting Nato bases. At a subsequent press conference, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said her party believed joining the alliance was ""best for Sweden's and the Swedish people's security"". ""For us Social Democrats, it is clear that the military non-alignment has served Sweden well, but our conclusion is that it won't serve us as well in the future,"" she added. She also said Sweden would be left in a ""vulnerable position"" if it was the only country in the Baltic region that was not a Nato member. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto earlier confirmed his country would apply, calling it a ""historic day"". He spoke to Russia's President Vladmir Putin about the decision, saying he wanted to ""say it straight"". ""I, or Finland, are not known to sneak around and quietly disappear behind a corner,"" he said. Russia's president had previously told Finland it would be a ""mistake"" to join Nato, which was founded in 1949 to counter the threat from the Soviet Union. President Putin mentioned Ukraine's intention to join the alliance as one of the reasons for the invasion. The Social Democrats chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. The announcement isn't surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in favour, with just months to go until Sweden's next general election. Still there are some within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyone's convinced it makes military aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation that's used to staying out of major global conflicts. Foreign ministers of Nato countries, who are meeting in Berlin, have pledged to provide security guarantees for both Finland and Sweden while their bids to join Nato are being ratified by all member states - a process that can take up to a year. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said there could not be a ""transition period, a grey zone, where their status is unclear"". Meanwhile both US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said they were confident of overcoming Turkish objections to both Finland and Sweden's membership. Turkey, a Nato member state, accuses both Nordic countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. On Sunday Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ Finland, Nato and Russia Mr Blinken said he had heard strong support for the Nordic countries ""almost across the board"" and he had held talks with his Turkish counterpart - ""If that's [joining Nato] what they choose to do, I'm very confident that we will reach consensus on that,"" he said. Mr Niinisto has said he is ready to hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish media reported. Both Sweden and Finland have Kurdish communities, and in Sweden's case some parliamentarians have Kurdish origins. Turkey has not provided proof that these communities have links with the PKK.

'Bodies everywhere' - Witnesses tell of attack horror,"Witnesses to a racially-motivated attack at a New York state supermarket have been describing the horrific moment an 18-year-old white man pulled out a gun and began a shooting spree that left 10 people dead. The attacker, dressed in military gear, drove into the car park at Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo at about 2.30pm (19:30 BST) and began livestreaming his rampage via a camera on his helmet. ""When I first saw him shooting he shot a woman, he shot a deacon, he shot another woman... and then he went in the store and he started shooting again,"" eyewitness Grady Lewis told reporters. Katherine Crofton, a retired firefighter and doctor,told the local paper,externalshe had been playing with her dog and smoking a cigarette when she heard a shot from her front porch. ""I didn't see him at first, I turned around and I saw him shoot this woman,"" she said. ""She was just going into the store. And then he shot another woman. She was putting groceries into her car. I got down because I did not know if he was going to shoot me."" Ten killed in racially motivated attack at US supermarket FBI hate crime reports spike to 12-year high in 2020 US gun culture in seven charts The suspected gunman has been identified in court documents as Payton Gendron, of Conklin, New York. Of the 13 people shot, police said 11 were black. The authorities say it was a racially motivated attack in what is a predominantly black neighbourhood. Inside the ""packed"" supermarket, operations manager Shonell Harris told Buffalo News she was putting out groceries when the shooting happened. ""I heard a noise, and then it got louder and closer, and everybody started running"", she said. The gunman was arrested after the shootings outside the Tops Friendly Market store A small vigil is set up across the street to the crime scene Hearing the gunshots, Ms Harris said she made for the back exit, and ran around to the front of the store to look for her daughter, who was also working inside the supermarket. At the front of the store, she said she saw the gunman, clothed ""like he was dressed for the army"", shoot another person. She then ran back around to the back exit, where she found her daughter. ""I just grabbed her, I hugged her,"" she said. ""It's like a nightmare... you see this on TV, you hear about it on TV... but I never thought I would be one of them."" Three people were shot dead in the car park and the other seven were killed inside the supermarket, police said. As the shooter entered the store, a security guard named by local media as Aaron Salter - a retired police officer - fired multiple shots, but the gunman's bulletproof vest stopped one that hit him, police said. He then killed the guard and stalked through the store firing at other people. The local paper has named two others who died in the attack - supermarket customers Ruth Whitfield and Katherine Massey. A vigil was held for Ms Whitmore, 86, on Saturday night. A church deacon who worked as a driver was also killed, Buffalo News reports. Jennifer Tookes, who had been shopping in the store with her cousin when the shooting started, told NBC News that her cousin had hidden in the supermarket's freezer until the gunfire stopped. Ms Tookes added that she saw three bodies lying outside the car park when she escaped outside: ""One was right by the door. One man was by his car. Another girl was right there."" Ken Stephens, a member of a local anti-violence group who was at the scene, told the New York Times: ""Bodies were everywhere."" This video can not be played Watch: Mayor speaks of pain in wake of deadly shooting Witness Katherine Crofton said that after the shootings inside the supermarket, the gunman came outside. ""The guy walked out of the store, the cops were just screaming at him, and he just stood there,"" she said. ""It was like he wanted them to shoot him."" The attacker was arrested by police and has been charged with first-degree murder. Afterwards, local residents gathered at the scene. Among them was Marilyn Hanson, 60, who told The New York Times she had raced to the store after hearing the news to make sure her daughter, who lived nearby, was not hurt. Finding her safe, Ms Hanson - who shops at the store often - said: ""My daughter was so scared because that could've been me in that store."" ""If a black man did this, he'd be dead, too,"" she added, referring to the fact that the suspect had surrendered and had been taken into custody by police. A member of the local government council, Ulysees Wingo Sr, said most of the shoppers at the supermarket were black and that he knew some of the victims. ""This is the largest mass shooting to date in the city of Buffalo,"" he told reporters. ""I don't think anyone here in the city of Buffalo thought that something like this could ever happen, would ever happen."" Saturday's attack in Buffalo is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022, and will also further inflame the bitter political battle about gun control in the US. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides. Meanwhile, hate crimes in the US hit a 12-year high in 2020, with over 10,000 people reporting offences related to their race, gender, sexuality, religion or disability. Crimes against Asian and black Americans in particular surged that year, FBI figures suggest - although as police are not mandated to submit hate crime data to the FBI, those numbers are thought likely to be an undercount.
