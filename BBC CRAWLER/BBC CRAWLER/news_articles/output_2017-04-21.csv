'A hugely popular figure in the game',"Ehiogu celebrates with Aston Villa fans after reaching the final of the 1996 League Cup at the expense of Arsenal. Ehiogu won the trophy three times in his career - 1994, 1996 and 2004 Ugo Ehiogu, who has died at the age of 44 after suffering a cardiac arrest, was not just a highly accomplished and successful defender who was forging a growing reputation as a coach - he was a hugely popular figure within the game. The reaction to hisdeath after collapsing at Tottenham's training centre,the club where he was an under-23s coach, is a reflection of the esteem in which Ehiogu was held. Ehiogu was a powerful, imposing figure as a player and a well-rounded character away from the game, making a career in the music business while also shaping the future of the next generation at Spurs. He was a player who should have won many more than his four England caps - but still enjoyed a fine career and seemed destined for more success in the next stage of his development as an important member of the Spurs backroom team before his death. England boss Southgate ""stunned"" by death of long-time team-mate Ron Atkinson was one of Ehiogu's biggest champions and can regard the Â£40,000 it took to take the teenager from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa in August 1991 as one of his most astute moves in the market. Ehiogu was raw but the potential was there and even through some uneasy early moments in his career, Atkinson dismissed the doubters and never wavered in his belief that the Homerton-born powerhouse - a product of the Senrab Football Club that could count the likes of John Terry, Sol Campbell and Jermain Defoe among its former players - would be a success. And his judgement, both in making the bargain deal and mapping out Ehiogu's future, was accurate. Current Villa manager Steve Bruce, who played against Ehiogu for Manchester United, said: ""Big Ron bought him and what a bargain. He was a great player.""

He formed one half of a formidable central defensive partnership with Paul McGrath, whose brilliance and experience aided his development, and also played in the Villa rearguard alongside England manager Gareth Southgate. The trio were part of the Villa team that won the League Cup at Wembley in March 1996 with a 3-0 victory over Leeds United, cementing his status with the Holte End, who regarded him as a reassuring and inspirational presence in the side throughout more than 200 appearances. Andy Townsend, who played in that League Cup-winning side, says: ""Like all younger players it wasn't easy for him at the start of his Villa career - but in the end you saw that nobody was going to get the better of him. ""He was a commanding and formidable in the air, a player that every team would like to have at the back."" Ehiogu was alongside Southgate when Villa lost the 2000 FA Cup final - the last played under Wembley's Twin Towers - 1-0 to Chelsea and the pair were to link up once again at Middlesbrough. That showpiece was Ehiogu's last fling with Villa as he soon moved on to fresh pastures and a glorious, unexpected new chapter in his career. Ehiogu spent nearly a decade at Aston Villa after joining them for Â£40,000 from West Brom in 1991. When he left in 2000 he had played 237 league games for the club. Middlesbrough signed many outstanding players during Bryan Robson's reign as manager - and Ehiogu can take his place near the top of the list following his move from Villa to Teesside for a then club record fee of Â£8m in October 2000. Boro chairman Steve Gibson was prepared to bankroll the acquisition of high-profile, high-quality signings and Ehiogu fell perfectly into that category as the expenditure was rewarded with performances that ensured he will always be fondly remembered at the Riverside. He did start to suffer with the knee problems that would undermine the latter days of his career but it was at Boro where his friendship with Southgate continued to blossom, first as team-mates when the latter made the same journey from Villa as Steve McClaren's first signing as manager in July 2001, and then when Southgate took over as manager. The old defensive firm was soon back in action and providing the platform of solidity, experience and ability that culminated in both playing key roles as Boro won their first major trophy in 128 years with a 2-1 in over Bolton Wanderers at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium in the 2004 Carling Cup final. It was a Boro side laced with quality players, such as Gaizka Mendieta and Juninho. Mark Schwarzer was their outstanding keeper and he remembers the cool colleague who exuded authority, saying: ""He was always calm and reassuring. He was not too vocal but spoke when he needed to speak. He was a completely dedicated footballer."" Boro entered the uncharted waters of European glory to reach the 2006 Uefa Cup final, but it was to provide a signal that Ehiogu's time at his peak was drawing to a close. They were thrashed 4-0 by Sevilla in Eindhoven and he was only an unused substitute. As at Villa, Ehiogu will be associated with success at Boro and chairman Gibson delivered a warm tribute when he said: ""Ugo was one of the heroes at Cardiff when the club won its only ever major trophy, Ugo and Gareth Southgate were the rock on which Steve McClaren brought the club the best period in its history. ""He wasn't just a good footballer. He was a great man."" Ehiogu left Villa for Middlesbrough for a then club-record fee of Â£8 million in 2000 Ehiogu won only four England caps, a victim of injuries and the sheer quality of competition from the likes of John Terry, Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell - but he still played his part in a piece of history. He was named as a substitute by Sven-Goran Eriksson - the side's first foreign manager - for his first game in charge against Spain at Villa Park on 28 February 2001, scoring after coming on. Ehiogu also gave away a penalty but keeper Nigel Martyn saved Javi Moreno's spot-kick.

He was still not prepared to go quietly, however, and revived memories of his glory days with a goal that ensured he will be remembered forever at Ibrox, a spectacular overhead kick that gave Rangers a 1-0 derby win against Celtic in March 2007. It was voted 'goal of the season' by Rangers fans and the surprised goalscorer smiled as he said: ""I couldn't have written a better script. It was probably my best goal ever. A surreal moment."" Once again, the towering defender had made his presence and personality felt when it mattered. This video can not be played Archive: Ugo Ehiogu's winning goal for Rangers against Celtic in 2007 As he moved into coaching at Spurs, initially working at the Premier League club's academy under Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood, Ehiogu's love of music started to play a greater role in his life. The man who admitted he ""used to get psyched up to a bit of Bon Jovi before games"" helped set up Dirty Hit, a record label with the likes of The 1975, Ben Khan, Superfood and Fossil Collective on its books. It was the mark of a personality who enjoyed life and pursued wider interests outside football. He said: ""My love of football is massive but my love of music is amazing. You have people eating out of your hands when you're singing."" Ehiogu was a musical mentor as well as a wise counsel and guide to the young players at Spurs. He was a distinguished man as a player and coach in a career carried out with professionalism, dignity, respect and success.

The couple who want to rebuild their shattered city,"Someday, what seems like Syria's forever war will end. Then the focus will shift to rebuilding a country shredded and scarred by conflict. A husband and wife, both architects, who witnessed their city's devastation are already thinking about how to restore it. ""It's not easy to rise from the ruins, it's not easy,"" reflects Marwa al-Sabouni. We're standing in the cool dark depths of ahammam- a public bath dating back to Roman times in the old quarter of Homs. Its thick stone walls are now rough blotches of black and brown, dappled by shafts of light streaming through holes in a domed ceiling designed to draw light into this ancient warren. The history within these walls is even darker. ""This was a major battleground,"" Sabouni explains as we walk through the hammam's main chamber, with what remains of a water fountain at its centre. The debris of recent battles has been slowly cleared since two years of fierce clashes in the Old City area ended in 2014 when the government took back what had been a rebel-held enclave of Syria's third city. ""So many of us didn't even know this beautiful hammam, and so many other parts of our heritage, existed before the war,"" Sabouni says. ""It was neglected and then destroyed before we had to chance to know it."" Sabouni has taken me on a walk to illustrate some of the main ideas in her acclaimed book, The Battle for Home. An evocative memoir of her family's experience of living through a punishing war in their city, it's also an architect's vision of how to rebuild Syria to help mend its wounds and avoid errors of the past. One of her biggest allies is fellow architect Ghassan Jansiz - who happens to be her husband. Their ideas about architecture brought them together as students. They remained with their two young children in a city which saw some of the first protests and the most vicious fighting of the war. This 2,000-year-old hammam is our first stop on Sabouni's itinerary as we set out to explore the souk, a sprawling market that was once the vibrant heart of the Old City. Its labyrinth of alleyways is still largely deserted with most shops shuttered, or shattered by the gunfire and explosions. Syria's destructive conflict has been fuelled by many faultlines. Sabouni says architecture is one of them. ""Of course, I'm not saying that architecture is the only reason for the war, but in a very real way it accelerated and perpetuated the conflict,"" she explains. Her book chronicles the rise, over the past century, of soulless tower blocks and urban sprawls that effectively created sectarian ghettos and eroded shared public spaces which had long shaped Syrian society. Sabouni sees the built environment as a crucible for the frictions that led to civil war. A meander through Homs's old market is also a journey further back in time, through thousands of years of Syrian history and successive empires that left their mark. In this rich story, Sabouni finds lessons for a more inspired and inclusive way of living. Marwa al-Sabouni with Lyse Doucet ""Certain architectural elements from different eras are all incorporated within the same structures and they don't cancel each other out,"" she explains as she leads me to what she calls a ""hidden house."" A long dimly lit corridor leads into an exquisite courtyard with leafy fruit trees dotted with oranges. A sudden burst of bright colour surprises, as a small symbol of renewal. ""You see, this is what I talk about in the book,"" Sabouni exclaims. ""We had something very beautiful, very ancient and very harmonious interwoven in our lives, in our daily lives,"" she says, making her point that Syria's precious world heritage lies not only in famed sites such as the Roman ruins of Palmyra, but in its everyday social fabric. ""We vandalised a lot of it, and we mistreated a lot of it, so maybe we have the chance to start over now."" In another corner of the market, Jansiz shows me another hammam dating from the days of the Ottoman empire. Its vaulted ceilings with intricate patterns of holes creates a dance of circles of light on the stone walls and floor. But it's a pattern of light caused by damage rather than design which provides a small example of how to build from the ruins. The market's metal roofs - punctured by bullets and shrapnel - inspired Jansiz's work on the first rebuilding project in the Old City funded by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). On the day we visit, the project is a hive of activity. Workmen in blue overalls are putting the finishing touches on the new patterned screen now arching over the alleyway at one of the market's main entrances. ""Rebuilding is not just about stones,"" explains Jansiz, who was the lead architect on the first phase of the project. ""This market wasn't just a place to sell and buy stuff. It was also a social hub where people from all social and religious groups would spend time with each other."" A roof designed by Ghassan Jansiz Both Jansiz and Sabouni underline how the damage to Syria's social fabric is far deeper even than the endless ruins in pulverised neighbourhoods. ""All the workers you see around you are from Homs,"" Jansiz adds. ""They understand this city and understand its pain."" The long arcades of shuttered shops bear silent testimony to this aching sense of loss. Only about 30 out of nearly 5,000 have reopened. Some shopkeepers can't afford to rebuild, or await electricity and other services. Some sided with the rebels and were forced to flee, and are now unable or unwilling to return. With still no end in sight to this war, major Western donors still resist putting money for reconstruction into areas now back in government hands. ""So far we're only focusing on limited rebuilding to provide some support and a bit of hope,"" UNDP Country Director Samuel Rizk tells me. But the EU recently began to carefully raise the prospect of reconstruction funds, if and when a hesitant process of political talks with the opposition makes significant progress. And a Chinese delegation was in Damascus this week to discuss future investments in industries and infrastructure. There are already hints of conflicts to come over contracts and concepts for a post-war Syria. Even the first phase of this small project to rebuild a roof in the Old City ended up being clouded by disagreements. Sabouni believes Syrians must begin to imagine a different future. ""It may sound so sophisticated or a luxury to talk about architecture,"" she says. ""But if we don't think about it, I think we will miss the chance to rebuild it in the right way.""

He married his teacher - now he wants to run France," On a cool April night in 2016, a couple of hundred people gathered in a provincial town north of Paris. The guests were mostly the family and friends of the speaker, France’s Economy Minister, Emmanuel Macron. It was a low-key event – the simple room unadorned, the minister’s wife taking notes in the front row. “It felt like being at a wedding,"" according to one account - “a small room, emotion, a speech”. In fact, it was a birth. After holding forth for an hour on the future of French industry and employment, Macron delivered the message he’d come to convey - the launch of a new political movement, En Marche! (On The Move!) It was a bold move for a man working at the heart of France’s Socialist government. Brought in to politics by Francois Hollande, Macron was seen as the president’s political protégé, perhaps destined for greatness in the future. Few had any inkling he would make a bid for it so soon. And so, that night in Amiens, there were no flags to herald the new movement, no TV cameras, no campaign leaflets. Yet, in less than a year, its young leader overtook the country’s established politicians to become the front-runner in France’s presidential race - the most rapid political coming-of-age modern France had ever seen. “In months, he went from child to teenager, and teenager to adult,” says Alain Minc, a mentor and close associate who advised Macron on his political career. “I have known him intimately for 15 years, but I'm quite surprised how quickly he learns politics,” Minc says. “He's a cat - you throw him through the window and he manages to fall on his feet.” But politics wasn’t always Emmanuel’s Macron’s ambition. At school in Amiens, he wanted to be a novelist. He had a reputation as a brilliant, precocious boy, remembers Antoine Marguet, his class-mate from the private Jesuit school, La Providence. Macron read classic French literature, he said, and wrote poems, and a novel featuring Spanish conquistadors. “Emmanuel Macron has always been different,” recalls Marguet. “At an age when most people only watch TV, he just read. He was the teacher’s equal in some ways. [He had] an Olympic intelligence – each time further, higher, faster. Everyone who came across him knew at the time that he was somebody extraordinary - that he was different.” Someone who certainly saw him that way was Brigitte Trogneux, his drama teacher. “He wasn’t like the others,” she told a French documentary last year, “he wasn’t a teenager. He had a relationship of equals with other adults.” Macron attended La Providence school in Amiens One day, she remembers, he came to her with plans to write a play together for her final year drama class. “I didn’t think it would go very far,” she said. “I thought he would get bored. We wrote, and little by little I was totally overcome by the intelligence of this boy.” At 16, Macron left Amiens to finish his schooling in Paris, vowing to marry his former teacher. “We’d call each other all the time and spend hours on the phone,” she remembered. “Bit by bit, he defeated all my resistance, in an amazing way, with patience.” Brigitte Trogneux was 24 years older than Macron, and married with three children. But she left her husband, and began a relationship with her former pupil. The couple married in 2007. It’s an unusual love story that reveals a lot about Macron’s determination and self-belief, says Anne Fulda, author of a new book on his rise. Macron told her that he had “fought to live his life.  It wasn’t easy, wasn’t the most obvious and automatic of lives; it didn’t match the established way of doing things.” For years, the couple avoided publicity, Fulda says, but there was a subtle shift after Emmanuel Macron launched his presidential bid: He wants to give the idea that, if he was able to seduce a woman 24 years his senior and a mother of three children, in a small provincial town... despite opprobrium and mockery, he can conquer France in the same way."" Courtesy: Paris Match When En Marche was launched in April 2016, it was mocked by some in the establishment as a naive, flabby idea that was doomed to fail. One fellow minister marked the launch by posting a wry link on social media to a song titled I Walk Alone. But Emmanuel Macron wasn’t alone for long. En Marche recruited more than 200,000 members, though joining the movement costs nothing and doesn’t require supporters to give up their membership of other political parties. And as his movement grew, so did speculation that he would announce his bid for the presidency. The roots of Macron’s decision to run for president stretch back decades, and are covered by thick foliage of his own making - story-telling, image and myth. But Alain Minc is in no doubt that his protégé has “always” seen himself heading for the top job. I'll tell you the first words I exchanged with him 15 years ago... I [asked him] ‘what will you be in 20 years from now?' Macron answered: ‘I'll be president’. ” “I did my best to convince him to run in 2022,” Minc says, “and he told me: ‘You are wrong, there is an opportunity [now].’” In fact, says political writer Marc Endeweld, author of The Ambiguous Mr Macron, “everything was all ready to go from the autumn of 2015”. It was only because of the November 2015 attacks, and then the Brussels attacks in March 2016, that Macron waited to launch his movement until April, he says. Aftermath of the 2015 Paris attacks Mathieu Laine was one of a small coterie of people around Emmanuel Macron urging him to run. “We made something extraordinary,” he says. “At the beginning, we were maybe four people around him. Emmanuel is very focused and he loves collective intelligence. It was step-by-step - he didn’t just one day arrive at this idea.” When I get through to Laine at the offices of his market research company in London, he’s on the other line to Macron’s team. “I don’t want to say I call Emmanuel more than my fantastic wife,” he jokes when we finally speak, “but he’s number two! We exchange around 15 texts a day.” Macron with President Hollande He says the timing of Macron’s bid for the presidency was heavily influenced by his experience in President Francois Hollande’s government. As economy minister, Macron was embroiled in a struggle to push through a series of liberal economic reforms, nicknamed the Loi Macron (Macron Law). But divisions in the governing Socialist party and resistance in the National Assembly left him disillusioned. “His legs were broken by the system,” says Mathieu Laine. I remember telling him at the time - there’s only one job where you can reform the country, and that’s president of the Republic. I pushed him a lot to do it.” Macron faced public opposition to his economic policies In December 2015, Laine wrote an opinion piece for the weekly news magazine, Le Point, calling on Macron to run in the 2017 presidential race. It was the first public shot in the campaign. The scales tipped, he says, the following summer. The timing was right. And in November 2016, Macron announced his candidacy for president of France. The vibe at Camp Macron is more Silicon Valley than central Paris. Primary colours dominate, T-shirts form the backbone of the uniform, bunk-beds stand ready to catch exhausted volunteers, most of whom are under 30. On the wall behind Raphael Coulhon, part of the finance team, is a hand-drawn cartoon of Macron as Superman. “I put that up,” he laughs. It's not a personality cult, but that said, it's true that we all believe in him, his ideas. We're all behind him.” Macron has repeatedly said he wants to create a new kind of politics. And with no established party structure to rely on, the loyalty of willing supporters is key. “This movement is only what we make it,” runs the call to arms of En Marche. “From the first day, it depends on the involvement of each one of us.” Strong personal appeal is also useful when you’re trying to bridge deep ideological divides, like that between France’s left- and right-wing parties. But all political movements need ideas to unite behind. Macron’s personal charisma might have helped to launch his movement, but his challenge was to come up with a political programme that could appeal to centrists from both left and right. Before drawing up any policies – or even any concrete principles – Macron’s campaign carried out a nationwide door-to-door campaign, interviewing voters individually on their attitudes and complaints. “In general when you want to write a [political] programme, you call the experts,” explains Guillaume Liegey, founder of an electoral consulting firm that works with En Marche. “Experts are very smart, but it's good to have input from the field and that's what En Marche provided.” The Grande Marche (Great Walkabout), as it was called, resulted in 25,000 separate and unusually detailed interviews with voters, says Liegey. The origin of this idea “was absolutely the Obama campaign” in 2008, where Liegey earned his own electoral spurs.  The same technology that Liegey and his friends used to gather data on what American voters were thinking back then was adopted by En Marche to analyse their conversations with voters in France. En Marche volunteers asked each voter they met two questions - what works in France, and what doesn’t work? And there were interesting contradictions.  “Many people said schools worked,” Liegey remembers, “but to the question of what doesn’t work, they said the national education system.  They see schools and the system as different. So it doesn’t give you a straightforward solution.” From his first public speech, announcing his intention to run, Macron has made much of his dislike of the system, while presenting himself as “positive” about France itself. I’ve seen inside the vacuum of our political system, which stops the majority of ideas because they might threaten the machine, the traditional parties, vested interests… Our political system is blocked.” When Macron finally did go public with his political programme, it was ridiculed for being too vague, too general – a charge that followed him right through to the last days of the campaign. Macron, his critics say, is for and against everything. Macron's rival for the French presidency, Marine Le Pen In a presidential debate, in the run-up to polling day, his far-right rival Marine Le Pen shook her head and laughed after he finished his contribution, saying: “You know what, Mr Macron, you’re incredibly talented - you’ve managed to speak for seven minutes and I can’t summarise what you think.  You’ve said nothing, it’s an absolute void.” But Liegey says Macron is pragmatic. “I don't think France needs more ideas,” he says. “I think it's a question of methods. If you want to change the country you have to be methodical, you can't just say ‘I'm going to do it’.  You need a plan.” You also need a bit of luck, and Macron has been lucky in several ways. A large part of his rise can be traced to the struggles of France’s two established parties - the governing Socialists, and the centre-right Republicans. Both are battling declining appeal amid an electorate weary of the old political to-and-fro, with what many see as little real change. Division and lethargy have dogged the Socialist Party for years, while gloom hung over the centre-right Republicans party since their candidate, Francois Fillon, became embroiled in a damaging financial scandal. Francois Fillon That disillusionment with established parties is something Macron – and his far-right rival Marine Le Pen – played on heavily. And it worked. Macron cannibalised the Socialist Party’s support, and won over some high-profile figures, including the former prime-minister Manuel Valls, once seen as a bitter enemy. Macron and Valls pictured in 2016 Macron took many people by surprise, says political writer Marc Endeweld, because France has a “completely gerontocratic political system, and for these old plutocrats, the idea that a young, ambitious man of 39 would have presidential ambitions seemed so crazy, it was unbelievable.” Where once the young candidate was loudly ridiculed as a “champagne bubble” liable to pop, with no established party behind him and no previous electoral experience, there’s now a stunned silence. He’s bold, he takes risks, he’s a gambler.” But Macron has also been lucky, he says, that popular centrist figures like the Republican Alain Juppe and the Socialist Manuel Valls lost their party primaries to more hard-line rivals, leaving a broad swathe of space in the centre of French politics empty for the taking. “I told him he must have a contract with God, to have so much luck over the past few months,” Minc says. “Two weeks ago, we had dinner, and I asked him whether it was an indefinite contract. He said, ‘yes’. That’s important. He took a risk, and it isn’t finished.” Macron’s long-awaited manifesto was launched one spring morning, in a glitzy meeting hall off the Champs-Elysees. Inside, with sunlight dancing through the French windows, smartly-dressed waiters served orange juice and coffee to queues of waiting journalists. The launch was days after the Hollywood film La La Land won several Oscars, sparking a snide new nickname for Emmanuel Macron - “Bla-Bla-Land”. All talk, no policies. But instead, his manifesto seemed to offer policies for everyone - help for farmers, for industry, for employers, for workers, for entrepreneurs. Tax cuts alongside support for those on low incomes. Spending cuts nestling next to €50bn of public investment. He bounded onto the stage and spoke at length about his proposals. “People will ask if it’s a programme of the left or the right,” he said. “I want it to be a programme that brings France into the 21st Century.” Macron on the EU: A smiling Macron had promised to answer every single question from the hundreds of journalists packed into the hall. Three hours in, a French journalist brought up Macron’s past as an investment banker, questioning whether he was capable of attracting working-class votes. It prompted a vehement tirade from the En Marche leader against the idea that he was part of a privileged elite. “I was born in a provincial town, in a family that had nothing to do with the world of journalists, politicians or bankers,” he expostulated, clearly annoyed. I climbed the ranks with the help of school. I made my choices and I took all the risks… It’s with a lot of pride that I say I am the candidate of the working and middle classes.” Macron can be sensitive about his background. The story he tells about himself is of a boy from outside the establishment, who rose to prominence through merit and hard work. “My grandparents were a teacher, railway worker, social worker, and bridges and roadways engineer, all came from modest backgrounds.” Alternative views on his roots and his rise can sometimes appear unwelcome. “The fact that you worked for a bank and earned money is not such a bad thing in the UK,” explains his friend Mathieu Laine. “In France, it’s different. He always has to explain that it’s not bad to have worked in the private sector. It’s always the same question. But I agree with you that he doesn’t control his emotions. He’s very polite, but he can have some intensity.” Liberal economic reform, of the kind Macron advocates, is a divisive issue in France. Left-wing stalwarts, including many of the unions, fiercely oppose making it easier for companies to hire and fire staff, set salaries, or extend working hours. Macron has not done well with blue-collar workers, while his far-right rival Marine Le Pen was always going to perform well with that section of the vote. Reacting to her former colleague’s proposals, a senior member of the Socialist Party, Martine Aubry, exploded: “Up until now, Emmanuel Macron thought that being launched as a new product with a sparkling smile would be enough to be elected president. And I always say… when things are vague, there’s a wolf. Now that we’ve seen his programme it’s not a wolf we’re dealing with, but a pack of wolves.” His economic programme, said Aubry, “takes up the liberal agenda of the Anglo-Saxons in the 1980s. It’s about reducing public services, reducing deficits, and for workers to work more and be paid less.” There are plenty of centre-left Socialists who agree with the need for economic reform, and Macron has described himself as “a man of the left”, but mentor Alain Minc says there is something different about what he’s offering. “He's a leftist liberal, and that is new in French politics,” he says. “There has been a social democrat wing in the Socialist Party but he believes much more in the strengths of the market.” Tony Blair “He's a Blairist,” he concludes. “He's Tony Blair's son.” Some would argue that he went further than the former British prime minister, in the later stages of his campaign, in an attempt to win over right-wing voters. But cross-party appeal has never been easy. In order to try and pass his economic reforms, during his time as minister, Emmanuel Macron turned to right-wing MPs for help. “It was a nightmare for him,” says his friend Mathieu Laine. “A lot of these [right wing] MPs said, ‘Oh, the Loi Macron is a very good bill, but as it comes from the left, we won’t vote for it’. It was the beginning of the idea, among our very small group, that we should break this way of doing politics.” For Macron, politics in France is no longer a battle between right and left ideology, but one between protectionism and globalisation. His staunchest adversary is not the Socialist Party he deserted, nor the Republican Party of Francois Fillon, but the closed-border, anti-liberal policies of Marine Le Pen. Macron talks about Marine Le Pen: And nothing divides him and Le Pen more strongly than the issue of Europe. Macron is alone among the candidates in being enthusiastically pro-EU. “He's European in the way his generation is,” says Minc. “It’s not so much about the weight of the war or [the EU] as an instrument of peace, it's natural. He belongs to the new generation. And I think he will change the way our partners are looking to France.” Questions of immigration, culture and national identity have risen to the fore in this campaign, and in his “contract with the nation”, published at the manifesto launch in Paris, Macron lists education as his top priority – “the source of our national cohesion”. Teachers have played a crucial role in Macron’s life and career. Well before he married his own drama teacher, there was another woman teacher he adored - his maternal grandmother, Manette. “She helped me believe in my political destiny,” Macron told biographer, Anne Fulda. His grandmother was “demanding and determined”, Fulda wrote in her account of Macron’s life. “She wasn’t indulgent. She opened the door to reading and culture for him.” Macron would call his grandmother every night, Fulda says, whether he was working at Rothschild, or for the government. His father, by contrast, said he saw Macron just once a year during his time in the government. He’s always needed women to speak to,  first his grandmother, now [his wife] Brigitte.” As well as influencing his thinking, Emmanuel Macron’s grandmother gave him something else - solid working-class credentials. Manette’s own mother had been illiterate, and the story of her great-grandson making it to the Elysee Palace is a romantic tale – far more romantic than the tale of a neurologist’s son who ran for president after a stint in an investment bank. Macron has often spoken about the close bond he had with his grandmother, talking about her in his book and in interviews, to the extent that his parents have somewhat faded from the picture. “If you read some articles, Emmanuel doesn’t have a family!” his mother Francoise Nogues Macron told the biographer Anne Fulda. “That’s something I don’t take well at all.” “It was a provincial, bourgeois family life, with parents who worked a lot but gave their children a reassuring and protective cocoon.” [It was] a pretty traditional family, nothing like the wonderful, fantastical world drawn up by Emmanuel where only his grandmother seemed to exist.” Macron’s political image is built around the idea that he is outside the system, not part of France’s established political class - his provincial roots and illiterate great-grandmother presented in contrast to a privileged Parisian elite. But Macron’s parents were both doctors, his school in Amiens was private, and at 16 he headed to Paris to attend one of France’s most prestigious schools, Lycee Henri IV, before graduating from the central clearing-house for French leaders, the Ecole Nationale d’Adminstration. Once out of college, he regularly met with France’s king-makers and political elites, and became wealthy while working as an investment banker at Rothschild. So can he truly be described as the anti-establishment candidate? “It would be a little outrageous to say it,” admits Alain Minc. “He's anti-political system, but he's the best product of the French system. The system gives a chance to newcomers - like Georges Pompidou, Raymond Barre, Robert Badinter, Jacques Delors - but he took it more quickly and with a sense of gamble the others did not have.” The sense of Macron as a gambler comes up regularly among those who know him, along with frequent descriptions of him as clever and charming. “He’s extremely smart,” says Mathieu Laine, “At the same time he’s someone very human, with a lot of empathy. Very positive and generous in relationships.” Antoine Marguet He knows how to make you feel you’re the most important person in the world.” At rallies, Macron seems to give himself completely to the moment - hoarse with emotion, almost Messianic, he shouts into the auditorium, head thrown back, arms wide, telling his political fans that he loves them, that he needs them beside him. It’s rock-star politics. But in an interview with Anne Fulda, his wife Brigitte hinted at another side to Macron. Nobody enters his perimeter. He keeps people at a distance.” Then there’s the story of how Macron handled his departure from President Hollande’s government, in order to launch a presidential bid of his own. According to the daily newspaper, Le Monde, two days before launching En Marche, Macron took the president aside at the Elysee Palace and told him “as if it were nothing” – “Oh by the way, I wanted to tell you: I’m doing a thing in Amiens on 6 April. I’m launching a youth movement, a sort of think tank.” Macron with President Francois Hollande “He reached that day the peak of his duplicity,” a former adviser told the paper. “It’s what I call the ambiguity of Emmanuel Macron. There’s political ambiguity, but ambiguity also in his relations with other people, including powerful people.” “He plays a game of smoke and mirrors with the president,” Endeweld says. “Like a snake, he lets him go to sleep, and Francois Hollande didn’t want to face up to reality. You have to understand that Macron is the narcissistic projection of the son Hollande would like to have had. He was politically seduced by Macron.” “I think he’s someone who’s very hard and determined behind the amiable and seductive facade,” Fulda concludes. Like a lot of intelligent people, he gets bored easily. He likes the seduction and the chase, but once he has it, he wants to move on to something else.” Macron believes strongly in his own powers of persuasion. He talks to everyone, smiling for selfies, ready to debate with both friends and adversaries, and during his time as economy minister, famously walked out of a meeting with students in Herault to engage with protesters shouting outside. They were demonstrating against the economic reforms Macron was trying to pass. Macron, as one French paper put it, “lost first his smile, and then his temper”. “I can’t afford a suit like yours,” one of the protesters said to him. “You don’t scare me with your T-shirt,” Macron shot back. “The best way to afford a suit is to work.” French railway workers march to protest against labour laws, June 2016 There were several such cracks in Macron’s smooth exterior during his presidential campaign. Two months before the first round of the election, he caused uproar by saying that French actions in the Algerian War of Independence constituted a “crime against humanity”. The Algerian War of Independence, 1954-62, is still a controversial topic in France The same month, he sparked protest among left-wing voters by saying that those who had demonstrated against gay marriage had been “humiliated”. Moments like this appear to some as unscripted glimpses of the “real” Macron - the gaffes of a young, inexperienced politician. But according to Nicolas Prisette, the author of a book on Macron, they are instead carefully calculated to appeal to various parts of his support. “The extreme left is delighted about these adventures, which have the added virtue of consolidating the sympathies of some right-wing voters,” he writes. Macron attacks the totems of the left, and seduces the electorate of the right.” It’s not always easy to separate the storytelling from the substance when it comes to Emmanuel Macron. An investment banker who launches a grassroots movement; a product of the establishment who runs as an anti-system candidate; a private man who seems open to everyone, but needs no one. “He’s complex,” his school friend Marguet says. “I don’t think there is a ‘real’ Emmanuel Macron.” From the very first days of En Marche, Emmanuel Macron has created the sense that everyone has a stake in his rise, and that the levers of power will be collectively and democratically pulled. The creed of his new movement has been “we” - politicians and people together, a French echo of Obama’s successful 2008 motto, “yes we can”. Half of his cabinet are women, and half of his movement’s National Assembly candidates were women, leading to a record number winning seats. He also ensured that half of his candidates came from outside the political system. But not everyone agrees that a Macron presidency will bring a fresh wind blowing through the Elysee Palace. Political biographer Marc Endeweld says that, despite the mood of what might be described as horizontal democracy, Emmanuel Macron has always been the one with real power: “You have to realise that in the end, En Marche is something very vertical; there isn’t really a campaign manager, Emmanuel Macron has compartmentalised his relations a lot. And he has a conception of power that is extremely personal.” In an interview with a weekly news magazine in July 2015, Macron talked about an “incompleteness” at the heart of French politics. “That absence is the figure of the king,” he said, “which I don’t think the French people fundamentally wanted to die. The Terror [during the French Revolution] dug an emotional, imaginary and collective void - the king isn’t there anymore! We’ve tried to fill that void, to put other people in it… And all we want from the president is for him to occupy that function.” Execution of King Louis XVI, 21 January 1793 Macron has become much more brutal, much more cynical, much more professional, suggests Alain Minc. And when people say he's too young, he'll be a soft president – pah! He'll be very authoritarian, very political, very presidential, very cynical - fortunately. I don't worry at all about that.” Anne Fulda believes this single-mindedness could help him be a good president. “It’s not difficult for him to burn his bridges with people who helped him. He’s used the system very well to his effect, but he wouldn’t have a problem tearing it up.” Protesters march against Macron's economic policies, 2015 Macron’s proposed reforms sparked big demonstrations during his time as economy minister. And he has said he’s determined to stand firm against further disruptions should he win power. After an election as polarised as this one, implementing his proposals may not be easy. Protesters march against Macron's economic policies, 2014 And what critics and supporters alike agree on is that Macron is not adept at dealing with failure. He seems to have had few disappointments in life, barring his failure to pass the entry exam for the Ecole Normale Superieure (one of France's top schools). The business of government is likely to be tough. Macron believes he has found a new political model for France - one that attempts to unite people across an ideological divide that has existed since the Revolution. But bridging this fault-line and sustaining it under pressure was difficult at times during his campaign. Bridging it when in power – most likely without a majority in the National Assembly – could be even tougher. But for Emmanuel Macron, this new way of gathering support is the answer to what he believes is the end of the “ancien regime” in French politics. Marine Le Pen has built her growing appeal on uniting left and right voters behind the promise of a protectionist, populist agenda. He plans to do the same behind an agenda based on globalisation, open borders and free-trade. His coronation as France’s democratic leader marks not just the start of a new presidency, but a new chapter in French politics -the king is dead, long live the king. Built with Shorthand"
Does this court judgment make any sense?,"Did a High Court judge in Himachal Pradesh write his judgment with thesaurus in hand? There are few professions that allow one to be as verbose as a judge. Sometimes, this freedom can result in powerful judgements that weave brilliant legal interpretation with sparkling prose. At other times, legal judgements are so complicated that they make little sense to normal people. In rare times, as happened recently in India, they even bewilder lawyers directly involved in the case. A bemused Supreme Court bench sent back a convoluted judgement from a high court judge in the state of Himachal Pradesh to be re-drafted because it was simply unintelligible. ""We will have to set it aside because one cannot understand this,"" MB Lokur and Deepak Guptawere quoted by the Hindustan Times as saying,externalon 14 April. And what was so complicated aboutthe judgement,external, which ruled in favour of a tenant locked in a years-long battle with a landlord? Here is an extract: ""However, the learned counsel...cannot derive the fullest succour from the aforesaid acquiescence... given its sinew suffering partial dissipation from an imminent display occurring in the impugned pronouncement hereat wherewithin unravelments are held qua the rendition recorded by the learned Rent Controller..."" And more: ""The summum bonum of the aforesaid discussion is that all the aforesaid material which existed before the learned Executing Court standing slighted besides their impact standing untenably undermined by him whereupon the ensuing sequel therefrom is of the learned Executing Court while pronouncing its impugned rendition overlooking the relevant and germane evidence besides its not appreciating its worth. Consequently, the order impugned suffers from a gross absurdity and perversity of misappreciation of material on record."" The lawyer representing the tenant, Aishwarya Bhati, reportedly joked in court that she needed to hire an English professor to understand the convoluted ruling. But the UK-based Plain English Campaign (PEC) said it had seen similar language deployed in the past by judges, though the wording in this case was ""preposterously overblown"". ""There is simply no reason or excuse for it,"" the PEC's Lee Monks told the BBC. ""We've often heard the defence that these are 'legal terms' but that's very often a cop-out. ""The idea that something like '...fullest succour from the aforesaid acquiescence' is at all necessary is ridiculous."" While that may be true, judges in the Indian sub-continent, and elsewhere, clearly enjoy the freedom they have to show off their verbal dexterity and cultural knowledge in judgements - though they usually make more sense. On Thursday, a judgement from Pakistan's Supreme Court ruling that there was insufficient evidence of corruption to remove Nawaz Sharif from the role of prime minister began by mentioning Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, beforequoting 19th Century novelist Honore de Balzac,external, in the original French. Supporters of Nawaz Sharif didn't mind the wordy judgment Back in India, a 268-page Supreme Court judgement last year from Justice Dipak Misrawas particularly verbose,externalin dismissing a challenge to the constitutionality of the criminal offence of defamation brought by Subramanian Swamy, a politician. The judge wrote, in a sentencedescribed,externalby the journalist and former law lecturer Tunku Varadarajan as ""among the worst sentences I've encountered in all my years of reading legal materials"": ""This batch of writ petitions preferred under Article 32 of the Constitution of India exposits cavil in its quintessential conceptuality and percipient discord between venerated and exalted right of freedom of speech and expression of an individual, exploring manifold and multilayered, limitless, unbounded and unfettered spectrums and the controls, restrictions and constrictions, under the assumed power of 'reasonableness' ingrained in the statutory provisions relating to criminal law to reviver and uphold one's reputation"""" But Indian judges, with few exceptions, ""love purple prose which they mistake to be or believe to be Shakespearean English"", says journalist Binoo K John, who wrote a book -  Entry from Backside Only: Hazaar Fundaas of Indian English - about the peculiar use of English in India. ""So considering the long history of such prose, it is not all all embarrassing in India,"" he told the BBC. Meanwhile, at least one High Court judge in England has listened to calls to simplify the language used in judgements. Justice Peter Jacksonpublished a simply-worded ruling last year,externalin a family court case so it could be understood by the children affected by it. He even used an emoji.

Circular runways: Your doubts addressed,"This video can not be played Think again: Will circular runways ever take off? Last month we published a video arguing the case for circular runways at airports, as part of a series called World Hacks. It took off and went viral. The video has had more than 36 million viewson Facebook,externaland generated heated debate on social media - including within the aviation community. Many people are sceptical about the concept. So we decided to hand-pick some of the top concerns and put them straight to the man proposing the idea: Dutch engineer Henk Hesselink. This is what he had to say. Henk Hesseklink: With the banked character of the runway, the wingtips and engines are closer to the ground than currently is the case. But the bank angle is designed such that even the most constrained aircraft (Boeing 747 and Airbus A380) will be able to land. Still, there is less margin for error than is currently the case. Pilots will need automated support for take-off and landing. Henk provided this diagram: Henk responds: As there is no end to the runway, a starting aircraft can keep rolling and come to a stop in a safer way than is currently the case. We will need a safety distance between individual aircraft, which we took into consideration in our trials. Could an aborted takeoff cause problems in a circular runway? We used a runway length of three kilometres for planning purposes and a safety distance between separate aircraft of one kilometre. Henk Hesselink:Obviously, as we are making a turn during the landing,  the  ILS (Instrument Landing System) will not function. But we may be able to use an ILS-system for part of the approach phase, the first part is still straight-in. Either we put a simple form of ILS on each direction of the runway, or we can install a movable ILS-system that will move around the runway, for example on a rail-track . It is a bit far-fetched, I know. Could Instrument Landing Systems be adapted for circular runways? Better would be to use some new approach, like satellite navigation. The current quality of GPS is not sufficient, but new methods are already being investigated. I think developments in this area will move very fast as there is more demand for accurate location information, from trains, cars, drones, etc. Already curved approaches and fixed curves are used in aviation, requiring new navigation systems. Aviation enthusiast Phil Derner raised two big concerns inBusiness Insider magazine,external. Ice and rain will reduce the centrifugal force which circular runways rely on, increasing the stopping distance, he argued. He added: ""What if three airliners are landing, something goes wrong and they abort landings. Their prescribed go-around procedure would likely take them dangerously close to the other aircraft."" Henk responds:Indeed, like on a ""normal"" runway, ice and rain will have an effect on the operation. It is a fact that nowadays runway surfaces are getting better and are becoming more resistant to difficult conditions, and the current concrete absorbs most of the water. We have been thinking about building offices and parking spaces under the runway and the remaining heat could be transferred to the runway, but this is an idea that will need further exploration. Heating of the runway surface is something that is already being applied. Would aborted landings known as 'go-arounds' present a threat to safety? A new system for planning how aircraft move to and from the runway will be necessary. We have designed a system where the air traffic controller is supported by a 'circular' planning tool. This seems strange at first, but is already applied in other fields. The planning will take all safety aspects into account, such as the possibility for a go-around by one or more aircraft simultaneously. Henk replies:A higher speed will be necessary, indeed. Take-off and landing run will increase because of this and the time that an aircraft spends on the runway will be about five to ten seconds longer. Henk:The width of the runway has been extended by another 20 meters for safety. We consider safety a major issue and made calculations on the necessary runway dimensions. Anyway, the ""edge"" of the runway should not be designed as a large wall that airplanes can fall down from. This additional safety distance is also necessary when the airplane lands at a point of the runway where it will be too low and the centrifugal forces will move it to the outside of the track and further outside than its optimal track. We have calculated that the additional 20 meters will suffice for the safety case. We have also calculated that the aircraft will move to its optimal track in just one or two iterations, so no continuous bouncing upwards and downwards will occur. This is confirmed by the tests from the 1960s. In good wind conditions three planes can land and take off simultaneously in Mr. Hesselink's design Henk Hesselink conducts his work from the Netherlands Aerospace Centre and has received funding from the European Commission to research circular runways, leading a consortium of five European research institutes. In response to all the feedback to the video, he wanted to clarify the scope of theproject,external. ""To start with, the idea is a concept and many questions I receive are very directly related to current day operations. We must realize that it will take time before an endless runway can be brought into operation. It is like a concept car in a car exhibition - it will not be implemented exactly like this, but we learn a lot from the ideas, from simulations and, later on, practical tests. If someone one hundred years ago would have said that we would be transporting as many passengers in aircraft as we would in trains, people may have thought , ""a steam engine would never fit in an aircraft made of wood and ropes"".

Could a financial scam be key to bombs?,"The attack against Borussia Dortmund was not carried out by extremists It could have been taken from the plot of a James Bond film. A criminal, desperate to make a quick buck, decides to bomb a bus filled with top-flight football players on their way to one of the club's most important games of the year. In the resulting chaos, shares in the club plummet, and the wrong-doer makes his money and escapes into the night - albeit, potentially chased by 007. But while it may sound like a tale dreamed up by Hollywood scriptwriters, this is actually what police believe happened on 11 April, when the Borussia Dortmund football team were on their way to a Champions League game. Police initially believed the bombing - which left Spanish footballer Marc Bartra needing surgery - was the work of terrorists, helped to that conclusion by a number of letters purportedly written by Islamic extremists left near the site. 'Speculator' charged with bus attack 'Hardest 15 minutes' of footballer's life Instead, it may have been carried out for financial reasons - in a plot akin to something in a Bond film But they soon concluded something was amiss, and turned their attentions to a 28-year-old investor named only as Sergej W, whom they have now charged with attempted murder. It is surely one of the more bizarre accusations of recent times, and raises a number of questions - not least... Yes, in Casino Royale, Bond's nemesis Le Chiffre decided to short sell shares from an aircraft manufacturer in order to fund a terrorist organisation. His plan was to push down the value of the shares by blowing up the company's recently unveiled plane, the largest in the world. In this case, however, the plot failed when Bond foiled it. There are several ways a trader could have made money in this instance. The process used in Casino Royale is known as ""short selling"", and is basically when traders bet on a share price falling to make a quick profit. It involves someone borrowing a long-term investor's shares for a fee, and selling them on to a third party. When the shares fall, the trader quickly buys them back for less money. The stocks are then returned to the long-term investor, who is not worried by the decline because they weren't planning on selling yet anyway. This was also the method used by speculators portrayed in the 2012 film, The Big Short. Here's another explanation - this time with apples - from the BBC's Aaron Heslehurst: This video can not be played The BBC's Aaron Heselhurst explains short-selling through the medium of an apple A second way is by buying ""put options"". A put option on a share or some other asset is a contract which allows an investor to sell the asset at an agreed price. If the market price falls, they can then buy the asset more cheaply and sell it - or exercise the option - at the higher price to whoever sold the option, and pocket the price difference. If the police are proved right, the trader in this case was backing up his bet by ensuring the shares definitely did take the hit, by blowing up a bus. This is almost certainly the first time someone has tried to blow up a football team in order to make money. More usually on the less ethical end of the market, the stock might be pushed over the edge by a few well-placed rumours. It doesn't take much. Indeed, back in 2012, all it took wasa tweet to send share prices plummeting. A hacker broke into the Associated Press Twitter account and claimed then-President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack on the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 150 points as more than 4,000 people retweeted it.

Westminster attack gives playwright pause,"Call the Midwife's Charlotte Ritchie is part of the cast for The Philanthropist The Oscar-winning writer of West End play The Philanthropist contemplated rewriting his 1970 comedy in the wake of last month's Westminster attack. Christopher Hampton was concerned the play's references to a fictional attack on Parliament would be in poor taste. He said: ""I said to Simon Callow, quite seriously, maybe we should change it."" Yet Callow, who directed the revival at London's Trafalgar Studios, said it was ""important"" the play be staged as originally seen. Christopher Hampton won an Oscar for the 1988 film Dangerous Liaisons ""Christopher was perfectly willing to tone it down,"" said the actor and director after the play's opening night on Thursday. ""But I think it's very important there's this big shock in the play, that the characters then completely dismiss."" Lily Cole is also in the play... ... along with Matt Berry and Simon Bird Set in Oxford in the early 1970s, The Philanthropist depicts a group of self-absorbed academics who have little interest in the wider world. The play begins with news that a man armed with a machine-gun has killed the prime minister inside the House of Commons, along with a number of his front bench colleagues. ""The play is about how insulated and cocooned you can be in certain parts of life,"" said Hampton, who won an Academy Award for writing 1988 film Dangerous Liaisons. ""Therefore, I wanted to have bizarre things going on in the outside world."" Simon Bird, who plays lead character Philip, said it had been ""shocking and jarring"" for a real-life attack to occur ""just down the road"" from the play's West End home. ""The content of the play is bizarrely topical,"" said the star of Channel 4 sitcoms The Inbetweeners and Friday Night Dinner. ""It takes place in the backdrop of terrorist attacks and political turmoil, which makes it feel like it was written yesterday."" Four pedestrians were killed last month afterKhalid Masood drove his car along the pavement on Westminster Bridge. He then entered the grounds of the Palace of Westminster and fatally stabbed a police officer before being shot dead. Nicki Minaj's video was partly shot on the south side of the River Thames looking back at Westminster Bridge Pop starNicki Minaj faced criticismon social media this week for including shots of Westminster Bridge and the Palace of Westminster in the video for her song No Frauds. The Trafalgar Studios, formerly known as the Whitehall Theatre, are located a short distance away from where the events of 22 March took place. Last seen in London in 2005, The Philanthropist has traditionally been staged with actors considerably older than the characters they are playing. Thelate Alec McCowenplayed Philip in the original Royal Court production, while Matthew Broderick took the role when it was revived on Broadway in 2009. ""The characters are between 25 and 33, yet in the past they've always cast very skilled actors in their 40s,"" said Hampton. ""This production is different because the cast are the correct age. In a curious way, it feels much more like the play I wrote."" Bird's co-stars include Matt Berry from Channel 4's Toast of London, model turned actress Lily Cole and Call the Midwife cast member Charlotte Ritchie. It was recently revealed thatCall the Midwife is to have its first regular black character- a West Indian nurse whom Ritchie predicted would be ""a very good addition to the cast.""

Jared Kushner: Who is the Trump whisperer?,"This video can not be played What does Jared Kushner want to achieve with his new-found power? Some White House watchers have noted that weekends can be tricky for President Donald Trump. A number of crises have blown up on a Friday and not been sorted out until Sunday. Observers say it's because that's when President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner - an observant Orthodox Jewish man - is off duty, marking the Sabbath. Mr Kushner, the husband of the first daughter, Ivanka, is a power in the land, the crown prince. Because of his semi-public power struggle with Steve Bannon, he's seen as an enemy by the hard, nationalistic right. But what drives him? What does he believe? And how could that change the world? The son-in-law with Donald Trump's ear Kushner to be questioned over alleged Trump-Russia ties Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to lead US federal overhaul Who is the new first family? The provocative conservative commentator and early Trump supporter Ann Coulter - author of Adios, America: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole - told me the suspicion was not personal. ""You can't hire your kids,"" she said. ""They can't be fired, they are more than first among equals. ""It's a Third World thing to get elected and bring in all of you family. ""It's what they do in banana republics."" And this story is all about family, dynasty and destiny. President Trump has placed his family - including Jared Kushner (second right) - at the centre of his administration ""J-Vanka"" - their couple name - provides a soupcon of sophistication, implying smoothly groomed beautiful youths in a court that is more King Midas than Camelot. While Trump Sr starred in the downmarket tabloids, they have been a fixture of the glossy magazines. Last year,Elle Decor gushed about the couple's Upper East Side apartment,external, and its Lindsey Adelman light fixtures and candlesticks by Jeff Zimmermann. The room in black and white - with just a hint of imperial purple - is cool, understated. So are they. In the White House, amid the balding billionaires - and a leader who made vulgarity a virtue - their sleekness stands out. Lizzie Widdicombe, an editor of the New Yorker's Talk of the town,watches them closely,external. ""They both have a noticeable level of polish,"" she says. ""It is often said that Ivanka softens the brash, abrasive image of her father and makes it palatable."" I ask if Jared does the same thing politically. ""That's a great way of putting it,"" says Widdicombe. ""He has been the link to Wall Street, and Rupert Murdoch, who he's cultivated as a close personal friend, so he has emerged as a powerbroker."" The president and his son-in-law are both what's known as ""bridge and tunnel guys"" - President Trump from the outer borough of Queens, Mr Kushner from out-of-state New Jersey, each well versed in making a splash in the magic kingdom of Manhattan, turning grit to glitter using the glamour of gold. And there's a hint of resentment in both of them, sharpened by Mr Kushner's background. He's not just a property billionaire. He's not just the son-in-law of a property billionaire. He is also the son of a property billionaire - a property billionaire who went to jail. Jared Kushner stepped in to run his father, Charlie's, property business after he was sent to prison It was ugly - a family feud that went nuclear. As the row spiralled, Jared's father, Charlie, was jailed for tax evasion and deception. Jared's close friend Ken Kurson, editor of the New York Observer, told me the trauma had been the making of him. ""This is a guy who at 24-25 was made chief executive of a giant sprawling complex company,"" said Kurson. ""He not only handled that in an emergency, but grew the company. ""To step into a world of grizzled real estate guys, treat them with respect but also lead, was a truly astonishing feat."" Gabriel Sherman, who wrote an early profile of Mr Kushner forThe New York Magazine,external, agrees with Ken Kurson's analysis. ""Without question, it is still the defining moment of his life,"" he told me. ""Growing up, the family always thought he would run for political office and become a major figure in America, but much further down the road. ""When Charlie went to prison, Jared was required to start that climb to power at much earlier age. ""That was traumatic, but he also seized his opportunity."" Jared Kushner (left) is said to have clashed with fellow Trump adviser Steve Bannon According to one profile, friends say Jared's father, Charlie, is mostly a charmer - but can also be volcanic and irascible when crossed. Remind you of anyone? ""Charlie is a really aggressive, flamboyant, high-profile figure a lot like Trump,"" says Lizzie Widdicombe. ""Being the son or daughter of a person like that is a very specific experience. Jared is the Trump whisperer."" But what does he whisper? Probably a more pragmatic, more cautious, more mainstream Republican view than President Trump's own. Jared Kushner: Who is the Trump whisperer? One of my sources said he'd reflect the views of his New York friends who ""hate Trump"". To some on the hard right, he is the swamp President Trump promised to drain. Ann Coulter feels the will to power may outweigh any ideology. ""I think he wants to help his father-in-law,"" she says. ""It'll be embarrassing to be the son-in-law of a failed president. ""That's the good part of it - and it's very clear how his father-in-law can succeed or fail. ""If he keeps his promises, he'll be the first president we've had in a long time who didn't just break all his promises. ""He will not succeed unless he keeps his promises on immigration and trade."" In his old office, Mr Kushner kept a picture of President John F Kennedy addressing a crowd, from the front, and from the back. He is still in the backroom, not in front of the crowds, portrayed by Saturday Night Live as a preppy mute. He may not speak in public - but when he whispers, President Trump takes notice. Watch him closely to learn what the president will do next. Listen in full to Mark Mardell's profile of Jared Kushner on BBC Radio 4'sPM programme.

Why is Russia so good at encouraging women into tech?,"Irina Khoroshko says maths ""always felt magical"" to her Irina Khoroshko, from Zelenograd near Moscow, had learned her times tables by the age of five. Her precocious talent, encouraged by a maths-mad family and a favourite female teacher who transformed every lesson into one giant problem-solving game, led to a degree in mathematical economics at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics. ""My lecturer instilled in me the power of numbers and calculation, how it gives you the ability to predict things; in that sense the subject always felt magical,"" she says. Now Irina, 26, is a data scientist at Russian online lender, ID Finance, enjoying a lucrative career devising analytical models to determine loan eligibility. And this isn't an unusual story in Russia. But it is in many other countries around the world. Several studies confirm that all too often girls' early interest in Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - fizzles out and never recovers. Sorelatively few women go on to choose engineeringor technology as a career. Why? A new study from Microsoft,externalsheds some light. Based on interviews with 11,500 girls and young women across Europe, it finds their interest in these subjects drops dramatically at 15, with gender stereotypes, few female role models, peer pressure and a lack of encouragement from parents and teachers largely to blame. Not so in Russia. In Russia, it's not unusual for girls to be interested in science and technology According to Unesco, 29% of people in scientific research worldwide are women, compared with 41% in Russia. In the UK, about 4% of inventors are women, whereas the figure is 15% in Russia. Russian girls view Stem far more positively, with their interest starting earlier and lasting longer, says Julian Lambertin, managing director at KRC Research, the firm that oversaw the Microsoft interviews. ""Most of the girls we talked to from other countries had a slightly playful approach to Stem, whereas  in Russia, even the very youngest were extremely focused on the fact that their future employment opportunities were more likely to be rooted in Stem subjects."" These girls cite parental encouragement and female role models as key, as well as female teachers who outnumber their male colleagues presiding over a curriculum viewed as gender neutral. The differences don't stop there. When the Department for Education asked a cross-section of British teenagers for their views on maths and physics, five words summed up the subjects' image problem: male, equations, boring, formulaic, irrelevant. But no such stigma exists in Russia, says Mr Lambertin. ""They've really gone beyond that,"" he says. ""People are expected to perform well in these subjects regardless of gender."" Advancement in science was a national priority in the Soviet era, says Alina Bezuglova Alina Bezuglova is head of the Russia chapter of Tech London Advocates, an organisation that connects Russian talent with job opportunities in the UK. She regularly hosts women-only tech events in the UK, but not so in Russia. Why? ""You could say it's because we are neglecting the problem or that there is no problem at all, and I'm far more inclined to think the latter,"" she says. ""Compared to the rest of Europe, we just don't stress about 'women's issues'."" According to Ms Bezuglova, Russian women's foothold in science and technology can in part be traced back to the Soviet era, when the advancement of science was made a national priority. Along with the growth in specialist research institutes, technical education was made available to everyone and women were encouraged to pursue careers in this field. ""It never occurred to me at school that because I'm a girl I shouldn't be choosing Stem, and in the workplace I don't see much sexism, only that you're judged on your abilities,"" she says. But could the national psyche also play a part? With their characteristically forthright nature, do Russian women simply find it easier to speak up for themselves in male-dominated environments? Emeli Dral, assistant professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, thinks so. Emeli Dral thinks Russian women are ""more determined to prove ourselves"" She recalls how it was precisely this spirit that spurred her on to success as one of only two girls in her advanced maths group at school. ""It actually made both of us even more competitive and more determined to prove ourselves and be better than the boys,"" she says. ""I think Russian women are pretty confident about being in a minority, mainly because of the support they have had from their parents from a young age. ""Mine never queried why I was interested in maths and engineering - it was considered to be very natural."" Olga Reznikova, whose largely self-taught approach to Stem led to her current role as a senior software engineer, is a case in point. Growing up in a small seaside town populated by miners and fishermen, her love of computers began when she was just four, but it was a struggle to turn her passion into a career. Turning to online tutorials, she mastered the basics of algorithm design, machine learning and programming and made money coding simple websites. But wary of a future stuck in ""IT outsourcing sweatshops"", she headed to St Petersburg to study further and land a bigger role. ""For a while I was the only female programmer at my company,"" she says. ""I did encounter some issues with being taken seriously, but I stayed with it and am now earning a salary that's 30% higher than before."" While Russia is doing something right, it's still not there yet in terms of gender parity. ""There is no doubt that Russia is firing up girls' imaginations,"" says Mr Lambertin. ""Bringing creativity to the classroom with hands-on, practical application, and stressing the relevance of these subjects by focusing on the workplace, could be the way forward for those countries where girls are currently very disengaged.""

Norwich City 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion,"The two bizarre own goals happened in the space of 21 first-half minutes Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale scored two freakish own goals as the Seagulls lost at Norwich to miss out on securing the Championship title. Both came from Alex Pritchard shots, the first smashing the bar and rebounding in off Stockdale's back. Albion's Jamie Murphy had a penalty appeal waved away before Pritchard curled against the post, with the ball again hitting Stockdale and going in. The Seagulls, whosealed promotion on Monday,were well short of their best. Relive Norwich's victory over Brighton as it happened Chris Hughton's Brighton needed a win to become champions and came closest to scoring when Glenn Murray saw his header cleared off the line by Jonny Howson. The ineffective Anthony Knockaert, recentlynamed as the Championship's player of the year,was replaced just after the hour mark, though his side remain seven points clear of Newcastle, who have three games to play. Eighth-placed Norwich, who cannot make the play-offs, remarkably did not register a single shot on target despite winning comfortably. The Canaries could have gone ahead early on but Nelson Oliveira could not quite reach Howson's dangerous cross. Brighton must now wait until at least Monday to clinch the title, as Newcastle must avoid defeat against Preston to take the race into the penultimate round of fixtures. Norwich City interim boss Alan Irvine: ""A few weeks ago we hadn't beaten a side above us all season - now we have beaten three of them and that is very pleasing. ""I thought we deserved to win, even though I have just been told that we didn't have a single shot on target, unless you count the ones against the woodwork. ""I thought we controlled the game for most of the time. I thought we passed the ball really well, especially in the first half, and also defended well, especially when they were putting balls into our box."" Brighton & Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton on the two own goals: ""That's not something I have ever seen before. It happens to keepers from time to time, but not usually twice in one game. ""Obviously there is no blame attached to David at all - he was just trying to make the saves and the ball just came back off him. ""What I would say is that we were punished for allowing the player to get his shot away by not closing him down on the edge of the box. ""Norwich have got a lot of quality in their side and when that happens you are asking for trouble.""

Norwich 2-0 Brighton - Seagulls miss chance to secure title,"Two Pritchard shots hit post and go in off Stockdale's back Murray has header cleared off line for visitors Brighton needed to win to secure the title Seagulls already promoted with three games left Brendon Mitchell FT: Norwich 2-0 Brighton But that otherwise includes our coverage of tonight's match at Carrow Road. Many thanks for joining us, it's been a blast. If you're missing us already, here's James Law's rather fine report of everything you might've missed... Goalkeeper David Stockdale scores two own goals as Brighton lose at Norwich to miss out on sealing the Championship title. FT: Norwich 2-0 Brighton  And, last but not least, the weekend's final game in the EFL sees promotion-chasing Newcastle United play Preston North End. As I said a few moments ago, there is a chance the Magpies could join Brighton in sealing promotion to the top flight if things fall kindly for them before Monday. We'll just have to wait and see on that score. FT: Norwich 2-0 Brighton  This looks a tasty little fixture, doesn't it? Birmingham City, with Harry Redknapp at the helm, will be hoping to secure a vital three points in their fight against Championship relegation. Not that former Blues boss Steve Bruce is planning to do his old employers any favours, mind you... Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce does not want to see old club Birmingham City go down but is keen to win Sunday's derby. FT: Norwich 2-0 Brighton  We've got nine Championship fixtures to tuck into on Saturday, with plenty to play for at both ends of the table. Wigan, in fact, could even be relegated tomorrow if results go against them. We've also got a full programme of League One and League Two matches, with Swindon Town and Leyton Orient also facing the drop, while Bolton could seal promotion back to the second tier. We'll have live text commentary on the BBC Sport website from 14:00 BST. FT: Norwich 2-0 Brighton Not that much changed tonight, but here's a quick look at the top six of the Championship table anyhow. Brighton still have a couple of games left to seal the title. Newcastle, who face Preston on Monday, could actually be playing for promotion themselves if results go their way tomorrow. And, speaking of tomorrow, here's what's coming up this weekend... FT: Norwich 2-0 Brighton We look on in envy at them, because they've done it all season. We've got to look at this performance tonight and hope we can do this more in the future. We've got to challenge next season. Steven Naismith, Norwich forward on Sky Sports FT: Norwich 2-0 Brighton I don't think that'll ever happen again - but I'll take the assists! Alex Pritchard, Norwich midfielder on Sky Sports Norwich 2-0 Brighton Game over. Two David Stockdale own goals, three Norwich City points. Brighton & Hove Albion will have to wait to secure the Championship title. Norwich 2-0 Brighton I think I've enjoyed hearing about your goalkeeper hat-trick memories about as much as I have watching this second half. It's not been the best. Just 60 seconds left. Norwich 2-0 Brighton The 90 minutes are up, but we'll have three minutes of added time. The Brighton fans are still cheery enough, at least... Norwich 2-0 Brighton I say dawdle, but Tomer Hemed just had half a chance to spark this game into life at last, breaking through down the middle and with Chuba Akpom alongside him and unmarked. But, rather summing up Brighton's night, he over-runs it and the opportunity goes begging. Norwich 2-0 Brighton James Maddison is on for Alex Pritchard as we continue to dawdle towards the final whistle. Norwich 2-0 Brighton You can showboat when you're two or 3-0 up. Anthony Knockaert was showboating from the very start, in the wrong areas. Warren Aspinall, Ex-Brighton midfielder on BBC Sussex Perhaps a little peep into why Brighton's star man was withdrawn with the best part of half an hour to go? Norwich 2-0 Brighton The Canaries are cruising here, as Wes Hoolahan comes on for Josh Murphy. Norwich, by the way, still haven't actually had a shot on target this evening. Five minutes to go. Norwich 2-0 Brighton A final Brighton change sees Glenn Murray come off for Chuba Akpom. Norwich 2-0 Brighton We're into the final 10 minutes at Carrow Road, then. A reminder, if you're joining us late, that two David Stockdale own goals are currently separating the two teams. Norwich 2-0 Brighton Norwich are back on the ball now, though, again pinging it around and keeping Brighton at arm's length. I've no doubt the Seagulls would spark into life if they are able to pull one back, but it has felt a bit after the Lord Mayor's show from the Premier League new boys tonight. Norwich 2-0 Brighton That's a bit more like it from Glenn Murray, who spins on the corner of the penalty area and sends a rasping drive towards the near post of John Ruddy's goal, albeit just fizzing over the Canaries crossbar. Norwich 2-0 Brighton Evan Pritchard:Beeb, you should be a bit jealous. It's lovely day here in Winnipeg. Go Norwich! A Newcastle Supporter It's alright for some, Evan, that's for sure! And I've just got so much time for these two little tales... Jay Singh-Gelling:Our U13 goalie once scored a hat trick of ogs. He had refused to wear keeper gloves and sported Gabor Kiraly-esque trackiesÂ Abi Goulding:I used to play in goal for my university, and one match we lost 15-0. I probably managed to score an own-goal hat-trick somehow...Â Norwich 2-0 Brighton ... Which also means these scarves, photographed earlier this week, are going to have to be shelved for a little longer. Aside from being a bit premature, does anyone else get bugged when ""Premiership"" is used instead of ""Premier League""? Â© 2025 BBC.

Sportsday - Ugo Ehiogu tributes,"Tottenham coach & former Aston Villa defender Ugo Ehiogu dies Europa League semi-finals: Celta Vigo v Manchester United Champions League semis: Real v Atletico; Monaco v Juventus Premier League news conferences World Snooker updates Get involved: #bbcsportsday Libby Dawes Ugo Ehiogu dies, aged 44 We leave you with this fitting tribute to Ugo Ehiogu from England manager Gareth Southgate, who was his long-time defensive partner at both Aston Villa and Middlesbrough. âI'm
stunned and deeply saddened by Ugo's passing and clearly my initial thoughts
are with his wife Gemma, his children and his family. ""I know that football will be grieving because he was so
highly respected by everybody he worked with and losing him at such a young age
is difficult to come to terms with. ""Most importantly, he was a gentleman and he is one of
those characters that people would find it difficult to have anything bad to
say about him. ""I probably played more games with Ugo than anybody else in
my career and while in many ways he was a gentle giant away from football, he
was a colossus on the pitch. It felt like a true partnership with Ugo because
we were prepared to put our bodies on the line for each other. ""We shared highs, lows and won a couple of trophies
together with Villa and Boro and it's those memories that I will always cherish
when I think of Ugo. ""He wasÂ one
of the most professional people I played with in terms of how he applied
himself to his job and it was great to see him progressing through the coaching
pathway with that thirst for learning. ""I've spoken to several of our former team-mates today and
there's just a sense of disbelief that we're having these conversations. ""Ugo was a credit to football, a credit to his family and
he will be missed by everybody who was lucky enough to know him.""Â #bbcsportsday United States' Serena Williams - winner of 23 Grand Slam singles titles - intends to return to tennis after her announcement that she is pregnant, says her coachÂ Patrick 
Mouratoglou.Â ""Saying exactly when she will come back (next year) is not something she 
cares about right now, but she does not want to stop there,"" he told AFP. ""She won the last Australian Open [in January when she would have been 
eight weeks pregnant] and will probably become world number one next week. She 
feels she can still dominate tennis.""Â Former world number one Novak Djokovic is having a testing time of it against Belgian David Goffin in the last eight of the Monte Carlo Masters.

Wigan forward Tony Clubb is to have a kidney removed but says he will be

Former England defender Ehiogudied at the age of 44on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest the previous day. Southgate and Ehiogu formed a centre-back pairing for almost 10 years at Aston Villa and Middlesbrough, winning the League Cup together at both clubs. ""He was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch,"" Southgate said. Tottenham's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea on Saturday (17:15 BST) will see both teams wearing black armbands and a minute's applause before kick-off, with Villa's derby against Birmingham following suit on Sunday. Ehiogu, who was Tottenham's Under-23s coach, was taken to hospital on Thursdayafter collapsing,externalat the club's training ground, but a statement said he had died in the early hours of Friday morning. Capped four times by England, Ehiogu made over 200 appearances for Villa between 1991 and 2000 and then spent seven years at Boro. The defender also played for West Brom, Leeds, Rangers and Sheffield United, before retiring in 2009.

""I know that football will be grieving because he was so highly respected by everybody he worked with and losing him at such a young age is difficult to come to terms with. ""Most importantly, he was a gentleman and he is one of those characters that people would find it difficult to have anything bad to say about him. ""I probably played more games with Ugo than anybody else in my career and while in many ways he was a gentle giant away from football, he was a colossus on the pitch.

""I've spoken to several of our former team-mates today and there's just a sense of disbelief that we're having these conversations.

WSL 1 club Notts County Ladies fold,"Notts County Ladies had played their home matches at Meadow Lane English top-flight club Notts County Ladies have folded, two days before their first match of the Spring Series. Due to face Arsenal on Sunday, Notts' players were told the Women's Super League One club cannot stay afloat 15 minutes before Friday's announcement. Previously known as Lincoln Ladies before relocating in 2014, the squad included England's Carly Telford, Laura Bassett, Jade Moore and Jo Potter. Notts finished sixth in WSL 1 in 2016 after reaching the 2015 FA Cup final. Notts County Ladies left 'gobsmacked' after club folds In March, a winding-up petition against the club was adjourned for a second time, giving Notts until 3 July to pay debts owed to HM Revenue and Customs. Local businessman Alan HardypurchasedNotts County's men's and women's clubs in December, aiming to clear debts owed to HMRC by both outfits. A club statement said: ""Alan Hardy has reluctantly admitted defeat in his bid to save Notts County Ladies Football Club after facing a near-Â£1m bill to keep the club afloat this season. ""The Notts County chairman and owner had hoped to restructure six-figure HMRC debts inherited from Ray Trew and fund ongoing projected losses this season of half a million pounds. ""Despite weeks of negotiations with lawyers, HMRC and the Football Association, Hardy has now called time on his plans to save the Ladies set-up. ""The club has today been officially withdrawn from the Women's Super League and will play no matches in the Spring Series, including this Sunday's away fixture at Arsenal."" Reacting to the news, Notts and England goalkeeper Telford posted onTwitter:,external""CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE JUST WITNESSED!!! NOTTS COUNTY LADIES NO LONGER EXISTS!!!"" Midfielder Danielle Buetadded:,external""Thanks @Official_NCFC left jobless and homeless."" Former Arsenal winger Rachel Yankey, who had a spell on loan with Notts in 2016,posted:,external""Totally gutted for the @Official_NCLFC players, staff and supporters. I hope the @PFA and @fa are doing everything they can to support them."" An FA spokesperson said: ""The FA is aware of the situation and is liaising with all involved parties. ""Our priority is the welfare of the players and we will work closely with them, the PFA and wider stakeholders to support them through this time."" With the WSL transfer window having closed, it is not yet clear if any of the Notts squad will be able to sign for another English top-flight club this season. Notts County faced Chelsea in the first Women's FA Cup final to be held at Wembley in 2015 ""I am devastated that we cannot continue the Ladies project but the numbers simply do not stack up,"" said Notts County chairman Hardy. ""Continuing would have been little short of financial suicide. ""When I took over the club, HMRC and other creditors had in excess of Â£350,000 of unpaid liabilities. Additionally, I was extremely concerned that to operate Notts County Ladies for the current season was going to cost us approximately Â£500,000 - a figure principally made up of player and coaching salaries. ""Our total projected incoming revenue from attendances and sponsorship was Â£28,000. ""It's a very sad day for me personally and supporters should rest assured I have left no stone unturned in my quest to save the club. ""However, having taken all factors into consideration, the only possible outcome is to discontinue our Ladies club. ""I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to the staff and players and we all wish them every success in finding new clubs."" David Jackson, BBC Radio Nottingham All the noises from Alan Hardy had suggested that the tax bill would be paid and that Notts County Ladies would be able to continue, so this news comes out of the blue. He had even spoken about creating an academy for girls from across the county. I was at Wembley for the Women's FA Cup final against Chelsea in 2015 when it seemed like the club was on the way up. Even now, four of the current squad are in the England set-up. They've only been in existence - since moving from Lincoln - for three years and this is a loss for Nottingham as well as for women's football.
