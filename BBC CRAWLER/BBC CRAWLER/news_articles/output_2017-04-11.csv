Stakeknife 'linked to 18 murders',"Fred Scappaticci denies he was an Army agent within the IRA The British spy Stakeknife - described by an Army general as ""our golden egg"" - is now the subject of a Â£35m criminal inquiry called Operation Kenova. The inquiry has been triggered by a classified report which Northern Ireland's Director of Public Prosecutions Barra McGrory QC has told Panorama ""made for very disturbing and chilling reading"". What Stakeknife actually did has been wreathed in speculation since he was identified in 2003 as Belfast bricklayer Freddie Scappaticci. The one stand-out fact, however, has not been in doubt: for over a decade Scappaticci maintained his cover in the IRA by interrogating fellow British agents to the point where they confessed and were then shot. One British spy was preparing other British spies for execution. Step back over Stakeknife, PPS deputy asked Chief investigator calls for witnesses New investigation into Stakeknife launched Stakeknife linked to up to 50 murders And there were a lot of executions: 30 shot as spies by the IRA's so-called Nutting Squad which, I am told, Scappaticci eventually came to head. Panorama has learned that Scappaticci is linked to at least 18 of those ""executions"". Not all the victims would have been registered agents like him who produced the best intelligence. Some were akin to ""informers"" - people with close access to IRA members, or who passed on what they saw and heard to the security forces. A few were innocent of the IRA's charge of spying. Still, the spectacle of one British agent heading an IRA unit dedicated to rooting out and shooting other British spies is so extraordinary that I've often wondered how exactly the state benefitted by the intelligence services having tolerated this for the whole of the 1980s. The obvious person to ask is Scappaticci himself - but a draconian injunction stops journalists from approaching him, even to the point of making any enquiries about where he now lives or what he does. Jon Boutcher (left), chief constable of Bedfordshire Police, is leading Operation Kenova, with the authority of PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton Scappaticci was recruited by a section within military intelligence called the Force Research Unit, or FRU. I'm told the Army have assessed his intelligence as having saved some 180 lives. Can Scappaticci's intelligence have been so valuable that the sacrifice of other agents was a price worth paying to maintain his cover? It's not quite that simple. Had the cavalry been sent in every time Scappaticci tipped off his handlers about who was at risk, he himself wouldn't have lasted long. Yet protecting him also meant the murders he knew about - or was even involved in - were never properly investigated, driving a ""coach and horses"" through the criminal justice system, according to Mr McGrory. Barra McGrory said the report made for ""disturbing and chilling reading"" Also, the Army's assessment that Stakeknife saved 180 lives doesn't translate to the number of actual lives saved as a direct consequence of actioning Stakeknife's intelligence by, for example, interdicting an IRA unit on active service. I understand that figure of 180 is partly the army's guesstimate of lives that would have been lost had Stakeknife's intelligence not led to arrests and the recovery of weapons. Of course Stakeknife also contributed significantly to ""building a picture"" of the IRA, an insight much valued by the intelligence services. An ex-FRU operative with access to his intelligence told me: ""He knew all of the main players and picked up a tremendous amount of peripheral information. ""As the [IRA] campaign changed and the political side became more important again he was highly placed to comment on that."" No doubt, but it's hard to quantify ""picture building"" in terms of actual lives saved. One thing is for sure: leading a double life at the heart of an IRA unit with a Gestapo-like hold over its rank and file would have required cunning - and resilience. Especially since Scappaticci told his army handlers he disliked gratuitous violence. He seems to have managed the violence bit though, even when it was close to home. I'm told that in January 1988, Scappaticci sent a young boy up to the home of Anthony McKiernan, asking him to call by to see Scappaticci. The Scappaticcis and McKiernans were friends - children from both families had sleepovers. That was the last McKiernan's wife and children saw of him. Accused by Scappaticci's Nutting Squad of being a spy - something the family strongly deny - some 24 hours later, he was shot in the head. Unsurprisingly, Scappaticci's ex-IRA comrades paint a less flattering picture than his handlers. They say he was a prodigious consumer of pornography, loved James Bond movies and - although he was on the IRA's Belfast Brigade staff - was never a ""true republican."" That might explain why, after Scappaticci was released from detention without trial in December 1975, he drifted away from the republican movement and got involved in a building trade VAT scam. There were family holidays in Florida. But then he was arrested by the police and agreed to work for the fraud squad as an informer. His former IRA comrades also speak of a man with an intimidating manner, handy with his fists and a large ego who liked to be at the centre of things. His appointment to the IRA's Nutting Squad - a job most IRA members ran a mile from -  certainly gave him that opportunity. It provided Scappaticci with unrivalled access to what the IRA high command were thinking and their war plans. Mr Scappaticci left Northern Ireland when identified by the media as Stakeknife, in 2003 It also gave him access to the names of new IRA recruits on the pretext of vetting them, plus details of IRA operations on the pretext of debriefing IRA members released from police custody to establish whether they gave away too much to their interrogators. That explains why military intelligence was so eager to recruit Scappaticci when, in September 1979, he graduated to the FRU from spying for the fraud squad. He got an agent number - 6126 - and a codename. Stakeknife. His luck ran out in January 1990 after police agent Sandy Lynch was rescued from the clutches of the nutting squad. The police thought Lynch was about to be shot, Scappaticci having got him to confess. The ordinary CID who did not know Scappaticci was a spy found a thumb print in the house where Lynch had been held. Scappaticci fled to Dublin. However, a senior police officer who was in the know advised the FRU to get Scappaticci to concoct an alibi for his thumbprint. It worked. On his return to Belfast in the autumn of 1992, Scappaticci was arrested and then released without charge. His handlers hoped he could return to spying. But by now the IRA were suspicious and removed him from the security unit. With Scappaticci's access to IRA secrets gone, the FRU formally stood him down as an agent in 1995. How did he escape the same treatment at the hands of the IRA that he had helped mete out to others? Probably because the sight of his body dumped on a roadside would have provoked a slew of questions about those IRA leaders who appointed him to protect the IRA from spies like him - and who also ignored warnings from their more sceptical comrades along the border that ""Scap"" was not to be trusted. That did not stop the IRA in Belfast from putting Scap in his place. After being sidelined, he agreed to help the staunchly republican Braniff family clear the name of a brother, Anthony, who was shot as a spy in 1981. He was eventually exonerated by the IRA. But when Scappaticci spoke up for Anthony at a private meeting of republicans, to his embarrassment, the IRA's most senior man in Belfast, Sean ""Spike"" Murray suddenly appeared and slapped him down. When Scap was eventually outed as Stakeknife by a former FRU operative in 2003, he was spirited to England where MI5 told him the IRA knew he had been a spy. He rejected MI5's offer of protective custody, flew straight back to Belfast and sought a meeting with the IRA. He gambled on not being shot because he calculated the IRA now had every reason to support a denial that he was a spy - even though he knew they didn't believe him. His gamble was based on the fact that the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein were now engaged in the peace process. Scappaticci calculated that were the IRA to admit they'd long suspected he was a spy, it would undermine the official line that they'd fought the British to an honourable draw. Any such admission would provoke the rank and file into questioning whether the IRA had been pushed into peace, paralysed by the penetration of agents like him. His gamble paid off. After meeting two of the most senior representatives of the IRA leadership, Martin ""Duckster"" Lynch and Padraic Wilson, I'm told Scappaticci and the IRA came to an understanding: Scappaticci would issue a firm denial which the IRA would not contest. To this day, that's been the IRA's official position - even though, as they say in Belfast, the dogs in the street know it's nonsense. Once again, Agent 6126 had relied on his wits and native cunning. Whether the 71-year-old Scappaticci now outwits the 50 detectives trawling over everything he did, what his handlers allowed him to do, and what the IRA leaders authorised him to do, is another question. You might say he's the spy who knows too much - because he knows the answers to all these questions.

Scout leaders: 'It's the best non-paid job in the world',"A shortage of leaders has left thousands of childrenstuck on a waiting listto become Scouts, Beavers, Cubs or Explorers, the Scout Association says. Here, two people to have donned the Scouts' woggle and scarf describe the ups and downs of being a volunteer. Lynn Dredge, who leads her local Beaver group for six- to eight-year-olds in Surrey, says she really enjoys her role. ""You're able to do things you would have as a child but with your adult's head on - you still get that level of fun,"" she says. ""We do sleepovers in the Scout hut and sing songs - all the old traditional things which the kids love. ""Because we're a village I sometimes see old Beavers who are now grown up - they'll say 'Hi Kingfisher!' which is my scouting name."" The 52-year-old, a teaching assistant in a primary school, has led the group for 16 years. She began as a parent volunteer after her son Stephen joined. Lynn Dredge: 'It's about juggling life' Now, she runs a weekly meeting during term-time that lasts for an hour-and-a-quarter, and plans sessions with two other leaders. To organise this summer's term, ""I met the other leaders at the pub and within a couple of hours we'd planned from now until July."" Each weekly evening has a different theme, where children may be taught to tie knots, how to light a campfire or learn computer skills. And there are the trips. A camp-out on Dorset's Brownsea Island nature reserve and a jamboree in Holland where Scouts meet counterparts from across the world are on the agenda for Lynn's Beaver Scout Colony. ""The adults are Scouts as much as the children,"" Lynn says. ""If they go abseiling, or perform a talent show, we do it too - I'd never ask them to do something I'm not prepared to do myself."" On the shortage of volunteers, she says parents often ""love the idea"" of their children scouting - but that they are rarely prepared to give their own time. This video can not be played Scout Katie Ainscough tells the Today programme why the group is still important ""They forget that it's run by volunteers, week in and week out."" She said some parents put their children on waiting lists up to four years before they are old enough to join, especially for oversubscribed groups. ""A group in Ashford has to run two evenings a week, of around 20 children each, and there is still a waiting list,"" she says. ""I've had to tell parents that unless you're prepared to help we won't be able to carry the group on."" But she adds: ""For the people who say that they don't have anytime to volunteer, I say, it's about juggling life."" But with the activities come responsibilities. Training, health and safety rules and planning can be onerous, some leaders say. Jim Godden, 52, was a Scout leader in Bristol for eight years, but says he became ""disillusioned"" with bureaucracy by the time he left in 2015. ""I was a very active Scout, leading a successful troop,""  he says. ""We regularly went mountain walking, climbing, water-skiing, kayaking, biking and wild swimming, among many other activities."" But it gradually became more difficult to authorise activities with senior leaders, he says, ""even with the correct levels of leader ability and adhering to all safety factors"". He adds: ""The only way the Scout movement can really move on is to attract those people who already take part in adventurous activities."" Jim says children want ""adventure and excitement,"" rather than sitting at a campfire singing songs. He says some leaders are old-fashioned and ""still see it from their 'good old days' when they were Scouts."" For its part, the Scout Association said it was making it easier for those with limited time to join up by being flexible about how much time they can give and the sorts of jobs they do. It says they are responding to people wanting ""much more flexible volunteering arrangements"" than in the past. It said people could take up administrative and trustee roles, as well as being group leaders. They can help once a fortnight, month or term or at special events or camps. But this has to be balanced with training leaders, who with one other adult can be responsible for around 20 young people at a particular time. Chief scout Bear Grylls helping youngsters with lighting a fire Everyone who signs up has a criminal record check and an appointment to assess if they are suitable for leading. After this, volunteers have five months to complete an initial training which includes essentials like first aid and leadership training. Once complete, they get a ""Gilwell woggle"" to show they are a learner leader. But it can take up to five years to finish training and get a Wood Badge - the recognised insignia given to adult scouters across the world. It looks like two wooden beads threaded onto a leather thong, and is modelled on a necklace given out by Robert Baden-Powell's at the first Scoutmasters' training camp in 1919. Lynn says: ""It sounds like a lot, but you fit in learning over the weekend. We all enjoy teaching the children, but it's about us learning too."" 51,000 children waiting to join Scouts How scout badges have changed over 100 years Six-year-old scout helped save a life LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

United Airlines incident: Why do airlines overbook?,"This video can not be played Passenger dragged off a United flight. Video: Audra D. Bridges A common seating problem on a United Airlines flight on Sunday ended with a man being bloodied and dragged from his seat and an already troubled airline earning more bad press. How did it all go so wrong? Overbooking on flights happens all the time. Airlines boost their profit margins by overselling, betting against the number of passengers who will miss their flights. In this case, the problem arose because United decided at the last minute to fly four members of staff to a connection point and needed to bump four passengers to make way for them. When there's a seating issue the first step is to offer an inducement to the passengers to take a later flight. On Sunday passengers were offered $400 (Â£322), a hotel room for the night and a flight the following afternoon. When no-one took the offer, the amount was upped to $800. Still no-one bit, so a manager boarded the flight and informed passengers that four people would be selected to leave the flight. That selection is based on several factors, but frequent fliers and higher fare-paying passengers are given priority to stay aboard, a spokeswoman for United confirmed. A couple who were selected agreed to leave the plane voluntarily. A third passenger, reportedly the wife of the man who was forcibly removed, also agreed. The man, who said he was a doctor and had to see patients in the morning, refused. At this point, the airline could have identified another passenger for removal or raised its offer anywhere up to a maximum of $1,350. Erin Benson, a spokeswoman for United, could not confirm whether other passengers were sought. She did confirm that no offer was made above $800, but could not comment on why. Passenger forcibly removed from flight Chinese anger at violent removal of passenger According to eyewitnesses, the man who refused to be ejected said he was a doctor and he had appointments to keep the following day, though this has not been confirmed. This was a Sunday night flight; the next flight on offer didn't leave until 15:00 on Monday. An eyewitness said the man was ""very upset"" about the possibility of being bumped and attempted to call his lawyer. An airline manager told him that security would be called if he did not comply. At this point, security officers came to speak to him, first one then two more. As the video shows, their conversation ended with the man being yanked from his seat onto the floor and dragged off, blood visible on this face. United is technically within its rights to forcibly remove the man for refusing to leave the flight, and the step is part of the airline's carriage guidelines, but such instances are extremely rare. Of the 613 million people who flew on major US carriers in 2015, 46,000 were involuntarily denied boarding, according to data from the Department of Transportation - less than 0.008%. The majority of those would have been informed before they boarded the flight, said Charles Leocha, the founder of passenger advocacy group Travelers United. He could not remember seeing a passenger violently dragged off a plane. ""It turned my stomach,"" he said. Removing passengers at the last minute to make way for staff was also highly unusual, he said. Staff transport should be identified ahead of time and factored into bookings. US fliers have become resigned to chronic delays and poor service, according to Mr Leocha, and a lack of readily available information about their rights meant they were too dependent on the airline managers in situations like these. ""Our expectations have been driven so low that passengers have begun to accept it,"" he said. ""What they shouldn't have to accept is being dragged off the flight to make way for an employee."" Oscar Munoz, CEO of United, said in a statement: ""This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers."" Mr Munoz said the airline would review the event and ""reach out"" to the passenger, though a spokeswoman could not confirm whether United was in touch with him yet. One of the security officers involved in the incident was suspended on Monday afternoon, pending a review, said the Chicago Department of Aviation in a statement. The actions of the officer were ""obviously not condoned by the Department"", the statement said. Whatever happened on the flight - and the details will undoubtedly emerge in the coming days - it was a bad day for United, Mr Leocha said. The airline had only recently been at the centre of another controversy, when a fortnight ago it refused to let two girls board because they were wearing leggings. ""This isn't really a lesson for passengers it's a lesson for airlines,"" he said. ""The only lesson here for passengers is when security get on throw up your hands, because otherwise you're going down the aisle with a fat lip.""

'Blood contamination tore my family apart',"This video can not be played Brothers David, Vincent and Barry all died as a result of blood contamination Thousands of people with haemophilia were infected with HIV and hepatitis as a result of NHS treatments in the 1970s and 80s. But their families are still seeking a public inquiry into the scandal. Tony Farrugia was just 14-years-old when his father Barry died of Aids. Over the next 20 years, two of his four uncles would also die in what was perhaps the worst treatment scandal in the NHS's history. In the 1970s and 80s, thousands of haemophiliacs - like members of Tony's family - were treated with contaminated blood products. Some 4,670 of them were later diagnosed with hepatitis C, while around 1,200 also contracted HIV. Many did not live long enough to be treated with modern drugs. Thirty years later, the survivors and their relatives have told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethey are still fighting for answers. Some are worried that a new support scheme planned by the government could leave them struggling to pay mortgages and bills. Tony's father Barry was diagnosed with haemophilia - a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting - as a baby. It took Tony almost 25 years to get hold of his father's medical records after his death. They show that Barry was a mild haemophiliac, whose symptoms could have been managed. He might not have needed to be treated with the blood clotting agent Factor VIII - the cause of the contamination - but it was prescribed anyway. The result was that he was infected with hepatitis B in the late 70s and then with HIV as early as 1980. Entries in the records show that doctors were aware he might have had the virus two years before he was finally told. By 1985, Barry's health had declined rapidly. Tony, then a teenager, was sent away to live with other family members but the new living arrangements did not work out and he was eventually placed in care. In the summer of 1986, he visited his father in hospital for the final time. Barry contracted hepatitis B and Aids ""He started to lose weight by then,"" Tony recalls, ""a lot of weight - so he was really, really skinny."" ""I remember my dad asking me for some of my ice cream. I handed it to him, at which point one of the nurses intervened and said 'you can't give him that'. ""He had blisters in his mouth which were bleeding. I couldn't share an ice cream with my dad because they had given him Aids,"" he says. Barry's death in September 1986 split the family apart. Tony went back into care in Luton while his twin brother David went to a separate care home in North London. His older teenage brothers were left to fend for themselves. It was not until 2010 that he was reunited with other members of his family. ""That was the first time since dad died that we were together again,"" Tony says. ""That's what the [health service] did, they destroyed my dad with these viruses then they watched his family crumble."" In the years after Barry's death the family continued to struggle. One of Barry's brothers, Vincent, was killed by Aids passed on through contaminated blood. In 2012, another brother, David, died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage linked to the hepatitis C he had contracted through Factor VIII. Madeline, David's widow, says the contaminated blood scandal has caused ""devastation"" to her family. ""I can put my hand on my heart and tell you I am not the same person [since David's death]. I will never be the same person,"" she said. ""It comes back to haunt you in so many ways."" Barry died in September 1986 Madeline says the doctors who prescribed Factor VIII ""never, ever"" told them there was a risk of blood contamination. Angie, Barry's sister, adds: ""Treatment shouldn't kill you, should it? Medical treatment shouldn't kill you."" The family say they also had to live with the stigma that surrounded Aids in the 1980s. On one occasion, Vincent had ""Aids scum"" scratched into his car. When he walked into his local cafe one day, everyone else got up and walked out. ""It was awful - awful - to see this happen to a person,"" Angie said. The family are still looking for answers as to why their relatives died and have called for a public inquiry. ""All we are after is recognition for the harm which was done. We still haven't got the truth and they haven't given us all the answers,"" says Tony. ""The government can't learn lessons until they face up to what they have done."" Thousands of people in the UK were infected when they were treated with imported blood products in the 1970s and 80s There have been two previous inquiries. One was privately funded from donations and could not force health officials or ministers to testify. The other only looked at a small number of Scottish victims and did not have the power to summon witnesses from England. The Haemophilia Society is now calling for a full public inquiry into the scandal, something the government has so far ruled out. Victims and their families are also worried that a new financial support scheme currently being planned could leave some worse off. Under the proposals, a widow of a haemophiliac who died from Aids in England will receive a one-off sum of Â£10,000, compared to a lifetime payment of Â£27,750 a year in Scotland. A new Welsh scheme announced this month is also significantly more generous than in England and Northern Ireland. ""The whole thing is a shambles, it's shameful,"" says Sue Threakall, of the campaign group Tainted Blood. ""These are payments which people rely on to pay their mortgages, pay rent and feed their families."" The government says it has doubled the amount it is spending on support payments to those affected since 2015. ""This is significantly more than any previous government has provided for those affected by this tragedy,"" a spokesman for the Department of Health said. ""We will continue to listen and are currently consulting on new measures to extend the group of individuals who benefit from higher annual payments.""

Jonathan Marcus: Trump's dangerously unclear foreign policy,"The lack of clarity with US foreign policy is a cause of concern for America's allies Just a few days ago the Russian embassy in London responded on its Twitter feed to the British Foreign Secretary's announcement that he was cancelling his planned visit to Moscow. Accompanying the Russian tweet was a picture of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimea War - one of the great disasters of 19th Century British military history. It was, though, a curious choice of subject. Maybe the Russian embassy should brush up on their own history, for whilst the charge itself was a glorious failure, Britain and France  - who had gone to war with Russia ostensibly over an arcane dispute involving the Ottoman Empire and access to holy sites - did in fact win and Moscow had to back down. But there is another more important lesson from the Charge of the Light Brigade that is relevant to today's diplomatic crisis. The flower of Britain's Light Cavalry charged down the wrong valley directly into the mouth of the Russian guns because the message ordering them into action was not clear. The US struck at the Syrian airfield from where the Americans say the recent chemical attack was launched with impunity. They did so to reinforce a red line - drawn by the previous Obama administration - but one never acted upon. G7 rejects sanctions on Russia Syria 'chemical attack': What now? Of course the thing about red lines is that they need to be crystal clear. In the immediate aftermath of the strike this seemed to be the case. The message was: use nerve gas again and consequences will follow. But on Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer muddied the waters. Asked if air attacks with conventional weapons might also draw US punitive action, he said: ""If you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, you will see a response from this president."" Barrel bombs, though, tend to be large canisters filled with explosives and shrapnel that are typically dropped by Syrian government forces from helicopters. In other words they are conventional rather than chemical munitions. So was Mr Spicer broadening the red line? Belatedly the White House had to issue a clarification noting that what he really was saying was that barrel bombs containing chemical weapons would draw a US response. This lack of clarity would not matter quite so much if it was not characteristic of the Trump administration's whole approach to foreign policy. And the stakes could not be higher. One crisis in US-Russia relations is already upon us. Another involving the unpredictable North Korean regime is fast building. These are the Trump team's first big foreign policy tests and so far they are gaining a very mixed report card. In the wake of the US strike on the Syrian air base, Trump administration officials - ranging from the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, US Ambassador to the UNNikki Haleyand US National Security Adviser General H R McMaster, to the White House spokesman Sean Spicer - have suggested a variety of US policy approaches that extend from the relative isolationism of ""America First"" to a more strident interventionism. On key questions there seems to be little agreement. Is the US eager to remove the Assad regime? Does its priority remain the fight against so-called Islamic State? How does the strike against Syria that has enraged not just Russia but also Iran square with US interests in Iraq, where, unlike in Syria, Washington and Tehran find themselves on the ""same side"" in that they are both giving military backing to the Iraqi Government? Mr Tillerson will arrive in Moscow without the backing of the G7 for economic sanctions against Russia The lack of clarity in the message is hampering America's allies as well. The British Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken of a ""window of opportunity"" to separate Russia from Syria's President Assad. But Tuesday's G7 group of nations meeting has pointedlyfailed to agree on the need for additional economic sanctionsagainst Russia. Mr Tillerson is arriving in Moscow without the strong backing from America's key allies that he had hoped for. Yes, they all agree that Mr Assad cannot be part of the solution. They all agree Russia must exercise its responsibilities in Syria. But in terms of what to do, they are as much at sea as the Trump administration itself. What is still needed is a broad statement of US policy goals and the instruments that will be used to achieve them. Without that the growing militarisation of US foreign policy - stepped up strikes in Yemen; more troops to Syria and Iraq; and the punitive cruise missile attack in Syria - may worry both friends and potential enemies alike. There seems to be no central guiding brain behind the evolution of the Trump team's foreign policy. The US president himself has failed to articulate any clear approach. With regard to Syria that may be unsettling. With regard to North Korea, it could be potentially catastrophic.

Witness to the execution: Americans who watch men die,"Teresa and Larry Clark, from Waynesboro, VA, have witnessed multiple executions Teresa Clark has watched three strangers die. She held her husband's hand the first time, but after that the experience began to feel normal. The couple, who run a chimney sweeping business in Waynesboro, Virginia, volunteer to watch executions. Teresa's husband, Larry, 63, went to the first one alone. ""He was very curious. I dropped him off and I asked him all kinds of questions,"" she says. ""Afterwards he said, 'You gotta see this'."" Eventually she did. In 1998 they made the ""nervous journey"" to watch the execution of Douglas Buchanan, Jr, who had been convicted of murdering his father, stepmother, and two stepbrothers. Witnesses like Teresa and Larry Clark are a legal necessity. In Virginia, as well as some other death penalty states, the law requires people with no connection to the crime attend each execution. Volunteers ""are considered public eyewitnesses, and go to executions standing in the place of the general public,"" says Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. ""It's a recognition that these proceedings need to take place in public view."" On the night of the execution, Teresa, Larry and the other volunteers were picked up by the prison bus and taken to Greensville Correctional Facility in Jarratt, Virginia. After spending some time mingling with reporters in the cafeteria, they were led into a small room. The room was brightly lit, and featured a large viewing window. When the curtains opened they saw the gurney. Then Buchanan entered. When asked if he had any final words, he replied: ""Get the ride started. I'm ready to go."" During executions, Teresa says the prisoners look right into the observation gallery, and the room stays silent. ""It's quite weird, watching somebody look at you as they're getting ready to die,"" she says. After the execution, the doctor pronounces the inmate dead and the curtains close. The witnesses are thanked for their service and sent home. The volunteer process made headlines recently when Wendy Kelley, director of the Arkansas corrections department, appealed for volunteers at a community meeting. The state plans to execute a record seven inmates in 11 days, but can't find enough people who are willing to watch. Arkansas state law says that at least six ""respectable citizens"" must be at every execution to ""verify that the execution was conducted in the manner required by law."" Seeking funds to say a final farewell to sons on death row Global executions fall 37% since 2015 - Amnesty The publicity worked. Arkansas now has a flurry of volunteers. Beth Viele, 39, from Jacksonville, Arkansas, wrote a letter to Kelley expressing her interest. ""Please accept this correspondence as a formal request to be a volunteer witness for the eight upcoming executions,"" she wrote. ""I would love to be part in helping the families of the victim(s) see long overdue JUSTICE be carried out."" Beth Viele's application letter to serve as a volunteer witness Frank Weiland, 77, works as a brass works fabricator in Lynchburg, Virginia. He's volunteered to witness four executions. He says he goes as a show of support for law enforcement. The last execution he witnessed was in 2006, when Brandon Hedrick chose the electric chair over lethal injection. ""This guy didn't live too far from me, and I know some people that knew him."" ""They said he was scared of needles,"" Weiland says with a laugh. He watched Hedrick get strapped into the chair, and saw the warden put a sponge on his head to help the electrical current travel faster. ""The next thing you know - boom!"" Weiland says. ""I noticed his hands on the arms of the chair, and I said, well if there's anything as far as feeling goes he'll clench, and he did not clench. The noise is kind of a bump. ""He didn't convulse or anything. As a matter of fact if I had the choice I would take the chair. ""The only thing that told you that he was getting it was the way his legs smoked a little bit."" Eight men the state of Arkansas originally planned to execute over 11 days. Jason McGehee (bottom left)'s execution has been stayed an additional 30 days Still, witnessing these deaths leaves an impact. ""I've replayed it very much in my mind,"" he says. ""I really don't know why, but I have."" Teresa Clark tells a story about the night following the first execution she attended. ""I was sitting in my car at a red light and I looked in the rear view window, and I swear I saw the man I just saw die,"" she says. ""The picture kind of sticks with you."" But she remains undeterred. ""If they called now and needed somebody, I would go."" ""It came across my mind, and it still does, that these people know when they're going to die, and the people they killed didn't. They get to say their goodbyes, so I really can't say I felt sorry for them.""

Meet the female entrepreneurs using tech for good,"When Jude Ower entered the gaming industry she was one of very few women Jude Ower loved playing video games as a child, but she never dreamed that her passion would eventually become a force for good and win her accolades and honours. After 12 years making games for education and training, she went on to create an international games platform with a social conscience - Playmob. ""After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Zynga, the creator of Farmville, launched a campaign to raise funds for the victims by selling an in-game item, with a percentage of each purchase going to help the victims,"" she explains. ""It was massively successful and raised over $1m in a matter of days. It was then I thought: 'Maybe I could make a platform that connected games and causes?'"" Playmob pairs games developers or businesses with a charity and then sets up in-game advertising campaigns. By clicking on links within the game, players can make donations. The campaigns have helped more than 3,000 teenagers receive counselling for cyber-bullying, provided protection for 31 pandas, and secured education for 8,500 children in Africa and Asia, the company says. ""With Playmob we can track the social impact, such as number of trees planted, number of meals provided, water wells built, and so forth,"" she says. ""This allows players to see that the more they play and interact with the branded content, the more good they do."" So far the games platform has raised more than $1m for charities over the past five years, and more than 1.5 million players have interacted with charitable in-game content. Her success saw her awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 2015 for services to entrepreneurship and she's been voted one of the top 100 Women in Tech in Europe. Ms Ower is just one of a growing number of entrepreneurs - many of them women - exploring how technology can be harnessed in the cause of philanthropy. This is tech for social good, or ""philtech"" as it's sometimes called. Erin Michelson had all the trappings of financial success but felt ""terribly unhappy"" Erin Michelson's high-flying banking career took her to Hong Kong, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, where she rose to vice president and director of philanthropic management at Bank of America. But despite seemingly having it all, she felt there was something missing. ""I realised that even though I had all the trappings of success, I was terribly unhappy,"" she says. ""So I quit my job, sold everything I owned, set up a charitable fund, and headed out on a two-year around-the-world trip volunteering with humanitarian organisations."" Taking only one suitcase, she spent 720 days travelling to 62 countries across all seven continents - an adventure that helped her find meaning in her life, she says. After writing a book about her experiences, she returned to San Francisco and founded Summery, a data analytics company that has developed a piece of online software similar to theMyers-Briggs personality test,external. Summery helps firms match their charitable projects with their employees' personalities The program combines behavioural science and analytics to give employers an idea of their staff's social priorities and attitudes towards giving, which she says helps inform companies how to focus their charitable efforts. ""The test matches you with one of 10 'giving' personalities and provides a snapshot of your giving DNA, one of 59,048 possibilities,"" says Ms Michelson. By taking the guesswork out of charitable giving, she says it can improve the relationship between employer and staff, to everyone's benefit. ""Engaged employees lead not only to better corporate performance, but also significant cost savings through stronger retention and more targeted recruitment based on cultural appreciation,"" she says. Richard Craig, chief executive of the Technology Trust, which helps charitable organisations use tech more effectively, says: ""Over the last couple of years there has been a noticeable trend in graduates specifically looking for roles in charities and non-profits who might previously have looked to careers in the City, for example. ""I am seeing the same trend with technology start-ups, with a proportion looking to deliver social good either as non-profits themselves, or commercial organisation with social purpose."" Good-Loop's Amy Williams says she saw ""untapped potential"" in online advertising It was while working for an advertising agency in London that Amy Williams had her ""philtech epiphany"". ""I saw firsthand the huge amount of money that gets passed from one big conglomerate to another, buying and selling the cheap commodity of our attention online,"" she says. ""The stark contrast between these two worlds really hit me - Â£4.7bn was spent on online advertising in the UK last year."" She quit and went travelling, working as a volunteer for a small charity in Argentina called Food For Thought, which specialises in nutrition education for kids. ""I started started to see the untapped potential within online advertising to make some real positive impact."" Inspired by her experiences, she founded Good-Loop, a company that rewards viewers of video ads with donations to their chosen charities. Brands create a video and if the visitor watches it for 15 seconds or more, the advertiser pays 50p - with 50% of that going to the chosen charity, 40% to the content creator, and 10% to Good-Loop. She says the process makes viewers more engaged with brands because they have opted to watch the content rather than having it forced upon them. Playmob's Jude Ower believes recent political events in Europe and the US have fired up younger generations to get more involved in socially responsible causes.

Why is the latest X-Men comic controversial?,"The release of the first issue of X-Men Gold generated controversy in Indonesia Marvel Comics has had to apologise and alter its latest comic release after one of its artists made hidden references to an ongoing political controversy in Indonesia. The imagery included by Indonesian Muslim Ardian Syaf, a freelance contributor to Marvel, was called ""bigoted"" and he was accused of ""spreading hatred"" by social media users. Some even saw anti-Semitic sentiment in his artwork. The first issue of Marvel's latest X-Men Gold series was released in early April. The entertainment giant has since said it will take the offending references out of subsequent print editions, as well as take disciplinary action. The artist has also spoken to Indonesian media following the controversy, saying while he was expressing a political view, he was not trying to spread hate. Mr Syaf was able to get two politically-charged references into the comic. The first reference was spotted on metallic Russian mutant Colossus, who wears an innocent-looking T-shirt during a baseball game. The shirt has the words 'QS 5:51' on it - a reference to a passage in the Koran interpreted by some to mean that Muslims should not appoint Jews and Christians as their leader. The number 51 also appeared elsewhere throughout the issue, further referencing the passage. Mr Purnama is the first non-Muslim governor of Indonesia's capital Jakarta in 50 years The reason this is controversial is because it is widely seen as a reference to the case against the governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, widely known as Ahok. Mr Purnama - a Christian of Chinese descent - is currently on trial for blasphemy. He angered many hard-line Muslims after he referenced the passage while campaigning last year. The prosecution says he insulted Islam. Mr Purnama insists his comments were aimed at politicians ""incorrectly"" using the Koranic verse to make a case against his re-election. If convicted, he faces a maximum five-year jail sentence. Who is Jakarta's non-Muslim governor? The blasphemy trial testing Indonesian identity Indonesia blasphemy: Emotional scenes as Ahok trial begins The second reference came in a panel scene involving mutant and X-Men leader Kitty Pryde, who was seen addressing a crowd on the street. The number ""212"" is written on a wall in this scene. Many readers noted its significance - thelargest-ever street protestorganised by hard-line Muslim demonstrators against Mr Purnama took place on 2 December (2-12) 2016. Mr Syaf had previously said that he participated in this rally. In this panel, the numbers ""212"" referenced a significant political date in Jakarta Marvel has since distanced itself from Mr Syaf's work and issued the following statement. ""The mentioned artwork was inserted without knowledge behind its reported meanings. These implied references do not reflect the views of the writer, editors or anyone else at Marvel and are in direct opposition of the inclusiveness of Marvel Comics and what the X-Men have stood for since their creation."" The X-Men are mutants who tackle bigotry as they fight for equality and peace with humans. Illustrator Gary Choo, who has previously worked on Marvel artwork and covers, says sneaking political opinions and ideals into comics isn't something new. ""Politics should continue to find its way into comic books,"" he told the BBC. ""But for what Marvel represents, this episode definitely did not fit into Marvel's storytelling."" The X-Men series touches on mutants who are persecuted by society Mr Syaf has been responding to the outcry on his personal Facebook page saying those who were angry ""did not know him"". ""My career is over now. It's the consequence [of] what I did. Please, no more mockery, debate, no more hate. My apologies for all the noise. Good bye. May God bless you all,"" hesaid,externalon Tuesday. But that has not stopped angry reaction from Marvel fans and readers. ""No one needs to ""know you"" to understand what you did,"" wrote Andy Apsay on Facebook. ""It was blatant and intentional. Swallow your pride. You are not bigger than Marvel."" Others like Gusti Made Sumariana said the artist was ""spreading hatred towards Christians and Jews"" with his work. ""Keep your bigotry out of the X-Men,"" wrote another Facebook user. But the reaction has spiralled into a heated debate on the social media site, with supporters of Mr Syaf coming to his defence. ""People are free to react how they may. Artists are free to express what they do,"" wrote one user in Indonesian on Facebook.

Robot snake slithers to ocean missions,"The self-propelling Eelume robot moves like a snake through the water In the near future, ocean search-and-repair specialists won't need arms or legs, according to one vision. In fact, they are destined to be much more slithery. ""We try to get people to move away from the word snake because it's seen as kind of scary but even I find myself all the time calling it a snake,"" says Richard Mills from marine tech firm Kongsberg. If the idea of a swimming robot snake doesn't appeal, you might want to skip the next few paragraphs. I first mentioned Eelume to a friend who asked me whether I would be allowed to have a swim with it. I was secretly relieved that the answer was no. What started as a university robotics research project in Norway 10 years ago, has become a commercial prototype - and it is unavoidably snake-like. It's designed to inspect structures on the sea bed and carry out repairs, and is currently being tested on oil rigs. ASV Global describes the controller for its remotely operated vessel as being like ""an Xbox controller on steroids"" The flexible, self-propelling, tubular device has a camera at each end and is kitted out with sensors. Because it has a modular design, its parts can be switched to suit different tasks, with swappable tools including a grabber and cleaning brush. The design allows the robot to work in confined spaces that might be inaccessible to other vehicles, as well as to wriggle its body to stay in place in strong currents. And because it is designed to connect itself to a seabed dock when not in use, it can be deployed at any time whatever the surface conditions. It isn't yet on the market, but was recently on show at the Southampton's Ocean Business trade fair. The Eelume robot sea snake that could one day explore the Titanic Future plans already include a cheap 3D-printed model and another which can operate in very deep water. ""Something like going inside the Titanic, where divers can't, is a great opportunity that we could look at in the future,"" said Mr Mills. ""We are only limited by imagination in where we can take this vehicle."" Just as driverless cars are causing excitement on land, autonomous boats are also making a splash. ""Unmanned systems allow you to focus on the data,"" said Dan Hook from UK firm ASV Global, which was also at the Southampton expo. The vessel can run for up to five days at a time either autonomously or via remote control ""You stay on board your ship in a warm, dry location, you can focus on the data and where to send the unmanned system next."" The firm's two autonomous vessels - which can also be operated via remote control -  currently run on diesel generators rather than battery power. ""We're seeing increasing regulation on the types of engines we can use - it's a good thing to force you into the cleaner engines,"" he said. ""They are quieter and more efficient... but the future is electric, we're seeing it in cars, it's happening in our industry as well."" Batteries from the specialist battery-maker Steatite's have to function at low temperatures and high pressure, and power deep-sea devices for days at a time. This is the battery that will be tested on Boaty McBoatface Lithium-sulfur battery tech, already in the sights of electric car makers, is set to be trialled on board the famous autosub trio collectively known as Boaty McBoatface later this year - and it will be a Steatite creation. ""Lithium-sulfur is the next generation from lithium-ion,"" said the firm's Paul Edwards. ""It's got a better energy density, so you get more energy for the amount of weight you are carrying."" The Deep Trekker sub can go for six to eight hours - but its operator can't But if you think that it is battery life that holds marine tech back, then think again. It is more likely to be your concentration span, said Sam McDonald, president of a Canadian firm called Deep Trekker. The firm was demonstrating two remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) - the larger of which was about the size of a small child. Ms McDonald said that the operator would become tired before the ROV did. ""I need to take a break after three or four hours of running it,"" she said. ""You're looking at a screen the whole time, it takes a great deal of concentration. ""You're trying to hold position under the water, looking at infrastructure or watching tools or divers work, you're constantly moving your hands and eyes,"" she explained. If that sounds exhausting imagine being in charge of a whole load of them at once. Return to sender... rewards will be offered for washed-up ecosubs Planet Ocean was showing off the ecosub - a small, thigh-sized device that looks a bit like an old shell casing and is designed to ""swim"" in shoals, with each individual sub packed with different sensors to build up collectively a strong picture of the group's watery environment. One ""pilot"" can oversee many simultaneously, and they are so small that each individual sub can only carry four or five sensors, said managing director Terry Sloane. ""If they bump into each other it's not a big disaster,"" he said. ""They only weigh 5kg [11lb] on land"". Keen to encourage recycling, Mr Sloane is prepared to offer a bounty for washed-up ecosubs that find their way to the beach - there's a hotline number on the casing for eagle-eyed beachcombers to call. ""We don't want to leave things floating around in the ocean, but it doesn't take many hours of searching for one to make it uneconomical to recover,"" he said.

Election Tour de France: South-west voters want change,"Pensioner Genevieve is excited to meet someone from ""Brexit Britain"" and wishes France could also leave the European Union To find out what French voters make of their forthcoming presidential election, I am following the route of the Tour de France and this week I've reached the south-west of the country. Pensioner Genevieve has just ordered the plat du jour as I walk into the beautiful Veloc cafe in Perigueux and, as this is her birthday lunch, she's telling the cafe owner with a flirtatious wink, she's already got her eye on one of his bottled prunes afterwards as a ""special little treat for a special little old lady"".  She turns her infectious smile to me. ""Ooh!"" she says when I tell her who I am. ""How lovely, a lady from Brexit Britain. I think Brexit's great. I'd like France to get out of Europe so she could find her own identity again."" All the way down the Dordogne valley, Britain's influence is hard to ignore. The region is home to so many British expats that it's often dubbed Dordogne-shire. They may not have got the French eating Marmite quite yet but they certainly have got the locals chewing over the results of last June's referendum and wondering what a Frexit might taste like. Unlike some of his customers, cafe owner Christophe Constantin feels thoroughly European Cafe owner Christophe Constantin shakes his head firmly when I ask whether he sees France's future outside Europe. Since opening his cafe six months ago he explains, 27 different nationalities have walked through his door. And he feels thoroughly European, he adds. His neighbour Thomas listens in as he sips coffee at the bar. ""I think there's a strong current pushing for France to leave the EU actually,"" he says. ""I think there's a strong possibility that we'll be out - perhaps not in these elections but maybe after the next. The EU needs to reform to avoid this total divorce."" Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has made renegotiating France's membership of the EU one of her key campaign promises. She has vowed to pull France out of the euro and to hold a referendum on a new deal. Since France has a constitution that states that the ""Republic is part of the European Union"" however, any Frexit would require a constitutional change. French election 2017: Who are the candidates? France's presidential election: Everything you need to know The two uniformed men on the street opposite the cafe laugh when I suggest that it is unlikely that the Front National would be able to get such a constitutional change approved. ""Don't worry, we'll watch how Britain does it first,"" says one. Back inside the cafe, Genevieve's charm has won over Christophe and she's contentedly tucking into her freebie birthday prune.  She beckons me over. ""I'm voting Le Pen,"" she says. ""Because she wants to close the borders, just like Trump is doing in America."" She licks the last of the syrup from her spoon. ""Let's make France great again!"" The castle at Pau, one of the stages on the route of the Tour de France cycling race Three hundred kilometres (186 miles) further south and in his office in Pau's town hall, centrist Mayor Francois Bayrou looks out on to the imposing snowy peaks of the Pyrenees. For years, he's been trying to tell the French that they have been imprisoned by a two-party system - between a Left and a Right that will never concede there might be a third way. ""But that has to change now,"" says Mr Bayrou who has stood as a centrist candidate in the last three presidential elections. ""We need to unite people and we need to reform. The Socialist Party is decomposing and the Republican right is in civil war."" Francois Bayrou, a former centrist presidential candidate and Mayor of Pau, says he will now support Emmanuel Macron This year it won't be Mr Bayrou who is representing the centrists. It is the younger, staunchly pro-European Emmanuel Macron with his brand new movement En Marche. Emmanuel Macron borrows creeds from left and right and his centrist approach has already won him more than 100,000 supporters nationally but it has left others suspicious and confused. ""What does he really stand for?"" asks a woman on her way to work. ""I'm not sure I trust him."" ""I will probably vote Macron, but with no enthusiasm or conviction,"" says a retired man strolling through the park. ""But maybe we should try something a little bit different."" Residents of Mirail, a poor suburb of Toulouse, believe the neighbourhood carries a stigma that is hard to live down My next stop is Mirail, a poor and largely immigrant suburb of Toulouse. In this ""sensitive neighbourhood,"" as the French call it, they need a political solution that is radically different.  The police won't even come here let alone the politicians. ""If you want to talk about Islam or about terrorism, I'm off,"" warns a young man in a grey hoodie at Kada's burger stall. ""We need to talk about jobs - that's what we need to talk about - work is the problem here, not Islam."" His friend shouts over him. ""Politicians know damn well what we need. They've known for years. ""Why would I vote when no-one represents my neighbourhood or me?"" Young men in Mirail want jobs and opportunities and a president who could offer them those Kada, who runs the burger stall, nods at the groups of men clustering round him. ""If you come from a sink estate like this, believe me you're stigmatised. But give us jobs and watch what we can do."" Kada believes it's his civic duty to vote but he understands why so many of his customers won't be voting. ""Look at this social collapse, this poverty. People don't want us to feel as French as everyone else. I want a president who can lift us up from all this."" Shopkeeper Klams says he has never voted and has seen no sign of change in 20 years In his telephone repair shop, Klams sorts through tiny screws on his workshop counter as he hums along to his latest rap song about divisive politics. Although he has left-wing sympathies, he has never voted because, as he says, even the Socialists seem to want to clamp down on Muslims - always banging on about Muslim women wearing headscarves. He searches my face for traces of irony when I suggest that perhaps he needs to vote so his voice will be heard. ""In 20 years, nothing's changed in this neighbourhood,"" he says. ""Politicians just forget us the minute the elections are over."" He picks up a screwdriver. ""That's why I vote God.""

Turkey's critics abroad fear Erdogan's reach,"Protests gripped Rotterdam in March when a Dutch ban on visits by Turkish ministers enraged Ankara How do Turks in the Netherlands feel about Turkey's controversial referendum on 16 April? Turks living abroad are already voting - deciding whether to give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sweeping new powers. The BBC's Anna Holligan looks at the tensions gripping the Dutch-Turkish community. A convivial mood emanates from the crowds flashing ID cards and smiles, as they stream through metal barriers outside a temporary polling station, set up inside a convention centre in a suburb of The Hague. Families link arms, children catch melting ice-cream with the tips of their tongues. Some women wear headscarves, others let their bleached hair flow, men hug and share jokes in their mother tongue. Plain-clothes police officers keep a cautious watch across the street. About 250,000 Dutch-Turks are eligible to vote.  Along with the millions in Germany, a politically-engaged diaspora could swing what is expected to be a tight result. Two young men made the one-hour round trip from Rotterdam to mark their ballot because ""it's the motherland'. The 25-year-old grins - one day he will go and live there forever. He voted ""yes"" because ""Erdogan is a good man who can make the country better"". Why is Turkey holding a referendum? Turkish-German ties fray Turkey 'spied' on opponents in Germany Erdogan critic Sinan Can: ""Every day it's getting worse. I'm afraid someone will get killed"" But those who hold different views take a risk by expressing them. Sinan Can's documentary work has made him unpopular with the pro-Erdogan lobby based in the Netherlands. ""When I went to vote they called me a traitor, if you're critical of Erdogan you're considered disloyal to Turkey. Fear is the biggest problem among Turks here. ""They say if I go to Turkey they'll get me and lock me up. Gulenists have a lot of death threats, every day it's getting worse. I'm afraid someone will get killed,"" he said. He has not been home for three years. And last week's detention of 10 Dutch-Turkish holidaymakers was evidence that this isn't paranoia. Mr Erdogan's AK Party says the botched military coup last July was instigated by US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally turned enemy. Turks first moved to the Netherlands as ""guest workers"" during the post-war economic boom in the 1960s and 1970s. Now they are third- and fourth-generation. Many of those who were born and educated in this secular society feel a greater affinity with the Islamic country of their ancestors. And this romanticised nostalgia is buoyed by propaganda pumped out by satellite TV and other state-funded channels. The long arm of Mr Erdogan is felt through the Turkish government's influence on the diaspora. Hakan Buyuk works for the Dutch-Turkish weekly newspaper Zaman Vandaag - he has been told by police to keep a low profile after reporting threats to his life. ""The Union of European Turkish Democrats functions as the AKP in Europe. Diyanet - the directorate of religious affairs - is funded by the Turkish government and runs about 150 mosques in the Netherlands,"" he says. Turks are deciding whether to give President Erdogan sweeping new powers Last month Dutch police fired water cannons to disperse a pro-Erdogan crowd outside the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam, protesting after two Turkish ministers were barred from addressing a rally. Mr Erdogan fired back with insults, calling the Dutch ""Nazi remnants"" and accusing them of presiding over the genocidal slaughter of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995. ""It just makes them more passionate about him,"" says Thijl Sunier, professor of cultural anthropology at the Free University of Amsterdam. He tells me Dutch-Turks see Mr Erdogan through rose-tinted glasses. ""They don't experience the negatives caused by his policies, all the economic crumbling...  they're looking at him from a distance, they're impressed by the macho way he does politics."" ""We are very concerned,"" says Han Ten Broeke, the liberal VVD party's foreign affairs spokesman. ""We are a free and open society. This monitoring makes people silent. We get diversions, intimidation and violence. We simply cannot tolerate that in this country. ""There's been a surge in police reports of Turks who feel threatened by other Turks - these are Dutch people and it's happening in the midst of our society."" The Dutch government believes these ties to a country led by someone seen as the authoritarian antithesis of Dutch liberal tolerance is one of the greatest impediments to Turkish integration. Schilderswijk in The Hague: Many Dutch-born Turks show strong loyalty to Turkey Some working-class neighbourhoods are divided along ethnic lines - places like Feijenoord, a Rotterdam district, and Schilderswijk in The Hague. There it is ""proud Turks"" versus nationalist white Dutchmen, like Erwin, who tells me the Turks need to ""get more Dutch - we're not trying to make them walk in clogs, but they have to stop trying to grab onto the past"". Prof Sunier says this push is more influential than the pull Dutch-Turks feel from Ankara. ""If we continue to see people with a Turkish background as foreigners, even when they are born and raised here, it creates this feeling that even when they have a Dutch passport, speak Dutch, have a Dutch education, still they cannot reach higher levels - this is more important than all the efforts of Erdogan."" The AKP - enjoying very solid support in Turkey - is even more popular among foreign-born Turks. In Turkey's November 2015 election 70% of Dutch-Turks voted Erdogan. Such powerful political influence over a large ethnic minority poses challenges not only for the Netherlands but for Europe in general.

Meet the female entrepreneurs making tech work for good,"When Jude Ower entered the gaming industry she was one of very few women Jude Ower loved playing video games as a child, but she never dreamed that her passion would eventually become a force for good and win her accolades and honours. After 12 years making games for education and training, she went on to create an international games platform with a social conscience - Playmob. ""After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Zynga, the creator of Farmville, launched a campaign to raise funds for the victims by selling an in-game item, with a percentage of each purchase going to help the victims,"" she explains. ""It was massively successful and raised over $1m in a matter of days. It was then I thought: 'Maybe I could make a platform that connected games and causes?'"" Playmob pairs games developers or businesses with a charity and then sets up in-game advertising campaigns. By clicking on links within the game, players can make donations. The campaigns have helped more than 3,000 teenagers receive counselling for cyber-bullying, provided protection for 31 pandas, and secured education for 8,500 children in Africa and Asia, the company says. ""With Playmob we can track the social impact, such as number of trees planted, number of meals provided, water wells built, and so forth,"" she says. ""This allows players to see that the more they play and interact with the branded content, the more good they do."" So far the games platform has raised more than $1m for charities over the past five years, and more than 1.5 million players have interacted with charitable in-game content. Her success saw her awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 2015 for services to entrepreneurship and she's been voted one of the top 100 Women in Tech in Europe. Ms Ower is just one of a growing number of entrepreneurs - many of them women - exploring how technology can be harnessed in the cause of philanthropy. This is tech for social good, or ""philtech"" as it's sometimes called. Erin Michelson had all the trappings of financial success but felt ""terribly unhappy"" Erin Michelson's high-flying banking career took her to Hong Kong, Chicago, New York and San Francisco, where she rose to vice president and director of philanthropic management at Bank of America. But despite seemingly having it all, she felt there was something missing. ""I realised that even though I had all the trappings of success, I was terribly unhappy,"" she says. ""So I quit my job, sold everything I owned, set up a charitable fund, and headed out on a two-year around-the-world trip volunteering with humanitarian organisations."" Taking only one suitcase, she spent 720 days travelling to 62 countries across all seven continents - an adventure that helped her find meaning in her life, she says. After writing a book about her experiences, she returned to San Francisco and founded Summery, a data analytics company that has developed a piece of online software similar to theMyers-Briggs personality test,external. Summery helps firms match their charitable projects with their employees' personalities The program combines behavioural science and analytics to give employers an idea of their staff's social priorities and attitudes towards giving, which she says helps inform companies how to focus their charitable efforts. ""The test matches you with one of 10 'giving' personalities and provides a snapshot of your giving DNA, one of 59,048 possibilities,"" says Ms Michelson. By taking the guesswork out of charitable giving, she says it can improve the relationship between employer and staff, to everyone's benefit. ""Engaged employees lead not only to better corporate performance, but also significant cost savings through stronger retention and more targeted recruitment based on cultural appreciation,"" she says. Richard Craig, chief executive of the Technology Trust, which helps charitable organisations use tech more effectively, says: ""Over the last couple of years there has been a noticeable trend in graduates specifically looking for roles in charities and non-profits who might previously have looked to careers in the City, for example. ""I am seeing the same trend with technology start-ups, with a proportion looking to deliver social good either as non-profits themselves, or commercial organisation with social purpose."" Good-Loop's Amy Williams says she saw ""untapped potential"" in online advertising It was while working for an advertising agency in London that Amy Williams had her ""philtech epiphany"". ""I saw firsthand the huge amount of money that gets passed from one big conglomerate to another, buying and selling the cheap commodity of our attention online,"" she says. ""The stark contrast between these two worlds really hit me - Â£4.7bn was spent on online advertising in the UK last year."" She quit and went travelling, working as a volunteer for a small charity in Argentina called Food For Thought, which specialises in nutrition education for kids. ""I started started to see the untapped potential within online advertising to make some real positive impact."" Inspired by her experiences, she founded Good-Loop, a company that rewards viewers of video ads with donations to their chosen charities. Brands create a video and if the visitor watches it for 15 seconds or more, the advertiser pays 50p - with 50% of that going to the chosen charity, 40% to the content creator, and 10% to Good-Loop. She says the process makes viewers more engaged with brands because they have opted to watch the content rather than having it forced upon them. Playmob's Jude Ower believes recent political events in Europe and the US have fired up younger generations to get more involved in socially responsible causes. ""We are seeing people leave well-paid jobs to take a risk and set up on their own, not just in the hope of creating a successful start-up, but to do something with purpose.""
