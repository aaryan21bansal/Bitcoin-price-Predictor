Kim's right-hand man 'carrying Trump note',"Kim Yong-chol has emerged as North Korea's lead negotiator in talks with the US One of North Korea's top negotiators is in Washington to meet US officials ahead of a possible second summit between the two countries' leaders. Kim Yong-chol is meeting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and could hold talks with President Donald Trump at the White House later, US media say. He reportedly has another letter from leader Kim Jong-un to Mr Trump. Little progress has been made on North Korean de-nuclearisation since their historic summit in Singapore last June. Speculation is mounting that a second meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump could be held in Vietnam. The North Korean leader is scheduled to travel to the communist-run country for an ""official state visit"" sometime in February, Reuters news agency reports, citing unnamed sources. Kim Yong-chol: Kim Jong-un's right hand man North Korea's breakdown of communication There has recently been a flurry of diplomatic activity.Kim Jong-un visited China earlier this monthfor talks with President Xi Jinping, as he did before the Singapore summit. Meanwhile, another senior North Korean official, vice-foreign minister Choe Son-hui, took part in talks in Sweden. Gen Kim, a former spymaster often referred to as Kim Jong-un's right-hand man, has emerged as North Korea's lead negotiator in recent talks with the US. He is a controversial figure and was accused of masterminding attacks on South Korean warships during his time as military intelligence chief in 2010. He last visited Washington in June, when he delivered a letter to Mr Trump ahead of historic talks between both countries.

The last time Mr Kim went to the US, his letter to Mr Trump appeared to have helped get the Singapore summit back on track. Negotiations between both countries have stalled since then, but this meeting could be what it takes to restart talks. This video can not be played How is North Korea evading sanctions? Earlier this month, Mr Trump said that the US and North Korea were negotiating over a location for another summit but US officials have not provided any further details. The meetings in Washington could finalise plans for the summit, but just as important, analysts say, would be an understanding of what the agenda would be. Kim Jong-un warns of 'change in direction' Denuclearisation: The word Trump and Kim can't agree on Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? In his annual new year's speech a few weeks ago, Mr Kim said he was committed to denuclearisation, but warned that he would change course if US sanctions remained. Both parties signed a pledge in Singapore to denuclearise the Korean peninsula, though it was never clear what this would entail.

Netflix subscribers rise to nearly 140m,"Sandra Bullock's character battles impossible odds throughout Bird Box Shows including Bird Box helped Netflix end 2018 with more than 139 million subscribers, adding 8.8 million members in the last three months of the year. The streaming giant said the growth reflected the success of its original programmes. Netflix-original material now represents the ""vast majority"" of its most popular shows, executives said. Television viewers in the US also spend an estimated 10% of their time on Netflix, they claimed. The figures accompanied the release of the firm's quarterly earnings report on Thursday. What's behind the success of Netflix's latest releases? Sleepless nights over Sandra Bullock's blindfold They offered investors a rare glimpse of audience viewing patterns, as the firm seeks to explain how its massive spending on content - much of it funded with debt - is paying off. The company released details of some of its most popular shows: Bird Box was watched by 80 million households in its first four weeks after release Spanish drama Elite was watched 20 million households in its first four weeks after release Netflix estimates that You and Sex Education will both be watched by 40 million households within their first four weeks of release Analysts estimate that Netflix spent more than $13bn on movies and shows this year. Netflix said its spending is likely to increase. ""Our multi-year plan is to keep significantly growing our content while increasing our revenue faster to expand our operating margins,"" Netflix said in a shareholder letter tied to the earnings report. ""Our growth is based on how good our experience is,"" it said. Netflix recently renewed Narcos: Mexico for a second season Shares, which had risen sharply in recent weeks, dipped more than 3% in after-hours trade, after revenue for the fourth quarter fell shy of analyst expectations. The firm reported quarterly revenue of $4.2bn (Â£3.2bn), up 27% from the same period in 2017. However, a price increase in the US and some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean announced this week has the potential to add some $1bn in revenue. The firm said it will also look to adjust prices elsewhere as currencies fluctuate, but warned the increases could lag behind the exchange rate shifts, causing revenue hiccoughs. George Salmon, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said he expected Netflix subscribers to swallow the higher fees. The 8.8 million rise in paid subscribers - most of them from overseas - marked 6% growth from the prior quarter. He added: ""The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren't going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers' eyeballs is only just getting started."" Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco In its letter to shareholders, there's a candid passage about where Netflix's real competition lies. It said it faces greater competition from people watching clips of video game Fortnite over those watching rival entertainment provider HBO. ""When YouTube went down global for a few minutes in October, our viewing and signups spiked for that time,"" it added. It's what makes predicting Netflix's future so interesting - they're not so much in the entertainment business, but the eyeballs business. You, the consumer, have more things than ever to look at, or interact with, and competition for Netflix will only get fiercer in 2019. In the letter, Netflix took time to big up its successes - Bird Box, which it estimates will be watched by 80 million households within four weeks of its release, and a Spanish-language exclusive, Elite, that has attracted more than 20 million. That's all positive news, but we'll learn more about the health of the company in three month's time, when we find out if consumers have a problem with Netflix's recent price hike in the US and some other countries. As for today's earnings, they are rather unremarkable: with the firm disappointing Wall Street on some measures (revenue) but outperforming expectation on others (subscriber growth). As I write this, shares are down - but I'd expect the price to recover quickly. What's behind Netflix's latest successes?

Student killed while on phone with sister,"Police released these images of Aiia Maasarwe, taken on the night she was killed A 21-year-old Israeli student was attacked and killed in Melbourne, Australia while speaking to her sister on the phone, police say. The body of Aiia Maasarwe, 21, was found near La Trobe University in the city's north. She had taken a tram home late on Tuesday after a comedy show. Her sister ""heard the sound of the phone falling to the ground and heard some voices"", officer Andrew Stamper said. Police are searching for the killer. They have not ruled out the possibility that Ms Maasarwe was sexually assaulted, Melbourne's Age newspaper says, with known sex offenders ""an active line of inquiry"". ""Our presumption at this stage is that this was a random attack and opportunistic,"" Detective Inspector Stamper told reporters. Ms Maasarwe was on an exchange programme at La Trobe University Ms Maasarwe's sister, worried about Aiia, is reported to have called Australian police around the same time the body was found on Wednesday morning outside a shopping centre. A black cap emblazoned with ""1986"" and a grey t-shirt were found near the crime scene,external, and are being forensically tested. Police are also scouring CCTV footage for clues. ""Someone in the community knows about this. Someone has gone home on Tuesday night, or in the early hours of Wednesday morning, maybe with blood on them, missing items of clothing. Somebody knows about this,"" said Mr Stamper. Flowers have been left at the scene where the body of the Israeli student was found outside a shopping centre Ms Maasarwe was a student of Chinese and English at a university in Shanghai, her uncle, Abed Katane, told Israeli media. She was on an exchange programme at La Trobe, he said. ""She was an excellent student, full of life. She wasn't in a very dangerous country at all, and yet we are still receiving such a painful message,"" Mr Katane told the Haaretz newspaper. Are backpackers worried about Australia? Vigil held for murdered Australia comedian Aiia Maasarwe's father has arrived to identify the body, which the Israeli embassy said it would assist with returning to Israel. Police are searching for the killer and scouring CCTV footage for clues Last June the killing of 22-year-old comedian Eurydice Dixon sparked fresh anger and debate about violence against women in Australia. Ms Dixon was raped and killed while walking home after a performance in Melbourne. That followed a similar case in 2012, when Irish woman Jill Meagher was raped and murdered in Melbourne's inner north while walking home - prompting mass rallies to remember her and raise the issue of women's safety. Jill Meagher's murder 'was preventable' Australia's human rights commission has said thatthe country has ""a disturbingly high rate of violence against women"",external. According to government figures,one in five women, and one in 20 men, have experienced sexual violence or threats since the age of 15,external. Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, draws large numbers of foreign students to its many universities. More than 200,000 students came to the state of Victoria in 2017 to study, according to the state government. Are backpackers worried about Australia?

BBC editor on trial over victim naming,"Arif Ansari checked his reporter's script before it was broadcast, the court heard BBC Asian Network's head of news has gone on trial over the naming of a victim of sexual abuse in a live radio broadcast, a charge he denies. Victims of sexual offences are given lifetime anonymity by law. The reporter who used the victim's name said he thought it was a pseudonym - and the charge was brought against Arif Ansari, in his capacity as editor. The woman was listening to the news when her name was read out and went into ""full meltdown"", the court heard. In a witness statement, the woman - a victim of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal - said she was ""panicking and crying"". She said she had found the process of giving evidence in the sex abuse trial at Sheffield Crown Court difficult and added: ""To then have my name given out as a victim of rape on a BBC radio station was unbelievable and made me feel sick"". Sheffield Magistrates' Court was told that Mr Ansari had the role of checking and approving content for broadcast on 6 February last year. Earlier that day, reporter Rickin Majithia had been in court to hear evidence in a trial linked to the Rotherham sex abuse scandal when a victim's real name was used. Giving evidence in the trial of Mr Ansari, Mr Majithia explained how the woman gave evidence in court from behind a screen and he wrongly assumed that when her forename was used in court, it was a pseudonym. The reporter said that he had a number of previous dealings with the woman as he investigated the Rotherham abuse scandal and had become confused, thinking that the name he had always called her was her real one, when it was not. He added that he had not done any court reporting before the incident and had never even sat in a crown court before to watch a case. The prosecution said this was significant because Mr Ansari knew that was the situation - and say the charge was brought against him as he had editorial responsibility for the output that was broadcast that day. On the day of the broadcast, Mr Majithia sent Mr Ansari his script for approval at about 16:35 GMT, and it was broadcast live at 17:00, the court heard. Mr Ansari did not query the name of the victim before approving the script, nor was the script checked by BBC lawyers. Immediately after the broadcast, Mr Majithia was alerted to the mistake, and it was not repeated. The court heard that, after mistakenly broadcasting her real name he wrote an email to the witness, saying: ""I made a human error. It was a moment of confusion I will regret forever."" But the email was not sent due to advice from his superiors, the court heard. The prosecution said it accepted Mr Ansari did not know or suspect the victim's real name was in the script but said he had good reason to suspect its use might be wrong because Mr Majithia was inexperienced. Prosecutors also described Mr Majithia as ""very driven and a bit of a loose cannon"", who had produced a ""very poor"" broadcast on the case earlier in the day. Mr Ansari is charged with breaching theSexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,external, which entitles all complainants of sexual offences to lifelong anonymity. From the moment a complaint of sexual abuse is made, all publishers and broadcasters are banned from naming the complainant unless they choose to waive their anonymity or a court orders otherwise. It is the first time a BBC editor has been charged under this Act. The trial, which is expected to last two days, continues.

Oxford University suspends Huawei donations,"The University of Oxford has suspended new donations and sponsorships from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. The firm is facing accusations from the US and other countries that its equipment could be used for espionage. Huawei has denied those claims, saying it doesn't pose a spying risk. The US is also reportedly investigating Huaweifor ""stealing trade secrets"" from US businesses, and has accused it of contravening sanctions by lying about its business in Iran. Oxford University said it had decided on 8 January that it will ""not pursue new funding opportunities... at present"" with Huawei. ""Huawei has been notified of the decision, which the university will keep under review. The decision applies both to the funding of research contracts and of philanthropic donations."" ""The decision has been taken in the light of public concerns raised in recent months surrounding UK partnerships with Huawei."" It added that it hoped those matters can be resolved shortly. It's believed the university is concerned about any potential government restrictions on the telecoms giant in the future. Oxford added that it would continue with its existing research contracts where Huawei funding has been received or committed. ""We currently have two such on-going projects, with a combined funding from Huawei of Â£692,000. Both projects were approved under the university's regulatory processes before the current levels of uncertainty arose,"" it said. A Huawei spokesman said: ""We have not been informed of this decision."" Analysis: BBC technology correspondent Mark Ward The bad news is piling up for Huawei. Alongside the arrest of staff in Canada and Poland are accusations that it stole trade secrets. It has denied the claims. The arrests follow increasing restrictions on its role in future US 5G mobile networks. Australia and New Zealand have followed suit. In the UK some of its kit has been removed from BT's network. A ban might soon come in Germany too. The bans aside, the company is doing well. In 2018 it shipped more than 200 million handsets - second only to Samsung. It warned that 5G without Huawei would be a shadow of what it could become. Like the NBA without its stars, it said. For some governments that might be a price worth paying. Huawei, which has about 1,500 employees in the UK, collaborates with a number of universities in the country, including Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Imperial College London, Manchester and York. The Chinese firm has made a $7.5m donation to the 5G Innovation Centre at the University of Surrey, and more than $1m to the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory.

Trump cancels Pelosi trip over shutdown,"Mr Trump has postponed Ms Pelosi's trip a day after she called on him to postpone his address to Congress US President Donald Trump has postponed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's upcoming trip to Brussels and Afghanistan, asking her to stay to negotiate an end to the partial US government shutdown. The president was able to halt the trip by denying the use of military aircraft to Mrs Pelosi and a delegation. On Wednesday Mrs Pelosi had urged Mr Trump to postpone his State of the Union address, amid political deadlock. Mr Trump's move came on the 27th day of the US's longest-ever federal shutdown. The Republican president wants $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) of congressional funding to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, but Democrats have refused. Mr Trump's cancellation of the trip emerged less than an hour before the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives was scheduled to leave on Thursday afternoon, US media say. 'I can't get my meds because of Trump' Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting Six ways the US shutdown ends White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders shared the president's letter in a tweet.

""I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown,"" Mr Trump wrote. The president added that Mrs Pelosi could proceed with the trip - which he described as a ""public relations event"" - using a commercial airline. Later on Thursday the White House announced it would not send a US delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland later this month, over the shutdown. ""Out of consideration for the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay and to ensure his team can assist as needed, President Trump has cancelled his delegation's trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,"" Mrs Sanders said in a statement. Mr Trump had previously said he would not attend, and on Tuesday announced a scaled-back delegation, which was to be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. This video can not be played Just why has the US government partially shut down? Drew Hammill, Mrs Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, said her travel to Afghanistan had required a stop in Brussels to allow pilots to rest, as well as to meet top Nato commanders ""to affirm the United States' ironclad commitment"" to the alliance. How will history judge President Trump? Mr Hammill said the plans did not include a visit to Egypt, and noted that Mr Trump and Republicans have travelled during a shutdown. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs Pelosi's travel had not been announced before Mr Trump's letter. Some commentators expressed dismay that the president would reveal plans about a trip to a war zone by a congresswoman who is third in line to the presidency. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News The shutdown chess match between Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi has turned into a game of checkers. The House speaker threatens to take away his State of the Union Address? The president erases her congressional trip to Afghanistan. Jump-jump-jump. Your move. The White House had reportedly been caught flat-footed by Ms Pelosi's State of the Union announcement on Wednesday and was searching for ways to circumvent the speaker's threatened roadblock. There's still no obvious solution for them, but that hasn't kept the president from firing back. How the American public perceives this tit-for-tat is an open question. At least so far, the president appears to be shouldering the lion's share of the blame for the government shutdown. At some point, however, the governmental dysfunction could drag everyone down. Meanwhile, 800,000 federal employees continue to work - or sit at home - without pay. Government websites crash, services grind to a halt and the economic toll begins to mount. This has become a zero-sum battle where the costs of continuing to fight are matched only by the political price to be paid if a side backs down. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters Mr Trump's action ""demeans the presidency"" while Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called Mrs Pelosi's threat to cancel the state of the union address ""irresponsible"" and Mr Trump's response ""also inappropriate"".

A White House aide told US media that the trip ""would have guaranteed"" that federal workers would miss their second paycheque ""because [Mrs Pelosi] would not have been here to negotiate any kind of deal"". However, Mr Trump has not banned Mrs Pelosi from going - just from using military aircraft. Later on Thursday, Melania Trump used a military plane to fly to the family's private resort in Florida ahead of the long holiday weekend, US media reported. Fox News also reports that members of Congress who were due to join the trip were left sitting on a US Air Force bus at Capitol Hill as staff at the Capitol, State, Pentagon and White House scrambled to handle the situation.

Speaker Bercow 'could be denied peerage',"Speaker John Bercow has been criticised by some Tory MPs Such is the anger with the Speaker at senior levels of government, it has been suggested he could be blocked from getting a peerage when he retires. Ministers are furious at what they see as John Bercow's ""bias"" during Commons debates on Brexit. The move would break a tradition dating back 230 years, that former Commons Speakers are automatically offered a seat in the House of Lords. A Cabinet source said: ""It's a good job peerage nominations are in our gift."" They added: ""I'm sure we'll be thinking carefully about which individuals we would choose to elevate to the House of Lords. ""I can't imagine we would look favourably on those who've cheated centuries of procedure."" By tradition, retiring Speakers have stood down as MPs at the same time triggering a by-election. They are thenawarded a peerage at the request of the Commons,external, in a motion asking the Queen to ""confer some signal mark of Her Royal favour"" upon them. After a recommendation from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace, they then sit in the Upper House as a crossbencher, an independent. This is what happened the last time a Speaker stood down. Michael Martin was ousted ten years ago over his handling of the expenses scandal. But, despite criticism at the time,he became Lord Martin of Springburn,external. Lord Martin died last year. John Bercow has faced criticism from MPs for months. In October hetold friends he intends to stand down as Speaker this summer, following a report which condemned a culture in Parliament in which abusive behaviour was ""tolerated and covered up."" Mr Bercow has also faced allegations of bullying, which he has strenuously denied. Earlier this month, plenty of people within the government were furious with the Buckingham MP, saying he broke precedent and ignored the advice of his officials ina heated row about parliamentary procedure over Brexit. Critics within government saw this as proof that he was unable to be impartial over Brexit, and was determined to make life difficult for the government. Two years ago, Mr Bercowrevealed that he voted Remain in the EU referendum. Asked about the prospect of being denied a peerage when he retires, a spokeswoman for the Speaker declined to comment. A Downing Street spokesman said on Friday: ""We don't recognise this story and we have quite enough to be getting on with at the moment.""

Brexit continues to divide parliamentarians in the wake of the crushing defeat of the prime minister's Brexit deal earlier this week, when it was rejected in the Commons by 230 votes. Having narrowly survived a no-confidence vote on Wednesday, Theresa May has called on politicians from all sides ""to put self-interest aside"" and ""work constructively together"" to help her find a consensus for a new Brexit plan. The PM will publish a new plan on Monday with a full debate and key vote scheduled for Tuesday 29 January. Brexit: A really simple guide May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? So far she has held talks with senior figures from the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru  - as well as members of the DUP and Tory Brexiteers. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn remains adamant that he will not take part in the talks unless the threat of no-deal Brexit is ruled out. In addition, Mr Corbyn has urged Labour MPs not to take part in any talks while a no-deal Brexit remains an option. The prime minister has said it is ""not within the government's power"" to rule out a no-deal, and the ""door remains open"".

Shoreham jury shown footage of crash,"This video can not be played The Hawker Hunter crashed into A27 in Shoreham Jurors have been shown footage of a fatal jet crash at the Shoreham Airshow in which 11 men died. Andy Hill's Hawker Hunter jet hit the ground and exploded after he attempted a manoeuvre known as the bent loop, the Old Bailey has heard. The court was shown several clips of the moment the vintage aircraft erupted into a ""massive fireball"" upon crashing into the A27 in August 2015. Mr Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. On the second day of the trial, Prosecutor Tom Kark QC played a series of videos recorded by spectators. He warned jurors they may find the footage, parts of which were filmed by a witness standing behind some of the victims, ""distressing"". ""You are in effect seeing these gentleman in the last few seconds of their lives,"" he said. One clip, filmed by a spectator on the road, shows the aircraft going into the loop manoeuvre before coming towards the camera. It ends with images of the fireball, with the footage cutting out as the person filming throws themselves to the ground. A second piece of footage shows the aircraft descend behind a group of trees before bursting into flames. Jurors were also shown a clip filmed inside the aircraft's cockpit. Lasting about a minute, the footage shows the jet performing a banking turn and a loop before inverting and descending, ending with the impact. The court has heard the aircraft erupted in a ""massive fireball"" upon impact David Evans, a member of the Shoreham Airshow's flying committee, said he had watched as Mr Hill performed the manoeuvre. Giving evidence, the former Civil Aviation Authority air display director said the jet ""was quite slow; it was quite low"". ""That's when I thought 'my god' this doesn't look very good. It was, in my opinion, a bit low to undertake the manoeuvre,"" he told the jury. Asked if he took any action to halt the display, he replied: ""I think it had gone beyond that point."" Mr Kark told jurors Mr Hill chose to perform the ""highest risk"" manoeuvre possible before the fatal crash. He had committed the ""cardinal sin"" of trying to complete the trick while apparently lacking the height to do so, the Old Bailey heard. Jonathan Whaley, a ""very experienced ex-Royal Navy pilot"" who has flown more than 1,200 hours in a Hawker Hunter, had reviewed footage of the crash, Mr Kark told the court. Mr Whaley had concluded the pilot ""made a conscious decision to pull through the loop even though he appeared to be too low to do so"", Mr Kark said. Mr Whaley described this as a ""cardinal sin,"" jurors were told. The court heard that Mr Whaley viewed the bent loop as ""perhaps the highest risk manoeuvre in an aircraft which is not designed as pure aerobatic aircraft"", such as a Hawker Hunter. The prosecution argued Andy Hill was flying too low to complete a manoeuvre while performing at the Shoreham Airshow in 2015 Prosecutor Mr Kark said the crash, which killed ten victims instantly, was the inevitable outcome of a ""catalogue of errors"" on the defendant's part. He told jurors they would need to decide whether ""the true reason Mr Hill crashed his aircraft was his dreadful negligence"". ""At the crucial point when Mr Hill committed to the downward part of the loop there was a serious and obvious risk of death to those on the ground - a risk that was to be tragically realised,"" he said. Karim Khalil QC, defending, argued g-forces acting upon the jet rendered Mr Hill ""unable to properly and fully control the aircraft"". Mr Hill ""was not in full control of his actions"" and the errors were ""simply too numerous"" to have been made by a pilot of his experience unless he was suffering from ""cognitive impairment"",  Mr Khalil told the jury. Andy Hill had ""responded professionally"" to errors made at previous air shows, the court heard Jurors have been told Mr Hill was known to take risks, and a previous air show display had been halted due to his ""dangerous"" flying. Defence barrister Mr Khalil said Mr Hill was ""not a cavalier pilot"", nor one ""who plays fast and loose with the safety rules or the lives of others"". He said the defence would provide evidence to show criticisms of Mr Hill were either ""wrong or misplaced"". Acknowledging previous mistakes made by Mr Hill at air shows, Mr Khalil said: ""It would be a remarkable pilot indeed who had never made an error."" The defence argued Mr Hill had ""responded professionally"" and taken steps to avoid repeating the mistakes. The trial is expected to last up to seven weeks.

Laura Kuenssberg: Meetings aren't a Plan BFrance activates no-deal Brexit planWhat does the DUP want from Brexit talks?Brexit: Are we running out of parliamentary time?,"Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. It's clear, wide open, in public, that the cabinet is at odds with each other. Just listen to David Gauke and Liam Fox on whether a customs union could be a compromise for example. The answer for her is not suddenly going to emerge from a unified tier of her top team. There are perhaps five or six of the cabinet who would be happy to see that kind of relationship as a way to bring Labour on board. But there is a group of around the same size who would rather see what they describe as a ""managed no deal"". You may well wonder if that isn't a contradiction in terms. But the principle would be that the UK would pay the divorce bill already agreed and over a two-year period construct a series of side deals on specific issues, rather than try to come up with a whole new comprehensive plan. There are already intense arguments about whether that's remotely realistic. But the overall point is that the prime minister cannot just therefore look to her top colleagues for an immediate solution. Before she decides which way to tack, or how far to budge, she may need to ask herself if the talks she wants to hold with other political parties are occasions when she is really open to ideas - or just ways of managing the political situation. One cabinet minister involved in the talks suggested that many MPs still needed to understand how the agreement they have reached with the EU worked. And that as ""project reality"" dawned, there could still be a way through of salvaging Mrs May's deal in something like its current form. And certainly there wasn't much in the PM's lectern statement to suggest she is suddenly ready to move very much. One former minister described it as ""still flicking the V at the 48% - she's deluded, she never changes her mind and cannot conceive that others might"". If all that the prime minister intends to do is massage a few egos with these talks, it seems unlikely that she'll find a quick route to success. And Labour may well stay outside the process. Many members of the public might be furious that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn won't play nice during a time of crisis. He's always said he believes in dialogue, but when it really matters, he says no. But inside the Labour movement there are others who might accuse of him of helping to make Brexit happen if he takes part. Like so many facets of this process, it's not a straightforward political calculation. But across Parliament, for a very long time now, even some MPs who were on the prime minister's side to start with have been intensely frustrated that she hasn't listened. It will take a lot more than a cup of tea in Downing Street to bring her many critics on board.

France activates no-deal Brexit planWhat does the DUP want from Brexit talks?Brexit: Are we running out of parliamentary time?,"France will spend millions of euros preparing ports and airports for a no-deal Brexit French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said a no-deal Brexit looks ""less and less unlikely"" and has launched a contingency plan to prepare for it. After the UK Parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement, Mr Philippe said laws had to be passed and millions invested in French ports and airports. An EU official will now visit all 27 capitals to co-ordinate no-deal plans. EU countries with close UK ties have already begun preparing for its departure on 29 March without a deal. ""We are taking this very seriously now as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is becoming more possible after Tuesday night,"" said European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas. ""This is work which is ongoing and it's developing fully. We are not taking any chances."" He also revealed that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and UK Prime Minister Theresa May had texted each other since her defeat in Parliament on Tuesday, but said they had not spoken.

Some â¬50m (Â£44m; $57m) would be invested in ports and airports, focusing on control points and parking areas, with the possible appointment of 580 customs and veterinary staff. Ireland'sprime minister Leo Varadkar updated the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) about the Dublin government's plans for legislation on a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. Of all the EU member states, Ireland has the closest links to the UK and much of the government's non-priority business is being scrapped to focus on measures covering health, communications, education, finance, employment and justice. Medicine 'watch list' in Irish no-deal plan The Netherlands'foreign trade minister, Sigrid Kaag, said on Wednesday night that the Netherlands was launching a major information campaign on 28 January. ""After Ireland, the Dutch economy is most entwined with that of the UK,"" she said, citing fisheries, meat-processing and flower exports. She warned that many small and medium enterprises had failed to make sufficient preparation for a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit warning for UK drivers Germany'sforeign minister, Heiko Maas, said on Thursday that plans for a disorderly Brexit would have to be stepped up. ""In the coming days and weeks, we will do everything we can so that Britain exits with and not without an agreement,"" he told the Bundestag (German parliament). Spainsaid on Thursday that staffing of immigration offices would be beefed up if the UK left the EU without a deal. Some 310,000 UK citizens live in Spain and they would have to confirm their residency under a no-deal Brexit, officials said.

What does the DUP want from Brexit talks?Brexit: Are we running out of parliamentary time?,"The DUP insists it will not support a Brexit plan unless the Irish border backstop is time-limited or removed from the withdrawal deal On Wednesday, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) held up its end of the confidence-and-supply pact it shares with the Conservatives and helped the government rebuff a no-confidence vote. But just a day before,its 10 MPs voted against Theresa May's Brexit plan, which led to the biggest government defeat in modern times. How should we read the party's actions? Almost everything you need to know about the DUP and Brexit can be gauged from its name, with the emphasis on ""unionist"". May pushes for cross-party Brexit consensus DUP has 'useful' meeting with PM No-deal Brexit could 'break up the UK' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop In 2017, when Theresa May lost her majority after calling a snap general election,the DUP had its best ever Westminster election result, winning 10 seats in the House of Commons. Attention turned to the party in an unprecedented way and, as speculation mounted that it would do a deal with the Conservatives, DUP leader Arlene Foster pronounced that the ""union is our guiding star"" and would remain central to its actions. This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster Nearly two years on, that commitment to the union remains resolute. The party has always opposed any suggestion of ""special status"" for Northern Ireland in the Brexit negotiations - arguing that any differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain could threaten to break up the United Kingdom. It showed Theresa May it meant business last November, just days after she published her original Brexit plan that included the Irish border backstop. To the DUP, the backstop represented its worst fears come to life: regulatory differences meaning only NI would continue to follow some EU rules, no time limit and the ability to exit the backstop would need to be agreed jointly by the UK and EU. The Irish border backstop is an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit So, the DUP fired a warning shotat the government by abstaining on budget votes, telling Mrs May to ""keep her side of the bargain"". What followed were accusations that the DUP had broken the confidence-and-supply pact by not voting with the government. But the party said it remained intact, and that the government had bent the rules first, by signing up to a withdrawal agreement that went against the DUP's one self-proclaimed ""blood red"" line. It has proceeded to vote with the Tories on other matters, acutely aware that it would not be in the party's interests if the confidence-and-supply pact fell through. The DUP negotiated an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland through the deal, andnot all of it has been released by the Treasury yet. Boris Johnson spoke at the DUP's annual conference last November in Belfast Moreover, the last thing the DUP wants is a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. The DUP's most senior MPs, including its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, have been consistently critical of the Labour leader, particularly for his past links with Sinn FÃ©in and his stance on security issues. That's why the party voted with the government in Wednesday's no confidence vote, ensuring the Conservatives remain in Number 10. Just after the vote, Mr Dodds told MPs it illustrated the ""importance"" of the parties' pact. It's something he is likely to remind Mrs May of in the days and weeks ahead, as she seeks to rework her Brexit deal. It is pro-union (UK, not Europe), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party is the fifth largest in Parliament, but it wasn't always so popular. It started as a one-man-band, with Rev Ian Paisley, a fundamentalist Protestant preacher, at its helm. He founded the party in 1971 in opposition to what he saw as the increasingly liberal approach of the Ulster Unionists - the party of the political establishment since the state was founded in 1921. The Democratic Unionist Party moved from a hard-line fringe unionist party in the 1970s, led by Ian Paisley, to Northern Ireland's biggest party Unlike nationalists, who want to see the Irish border removed and rule from Westminster ended, unionists want the link with Britain preserved. For most of his political career, Ian Paisley saw the prospect of devolved power sharing with his political enemies as a Trojan Horse to Irish unity. But by 2005, his approach from saying no, which helped him make political gains, allowed the DUP to displace the ruling class of the Ulster Unionists as the party that could legitimately claim to speak for all of unionism. Power sharing with Sinn FÃ©in followed in 2007 and, until recently, the DUP had a reputation for fiscal prudence and deft political strategising. On social issues the party is deeply conservative. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion: abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. Read a full profile of the DUP. But ultimately, what does the party want from Brexit? First of all, the DUP has said it still wants the UK to leave the EU with a deal - but it must be one that treats Northern Ireland no differently from the rest of the UK. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? After talks with Mrs May in Downing Street on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the prime minister had been in listening mode, adding that the DUP had made a ""clear ask"" in relation to its concerns about the Irish border backstop. ""She has a way through this: Address the backstop in a satisfactory way,"" added Mrs Foster's deputy, DUP MP Nigel Dodds. Ideally, the DUP would like to see the backstop removed from the withdrawal agreement completely. Given the soundings coming from the Irish government and the EU, as well as Mrs May's insistence that there won't be a deal at all without some form of a backstop, that first preference seems unlikely. The other option is to place some kind of time limit on the backstop, something the DUP has said it's open to. Theresa May has said she wants to work with the DUP and other parties in Parliament to get a deal that works for the whole of the UK There have been suggestions in one newspaper that a backstop that lasts only until May 2022 could be enough to persuade the ardent unionists. Whether that's something the EU could move towards, and if the prime minister is capable of obtaining any concessions, is unclear. The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions. The UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards. But, after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. Neither the UK government nor the EU want any hardening of the border. In December 2017 they both signed up to the need for a backstop that would maintain cross-border cooperation, support the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday peace agreement. An agreement on the backstop is important because the EU won't agree to a transitional period and substantive trade talks until it is in place. But the UK's current red lines, which include leaving the customs union and the single market, make that very difficult. The DUP argues the backstop would create a border down the Irish Sea, by placing checks on some goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. It believes any differences for Northern Ireland could threaten the integrity of the union. Read more here. Up until now, reassurances haven't worked at all. Just days ago, a senior DUP source told me unionists were ""too long in the tooth to fall for written assurances"", and described Mrs May as being guarded and difficult to talk to. Nevertheless, the party insists the issue of who leads the Tories is not a matter for the DUP. Theresa May now has to keep calm and carry on. She also has to be mindful of the fact that the DUP is not the only voice on Brexit in Northern Ireland, with a majority of parties and business groups actually urging support for the backstop. But as a prime minister who's referred to herself as a ""proud unionist"", the DUP will be keen to see her live up to that.

Brexit: Are we running out of parliamentary time?,"Throughout the Brexit process, people have used the image of a ticking clock. On 29 March, unless something changes, the clock stops. That's why political pressure in the United Kingdom to extend Article 50 (the two year negotiating period for leaving the EU - which runs out on that date) is growing. Article 50,externalcan't be paused. It can only be extended or revoked altogether and if neither of these things happen, the UK leaves, deal or no deal. So, people are worried that time is about to run out. Extending Article 50 is not government policy. But asked by the BBC on Wednesday if there was still time to leave the EU with a deal passed through Parliament, the Justice Secretary, David Gauke, said: ""It's still possible - but it is very tight. We don't have a lot of spare time, frankly."" ""I think we've got days before we will start to run out of parliamentary time. I hope we can meet that timing."" These may be the words of a government minister keeping up the pressure on Parliament to agree on something. But it's not just about agreeing a deal - although there is, as yet, no clear sign of a majority in Parliament for any form of Brexit or for an election or another referendum. It's also that even if Parliament were to vote in favour of the Prime Minister's deal, or something like it, there is a huge amount of legislative work to do. There are now fewer than 40 legislative days left before Brexit is due to happen. And if the withdrawal agreement were to be approved, it would then have to be turned into new legislation. The passage of that legislation could be contentious. Theresa May's deal voted down Chancellor hints at Article 50 extension Article 50: Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit The next Brexit vote - on what Theresa May is proposing to do next - is scheduled for 29 January. After that there will be fewer than 30 sitting days in which to get new laws through Parliament. A little more time could be found if Parliament were to sit on Fridays and a planned parliamentary recess next month was abandoned. That might buy a maximum of 14 extra days but the schedule would still be extremely challenging. There's also a huge amount of secondary legislation that needs to be passed, making small changes to the law (sometimes just tweaking language, sometimes more complicated) via what are known as statutory instruments (SIs). The government estimates it will need nearly 600 SIs before Brexit day. The latestresearch from the Hansard Society,externalshows that 305 SIs related to Brexit  have been introduced so far - and only 67 have completed their passage through Parliament. There are also six other pieces of primary legislation going through Parliament at the moment (on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, international health care and financial services) - and all of them would need to be approved before the end of March if the UK leaves the EU with no deal. The Institute for Government iskeeping track of the legislation here,external. If there was a post-Brexit transition period, during which all the rules would stay the same, there would be more time to complete the passage of this legislation (and the financial services bill would fall away completely). But as long as a no-deal Brexit is on the table, ministers and officials have to plan for the possibility of having to pass them all by 29 March. In exceptional circumstances, it is possible in theory to ram legislation through Parliament extremely quickly. The 2017 Northern Ireland Budget Act, for example, passed the House of Commons in one day, the House of Lords in one day, and received royal assent two days later. But it would be unprecedented to operate in that way, with so little scrutiny, for legislation as momentous as the EU Withdrawal Act, and it would obviously require the cooperation of both Houses of Parliament. First of all, the government would need the formal agreement of all 27 other EU countries. The EU would need to be convinced that there were good reasons for an extension, beyond prolonging unresolved political arguments in Westminster. That could mean developments in UK politics that would change the nature of the argument over Brexit - such as a decision to call an election or another referendum. Or, if a deal was agreed late in the day, a short extension could be considered to give a bit more time to complete the ratification process and pass the necessary legislation. If other EU countries agreed, the government would still need parliamentary approval in Westminster for extending Article 50 via a resolution and it would need to change the date of exit in EU law. Again, that could be done relatively easily with the support of Parliament. But how much extra time could be needed? Elections for the next European Parliament are being held in May and there are currently no plans for the UK to take part. But new members (MEPs) won't be sworn in until the first week of July, which creates a three-month window. ""An extension of Article 50 until 1 July is feasible without needing to hold European parliamentary elections in the UK in May,"" said the Labour MEP Richard Corbett. In theory the outgoing European Parliament could be convened in an extraordinary session in June, after the elections, to complete its part in the ratification of any Brexit withdrawal deal. There are already calls for a much longer extension of Article 50 - but if there have been no European elections in the UK, that takes you into very tricky legal territory. The UK would still be an EU member state but it would have no newly elected MEPs. A confidential legal opinion, first drafted by the European parliament's legal service in 2017 and seen by the BBC, concludes that the UK would technically be in breach of its treaty obligations if it did not hold European elections while it remained an EU member state. But - importantly - the opinion also concludes that such a move wouldn't make the new parliament illegal. ""The possibility for the European parliament to be validly constituted following the 2019 elections,"" it says, ""would not be affected by a potential failure by the UK to organise elections."" Lawyers will continue to argue over the details, and there will be many political reservations. Like with so many parts of the Brexit process, this is uncharted territory. And no-one is sure what is likely to happen next.

Hitachi to halt work on Wales nuclear plant,"Hitachi has said it will suspend work on a multi-billion-pound UK nuclear project because of rising costs. The decision puts thousands of jobs at risk if the Â£13bn plant at Wylfa Newydd in Anglesey, north Wales, is scrapped. The Japanese firm had been in talks with the UK government since June about funding for the project, which was being built by its Horizon subsidiary. The government said it had failed to agree terms with Hitachi. The nuclear industry said it was ""disappointing"". Hitachi said it would also suspend work on another site, in Oldbury in Gloucestershire, ""until a solution can be found"". About 9,000 workers had been expected to be involved in building the two nuclear reactors, which were due to be operational by the mid-2020s. What's Wylfa and why is it important? 'Tremendous blow' for Wales Is nuclear power the answer to climate change? Hitachi said the decision would cost it an estimated 300bn yen (Â£2.1bn) as ""extraordinary losses"".

Saturn's rings are 'very young',"The end phases of the mission should yield new information about Saturn's interior We're looking at Saturn at a very special time in the history of the Solar System, according to scientists. They've confirmed the planet's iconic rings are very young - no more than 100 million years old, when dinosaurs still walked the Earth. The insight comes from the final measurements acquired by the American Cassini probe. The satellite sent back its last data just before diving to destruction in the giant world's atmosphere in 2017. ""Previous estimates of the age of Saturn's rings required a lot of modelling and were far more uncertain. But we now have direct measurements that allows us to constrain the age very well,"" Luciano Iess from Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, told BBC News. The professor's team has published an account of its work with Cassiniin Science magazine,external. Cassini has been circling around Saturn for 13 years On the icy moon Enceladus it discovered... an ocean of water hidden beneath the surface eight times as deep as the oceans on Earth. Cassini's chemical analysis of the water... suggests conditions could be right for micro-organisms to live there. While visiting Saturn's largest moon which is the size of the planet Mercury Cassini flew over seas and lakes of methane and discovered they are up to 170 metres deep. On Saturn itself, above the north pole Cassini took photos of a hexagonal hurricane 32,000km across. Scientists have puzzled over how this giant storm spins. Cassini measured its winds at a staggering 330mph Four times as strong as a hurricane on Earth! Back out on the edge of one of Saturn's rings among the clouds of ice particles Cassini even captured the birth of a possible new moon. It's been named Peggy and is just 1km wide. Finally, running out of fuel, Cassini was flown directly towards the planet until it burnt up in Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini: A mission of 'astonishing discovery' Click next button to proceed Loading ... Swipe to progress Images: Nasa, Kongle  Saturn probe Cassini is incinerated Meet the people who made Cassini happen In Pictures: Cassini probe's greatest shots There has long been a debate about the age of Saturn's rings. Some had argued these gorgeous loops of icy particles most likely formed along with the planet itself, some 4.5 billion years ago. Others had suggested they were a recent phenomenon - perhaps the crushed up remains of a moon or a passing comet that was involved in a collision. Artwork: Cassini plunged between the rings and the planet's cloudtops The US-European Cassini mission promised to resolve the argument in its last months at the gas giant. The satellite's end days saw it fly repeatedly through the gap between the rings and the planet's cloudtops. These manoeuvres made possible unprecedented gravity measurements. Cassini essentially weighed the rings, and found their mass to be 20 times smaller than previous estimates: something on the order of 15,400,000,000,000,000 tonnes, or about two-fifths the mass of Mimas - the Saturn moon that looks like the ""Death Star"" weapon in the Star Wars movies. Mimas: The ""Star Wars"" moon is a favourite among Saturn fans Knowing the mass was a key piece in the puzzle for researchers. From Cassini's other instruments, they already knew the proportion of dust in the rings and the rate at which this dust was being added. Having a definitive mass for the rings then made it possible to work out an age. Prof Iess's team says this could be as young as 10 million years but is no older than 100 million years. In terms of the full age of the Solar System, this is ""yesterday"". The calculation agrees with one made by a different group which last month examinedhow fast the ring particles were falling on to Saturn,external- a rate that was described as being equivalent to an Olympic-sized swimming pool every half-hour. This flow, when all factors were considered, would probably see the rings disappear altogether in ""at most 100 million years"", said Dr Tom Stallard from Leicester University, UK. ""The rings we see today are actually not that impressive compared with how they would have looked 50-100 million years ago,"" he told BBC News. ""Back then they would have been even bigger and even brighter. So, whatever produced them must have made for an incredible display if you'd been an astronomer 100 million years ago."" Cassini's investigations cannot shed much light on the nature of the event that gave rise to the rings, but it would have been cataclysmic in scale. It was conceivable, said Dr Stallard, that the geology of the moons around Saturn could hold important clues. Just as rock and ice cores drilled on Earth reveal debris from ancient meteorite and comet impacts, so it's possible the moons of Saturn could record evidence of the ring-forming event in their deeper layers. Maybe we'll get to drill into the likes of Mimas and Enceladus... one day.

Student helps Tube station baby birth,"The London Ambulance Service was called to Warren Street Station A medical student who helped deliver a baby at a central London Tube station said it was a panicked situation. Hamzah Selim, 21, was on his way home from an anatomy lecture when he heard a woman screaming at Warren Street Station on Tuesday afternoon. The first-year medic rushed to help the woman, who was standing in a ""pool of blood"" alongside her sister, and used his jumper to protect the newborn. The mother and her baby were then taken to hospital by paramedics. Mr Selim initially thought a fight had broken out between two women when he heard screaming and swearing at the station. He helped her to sit down as he feared she might faint because of the extensive blood loss. He said he ""felt something warm, instinctively looked down and saw a little baby's head with its arms side by side"". ""All the blood left me in that moment,"" he added. The woman was with her sister, he said, who had been ""incredible"" and had begun delivering the baby prior to his arrival. Hamzah Selim is currently building an app to screen for dementia as part of his degree Mr Selim has not studied midwifery but had just spent the past few weeks at a neo-natal unit as part of his degree at University College London. ""I knew a little bit of what to do. I had to lower the woman. I took my jumper off and wrapped the baby in it. ""I held the baby in horror. It wasn't responding so I immediately went to the worst possible thought."" He said he called for ""someone more qualified"" to help but that ""there was no-one there"". Allow Twitter content?

Nursing mother smashes 268-mile race record,"Jasmin Paris pumping breast milk at checkpoint one A mother who expressed milk for her baby during a 268-mile race along the Pennine Way has broken the course record by more than 12 hours. Jasmin Paris, 35, completed the Montane Spine Race - from Derbyshire to the Scottish borders - in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. The vet, who lives in Midlothian said the race was ""brutal"". Mrs Paris' sponsor, inov-8, said her achievement was ""one of the greatest stories"" in the sport. Jasmin Paris was met by her daughter, Rowan, at the end of the race Competitors spend two-thirds of the race in the dark and carry all their own kit and supplies. They also have no personal support team or runner with them on the course. Mrs Paris told the BBC Scotland news website how despite having frozen breast milk at home before the race for her 14-month-old daughter, she expressed milk during the race to stop mastitis. She said: ""I had thought I would have stopped breast feeding by this point and tried when Rowan was one, but over Christmas she got two viruses and I had to go back to feeding her multiple times throughout the night to soothe her. ""Although my milk production diminished throughout the race, I did express at four out of the five checkpoints. ""The first night was the hardest for me mentally because I was away from my daughter, but as the race went on it got easier as I got used to being away from her. ""She was very bemused to see me on the finish line and has been very clingy today as if she is thinking I might go away again. This video can not be played She broke the Spine Race course record by more than 12 hours Mrs Paris reached the finish line in Kirk Yetholm on Wednesday evening having started in Edale in the Derbyshire Peak District on Sunday. She said that compared with other competitors, she had got off lightly with just a few blisters although her toenails were very sore and black and she feared she would lose at least her big toenails. She said: ""I was worried at the start of the race when I heard other runners saying they had taped their feet up as I hadn't, but somehow I've not really had any problems with my feet apart from losing the skin between my toes. ""I think it comes from all the running I do, it's toughened up my feet. I was running 100 miles a week in the run up to the race. ""I never thought I would do this race as I've heard it's absolute torture but its good to set yourself a challenge because it's exciting so I entered. ""I started thinking I could possibly win and it was exciting when it turned into a race and Eugeni was chasing me for 40 miles. ""A man was also popping up along the course telling me our split times, which made it really exciting and when Eugeni was entering one of the checkpoints and I was leaving I think it broke his morale."" Competitors have one week to complete the gruelling race, which travels over hilly terrain and covers 43,000ft of climbing - more than Everest at 29,000ft. The Spine Race 2013 winner, Eugeni Rosello Sole, was forced to push his emergency button 6km before the end, which eliminated him from the race after becoming unwell from sleep deprivation. During the entirety of the race, Mrs Paris only slept for three hours. She said that by the last day, she was hallucinating on the Cheviots. ""I saw a pig in the heather, trees stretching and doing a morning workout in the woods, workmen doing stretches, a house appeared and I was very cold. ""There is not much of a comfort zone between a bad situation and an ok situation and I was aware I was pushing my limits but I know that's what happens. ""It was the hardest race I've done due to the amount of time and weather wise, but I'm really happy because I gave it my best shot. I raced hard and gave it the best I could. ""It's been a life affirming experience and it will take me a couple of weeks to recover from the effort and cost it took."" Mrs Paris did the race during a week-long break from writing her PhD thesis, which she must hand in by the end of March. Lee Procter, inov-8 ambassador team manager, said: ""All of us here at inov-8 are so proud of Jasmin. ""She is not a professional, full-time athlete, but instead a down-to-earth, modest mum-of-one with an incredible talent and phenomenal strength, both physically and mentally. ""What she has achieved in this race in beating everyone of both sexes and setting a new overall course record is one of the greatest stories in the history of ultra-running as a sport."" Scott Gilmour, The Montane Spine Race director, also said it was an ""incredible feat"". He said: ""Never underestimate a competitor whether it's a man or a woman. It's the person's dedication and attitude that drives results. ""Paris is a machine so this result is not a surprise to us, but what is brilliant is she carried all that expectation and pressure on her shoulders. ""She never got upset and was swan-like all the way to the end."" He added: ""The four-day record of 95 hours was really tough and we didn't think it was possible to beat it due to sleep depravation, its incredible. ""She absolutely dictated the pace of the race, it's an incredible feat. ""She's such a figure head and such a champion and she will inspire others.""

"Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn","A diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet. Scientists have been trying to figure out how we are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come. Their answer - ""the planetary health diet"" - does not completely banish meat and dairy. But it is recommending we get most of our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) instead. Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat. If you eat meat every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you're looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that's your lot. You can still have a couple of portions of fish and the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of your protein will need to come from. The researchers are recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day instead. There's also a major push on all fruit and veg, which should make up half of every plate of food we eat. Although there's a cull on ""starchy vegetables"" such as the humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa. If you served it all up this is what you would be allowed each day: Nuts- 50g a day Beans,chickpeas,lentilsand other legumes- 75g a day Fish- 28g a day Eggs- 13g a day (so one and a bit a week) Meat- 14g a day of red meat and 29g a day of chicken Carbs- whole grains like bread and rice 232g a day and 50g a day of starchy vegetables Dairy- 250g - the equivalent of one glass of milk Vegetables-(300g) and fruit (200g) The diet has room for 31g ofsugarand about 50g worth ofoilslike olive oil. Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive.Update your browser to have a go! Prof Walter Willet, one of the researchers who is based at Harvard, said no and that after a childhood on a farm eating three portions of red meat a day he was now pretty much in line with the planetary health diet. ""There's tremendous variety there,"" he said. ""You can take those foods and put them together in thousands of different ways. We're not talking about a deprivation diet here, it is healthy eating that is flexible and enjoyable."" These are some plates of food that meet the planetary health diet rules BBC Food: Health recipes and diet information This plan requires changes to diets in pretty much every corner of the world. Europe and North America need to cut back massively on red meat, East Asia needs to cut back on fish, Africa on starchy vegetables. ""Humanity has never attempted to change the food system at this scale and this speed,"" said Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, at Stockholm University. ""Whether it's a fantasy or not, a fantasy doesn't have to be bad... it's time to dream of a good world,"" she says. Taxes on red meat are one of the many options the researchers say may be necessary to persuade us to switch diets. A group of 37 scientists from around the world were brought together aspart of the EAT-Lancet commission,external. They're a mix of experts from farming to climate change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their findings which have been published in the Lancet. The world population reached seven billion in 2011 and it's now around 7.7 billion. That figure is expected to reach10 billion around 2050,externaland will keep on climbing. The researchers say the diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year. That number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are now the biggest killers in developed countries. The use of land for growing food and forestry accounts for around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's about the same as from electricity and heating, and substantially more than from all the trains, planes and automobiles on the planet. When you look more closely at the food sector's environmental impact, you can see that meat and dairy are the major factors. Worldwide, livestock accounts for between 14.5 and 18% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to other warming gases, agriculture is one of the leading contributors to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agriculture is also a significant source of air pollution with ammonia from farms a major cause of fine particulate matter, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is a threat to health worldwide. Similarly when it comes to water, agriculture and food productions are one of the biggest threats, consuming 70% of global freshwater sources for irrigation. The researchers' aim was to feed more people while: minimising greenhouse gas emissions preventing any species going extinct having no expansion of farmland, and preserving water However, just changing diets is nowhere near enough. To make the numbers add up, also requires a halving of food waste and an increase in the amount of food produced on current farmland. ""If we were just minimising greenhouse gases we'd say everyone be vegan,"" said Prof Willet. However, it was unclear whether a vegan diet was the healthiest option, he said. The EAT-Lancet Commission is going to take its findings to governments around the world and bodies such as the WHO to see if it can begin to change the way we eat.

Reports last week suggestedthey could be drastic with cuts on between 80% and 90% of goods, with some tariffs being scrapped completely. If you need a refresher on what tariffs are and what they aim to do, here's a handy explanation. BBC Radio 5 Live Sally Jones, Deloitte UKâs director for International Trade Policy, has been speaking about the UK's trading arrangements after Brexit and expectations that more information will be released today. She told Wake Up To Money that industries such as steel, ceramics and agriculture were concerned their products would be ""less competitive"". This is because they are already operating in markets where there are already high tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules and also where there is a lot of international competition. Taking cars as an example, tariffs here can be as high as 25% for component parts, and 10% for finished cars under WTO rules, she said. ""If we chose to set a zero tariff  on those components and finished cars for import into the UK then you would see competition for our plants in Sunderland and similar would be increased"". BBC News Channel Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says he had ""constructive talks"" with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove and the prime minister's chief of staff Gavin Barwell. He says he raised the need for the prime minister to take no deal off the table, as well as discussing his preferred option of a Norway-style agreement, which would see a close relationship with the European Union. He told BBC News: âItâs time for all parties to come together in the national
interest."" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has rejected government claims that it would take more than a year to organise another referendum. The Conservative MP, who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""The timetable put forward by the government is simply wrong and they must be aware of it themselves."" He says another referendum could be carried out ""swiftly and within a limited extension of Article 50"".

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has criticised a tweet from a Guardian columnist which references calculations that the Leave vote has been declining - in part due to older Leave supporters dying. Polly Toynbee was tweeting about her column, which discusses estimates that the Leave vote has been shrinking by about 1,350 a day. Mr Javid retweeted her along with the comment: ""How utterly disrespectful"". The calculation, conducted on behalf of the People's Vote campaign, takes into account the number of mainly Leave voters who have died, and mainly Remain voters who have reached voting age. The survey predicted that - assuming no voters changed their mind - demographic factors alone were causing the Leave majority to shrink by almost half a million a year. The Scottish government's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said planning for Brexit has been a ""game-changer"" for the country's police force.

The Republic of Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said a no-deal Brexit would have to become ""an exercise in damage limitation"". Speaking in the Irish parliament, Simon Coveney said: ""It would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors, which is currently facilitated by our common EU membership."" Mr Coveney said the EU would continue to seek to be as helpful as possible but that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation. ""The backstop is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he added. ""It acts as an insurance policy, to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit. It is essential.""

Norman SmithAssistant political editor Senior Tory MP Nick Boles is seeking to secure parliamentary backing for a bill that would force the government to delay Article 50. The measure would kick in if Mrs May was unable to get a Brexit deal through the Commons by the end of February. Mr Boles said he believed a number of Cabinet ministers  - including the chancellor - support his plan. He also said ministers outside the Cabinet had told him they would resign if forced to oppose the measure. Mr Boles has decided to drop his previous plan to give the Liaison Committee the power to introduce a new draft bill after it was widely criticised by members of the committee. It's thought Mr Boles' proposal - if accepted by the speaker - would be voted on ahead of Mrs May's statement to MPs on her Brexit plans on 29 January. Mr Boles made his comments in an interview with the Political Thinking podcast - published tomorrow. Â© 2025 BBC.

Laura Kuenssberg: Meetings aren't a Plan B,"Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. It's clear, wide open, in public, that the cabinet is at odds with each other. Just listen to David Gauke and Liam Fox on whether a customs union could be a compromise for example. The answer for her is not suddenly going to emerge from a unified tier of her top team. There are perhaps five or six of the cabinet who would be happy to see that kind of relationship as a way to bring Labour on board. But there is a group of around the same size who would rather see what they describe as a ""managed no deal"". You may well wonder if that isn't a contradiction in terms. But the principle would be that the UK would pay the divorce bill already agreed and over a two-year period construct a series of side deals on specific issues, rather than try to come up with a whole new comprehensive plan. There are already intense arguments about whether that's remotely realistic. But the overall point is that the prime minister cannot just therefore look to her top colleagues for an immediate solution. Before she decides which way to tack, or how far to budge, she may need to ask herself if the talks she wants to hold with other political parties are occasions when she is really open to ideas - or just ways of managing the political situation. One cabinet minister involved in the talks suggested that many MPs still needed to understand how the agreement they have reached with the EU worked. And that as ""project reality"" dawned, there could still be a way through of salvaging Mrs May's deal in something like its current form. And certainly there wasn't much in the PM's lectern statement to suggest she is suddenly ready to move very much. One former minister described it as ""still flicking the V at the 48% - she's deluded, she never changes her mind and cannot conceive that others might"". If all that the prime minister intends to do is massage a few egos with these talks, it seems unlikely that she'll find a quick route to success. And Labour may well stay outside the process. Many members of the public might be furious that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn won't play nice during a time of crisis. He's always said he believes in dialogue, but when it really matters, he says no. But inside the Labour movement there are others who might accuse of him of helping to make Brexit happen if he takes part. Like so many facets of this process, it's not a straightforward political calculation. But across Parliament, for a very long time now, even some MPs who were on the prime minister's side to start with have been intensely frustrated that she hasn't listened. It will take a lot more than a cup of tea in Downing Street to bring her many critics on board.

France activates no-deal Brexit plan,"France will spend millions of euros preparing ports and airports for a no-deal Brexit French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said a no-deal Brexit looks ""less and less unlikely"" and has launched a contingency plan to prepare for it. After the UK Parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement, Mr Philippe said laws had to be passed and millions invested in French ports and airports. An EU official will now visit all 27 capitals to co-ordinate no-deal plans. EU countries with close UK ties have already begun preparing for its departure on 29 March without a deal. ""We are taking this very seriously now as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is becoming more possible after Tuesday night,"" said European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas. ""This is work which is ongoing and it's developing fully. We are not taking any chances."" He also revealed that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and UK Prime Minister Theresa May had texted each other since her defeat in Parliament on Tuesday, but said they had not spoken.

Ireland'sprime minister Leo Varadkar updated the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) about the Dublin government's plans for legislation on a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. Of all the EU member states, Ireland has the closest links to the UK and much of the government's non-priority business is being scrapped to focus on measures covering health, communications, education, finance, employment and justice. Medicine 'watch list' in Irish no-deal plan The Netherlands'foreign trade minister, Sigrid Kaag, said on Wednesday night that the Netherlands was launching a major information campaign on 28 January. ""After Ireland, the Dutch economy is most entwined with that of the UK,"" she said, citing fisheries, meat-processing and flower exports. She warned that many small and medium enterprises had failed to make sufficient preparation for a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit warning for UK drivers Germany'sforeign minister, Heiko Maas, said on Thursday that plans for a disorderly Brexit would have to be stepped up. ""In the coming days and weeks, we will do everything we can so that Britain exits with and not without an agreement,"" he told the Bundestag (German parliament). Spainsaid on Thursday that staffing of immigration offices would be beefed up if the UK left the EU without a deal. Some 310,000 UK citizens live in Spain and they would have to confirm their residency under a no-deal Brexit, officials said.

What does the DUP want from Brexit talks?,"The DUP insists it will not support a Brexit plan unless the Irish border backstop is time-limited or removed from the withdrawal deal On Wednesday, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) held up its end of the confidence-and-supply pact it shares with the Conservatives and helped the government rebuff a no-confidence vote. But just a day before,its 10 MPs voted against Theresa May's Brexit plan, which led to the biggest government defeat in modern times. How should we read the party's actions? Almost everything you need to know about the DUP and Brexit can be gauged from its name, with the emphasis on ""unionist"". May pushes for cross-party Brexit consensus DUP has 'useful' meeting with PM No-deal Brexit could 'break up the UK' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop In 2017, when Theresa May lost her majority after calling a snap general election,the DUP had its best ever Westminster election result, winning 10 seats in the House of Commons. Attention turned to the party in an unprecedented way and, as speculation mounted that it would do a deal with the Conservatives, DUP leader Arlene Foster pronounced that the ""union is our guiding star"" and would remain central to its actions. This video can not be played ""The union is our guiding star"" - DUP's Arlene Foster Nearly two years on, that commitment to the union remains resolute. The party has always opposed any suggestion of ""special status"" for Northern Ireland in the Brexit negotiations - arguing that any differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain could threaten to break up the United Kingdom. It showed Theresa May it meant business last November, just days after she published her original Brexit plan that included the Irish border backstop. To the DUP, the backstop represented its worst fears come to life: regulatory differences meaning only NI would continue to follow some EU rules, no time limit and the ability to exit the backstop would need to be agreed jointly by the UK and EU. The Irish border backstop is an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit So, the DUP fired a warning shotat the government by abstaining on budget votes, telling Mrs May to ""keep her side of the bargain"". What followed were accusations that the DUP had broken the confidence-and-supply pact by not voting with the government. But the party said it remained intact, and that the government had bent the rules first, by signing up to a withdrawal agreement that went against the DUP's one self-proclaimed ""blood red"" line. It has proceeded to vote with the Tories on other matters, acutely aware that it would not be in the party's interests if the confidence-and-supply pact fell through. The DUP negotiated an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland through the deal, andnot all of it has been released by the Treasury yet. Boris Johnson spoke at the DUP's annual conference last November in Belfast Moreover, the last thing the DUP wants is a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. The DUP's most senior MPs, including its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, have been consistently critical of the Labour leader, particularly for his past links with Sinn FÃ©in and his stance on security issues. That's why the party voted with the government in Wednesday's no confidence vote, ensuring the Conservatives remain in Number 10. Just after the vote, Mr Dodds told MPs it illustrated the ""importance"" of the parties' pact. It's something he is likely to remind Mrs May of in the days and weeks ahead, as she seeks to rework her Brexit deal. It is pro-union (UK, not Europe), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party is the fifth largest in Parliament, but it wasn't always so popular. It started as a one-man-band, with Rev Ian Paisley, a fundamentalist Protestant preacher, at its helm. He founded the party in 1971 in opposition to what he saw as the increasingly liberal approach of the Ulster Unionists - the party of the political establishment since the state was founded in 1921. The Democratic Unionist Party moved from a hard-line fringe unionist party in the 1970s, led by Ian Paisley, to Northern Ireland's biggest party Unlike nationalists, who want to see the Irish border removed and rule from Westminster ended, unionists want the link with Britain preserved. For most of his political career, Ian Paisley saw the prospect of devolved power sharing with his political enemies as a Trojan Horse to Irish unity. But by 2005, his approach from saying no, which helped him make political gains, allowed the DUP to displace the ruling class of the Ulster Unionists as the party that could legitimately claim to speak for all of unionism. Power sharing with Sinn FÃ©in followed in 2007 and, until recently, the DUP had a reputation for fiscal prudence and deft political strategising. On social issues the party is deeply conservative. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion: abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. Read a full profile of the DUP. But ultimately, what does the party want from Brexit? First of all, the DUP has said it still wants the UK to leave the EU with a deal - but it must be one that treats Northern Ireland no differently from the rest of the UK. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? After talks with Mrs May in Downing Street on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the prime minister had been in listening mode, adding that the DUP had made a ""clear ask"" in relation to its concerns about the Irish border backstop. ""She has a way through this: Address the backstop in a satisfactory way,"" added Mrs Foster's deputy, DUP MP Nigel Dodds. Ideally, the DUP would like to see the backstop removed from the withdrawal agreement completely. Given the soundings coming from the Irish government and the EU, as well as Mrs May's insistence that there won't be a deal at all without some form of a backstop, that first preference seems unlikely. The other option is to place some kind of time limit on the backstop, something the DUP has said it's open to. Theresa May has said she wants to work with the DUP and other parties in Parliament to get a deal that works for the whole of the UK There have been suggestions in one newspaper that a backstop that lasts only until May 2022 could be enough to persuade the ardent unionists. Whether that's something the EU could move towards, and if the prime minister is capable of obtaining any concessions, is unclear. The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions. The UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards. But, after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. Neither the UK government nor the EU want any hardening of the border. In December 2017 they both signed up to the need for a backstop that would maintain cross-border cooperation, support the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday peace agreement. An agreement on the backstop is important because the EU won't agree to a transitional period and substantive trade talks until it is in place. But the UK's current red lines, which include leaving the customs union and the single market, make that very difficult. The DUP argues the backstop would create a border down the Irish Sea, by placing checks on some goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. It believes any differences for Northern Ireland could threaten the integrity of the union. Read more here. Up until now, reassurances haven't worked at all. Just days ago, a senior DUP source told me unionists were ""too long in the tooth to fall for written assurances"", and described Mrs May as being guarded and difficult to talk to. Nevertheless, the party insists the issue of who leads the Tories is not a matter for the DUP. Theresa May now has to keep calm and carry on. She also has to be mindful of the fact that the DUP is not the only voice on Brexit in Northern Ireland, with a majority of parties and business groups actually urging support for the backstop. But as a prime minister who's referred to herself as a ""proud unionist"", the DUP will be keen to see her live up to that.

"Breaking|Breaking newsPrince Philip unhurt after car crash - palaceDuke of Edinburgh involved in car crash near Sandringham Estate but not injured, Buckingham Palace says","This video can not be played The BBC's Nicholas Witchell says the Duke regularly drives in the Sandringham area The Duke of Edinburgh has been involved in a car crash while driving near the Queen's Sandringham estate, Buckingham Palace has said. Prince Philip, 97, was not injured in the accident, which happened as he drove a Land Rover out of a driveway onto the A149 shortly before 15:00 GMT. The other car involved was a Kia. Two women in it needed hospital treatment - they have since been discharged. Eyewitnesses said the duke's Land Rover overturned during the collision. They said they helped the duke out of the vehicle. He was conscious but very, very shocked and shaken, they added. Norfolk police said it was force policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings. The duke is back at Sandringham and has seen a doctor as a precaution. A woman who drove past the crash scene - near Babingley, a small village north of King's Lynn in Norfolk - at around 15:40 said she saw an ambulance and ""a heavy police presence"". ""I was just going down the A149 â¦ and saw a lot of blue flashing lights ahead,"" she said. ""I saw a black, 4x4 type car on its side and me and my son were like 'oh my word, that doesn't look good'. ""Luckily it was just sort of on the side of the road, the road wasn't closed in any way. ""Obviously it looked quite smashed in. I'm quite amazed he [the duke] is okay actually."" Norfolk police confirmed officers were called to the scene shortly before 3pm after a Land Rover and a Kia were involved in a collision. It had previously been reported the duke had been driving a Range Rover. The driver of the Kia suffered cuts, while the passenger sustained an arm injury, police said. Both were treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. This video can not be played Prince Philip crash: ""People stopped to help"" - eyewitness A statement said the road remained open and both vehicles were recovered a short time later. Nick Cobb, a long-time Babingley resident, was driving past with his 16-year-old daughter Emily at about 15:10 GMT when they spotted an overturned car about 100 yards from their house. ""The [Land Rover] was on its side on a private road. ""The other car was well into the hedge on the opposite side of the road. ""There was lots of debris in the road, lots of glass and lots of other cars, some police cars, some from the Sandringham Estate and about six ordinary looking cars that looked as though they had stopped to help. Smashed glass and parts of a car left at the roadside at the scene of the crash ""We only found out that it was the duke's car when we saw it on the news. The road was not blocked by the crash and was open when we came past."" The BBC's Nic Rigby, at the scene, says all that's left are pieces of broken glass and the remnants of a wing mirror. It has been a chilly day, he adds, and there were small flurries of snow in parts of Norfolk, but nothing that troubled the county's roads. The Queen and Prince Philip have been staying at the estate in Norfolk since Christmas. The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu,tweeted a prayer,externalin support to the duke, and later another one for the two other people involved in the accident. By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond There will be several sharp intakes of breath over this accident. The first will be over the good news - that the Duke escaped unscathed. A photo of what is believed to be the accident shows what looks like a Land Rover resting on its driver side, having turned or flipped as a result of the collision. That must have been some impact. The duke was, a witness told the BBC, ""very very shocked"". But the Palace says the duke was not injured and did not need medical treatment. The duke is five months short of his 98th birthday. By anyone's standards, getting away from an accident like that unhurt is pretty impressive. There will be some surprise that the duke still drives himself on public roads. But he has always been fiercely independent, and would have resisted any suggestion that he be denied the right to drive himself. And there will now be an investigation into the circumstances of the accident. It might be that the duke is about to be persuaded to give up the wheel. Royal biographer Hugo Vickers told BBC News: ""Any kind of car accident at the age of 97 is likely to produce shock. ""Some years ago he gave up flying planes long before he needed to because he was scared that if something happened there would be a lot of criticism. ""You know, why was he, at the age of 55, still flying a plane when he should have retired at 48 or something like that. ""So he does listen to these things - he's very, very sensible. ""If anyone's involved in a car accident, it's quite a frightening thing. If he thought that he'd lost concentration or something or he hadn't seen somebody he would realise he's not up to it anymore."" The president of the AA, Edmund King said high profile car crashes involving elderly drivers often spark calls for bans or restrictions on older drivers. But he added: ""If driving restrictions based on age and safety were introduced we would be more likely to restrict young drivers rather than older drivers. ""Young, predominantly male, drivers are much more likely to crash within six months of passing their test than older drivers within six months of hanging up their keys. ""Older drivers often self restrict their driving by not driving at night and only driving on familiar roads."" The duke famously drove the Obamas when the then-US president and first lady visited Windsor in 2016. This video can not be played Prince Philip was 94 when he drove the Obamas and his wife, the Queen A discussion on whether to put average speed cameras on the stretch of the A149 where the duke's crash happenedhad already been planned,externalby Norfolk County Council on Friday - prior to the crash. Prince Philip retired from public life in August 2017having spent decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. Buckingham Palace calculated he had completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. Since retiring from official solo duties, he has appeared in public alongside the Queen and other members of the royal family at events and church services. He did not attend the Royal Family's Christmas Day service at Sandringham last month.

Corbyn: Rule out no-deal now,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not hold talks with Theresa May until she rules out a no-deal Brexit. He dismissed the prime minister's offer to meet him and other party leaders  - to discuss the way ahead after her deal was rejected by MPs - as a ""stunt"". And he said Labour would table further no-confidence motions in the government ""if necessary"". In a direct message to Mrs May he said: ""Take no-deal off the table now please prime minister."" The prime minister has held talks with senior figures from the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru after she narrowly survived a no-confidence vote on Wednesday. May pushes for cross-party Brexit consensus Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Brexit: A really simple guide She is to publish an updated plan of action on EU withdrawal to Parliament on Monday, 21 January, with a full debate and the key vote on it scheduled for Tuesday, 29 January. In a speech in Hastings, a marginal constituency currently held by Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Mr Corbyn said that after Tuesday's vote it was ""clear that her EU deal is now finished"". ""There can be no question of tweaks or sweeteners from Brussels to bring it back to life."" He said that to get a deal that could get the backing of MPs, Mrs May had to ""ditch the red lines and get serious about proposals for the future"". Mr Corbyn said Labour would table an amendment on its own Brexit proposals on Monday, which are based around ""three pillars"": permanent membership of a customs union with the EU a ""strong single market relationship"" guarantees to ""at least keep pace"" with EU standards on workers rights, and environment and consumer protections The Labour leader is coming under pressure from dozens of his own MPs to back calls for another EU referendum. Mr Corbyn said his preferred option remained a general election ""to break the deadlock and find a solution that works for the whole country"". ""That is why I tabled a motion of no confidence last night - and we will come back on it again if necessary,"" he told the audience of Labour members. But he added: ""If the government remains intransigent, if support for Labour's alternative is blocked for party advantage and the country is facing the potential disaster of no-deal, our duty will then be to look at other options, which we set out in our conference motion, including that of a public vote."" He declined to say what Labour's position would be in such a vote. ""If a second referendum should take place, then obviously the party will decide what role we will play in that and what our view would be. ""But I can't really go along with the idea it should simply be a re-run of what happened in 2016. ""There has to be a discussion about the options that we put forward and we've put forward the three options that I've outlined."" He also suggested Article 50, the process taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, might have to be extended if an agreement could not be reached in time. The Labour leader has set out his demands in a letter to Mrs May, in which he tells the prime minister: ""I am disappointed that there have already been several briefings in which you continue to rule out a customs union. ""A new customs union is part of a solution favoured by most businesses and trade unions and one that I believe could command a majority of the House of Commons.""

Which MPs have had Brexit talks?,"Former Brexit Secretary David Davis was among those who went to the Cabinet Office for talks Prime Minister Theresa May has been holding talks with MPs in the aftermath of the heavy defeat of her Brexit deal in the Commons - and following a slim victory in a no-confidence vote. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay arealso holding talks with senior opposition politicians. Meetings are being held in No 10 Downing Street and 70 Whitehall, the Cabinet Office. First up was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who all had talks with the prime minister on Wednesday night. Mr Blackford said that the extension of Article 50 - the two-year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of another EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Ms Saville Roberts said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no-deal Brexit off the table and a people's vote on our European future"". Sir Vince said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". The preferred choice of his party is another referendum. Labour leader and leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""quite happy"" to talk with Mrs May but she had to rule out a no-deal Brexit first. Members of the Tories' influential European Research Group (ERG) had a morning meeting with the prime minister Tory colleagues and Brexiteers Owen Paterson, Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, Mark Francois and Steve Baker were among the first politicians spotted in Whitehall on Thursday morning, as well as Conservative MP and former Northern Irish Secretary Theresa Villiers. They are all members of the Tories' influential European Research Group (ERG). Brexiteer John Whittingdale tweeted afterwards that their group's meeting with the prime minister had been ""constructive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former Conservative cabinet minister Mr Paterson described the meeting as ""thoroughly worthwhile"", ""very constructive"" and a ""good exchange"". On the subject of taking a no-deal Brexit off the table, he said:  ""You will lose all the pressure on the EU if we give up no-deal, WTO (World Trade Organization) terms, and you give up the date. And we just drift on month after month and this whole saga continues.""

"Nursing mother smashes 268-mile race recordJasmin Paris expressed milk for her 14-month-old daughter during the gruelling Montane Spine Race.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","Jasmin Paris pumping breast milk at checkpoint one A mother who expressed milk for her baby during a 268-mile race along the Pennine Way has broken the course record by more than 12 hours. Jasmin Paris, 35, completed the Montane Spine Race - from Derbyshire to the Scottish borders - in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. The vet, who lives in Midlothian said the race was ""brutal"". Mrs Paris' sponsor, inov-8, said her achievement was ""one of the greatest stories"" in the sport. Jasmin Paris was met by her daughter, Rowan, at the end of the race Competitors spend two-thirds of the race in the dark and carry all their own kit and supplies. They also have no personal support team or runner with them on the course. Mrs Paris told the BBC Scotland news website how despite having frozen breast milk at home before the race for her 14-month-old daughter, she expressed milk during the race to stop mastitis. She said: ""I had thought I would have stopped breast feeding by this point and tried when Rowan was one, but over Christmas she got two viruses and I had to go back to feeding her multiple times throughout the night to soothe her. ""Although my milk production diminished throughout the race, I did express at four out of the five checkpoints. ""The first night was the hardest for me mentally because I was away from my daughter, but as the race went on it got easier as I got used to being away from her. ""She was very bemused to see me on the finish line and has been very clingy today as if she is thinking I might go away again. This video can not be played She broke the Spine Race course record by more than 12 hours Mrs Paris reached the finish line in Kirk Yetholm on Wednesday evening having started in Edale in the Derbyshire Peak District on Sunday. She said that compared with other competitors, she had got off lightly with just a few blisters although her toenails were very sore and black and she feared she would lose at least her big toenails. She said: ""I was worried at the start of the race when I heard other runners saying they had taped their feet up as I hadn't, but somehow I've not really had any problems with my feet apart from losing the skin between my toes. ""I think it comes from all the running I do, it's toughened up my feet. I was running 100 miles a week in the run up to the race. ""I never thought I would do this race as I've heard it's absolute torture but its good to set yourself a challenge because it's exciting so I entered. ""I started thinking I could possibly win and it was exciting when it turned into a race and Eugeni was chasing me for 40 miles. ""A man was also popping up along the course telling me our split times, which made it really exciting and when Eugeni was entering one of the checkpoints and I was leaving I think it broke his morale."" Competitors have one week to complete the gruelling race, which travels over hilly terrain and covers 43,000ft of climbing - more than Everest at 29,000ft. The Spine Race 2013 winner, Eugeni Rosello Sole, was forced to push his emergency button 6km before the end, which eliminated him from the race after becoming unwell from sleep deprivation. During the entirety of the race, Mrs Paris only slept for three hours. She said that by the last day, she was hallucinating on the Cheviots. ""I saw a pig in the heather, trees stretching and doing a morning workout in the woods, workmen doing stretches, a house appeared and I was very cold. ""There is not much of a comfort zone between a bad situation and an ok situation and I was aware I was pushing my limits but I know that's what happens. ""It was the hardest race I've done due to the amount of time and weather wise, but I'm really happy because I gave it my best shot. I raced hard and gave it the best I could. ""It's been a life affirming experience and it will take me a couple of weeks to recover from the effort and cost it took."" Mrs Paris did the race during a week-long break from writing her PhD thesis, which she must hand in by the end of March. Lee Procter, inov-8 ambassador team manager, said: ""All of us here at inov-8 are so proud of Jasmin. ""She is not a professional, full-time athlete, but instead a down-to-earth, modest mum-of-one with an incredible talent and phenomenal strength, both physically and mentally. ""What she has achieved in this race in beating everyone of both sexes and setting a new overall course record is one of the greatest stories in the history of ultra-running as a sport."" Scott Gilmour, The Montane Spine Race director, also said it was an ""incredible feat"". He said: ""Never underestimate a competitor whether it's a man or a woman. It's the person's dedication and attitude that drives results. ""Paris is a machine so this result is not a surprise to us, but what is brilliant is she carried all that expectation and pressure on her shoulders. ""She never got upset and was swan-like all the way to the end."" He added: ""The four-day record of 95 hours was really tough and we didn't think it was possible to beat it due to sleep depravation, its incredible. ""She absolutely dictated the pace of the race, it's an incredible feat. ""She's such a figure head and such a champion and she will inspire others.""

It is not illegal in the UK to resell tickets to international cricket matches, although the Cricket World Cup's own ticketing website states that no ticket should be offered for public sale. A Viagogo statement read: ""Viagogo does not set ticket prices, sellers set their own prices, which may be above or below the original face value. Where demand is high and tickets are limited, prices increase."" Tickets for the England v Australia game at Lord's are being sold for more than Â£12,000 each on Viagogo Tickets for all World Cup matches are banded into four categories - bronze, silver, gold and platinum. For the sold-out England-Australia match on 25 June, a vendor on Viagogo is marketing two silver tickets, with a face value of Â£115, for Â£12,029 each. There are a number of other matches involving England and also India where prices of Â£12,029 per ticket are being asked on Viagogo. The Viagogo statement continued: ""Viagogo is a marketplace and doesn't buy or sell tickets. Viagogo provides a platform for third party sellers to sell tickets to event goers. ""Event organisers sometimes make claims that they will deny entry to people who have purchased resold tickets. These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal."" Separately, it has been alleged that Viagogo has previously approached supporters' group the Barmy Army with a request to sell some of its allocation for England matches outside of the World Cup, a claim Viagogo has not denied. When asked about the claim the company replied: ""All tickets on Viagogo are valid and it is perfectly legal to resell a ticket or give it to someone else if you want to."" A total of 48 World Cup matches will take place in England and Wales, with 36 listed as being sold out of all non-hospitality tickets on the tournament's ticketing website. The same site does have an official resale section, but no tickets are currently listed. As well as Viagogo, Stubhub is selling tickets well over their face value. Two gold tickets for the India v Pakistan match at Old Trafford on 16 June, originally priced at Â£150 per ticket, are being marketed at Â£3,280 each. When asked for a comment by BBC Sport, Stubhub said: ""As a ticketing marketplace, StubHub does not set the price of tickets that appear on our site, the fans do. Importantly, the prices for the tickets mentioned are the ones listed, but as it is often the case, those are not necessarily the prices for which tickets sell. ""StubHub believes that fans should have the flexibility to use, transfer, donate or resell their tickets on the marketplace of their choice that provides them with the best user experience and consumer protections."" Stubhub is marketing many tickets for the India v Pakistan game at a price well above the face value Rakesh Patel, founder of India supporters' group the Bharat Army, said: ""Through ballots, tickets have got into the hands of people who trying to make a quick buck."" Although Patel conceded that it is difficult for the International Cricket Council to stop tickets falling into the hands of those who want to resell them, he called on the game's governing body to do more to reward the loyalty of fans who regularly attend international matches. ""There has to be measures taken to stop these tickets getting into the wrong hands,"" he added. ""Surely the ICC can track genuine fans who turn up to matches and prioritise matches. It's something that football clubs do. ""If they are serious about dealing with tickets that get onto secondary sites, they have to do something about it, otherwise it will never stop."" In November, Cricket World Cup organisers were forced toapologise to thousands of fanswho were mistakenly told they had got tickets for the tournament through a ballot. The World Cup begins on 30 May, when hosts England meet South Africa at The Oval.

'Mr Big' hitman gets whole-life sentence,"Mark Fellows was nicknamed ""The Iceman"" A gangland hitman who gunned down a crime boss known as ""Mr Big"" has been given a whole-life sentence. Nicknamed ""The Iceman"", Mark Fellows, 38, shot notorious crime figure Paul Massey, 55, with an Uzi sub-machine gun outside his Salford home in July 2015. Mob ""fixer"" John Kinsella, 53, from Liverpool, was shot dead by Fellows three years later. Fellows' accomplice Steven Boyle, 36, who acted as a ""spotter"" in Kinsella's killing, was also jailed for murder. He was given a life sentence and told he would serve a minimum of 33 years behind bars. Paul Massey (left) and John Kinsella were ""notorious"" within organised crime circles Both victims were ""notorious"" criminals, and were murdered as a result of a feud between rival gangs in Salford. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Davis said: ""Whatever the background of Mr Kinsella and Mr Massey, the impact on their families of their murders has been devastating. ""This was execution, pure and simple."" The judge described Fellows as a contract killer, a ""gun for hire, prepared to kill whoever you were asked to kill"". He added: ""I have never had to deal with a contract killer of your kind before. There are few judges who have. Just punishment in your case requires you to be kept in prison for the rest of your life."" Fellows was convicted of both murders on Wednesday following a trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Steven Boyle acted as a ""spotter"" in John Kinsella's murder Boyle was cleared of involvement in the murder of Massey but convicted of the murder of Kinsella. Both Fellows, from Warrington, Cheshire, and Boyle, of Heywood, Greater Manchester, were acquitted of the attempted murder of Kinsella's partner Wendy Owen. Before he was led away, Fellows shouted from the dock: ""I didn't shoot at Wendy Owen. She's lying."" A member of Kinsella's family, believed to be one of his sisters, screamed from the public gallery ""Rat! Rat!"" before the judge asked her to leave court. The savage feud between the gangs resulted in father-of-five Massey being shot at 18 times. Five bullets hit him and he died on his doorstop. In May 2018 Fellows had cycled up to Kinsella while he and his pregnant girlfriend, Wendy Owen, were walking their dogs in Rainhill, St Helens. He shot him in the back twice with a revolver. He then stood over his victim and shot him again in the back of the head. The Greater Manchester Police investigation into the Massey murder had stalled until new evidence was uncovered by Merseyside Police during the Kinsella investigation. Detectives had a ""light-bulb moment"" when they seized Fellows' Garmin Forerunner watch, which had a GPS function. It showed a few months before the Massey murder, the wearer of the watch had travelled a route from his home to the area behind the church in which the killer lay in wait for his victim on 26 July 2015. The jury were told this key piece of evidence showed a ""reconnaissance run"". In his defence, father-of-two Boyle blamed his co-accused, claiming he had gone to Rainhill to pick up drug money from Fellows who instead handed over a gun, used moments earlier to murder Kinsella. Fellows made a cut-throat gesture and mouthed the word ""grass"" to his boyhood friend as he sat in the witness box.

May meets party leaders over Brexit deadlock,"This video can not be played Theresa May has called on MPs to ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward Theresa May has urged Jeremy Corbyn to discuss his Brexit plans with her, after he said he would not take part in talks until ""no deal"" was ruled out. In a letter to the Labour leader, the PM wrote that ruling out no deal was an ""impossible condition"" as it was not within the government's power to do it. She has been meeting other leaders to try to find a compromise on Brexit after her deal was rejected by MPs. Earlier, Mr Corbyn dismissed the talks as a ""stunt"". The PM will publish a new plan on Monday with a full debate and key vote scheduled for Tuesday, 29 January. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? Senior politicians on all sides have also been meeting with cabinet ministers to try to find a way forward. But Mr Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, declined to take part, telling Mrs May to ""ditch the red lines"" and ""get serious about proposals for the future"". In a speech in Hastings Mr Corbyn said: ""With no-deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phony talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring."" Mr Corbyn said the ""best outcome"" was to call a general election to ""break the deadlock"". The Labour leader has emailed Labour MPs urging them not to talk to Mrs May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. His stance has come under fire from Labour MP Mike Gapes, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, who told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Jeremy Corbyn has been quite happy in the past to talk to Hamas, Hezobollah... I find it extraordinary he's not prepared to go and meet the prime minister."" Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now Mark Urban: Is Brussels ready to give UK more time? In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I note that you have said that 'ruling out' no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the Government's power to rule out no deal. ""Let me explain why. Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless Parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. ""So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a Withdrawal Agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. ""I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result."" She wrote that she would be ""happy"" to discuss Mr Corbyn's proposals. On Wednesday night, speaking outside Downing Street after talks with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru, Mrs May called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"". ""It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done,"" she said. Separately, Downing Street said the government has produced a ""very short paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold another EU referendum, which suggests it would take ""in excess of a year"". The point of the document was to ""inform the expected discussion"" Mrs May was likely to have with MPs who back another public vote, government sources say. The prime minister is holding meetings with various party leaders as well as Tory Brexiteers and the DUP - both of whom rejected her withdrawal deal earlier this week - on Thursday. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay are also holding talks with senior opposition politicians, including Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.

The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said that the extension of Article 50 - the two year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of a second EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the talks were just ""time wasting"" if the prime minister was not prepared to consider another referendum, rule out a no-deal Brexit or to extend Article 50. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no deal Brexit off the table and a People's Vote on our European future"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum, said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". Following her meeting on Thursday, Green MP Caroline Lucas said the PM refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. ""I repeatedly urged her again and again to take 'no deal' off the table because I think it completely skews the talks because you know that cliff edge is there,"" she said. Mrs May was also resisting the option of extending Article 50, Ms Lucas said. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister was in ""listening mode"" and there was optimism that a Brexit deal could still be reached. She said she made a ""clear ask"" in relation to the Irish backstop, urging Mrs May to address it ""in a satisfactory way"". What does the DUP want from Brexit talks? What happens next? When asked what the government was willing to compromise on, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis refused to give specifics. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mrs May would not consider a customs union and that he did not believe a new referendum was ""the right way to go"". Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. Read full article. EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested that Brussels was ready to respond to any changes in Mrs May's ""red lines"", saying: ""If they change, we'll change."" He said getting an agreement was ""in everybody's interest"" and that ""something has to change"" if it is to be secured. The prime minister survived a vote of no confidence in her government by 325 to 306 votes - a margin of 19 - thanks to the backing of the 10 members of the DUP. Had they switched allegiance, the government would have lost by one vote.

This came after MPs voted against Mrs May's plans for Brexit on Tuesday night by a historic margin when it was rejected by 230 votes -the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. This video can not be played The former prime minister tells Today leaving the EU has to be delayed Former prime minister Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today that an extension to Article 50 was ""inevitable"" at this point and warned a no-deal Brexit would do ""profound damage"" to the UK's economy. There remains deep division among Mrs May's own MPs - including within her cabinet - about possible compromises, such as the option of staying in a customs union. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The government must remove the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit"" The Times newspaper,externalclaimed Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and other cabinet Brexiteers want Mrs May to present MPs with a ""Plan B"" on Monday that would include a promise to impose a time-limit on the Northern Irish backstop - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland - and to negotiate a Canada-style free trade deal.

Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock No-deal Brexit warning for UK drivers And the Telegraph reportedit had seen a leaked transcript of a conference call,externalin which Chancellor Philip Hammond told business leaders that a no-deal Brexit could be ""taken off the table"". Meanwhile, the SNP's Ian Blackford has also written to Mr Corbyn, along with other opposition leaders, to urge him to back another referendum as Labour's official position. And, in a letter published in the Times newspaper, more than 170 leading business figures called for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to back another referendum on withdrawal from the European Union ""to stop us crashing out of the EU with no deal at all"". Addressing a Leave Means Leave gathering in Westminster on Thursday evening, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Brexiteers should ""prepare"" and ""organise"" for the possibility of a another referendum.

Why is the government cooling on nuclear?,"The previous power station at Wylfa was closed in 2015 There was a time - not so long ago - that government ministers talked enthusiastically about a new nuclear age. A fleet of brand new reactors producing reliable, low carbon electricity for decades to come. Not only that, but the government wouldn't be taking any of the risks associated with financing and building them. Hinkley, Moorside, Wylfa, Oldbury, Bradwell and Sizewell were identified as the sites for the most significant national wave of new nuclear power construction anywhere in the world. Of those six, only one is under construction, three have been abandoned, and two face an uphill battle to get the green light. Under those circumstances, you might think the government would be embarrassed that its energy policy was in disarray. But it's not. The collapse of the Wylfa and Oldbury projects today (following the abandonment of Moorside) is evidence of some new economic realities that have seen government enthusiasm for new nuclear fade. The first and most obvious is the cost of building the darn things. At Â£20bn Hinkley Point is the most expensive UK construction project to date - HS2 will beat it. The good news is that the UK government isn't paying a penny of it. The bad news is that the electricity it will one day produce will be expensive. EDF, the French contractor that's paying for its construction, could only raise the money to do it by extracting a guarantee from the UK government that it would receive more than double the current going rate - for 35 years. That's one way to finance it. Let EDF raise the money and take the risk but ultimately foist the cost onto future generations of energy customers. One of the reasons Hinkley is so expensive is that EDF needed to go out and borrow huge sums for a risky project at interest rates of over 9%. In fact, of the total Â£20bn bill for Hinkley, well over half of it was the cost of raising the money over the lifetime of the project. There are cheaper ways to finance a project like this. The government can borrow money much more cheaply than anyone else. Right now it could get a Â£20bn 10-year loan at 1.3% and use that money to build the thing itself. There are financial and political problems with that. First, it adds to the public debt - which successive recent governments have been keen to reduce. Second, if there are massive cost overruns (and that is almost a rule with nuclear projects), the government foots the spiralling bill, taking commensurate political flak. Third, if the government is suddenly in the business of building nuclear power stations, why not other things - in fact why not nationalise the infrastructure we have already got? That is not comfortable territory for a Conservative government. There is a another way. Pay-as-you-go. Rather than lumber future generations with more expensive energy, get current consumers to pay a little extra on their bills (amount decided by the regulator) during the construction. This removes the need for massive borrowing and means you don't have to offer a juicy price guarantee to the contractor at the end as a reward for taking the operational and financial risk. This is the model the government now prefers and is testing on the Thames Tideway project. If Sizewell and Bradwell are ever built - this is how they will be financed. I say ""if"" because the truth is, the sums for new nuclear have been made very tough by the sharp falls in the cost of renewables. In 2015, the cost of offshore wind was over Â£140 per megawatt hour. That makes Hinkley Point look cheap at Â£92.50. The price of offshore wind is now Â£57.50. But hang on, says the nuclear industry. The wind doesn't always blow. When it doesn't, you will have to fire up gas or even coal stations to fill the gaps in the depths of winter. You are jeopardising our chances of meeting CO2 emissions targets and threatening security of energy supply. The government accepts some of this, and that is why Business Secretary Greg Clark said today that he is still open to new nuclear projects. But the government's preferred direction is towards smaller reactors of the type being developed by Rolls Royce, in which the government will contribute research backing, in the hope it becomes a major new export industry. The UK government is not alone in cooling on big nuclear. One of the reasons that Wylfa, Oldbury and Moorside collapsed was because the Japanese government could not get sufficiently behind the Hitachi and Toshiba projects. After the Fukushima disaster, backing nuclear power - particularly foreign nuclear power - is a pretty tough sell back home. Whatever it does, the government doesn't feel the need to do anything very quickly. The National Infrastructure Commission has said it doesn't need to make a decision for several years yet, and the National Grid says spare energy capacity is increasing rather than decreasing. Government sources say the resilience of the system to last year's ""Beast from the East"" also reassured officials. All this makes life difficult for EDF, which wants to build the follow-up to Hinkley Point at Sizewell. They will argue strenuously that only by adding a second, do you realise the economies of scale. Same design + same process + same skilled workforce + different funding model = quicker and cheaper project. Also, the more you rely on wind, the more exposed you are to its intermittence. The only way to make sure you have a secure, low carbon, reliable ""base load"" is to double-down on nuclear. That argument may yet still work but it is now much, much harder to win.

Why is Wylfa important?,"Work on Wylfa Newydd would start in 2020 if it gets the final go ahead There has been concern about whether or not there will be a new Wylfa nuclear plant in Wales in recent weeks. The future of plans for Wylfa is unclear afterJapanese tech company Hitachi said it was suspending work on the nuclear power plant. So what is the big fuss about it - and what does Hitachi's announcement mean for people in Wales? Here is what you need to know about Wylfa Newydd. The new Wylfa power station would be built next to the old power plant on Anglesey Why is Wylfa a big deal? Wylfa Newydd is a plan for a nuclear plant in north Wales. As nuclear plants go in the UK, it is a big one. It represents a real economic opportunity for north Wales to grow and would create about 9,000 jobs for people during construction. There are plans to build two to three power plants at Wylfa in Anglesey and another in Gloucestershire, producing nuclear energy in the 2020s. It is a huge chance for young people to get highly skilled, well paid work and for businesses in north Wales to grow. Wylfa nuclear 'tremendous blow' for Wales Will Anglesey profit from Wylfa? And it could have ripple effects throughout the whole of Wales, by bringing Â£5.7bn to the Welsh economy, according to independent research. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the scheme would be the ""biggest infrastructure project in Wales for a generation"". The original Wylfa Nuclear power station was decommissioned in 2015 Who is Hitachi and why is it thinking of pulling out? Big nuclear plans like Wylfa do not come cheap. It is a multi-billion pound investment being carried out by giant Japanese tech company Hitachi. But there are worries Hitachi may ditch the project - especially since announcing it will suspend it - because construction costs could rise, and uncertainty about what Brexit will mean. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met Theresa May on Thursday - but Wylfa was not discussed The company has been intalks with the UK government since June last yearto agree how Wylfa Newydd will be paid for. These negotiations are critical to the project because it decides how much public money can be invested into Wylfa. Wylfa is an expensive commitment - even for a big company like Hitachi. So it is counting even more on taxpayer money helping them out. However with the UK government's efforts fixed on Brexit, the firm has now ""pressed the pause button"",as an economic adviser put it. There is no upfront cash, no solid commitment by the government, so Wylfa Newydd is becoming riskier for Hitachi. Hitachi are in talks with the UK government about Wylfa What happens if Wylfa is later scrapped? If Hitachi completely pulls the plug it is bad news for people and businesses in Wales. It has just started hiring young apprentices and there is a Â£90,000 promise for an apprentice training scheme in Anglesey. So without the promise of Wylfa, could it mean a brain drain for north Wales? This includes people outside Anglesey too. People across north Wales, from Wrexham to Porthmadog hoping to benefit would have to look elsewhere for anything close to this size of engineering opportunity. Wylfa impact 'not adequately examined' Hitachi 'not given up' on power plant So who is affected if there is no Wylfa? The impacts of this would-be investment boost to Wales will be felt by people and Welsh businesses far and wide. Seventeen-year-olds looking for work at Wylfa would have to look to England for well-paid skilled jobs in the nuclear industry. And businesses in Wales who have already felt the benefit from the nuclear plans, may get less employment.

May meets MPs 'to seek Brexit consensus',"This video can not be played Theresa May has called on MPs to ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward Theresa May has urged Jeremy Corbyn to discuss his Brexit plans with her, after he said he would not take part in talks until ""no deal"" was ruled out. In a letter to the Labour leader, the PM wrote that ruling out no deal was an ""impossible condition"" as it was not within the government's power to do it. She has been meeting other leaders to try to find a compromise on Brexit after her deal was rejected by MPs. Earlier, Mr Corbyn dismissed the talks as a ""stunt"". The PM will publish a new plan on Monday with a full debate and key vote scheduled for Tuesday, 29 January. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? Senior politicians on all sides have also been meeting with cabinet ministers to try to find a way forward. But Mr Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, declined to take part, telling Mrs May to ""ditch the red lines"" and ""get serious about proposals for the future"". In a speech in Hastings Mr Corbyn said: ""With no-deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phony talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring."" Mr Corbyn said the ""best outcome"" was to call a general election to ""break the deadlock"". The Labour leader has emailed Labour MPs urging them not to talk to Mrs May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. His stance has come under fire from Labour MP Mike Gapes, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, who told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Jeremy Corbyn has been quite happy in the past to talk to Hamas, Hezobollah... I find it extraordinary he's not prepared to go and meet the prime minister."" Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now Mark Urban: Is Brussels ready to give UK more time? In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I note that you have said that 'ruling out' no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the Government's power to rule out no deal. ""Let me explain why. Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless Parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. ""So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a Withdrawal Agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. ""I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result."" She wrote that she would be ""happy"" to discuss Mr Corbyn's proposals. On Wednesday night, speaking outside Downing Street after talks with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru, Mrs May called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"". ""It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done,"" she said. Separately, Downing Street said the government has produced a ""very short paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold another EU referendum, which suggests it would take ""in excess of a year"". The point of the document was to ""inform the expected discussion"" Mrs May was likely to have with MPs who back another public vote, government sources say. The prime minister is holding meetings with various party leaders as well as Tory Brexiteers and the DUP - both of whom rejected her withdrawal deal earlier this week - on Thursday. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay are also holding talks with senior opposition politicians, including Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.

The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said that the extension of Article 50 - the two year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of a second EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the talks were just ""time wasting"" if the prime minister was not prepared to consider another referendum, rule out a no-deal Brexit or to extend Article 50. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no deal Brexit off the table and a People's Vote on our European future"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum, said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". Following her meeting on Thursday, Green MP Caroline Lucas said the PM refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. ""I repeatedly urged her again and again to take 'no deal' off the table because I think it completely skews the talks because you know that cliff edge is there,"" she said. Mrs May was also resisting the option of extending Article 50, Ms Lucas said. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister was in ""listening mode"" and there was optimism that a Brexit deal could still be reached. She said she made a ""clear ask"" in relation to the Irish backstop, urging Mrs May to address it ""in a satisfactory way"". What does the DUP want from Brexit talks? What happens next? When asked what the government was willing to compromise on, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis refused to give specifics. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mrs May would not consider a customs union and that he did not believe a new referendum was ""the right way to go"". Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. Read full article. EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested that Brussels was ready to respond to any changes in Mrs May's ""red lines"", saying: ""If they change, we'll change."" He said getting an agreement was ""in everybody's interest"" and that ""something has to change"" if it is to be secured. The prime minister survived a vote of no confidence in her government by 325 to 306 votes - a margin of 19 - thanks to the backing of the 10 members of the DUP. Had they switched allegiance, the government would have lost by one vote.

This came after MPs voted against Mrs May's plans for Brexit on Tuesday night by a historic margin when it was rejected by 230 votes -the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. This video can not be played The former prime minister tells Today leaving the EU has to be delayed Former prime minister Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today that an extension to Article 50 was ""inevitable"" at this point and warned a no-deal Brexit would do ""profound damage"" to the UK's economy. There remains deep division among Mrs May's own MPs - including within her cabinet - about possible compromises, such as the option of staying in a customs union. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The government must remove the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit"" The Times newspaper,externalclaimed Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and other cabinet Brexiteers want Mrs May to present MPs with a ""Plan B"" on Monday that would include a promise to impose a time-limit on the Northern Irish backstop - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland - and to negotiate a Canada-style free trade deal. Q&A: The Northern Irish backstop What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock No-deal Brexit warning for UK drivers And the Telegraph reportedit had seen a leaked transcript of a conference call,externalin which Chancellor Philip Hammond told business leaders that a no-deal Brexit could be ""taken off the table"". Meanwhile, the SNP's Ian Blackford has also written to Mr Corbyn, along with other opposition leaders, to urge him to back another referendum as Labour's official position. And, in a letter published in the Times newspaper, more than 170 leading business figures called for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to back another referendum on withdrawal from the European Union ""to stop us crashing out of the EU with no deal at all"". Addressing a Leave Means Leave gathering in Westminster on Thursday evening, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Brexiteers should ""prepare"" and ""organise"" for the possibility of a another referendum. ""If I have to fight again against this lot... it's no more Mr Nice Guy,"" he said.

"The diet to save lives, the planet and feed us all?","A diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet. Scientists have been trying to figure out how we are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come. Their answer - ""the planetary health diet"" - does not completely banish meat and dairy. But it is recommending we get most of our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) instead. Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat. If you eat meat every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you're looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that's your lot. You can still have a couple of portions of fish and the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of your protein will need to come from. The researchers are recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day instead. There's also a major push on all fruit and veg, which should make up half of every plate of food we eat. Although there's a cull on ""starchy vegetables"" such as the humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa. If you served it all up this is what you would be allowed each day: Nuts- 50g a day Beans,chickpeas,lentilsand other legumes- 75g a day Fish- 28g a day Eggs- 13g a day (so one and a bit a week) Meat- 14g a day of red meat and 29g a day of chicken Carbs- whole grains like bread and rice 232g a day and 50g a day of starchy vegetables Dairy- 250g - the equivalent of one glass of milk Vegetables-(300g) and fruit (200g) The diet has room for 31g ofsugarand about 50g worth ofoilslike olive oil. Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive.Update your browser to have a go! Prof Walter Willet, one of the researchers who is based at Harvard, said no and that after a childhood on a farm eating three portions of red meat a day he was now pretty much in line with the planetary health diet. ""There's tremendous variety there,"" he said. ""You can take those foods and put them together in thousands of different ways. We're not talking about a deprivation diet here, it is healthy eating that is flexible and enjoyable."" These are some plates of food that meet the planetary health diet rules BBC Food: Health recipes and diet information This plan requires changes to diets in pretty much every corner of the world. Europe and North America need to cut back massively on red meat, East Asia needs to cut back on fish, Africa on starchy vegetables. ""Humanity has never attempted to change the food system at this scale and this speed,"" said Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, at Stockholm University. ""Whether it's a fantasy or not, a fantasy doesn't have to be bad... it's time to dream of a good world,"" she says. Taxes on red meat are one of the many options the researchers say may be necessary to persuade us to switch diets. A group of 37 scientists from around the world were brought together aspart of the EAT-Lancet commission,external. They're a mix of experts from farming to climate change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their findings which have been published in the Lancet. The world population reached seven billion in 2011 and it's now around 7.7 billion. That figure is expected to reach10 billion around 2050,externaland will keep on climbing. The researchers say the diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year. That number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are now the biggest killers in developed countries. The use of land for growing food and forestry accounts for around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's about the same as from electricity and heating, and substantially more than from all the trains, planes and automobiles on the planet. When you look more closely at the food sector's environmental impact, you can see that meat and dairy are the major factors. Worldwide, livestock accounts for between 14.5 and 18% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to other warming gases, agriculture is one of the leading contributors to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agriculture is also a significant source of air pollution with ammonia from farms a major cause of fine particulate matter, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is a threat to health worldwide. Similarly when it comes to water, agriculture and food productions are one of the biggest threats, consuming 70% of global freshwater sources for irrigation. The researchers' aim was to feed more people while: minimising greenhouse gas emissions preventing any species going extinct having no expansion of farmland, and preserving water However, just changing diets is nowhere near enough. To make the numbers add up, also requires a halving of food waste and an increase in the amount of food produced on current farmland. ""If we were just minimising greenhouse gases we'd say everyone be vegan,"" said Prof Willet. However, it was unclear whether a vegan diet was the healthiest option, he said. The EAT-Lancet Commission is going to take its findings to governments around the world and bodies such as the WHO to see if it can begin to change the way we eat.

No-deal Brexit warning for UK drivers,"If UK motorists plan to drive within the EU after Brexit, they need to act soon or risk breaking the law. That's because a no-deal Brexit would leave drivers needing to have proof of insurance known as a Green Card. EU regulations will hit businesses and individuals. They will also apply to anyone driving across the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border. You need to order the card a month before you plan to travel, warned the Association of British Insurers. Although European insurance authorities agreed to waive the need for Green Cards in the event of a no-deal Brexit in May 2018, it has not been confirmed by the European Commission. UK drivers living in the EU urged to get new licence How will Brexit affect my holidays to Europe? It means Green Cards would be required under EU regulations as proof of insurance if the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal. The documents are supplied by insurers and anyone who drives without one may be breaking the law. Meanwhile the government is still pressing for the European Commission to give the Green Card-waiver a green light. A spokesperson from the Department for Transport said: ""The UK meets all requirements to remain a part of the Green Card-free circulation zone when we leave the EU, and we urge the Commission to issue a decision which would ensure UK motorists can drive in the EU without a Green Card."" Among those affected will be: People who drive across the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border. Anyone planning to take their vehicle to Europe, such as a family planning a holiday to France in the Easter holidays. Any freight company planning to transport goods into the EU after 29 March. EU motorists will also need a Green Card if they plan to drive in the UK. That also applies to Brits living abroad who have arranged cover in the country they live in. If UK motorists are renting a car abroad, they won't need to produce a Green Card as the rental company will provide local insurance. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said: ""As it looks increasingly possible that a no-deal Brexit may happen, we want all insurance customers to know the facts about what this means for them."" Customers' solutions for lower premiums Car and house insurance faces price probe How does Brexit affect the pound? When it comes to travel insurance, Mr Evans said that cover would continue to work in the normal way, even in the event that there is no replacement for the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) system that allows people some free healthcare in the EU. However, he added: ""Customers should always double-check their travel insurance policy meets their full needs."" If there is no deal with the EU, drivers may also need to get an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive abroad. RAC spokesperson Nicholas Lyes said: ""There will be two different types of IDP that apply in EU states, so it is important that motorists heading abroad in the event of a no-deal Brexit check which is required. In cases where someone is driving to Spain via France, they would need both types of IDP."" From 1 February, the government will begin providing IDPs at 2,500 Post Offices across the UK. The NI Department for the Economy suggests that there are approximately 110 million crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland each year. This includes cars, HGVs and buses/coaches. Eurotunnel Shuttle Services carried 1.6 million trucks and 2.6 million cars in 2017 (total number; both directions). According to official statistics, in 2017 there were 2.4 million HGVs travelling from Great Britain to Europe (excluding NI) and 370,000 HGVs travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

Brexit: Are we running out of time?,"Throughout the Brexit process, people have used the image of a ticking clock. On 29 March, unless something changes, the clock stops. That's why political pressure in the United Kingdom to extend Article 50 (the two year negotiating period for leaving the EU - which runs out on that date) is growing. Article 50,externalcan't be paused. It can only be extended or revoked altogether and if neither of these things happen, the UK leaves, deal or no deal. So, people are worried that time is about to run out. Extending Article 50 is not government policy. But asked by the BBC on Wednesday if there was still time to leave the EU with a deal passed through Parliament, the Justice Secretary, David Gauke, said: ""It's still possible - but it is very tight. We don't have a lot of spare time, frankly."" ""I think we've got days before we will start to run out of parliamentary time. I hope we can meet that timing."" These may be the words of a government minister keeping up the pressure on Parliament to agree on something. But it's not just about agreeing a deal - although there is, as yet, no clear sign of a majority in Parliament for any form of Brexit or for an election or another referendum. It's also that even if Parliament were to vote in favour of the Prime Minister's deal, or something like it, there is a huge amount of legislative work to do. There are now fewer than 40 legislative days left before Brexit is due to happen. And if the withdrawal agreement were to be approved, it would then have to be turned into new legislation. The passage of that legislation could be contentious. Theresa May's deal voted down Chancellor hints at Article 50 extension Article 50: Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit The next Brexit vote - on what Theresa May is proposing to do next - is scheduled for 29 January. After that there will be fewer than 30 sitting days in which to get new laws through Parliament. A little more time could be found if Parliament were to sit on Fridays and a planned parliamentary recess next month was abandoned. That might buy a maximum of 14 extra days but the schedule would still be extremely challenging. There's also a huge amount of secondary legislation that needs to be passed, making small changes to the law (sometimes just tweaking language, sometimes more complicated) via what are known as statutory instruments (SIs). The government estimates it will need nearly 600 SIs before Brexit day. The latestresearch from the Hansard Society,externalshows that 305 SIs related to Brexit  have been introduced so far - and only 67 have completed their passage through Parliament. There are also six other pieces of primary legislation going through Parliament at the moment (on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, international health care and financial services) - and all of them would need to be approved before the end of March if the UK leaves the EU with no deal. The Institute for Government iskeeping track of the legislation here,external. If there was a post-Brexit transition period, during which all the rules would stay the same, there would be more time to complete the passage of this legislation (and the financial services bill would fall away completely). But as long as a no-deal Brexit is on the table, ministers and officials have to plan for the possibility of having to pass them all by 29 March. In exceptional circumstances, it is possible in theory to ram legislation through Parliament extremely quickly. The 2017 Northern Ireland Budget Act, for example, passed the House of Commons in one day, the House of Lords in one day, and received royal assent two days later. But it would be unprecedented to operate in that way, with so little scrutiny, for legislation as momentous as the EU Withdrawal Act, and it would obviously require the cooperation of both Houses of Parliament. First of all, the government would need the formal agreement of all 27 other EU countries. The EU would need to be convinced that there were good reasons for an extension, beyond prolonging unresolved political arguments in Westminster. That could mean developments in UK politics that would change the nature of the argument over Brexit - such as a decision to call an election or another referendum. Or, if a deal was agreed late in the day, a short extension could be considered to give a bit more time to complete the ratification process and pass the necessary legislation. If other EU countries agreed, the government would still need parliamentary approval in Westminster for extending Article 50 via a resolution and it would need to change the date of exit in EU law. Again, that could be done relatively easily with the support of Parliament. But how much extra time could be needed? Elections for the next European Parliament are being held in May and there are currently no plans for the UK to take part. But new members (MEPs) won't be sworn in until the first week of July, which creates a three-month window. ""An extension of Article 50 until 1 July is feasible without needing to hold European parliamentary elections in the UK in May,"" said the Labour MEP Richard Corbett. In theory the outgoing European Parliament could be convened in an extraordinary session in June, after the elections, to complete its part in the ratification of any Brexit withdrawal deal. There are already calls for a much longer extension of Article 50 - but if there have been no European elections in the UK, that takes you into very tricky legal territory. The UK would still be an EU member state but it would have no newly elected MEPs. A confidential legal opinion, first drafted by the European parliament's legal service in 2017 and seen by the BBC, concludes that the UK would technically be in breach of its treaty obligations if it did not hold European elections while it remained an EU member state. But - importantly - the opinion also concludes that such a move wouldn't make the new parliament illegal. ""The possibility for the European parliament to be validly constituted following the 2019 elections,"" it says, ""would not be affected by a potential failure by the UK to organise elections."" Lawyers will continue to argue over the details, and there will be many political reservations. Like with so many parts of the Brexit process, this is uncharted territory. And no-one is sure what is likely to happen next.

Horizon Nuclear, which is owned by Hitachi, said work could restart when funding solutions were agreed. About 9,000 workers had been expected to build the Anglesey plant. Leighton Jenkins, assistant director of the Confederation of British Industry in Wales, said the importance of the decision ""cannot be over emphasised"". ""This is not just important for the region, not just for Wales but for the whole of the UK's energy structure,"" he said. Hitachi to halt work on Wales nuclear plant Wylfa and the energy gap - what next? ""We are becoming a nation of artist's impressions... We need to have a strategic review as to why we struggle to deliver major infrastructure projects in Wales."" Wylfa Newydd would have a 60-year operational life Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon's chief executive, said: ""We have made very strong progress on all aspects of the project's development, including the UK design of our tried and tested reactor, supply chain development and especially the building of a very capable organisation of talented and committed people. ""We have been in close discussions with the UK government, in cooperation with the government of Japan, on the financing and associated commercial arrangements for our project for some years now. ""I am very sorry to say that despite the best efforts of everyone involved we've not been able to reach an agreement to the satisfaction of all concerned. ""As a result we will be suspending the development of the Wylfa Newydd project, as well as work related to Oldbury, until a solution can be found."" The two projects would require a total investment of Â£20bn. National Grid has also confirmed it is suspending work on as 20-mile (32km) network of overhead pylons on Anglesey, which would connect with the new power station. ""We will continue to keep in close contact with Horizon to understand their plans,"" said a spokesman. ""We will only develop our proposals if they are needed."" Richard Foxall, Horizon's strategic communications director, said it was going to be a ""very tough time"" for the 150 people, including contractors, already working on the project. ""There isn't going to be very many of us - if any of us - left here. It's going to be a huge hit for us."" Horizon said it was looking to minimising the impact and was starting a consultation with staff, who have shown ""extraordinary talent, resilience and determination"". Energy is not currently devolved to the Welsh Government but Economy Minister Ken Skates said he was ""deeply concerned"" and that an emergency economic ambitions board meeting would take place on Monday. He said the UK Government ""needs to step up to the plate"" and he wanted urgent assurances about the project and the wider implications for the regional economy. What's Wylfa and why is it important? Cumbria nuclear power plant in doubt 'Disappointment' in Wyfa decision The plant aimed to have a generating capacity of 2900MW of electricity by the mid 2020s - enough power for about five million homes - and a 60-year operational life. The island's Plaid Cymru Welsh assembly member Rhun ap Iorwerth said it was a very worrying time for the staff and apprentices already employed on the project. ""But I'm thinking also about those who've pinned their hopes on future employment there,"" he said. ""Now we have to look at ways of moving forward. UK Government has to show if it's serious about backing Wylfa."" Anglesey Council is to hold a meeting in the next few days, with council leader Llinos Medi saying they would press the case with the UK government for the delay to be overcome. Gwynedd council leader Dyfrig Siencyn, vice chairman of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, said it was worth ""billions"" to the local economy. ""It's quite difficult to imagine the sums we're talking about so the impacts are extremely severe,"" he added. Coleg Menai has 700 engineering students, many hoping to take advantage of opportunities from Wylfa and its supply chain. It has also welcomed hundreds of local school children, encouraged to look at future jobs in engineering and the nuclear industry. The college confirmed its 30 Horizon apprentices would be funded to finish their three year courses and still be offered work experience. ""That is at least some consolation to us today,"" said Dafydd Evans, chief executive of the GrÅµp Llandrillo Menai college network. ""I don't want young people to lose faith - we've got to keep some element of optimism while we work really hard to get this scheme on track."" Analysis from Steffan Messenger, BBC Wales environment correspondent Nuclear currently accounts for more than a fifth of electricity generated in the UK. It has been seen as important because it is predictable low-carbon power, constantly feeding the national grid unlike the fluctuating output of wind and solar. The plan had been for several new plants to come on stream by the mid 2030s. But so far only one proposal - Hinkley Point C - has made it off the drawing board - with experts warning of a looming energy gap. If traditional, big plants are too costly, proponents of small modular reactors - such as the one proposed for Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd - could see this as an opportunity. Others will call for significant investment in renewables. Read more from Steffan here Edward Jones, a lecturer in economics at Bangor University who advises the North Wales Growth Bid, said: ""A pause is the best case scenario."" He added people in north Wales had already been investing in developing new skills for the project, along with investment by Hitachi themselves and other stakeholders. Unite union called it a ""hammer blow"" and said the UK government had ""failed miserably to put its full weight behind this bid"". UK Business Secretary Greg Clark told MPs that ministers were willing to provide a ""significant and generous package"" of support to Hitachi to continue work at Wylfa. He revealed that the UK government was willing to take a one third equity stake in the project and was ready to provide all of the required debt financing to see the project completed. Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday said she had raised Wylfa at her recent meeting with her Japanese counterpart and she wanted to see nuclear ""as part of our energy mix in the future."" Welsh Secretary Alun Cairnstold BBC Good Evening Wales he was still ""very positive"" the project would go aheadand that a partner would be found. Conservative environment spokesman Andrew RT Davies AM added: ""Whilst disappointing, this news isn't the end of the road,"" he said. But the anti-nuclear group Pawb welcomed the announcement and said its warnings over a long period about the project's costs had been ignored. ""It is time for politicians and officials from the UK government, the Welsh Government and Anglesey to admit that they were wrong,"" it said in a statement.  ""Wales is rich in natural resources which can be used to create a vibrant and sustainable energy future, and above all else create more jobs in less time than Wylfa would have done.""

Cumbria nuclear plant in doubt,"An artist's impression of the Moorside nuclear plant Toshiba plans to wind up its UK nuclear business after failing to find a buyer, dealing a potentially fatal blow to plans for a new nuclear power station in Cumbria. Its NuGen division was behind the development of the Moorside project. Toshiba's decision will dent the UK's plans to develop new nuclear power stations. Unions have criticised the government for failing to intervene and ensure the project went ahead. The Japanese firm said it would start the wind-up process in January. ""After considering the additional costs entailed in continuing to operate NuGen, Toshiba recognises that the economically rational decision is to withdraw from the UK nuclear power plant construction project, and has resolved to take steps to wind-up NuGen,""the Toshiba statement said.,external Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) had been a preferred bidder to take over the nuclear power plant project, but those talks fell through after more than a year of negotiations. Nuclear archive wins best building award Government must 'get a grip' on Sellafield Job cuts at firm behind new nuclear plant Toshiba said it expected to take a 15bn yen ($131.8m; Â£100.5m) hit from the withdrawal, but shares in the firm jumped 12.7% in Tokyo. The GMB union saidthe ""looming collapse"" of Moorside had been ""depressingly predictable"". ""Relying in this way on foreign companies for our country's essential energy needs was always irresponsible,"" said its national officer Justin Bowden. ""A new nuclear power station in West Cumbria remains vital for the UK's future energy security and requires urgent action."" In September NuGen announced it was reducing its team at Moorside from more than 100 to fewer than 40 - leading to speculation the plant's development was in jeopardy. NuGen was initially co-owned by Toshiba and the French firm Engie. Toshiba was subsequently forced to buy the remaining 40% of NuGen it did not already own via a bankruptcy condition related to Engie.

"Shoreham pilot 'chose highest risk stunt'Andy Hill was performing a loop manoeuvre just before his jet crashed and exploded, killing 11 men.Sussex","This video can not be played The Hawker Hunter crashed into A27 in Shoreham Jurors have been shown footage of a fatal jet crash at the Shoreham Airshow in which 11 men died. Andy Hill's Hawker Hunter jet hit the ground and exploded after he attempted a manoeuvre known as the bent loop, the Old Bailey has heard. The court was shown several clips of the moment the vintage aircraft erupted into a ""massive fireball"" upon crashing into the A27 in August 2015. Mr Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. On the second day of the trial, Prosecutor Tom Kark QC played a series of videos recorded by spectators. He warned jurors they may find the footage, parts of which were filmed by a witness standing behind some of the victims, ""distressing"". ""You are in effect seeing these gentleman in the last few seconds of their lives,"" he said. One clip, filmed by a spectator on the road, shows the aircraft going into the loop manoeuvre before coming towards the camera. It ends with images of the fireball, with the footage cutting out as the person filming throws themselves to the ground. A second piece of footage shows the aircraft descend behind a group of trees before bursting into flames. Jurors were also shown a clip filmed inside the aircraft's cockpit. Lasting about a minute, the footage shows the jet performing a banking turn and a loop before inverting and descending, ending with the impact. The court has heard the aircraft erupted in a ""massive fireball"" upon impact David Evans, a member of the Shoreham Airshow's flying committee, said he had watched as Mr Hill performed the manoeuvre. Giving evidence, the former Civil Aviation Authority air display director said the jet ""was quite slow; it was quite low"". ""That's when I thought 'my god' this doesn't look very good. It was, in my opinion, a bit low to undertake the manoeuvre,"" he told the jury. Asked if he took any action to halt the display, he replied: ""I think it had gone beyond that point."" Mr Kark told jurors Mr Hill chose to perform the ""highest risk"" manoeuvre possible before the fatal crash. He had committed the ""cardinal sin"" of trying to complete the trick while apparently lacking the height to do so, the Old Bailey heard. Jonathan Whaley, a ""very experienced ex-Royal Navy pilot"" who has flown more than 1,200 hours in a Hawker Hunter, had reviewed footage of the crash, Mr Kark told the court. Mr Whaley had concluded the pilot ""made a conscious decision to pull through the loop even though he appeared to be too low to do so"", Mr Kark said. Mr Whaley described this as a ""cardinal sin,"" jurors were told. The court heard that Mr Whaley viewed the bent loop as ""perhaps the highest risk manoeuvre in an aircraft which is not designed as pure aerobatic aircraft"", such as a Hawker Hunter. The prosecution argued Andy Hill was flying too low to complete a manoeuvre while performing at the Shoreham Airshow in 2015 Prosecutor Mr Kark said the crash, which killed ten victims instantly, was the inevitable outcome of a ""catalogue of errors"" on the defendant's part. He told jurors they would need to decide whether ""the true reason Mr Hill crashed his aircraft was his dreadful negligence"". ""At the crucial point when Mr Hill committed to the downward part of the loop there was a serious and obvious risk of death to those on the ground - a risk that was to be tragically realised,"" he said. Karim Khalil QC, defending, argued g-forces acting upon the jet rendered Mr Hill ""unable to properly and fully control the aircraft"". Mr Hill ""was not in full control of his actions"" and the errors were ""simply too numerous"" to have been made by a pilot of his experience unless he was suffering from ""cognitive impairment"",  Mr Khalil told the jury. Andy Hill had ""responded professionally"" to errors made at previous air shows, the court heard Jurors have been told Mr Hill was known to take risks, and a previous air show display had been halted due to his ""dangerous"" flying. Defence barrister Mr Khalil said Mr Hill was ""not a cavalier pilot"", nor one ""who plays fast and loose with the safety rules or the lives of others"". He said the defence would provide evidence to show criticisms of Mr Hill were either ""wrong or misplaced"". Acknowledging previous mistakes made by Mr Hill at air shows, Mr Khalil said: ""It would be a remarkable pilot indeed who had never made an error."" The defence argued Mr Hill had ""responded professionally"" and taken steps to avoid repeating the mistakes. The trial is expected to last up to seven weeks.

"World Cup tickets resold for Â£12,000Cricket World Cup organisers are prepared to take legal action against secondary ticketing sites, with some 2019 tickets being offered at 104 times face value.BBC Sport","Australia captain Aaron Finch and India counterpart Virat Kohli with the World Cup trophy World Cup organisers are prepared to take legal action against secondary ticketing sites, with some tickets being priced at over Â£12,000. Tickets for the England v Australia game at Lord's are being sold on Viagogo for 104 times their face value. ""We are working closely with lawyers to identify secondary ticket sites which infringe our terms and conditions,"" said a World Cup spokesperson. ""We are taking appropriate enforcement action against them as required."" The World Cup takes place in England and Wales from 30 May to 14 July. It is not illegal in the UK to resell tickets to international cricket matches, although the Cricket World Cup's own ticketing website states that no ticket should be offered for public sale. A Viagogo statement read: ""Viagogo does not set ticket prices, sellers set their own prices, which may be above or below the original face value. Where demand is high and tickets are limited, prices increase."" Tickets for the England v Australia game at Lord's are being sold for more than Â£12,000 each on Viagogo Tickets for all World Cup matches are banded into four categories - bronze, silver, gold and platinum. For the sold-out England-Australia match on 25 June, a vendor on Viagogo is marketing two silver tickets, with a face value of Â£115, for Â£12,029 each. There are a number of other matches involving England and also India where prices of Â£12,029 per ticket are being asked on Viagogo. The Viagogo statement continued: ""Viagogo is a marketplace and doesn't buy or sell tickets. Viagogo provides a platform for third party sellers to sell tickets to event goers. ""Event organisers sometimes make claims that they will deny entry to people who have purchased resold tickets. These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal."" Separately, it has been alleged that Viagogo has previously approached supporters' group the Barmy Army with a request to sell some of its allocation for England matches outside of the World Cup, a claim Viagogo has not denied. When asked about the claim the company replied: ""All tickets on Viagogo are valid and it is perfectly legal to resell a ticket or give it to someone else if you want to."" A total of 48 World Cup matches will take place in England and Wales, with 36 listed as being sold out of all non-hospitality tickets on the tournament's ticketing website. The same site does have an official resale section, but no tickets are currently listed. As well as Viagogo, Stubhub is selling tickets well over their face value. Two gold tickets for the India v Pakistan match at Old Trafford on 16 June, originally priced at Â£150 per ticket, are being marketed at Â£3,280 each. When asked for a comment by BBC Sport, Stubhub said: ""As a ticketing marketplace, StubHub does not set the price of tickets that appear on our site, the fans do. Importantly, the prices for the tickets mentioned are the ones listed, but as it is often the case, those are not necessarily the prices for which tickets sell. ""StubHub believes that fans should have the flexibility to use, transfer, donate or resell their tickets on the marketplace of their choice that provides them with the best user experience and consumer protections."" Stubhub is marketing many tickets for the India v Pakistan game at a price well above the face value Rakesh Patel, founder of India supporters' group the Bharat Army, said: ""Through ballots, tickets have got into the hands of people who trying to make a quick buck."" Although Patel conceded that it is difficult for the International Cricket Council to stop tickets falling into the hands of those who want to resell them, he called on the game's governing body to do more to reward the loyalty of fans who regularly attend international matches. ""There has to be measures taken to stop these tickets getting into the wrong hands,"" he added. ""Surely the ICC can track genuine fans who turn up to matches and prioritise matches. It's something that football clubs do. ""If they are serious about dealing with tickets that get onto secondary sites, they have to do something about it, otherwise it will never stop."" In November, Cricket World Cup organisers were forced toapologise to thousands of fanswho were mistakenly told they had got tickets for the tournament through a ballot. The World Cup begins on 30 May, when hosts England meet South Africa at The Oval.

Nine arrests over Kenya hotel attack,"This video can not be played Nairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation Nine people have been arrested in Kenya following an attack on a luxury hotel compound in the capital Nairobi that killed at least 21 people. All five militants who stormed the DusitD2 hotel and business complex on Tuesday have been killed, officials say, and a major hunt is under way to find those who helped organise it. Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab says it was behind the attack. Kenya's Red Cross says everyone who was missing has now been accounted for. A stark reminder of a real threat 'Our deaths are displayed for consumption' How the hotel siege unfolded Kenyan media reports that the wife of one of the suspected attackers has been arrested in Kiambu county, just north of Nairobi. Police said they had identified Ali Salim Gichunge, also known as Farouk, through the car used in the attack. Police stand guard outside the home of one of the suspected attackers, in Kiambu County Neighbours told The Standard newspaper that he and his wife had moved in to their home in October.The couple were secretive,external, they said, and had put the contents of their home up for sale before the attack, saying they were ""moving out of Nairobi this week"". The attackers, two of which are shown here, were caught on CCTV as they entered the complex President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Tuesday that five jihadis carried out the attack, and all were ""eliminated"" by security forces after a 19-hour siege. Al-Shabab issued a statement calling the attack""a response"" to US President Donald Trump's controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A White House National Security Council spokesman responded by saying: ""This senseless act is a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat radical Islamist terrorism."" Details of those who lost their lives have gradually emerged, and funerals have been held as mourners bury their loved ones. A policeman who rushed to the scene was revealed to be among the dead as the death toll rose on Wednesday.

A stark reminder of a real threat 'Our deaths are displayed for consumption' How the hotel siege unfolded Kenyan media reports that the wife of one of the suspected attackers has been arrested in Kiambu county, just north of Nairobi. Police said they had identified Ali Salim Gichunge, also known as Farouk, through the car used in the attack. Police stand guard outside the home of one of the suspected attackers, in Kiambu County Neighbours told The Standard newspaper that he and his wife had moved in to their home in October.The couple were secretive,external, they said, and had put the contents of their home up for sale before the attack, saying they were ""moving out of Nairobi this week"". The attackers, two of which are shown here, were caught on CCTV as they entered the complex President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Tuesday that five jihadis carried out the attack, and all were ""eliminated"" by security forces after a 19-hour siege. Al-Shabab issued a statement calling the attack""a response"" to US President Donald Trump's controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A White House National Security Council spokesman responded by saying: ""This senseless act is a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat radical Islamist terrorism."" Details of those who lost their lives have gradually emerged, and funerals have been held as mourners bury their loved ones. A policeman who rushed to the scene was revealed to be among the dead as the death toll rose on Wednesday. In pictures: Assault on hotel complex Kenyans praise 'heroes' of hotel attack Another victim, Kenyan James Oduor, had tweeted about the attack as it unfolded. The LG Electronics worker, who died on the eve of his birthday, was well-liked and known for his love of football. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At 23:00, a government official said that all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. But gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported just an hour later, and there was more heavy gunfire at about 07:00 on Wednesday. Security forces then combed their way through the building where frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside, hiding in offices, toilets and even under tables. 'How we survived Kenya hotel siege' The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants. In all, some 700 people were evacuated from the complex, officials said. Twenty-eight people were admitted to hospital with injuries. Many civilians were trapped in the complex for several hours Some of those killed had been dining in the Secret Garden restaurant. Other bodies were found on the third floor of the 101 room hotel. They oppose the Somali government, but have carried out attacks throughout East Africa. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? In September 2013,al-Shabab gunmen entered the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and targeted shoppers. During an 80-hour siege at the upscale centre, 67 people were killed. Two years later,the group carried out its deadliest ever assault in Kenya, shooting dead almost 150 people at Garissa University.

"BBC editor on trial over victim namingThe abuse victim says she went into ""full meltdown"" after hearing her name on air, a court hears.UK","Arif Ansari checked his reporter's script before it was broadcast, the court heard BBC Asian Network's head of news has gone on trial over the naming of a victim of sexual abuse in a live radio broadcast, a charge he denies. Victims of sexual offences are given lifetime anonymity by law. The reporter who used the victim's name said he thought it was a pseudonym - and the charge was brought against Arif Ansari, in his capacity as editor. The woman was listening to the news when her name was read out and went into ""full meltdown"", the court heard. In a witness statement, the woman - a victim of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal - said she was ""panicking and crying"". She said she had found the process of giving evidence in the sex abuse trial at Sheffield Crown Court difficult and added: ""To then have my name given out as a victim of rape on a BBC radio station was unbelievable and made me feel sick"". Sheffield Magistrates' Court was told that Mr Ansari had the role of checking and approving content for broadcast on 6 February last year. Earlier that day, reporter Rickin Majithia had been in court to hear evidence in a trial linked to the Rotherham sex abuse scandal when a victim's real name was used. Giving evidence in the trial of Mr Ansari, Mr Majithia explained how the woman gave evidence in court from behind a screen and he wrongly assumed that when her forename was used in court, it was a pseudonym. The reporter said that he had a number of previous dealings with the woman as he investigated the Rotherham abuse scandal and had become confused, thinking that the name he had always called her was her real one, when it was not. He added that he had not done any court reporting before the incident and had never even sat in a crown court before to watch a case. The prosecution said this was significant because Mr Ansari knew that was the situation - and say the charge was brought against him as he had editorial responsibility for the output that was broadcast that day. On the day of the broadcast, Mr Majithia sent Mr Ansari his script for approval at about 16:35 GMT, and it was broadcast live at 17:00, the court heard. Mr Ansari did not query the name of the victim before approving the script, nor was the script checked by BBC lawyers. Immediately after the broadcast, Mr Majithia was alerted to the mistake, and it was not repeated. The court heard that, after mistakenly broadcasting her real name he wrote an email to the witness, saying: ""I made a human error. It was a moment of confusion I will regret forever."" But the email was not sent due to advice from his superiors, the court heard. The prosecution said it accepted Mr Ansari did not know or suspect the victim's real name was in the script but said he had good reason to suspect its use might be wrong because Mr Majithia was inexperienced. Prosecutors also described Mr Majithia as ""very driven and a bit of a loose cannon"", who had produced a ""very poor"" broadcast on the case earlier in the day. Mr Ansari is charged with breaching theSexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,external, which entitles all complainants of sexual offences to lifelong anonymity. From the moment a complaint of sexual abuse is made, all publishers and broadcasters are banned from naming the complainant unless they choose to waive their anonymity or a court orders otherwise. It is the first time a BBC editor has been charged under this Act. The trial, which is expected to last two days, continues.

Shoreham pilot 'chose highest risk stunt',"This video can not be played The Hawker Hunter crashed into A27 in Shoreham Jurors have been shown footage of a fatal jet crash at the Shoreham Airshow in which 11 men died. Andy Hill's Hawker Hunter jet hit the ground and exploded after he attempted a manoeuvre known as the bent loop, the Old Bailey has heard. The court was shown several clips of the moment the vintage aircraft erupted into a ""massive fireball"" upon crashing into the A27 in August 2015. Mr Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. On the second day of the trial, Prosecutor Tom Kark QC played a series of videos recorded by spectators. He warned jurors they may find the footage, parts of which were filmed by a witness standing behind some of the victims, ""distressing"". ""You are in effect seeing these gentleman in the last few seconds of their lives,"" he said. One clip, filmed by a spectator on the road, shows the aircraft going into the loop manoeuvre before coming towards the camera. It ends with images of the fireball, with the footage cutting out as the person filming throws themselves to the ground. A second piece of footage shows the aircraft descend behind a group of trees before bursting into flames. Jurors were also shown a clip filmed inside the aircraft's cockpit. Lasting about a minute, the footage shows the jet performing a banking turn and a loop before inverting and descending, ending with the impact. The court has heard the aircraft erupted in a ""massive fireball"" upon impact David Evans, a member of the Shoreham Airshow's flying committee, said he had watched as Mr Hill performed the manoeuvre. Giving evidence, the former Civil Aviation Authority air display director said the jet ""was quite slow; it was quite low"". ""That's when I thought 'my god' this doesn't look very good. It was, in my opinion, a bit low to undertake the manoeuvre,"" he told the jury. Asked if he took any action to halt the display, he replied: ""I think it had gone beyond that point."" Mr Kark told jurors Mr Hill chose to perform the ""highest risk"" manoeuvre possible before the fatal crash. He had committed the ""cardinal sin"" of trying to complete the trick while apparently lacking the height to do so, the Old Bailey heard. Jonathan Whaley, a ""very experienced ex-Royal Navy pilot"" who has flown more than 1,200 hours in a Hawker Hunter, had reviewed footage of the crash, Mr Kark told the court. Mr Whaley had concluded the pilot ""made a conscious decision to pull through the loop even though he appeared to be too low to do so"", Mr Kark said. Mr Whaley described this as a ""cardinal sin,"" jurors were told. The court heard that Mr Whaley viewed the bent loop as ""perhaps the highest risk manoeuvre in an aircraft which is not designed as pure aerobatic aircraft"", such as a Hawker Hunter. The prosecution argued Andy Hill was flying too low to complete a manoeuvre while performing at the Shoreham Airshow in 2015 Prosecutor Mr Kark said the crash, which killed ten victims instantly, was the inevitable outcome of a ""catalogue of errors"" on the defendant's part. He told jurors they would need to decide whether ""the true reason Mr Hill crashed his aircraft was his dreadful negligence"". ""At the crucial point when Mr Hill committed to the downward part of the loop there was a serious and obvious risk of death to those on the ground - a risk that was to be tragically realised,"" he said. Karim Khalil QC, defending, argued g-forces acting upon the jet rendered Mr Hill ""unable to properly and fully control the aircraft"". Mr Hill ""was not in full control of his actions"" and the errors were ""simply too numerous"" to have been made by a pilot of his experience unless he was suffering from ""cognitive impairment"",  Mr Khalil told the jury. Andy Hill had ""responded professionally"" to errors made at previous air shows, the court heard Jurors have been told Mr Hill was known to take risks, and a previous air show display had been halted due to his ""dangerous"" flying. Defence barrister Mr Khalil said Mr Hill was ""not a cavalier pilot"", nor one ""who plays fast and loose with the safety rules or the lives of others"". He said the defence would provide evidence to show criticisms of Mr Hill were either ""wrong or misplaced"". Acknowledging previous mistakes made by Mr Hill at air shows, Mr Khalil said: ""It would be a remarkable pilot indeed who had never made an error."" The defence argued Mr Hill had ""responded professionally"" and taken steps to avoid repeating the mistakes. The trial is expected to last up to seven weeks.

State school secures 41 Oxbridge offers,"Dorcas wanted to prove that you can turn around a negative experience ""Both of my mums were so excited,"" says Dorcas Shodeinde. ""First I rang my foster mum and then I rang my actual mum,"" she explains. Dorcas has been in care since she was 14 and has just received an offer to study Law at Oxford university. She is one of 41 students at Brampton Manor, a state school in east London, to have secured an offer to study at either Oxford or Cambridge this year. The school is based in Newham - one of the poorest boroughs in London. However, its success rivals the admission rates of some of the top-performing private schools across the UK. Nearly all of those who received offers are from ethnic minority backgrounds, while two-thirds will be the first in their family to attend university. ""We need to shake off the idea that Oxford and Cambridge are just for an 'elite,'"" says the sixth form's director Half of them, like 17-year-old Dorcas, are on free school meals. ""When I was put in care because of family difficulties all I knew was that statistically care leavers don't do very well,"" she says. ""But I wanted to prove that it's not the end of the world and show my foster-sister that you can change the outcome of negative experiences."" Only 6% of young people leaving care attend university. ""I nearly didn't apply because I was scared of leaving London and figuring out where I'd live during half-term and after I graduated,"" she adds. Lydia fled Algeria when she was 12 years old Lydia Khechine, 18, travels for up to two hours a day to the school. The journey is ""worth it"", she says, smiling at her offer to study history and politics at University of Oxford. Fleeing Algeria, she arrived in the UK alone when she was 12, unable to speak English; she now lives with her older sister. Emotional, she doesn't want to go into details of her childhood in Algeria. But she says participating in inter-school debating competitions has helped boost her confidence. ""A lot of people filter themselves out of the Oxbridge process because they don't think they belong,"" she says. ""But the truth is people from unconventional backgrounds like mine do have the potential and it's about reassuring ourselves that we have a voice."" Rama has an offer to read English at Oxford Rama Rustom, who came to the UK as a refugee from Saudi Arabia in 2013, agrees. ""This offer sets my family on a new path,"" the 17-year-old says. ""In my culture, women are traditionally told not to pursue education."" She now holds an offer for English at St Hilda's College, Oxford. ""My first language is Arabic - lots of people outside of school said I couldn't do it, but my teachers always believed in me."" Brampton Manor opened its sixth form in 2012, with the aim of transforming the progression rates of disadvantaged students to the UK's top universities. Part of their motivation, the students say, is seeing the faces of former Brampton pupils who received Oxbridge offers on the school walls. At the entrance of the school, on bold laminated plaques, are lists of names of every former student to have attended university. The photos of its Oxbridge students are also displayed in multiple places across the school. In 2014, only one student received an offer. Last year, 25 students received offers from Oxford and Cambridge. This year's 41 offers, which are conditional on the students getting the grades, is a new record. New deal for schools in tough areas Oxbridge 'over-recruits from eight schools' Call for new Oxbridge colleges for disadvantaged students ""Every student here goes to university,"" says Sam Dobin, the director of sixth form, who has worked at Brampton Manor since it opened. ""We have a very traditional approach with no gimmicks or shortcuts."" Mr Dobin says there is ""no secret formula"" to its success. The school buys every student their own textbooks to encourage independent study, he says. It does not rely on supply teachers and has an in-house team of five Oxbridge graduates solely dedicated to university access. The school also has a study centre open from 06:00 until 19:30. Mr Dobin says it is always staffed and many students choose to work there until the school closes. ""This is where we choose to invest the money we receive from the pupil premium,"" he adds, referring to the additional funding given to state schools in England to help bridge the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. ""But the key is to keep telling your students that they're capable, that they're good enough. ""We need to shake off the idea that Oxford and Cambridge are just for an 'elite' couple of students and encourage everyone to apply."" Jeffery believes he has ""defied the odds"" in securing an offer from Cambridge The sixth form, which is oversubscribed and academically-selective, annually accepts 300 students, who are interviewed before being offered a place. Mr Dobin predicts at least 100 of the current cohort will apply to Oxford or Cambridge this September, and expects at least 50 offers. One student who will leave before then is 17-year-old Jeffery Maya. He joined Brampton Manor from a local comprehensive with a mixture of A and B grades and is now working hard to make good on his offer at Pembroke College, Cambridge to read natural sciences. He says he's ""defied the odds"". ""You don't see a lot of people around Newham going to college,"" he says. ""A lot of people get into illegal stuff."" His advice? ""Don't doubt yourself. The only way you won't get into Oxford or Cambridge is not applying in the first place.""

Housing market outlook worst 'for 20 years',"The housing market outlook over the next three months is the worst for 20 years, surveyors say. A net balance of 28% of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members expect sales to fall in the next three months. It's the most downbeat reading since records started in October 1998 and the pessimism is blamed on the lack of clarity around Brexit. Lack of supply and affordability also continued to affect the market. Sales expectations for the next three months are now either flat, with no change predicted, or negative, indicating falling sales, across all parts of the UK,the report said.,external Increasing numbers of surveyors reported seeing house prices fall rather than increase in December, with a net balance of 19% seeing falls rather than rises. That was up from a balance of 11% in November and marked the fourth month in a row of negative house price readings. New buyer inquiries fell for the fifth month in a row in December. The drop-off in interest from buyers was matched by a decline in fresh properties coming on to the market. Brexit uncertainty hits house purchases Where can I afford to live? Where does rent hit young people the hardest? The supply of new properties has been dwindling for six months, said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist. ""It is hardly a surprise with ongoing uncertainty about the path to Brexit dominating the news agenda, that even allowing for the normal patterns around the Christmas holidays, buyer interest in purchasing property in December was subdued. ""This is also very clearly reflected in a worsening trend in near-term sales expectations."" ""We experienced a slowing down in the local property market from last summer onwards with a lot of it down to the Brexit unknowns,"" said estate agent David Knights of David Brown & Co of Ipswich. ""Uncertainty causes people to sit on their hands."" He says that activity in November and December is generally about 50% of that seen during the rest of the year, but that the last two months of 2018 ""were noticeably more quiet"" because of that uncertainty. In the short-term, over the next three to four months, he expects the property market to continue to be subdued. ""When buyers don't know what's going to happen you can understand them being careful about how much they're prepared to offer."" But he remains positive about the property market over the slightly longer term. ""We're not going to see an instant rebound once Brexit is out of the way, but I think we'll see progression over the year,"" he said. ""There are really no signs that we are going have similar problems that we experienced in 2007 and 2008."" The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry published earlier in the week suggested housing activity was muted because of Brexit uncertainty. It said the average UK house price was Â£230,630 in October, falling by 0.1% month-on-month. Looking further ahead, estate agents are a little more hopeful of their sales expectations for 12 months' time. ""Looking a little further out, there is some comfort provided by the suggestion that transactions nationally should stabilise as some of the fog lifts, but that moment feels a way off for many respondents to the survey,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. ""Meanwhile, it is hard to see developers stepping up the supply pipeline in this environment."" He said that to get near to government building targets would ""require significantly greater input from other delivery channels, including local authorities"".

"World's coffee under threat, say experts","We drink two coffees out of more than 100 types growing naturally The first full assessment of risks to the world's coffee plants shows that 60% of 124 known species are on the edge of extinction. More than 100 types of coffee tree grow naturally in forests, including two used for the coffee we drink. Scientists say the figure is ""worrying"", as wild coffee is critical for sustaining the global coffee crop. About one in five of the world's plants is threatened with extinction, and the 60% figure is an ""extremely high"" one. ""If it wasn't for wild species we wouldn't have as much coffee to drink in the world today,"" said Dr Aaron Davis of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ""Because if you look at the history of coffee cultivation, we have used wild species to make the coffee crop sustainable."" Arabica originated in the highlands of Ethiopia Research published in the journal, Science Advances,,externalfound conservation measures were ""inadequate"" for wild coffees, including those considered ""critical"" for  long-term global coffee production. The study found that 75 wild coffee species are considered threatened with extinction, 35 are not threatened and too little is known about the remaining 14 to make any judgement. Furthermore, it was found that 28% of wild coffee species grow outside protected areas and only about half are preserved in seed banks. A second study, in Global Change Biology,,externalfound that wild Arabica coffee can be classed as threatened under official (IUCN Red List) rankings, when climate change projections are taken into account. Its natural population is likely to shrink by up to 50% or more by 2088 because of climate change alone, according to the research. Wild Arabica is used to supply seeds for coffee farming and also as a harvested crop in its own right. Ethiopia is the home of Arabica coffee, where it grows naturally in upland rainforests. ""Given the importance of Arabica coffee to Ethiopia, and to the world, we need to do our utmost to understand the risks facing its survival in the wild,"" said Dr Tadesse Woldemariam Gole, of the Environment and Coffee Forest Forum in Addis Ababa. Many coffee drinkers are unaware that we only use the coffee beans from two species -Coffea ArabicaandCoffea robusta- in the thousands of different blends of coffee on sale. Coffee comes in many blends, but relies on two species In fact, there are 122 coffee species on top of that which occur naturally in the wild. Many of these wild coffees do not taste good to drink, but may contain genes that can be harnessed to help coffee plants survive in the future, amid climate change and emerging diseases that attack coffee trees. Will coffee taste worse as the planet warms? Seeds hold hidden treasures for future food Wild crops pushed to brink of extinction Wild food crops to be 'rescued',external In the longer term, we will need to call on wild species to safeguard the future of the world's coffee crop, say researchers. ""We will call on those wild resources time and time again,"" said Dr Davis. Globally, about one in five plants is threatened with extinction, compared with 60% for coffee. As a comparison, about half of wild tea and mango species are threatened with extinction, 6% of hazelnuts and 9% of pistachios. The vast majority of wild coffee grows in the remote forests of Africa and on the island of Madagascar. Beyond Africa, wild coffee is found in other tropical climates, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Global coffee trade relies on two species - Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora). Coffee plantation in Colombia A third species - Liberica (Coffea liberica) is grown around the world, but is rarely used for coffee drinks. Crop wild relatives are wild plants that are genetically related to cultivated crops. They continue to evolve in the wild, and can be crossed with domesticated crops. They have been used to improve the yields and nutritional quality of crops since the dawn of agriculture. They say we must understand the risks to coffee farming and make sure we have the resources in place to overcome threats. Coffee trees, like many tropical plants, have seeds that do not survive the freeze-drying process used in conventional seed banks - 45% of coffee species have not been ""backed up"" outside the wild. Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha of Kew said this is the first time an IUCN Red List assessment has been carried out to find the extinction risk of the world's coffee, and the figure of 60% is ""extremely high"". ""We hope this new data will highlight species to be prioritised for the sustainability of the coffee production sector, so that appropriate action can be taken to safeguard the species,"" she said.

'IÃ¢ÂÂm just ill Ã¢ÂÂ respect me for who I am',"This video can not be played Ellen has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a condition that affects connective tissue and joints ""You're too pretty to be disabled, you're too young to be disabled, you're too smart to be disabled"" - all things Ellen Blunsdon has been told in the street. It's encounters like these that have made the 20-year-old Edinburgh student believe people need to rethink how they interact with disabled people. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Ellen, who uses a walking stick, said: ""I get stares and comments virtually every time I go out - people can say things that are just very inappropriate. ""I was once in a shop and a woman told me I was 'an inspiration' - and I was just shopping for crisps. I'm not an inspiration for getting out of the house. ""I don't want to be pitied or patronised. I am a full person despite my disability. ""She probably thought it wasn't harmful because it's a nice comment, but it's an example that many people don't know how to interact with disabled people."" Based on her experiences, Ellen thinks there needs to be a ""switch in mind-set"" in how many interact with people with disabilities. ""I'm not special, I'm just ill - respect me for the person I am,"" she said. ""I don't want to be seen as a victim, because I'm not a victim. Disabled people are not victims, there's nothing wrong with being disabled."" Ellen has a form of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a condition that affects connective tissue and can cause hypermobility of joints, joint pain and extreme fatigue. Due to her condition, she uses her walking stick, something she accepts is not ""normal"" for someone barely out of their teens. Having presented as ""able-bodied"", and without a ""marker"" of her disability for years, Ellen noticed a shift in attitude towards her when she began using her walking stick routinely. She believes the stick is a ""visual indicator"" of her disability, which has led to her becoming ""hypervisible"", attracting ""sheepish glances"" from the public, and sometimes more. The first time Ellen used her walking stick in public, she was verbally abused. Using a walking stick has increased Ellen's mobility, but she says it also keeps her mindful of her limitations Remembering the day, she said: ""I was already very self-conscious. I clipped past a stag do and heard one of them shout: 'Hurry up lads! Even that disabled bitch is going faster than us'."" Now using a stick routinely, Ellen sees it as much more than a mobility aid. ""It's become an extension of my body. I have about six now. They all have different patterns and I love them dearly. ""It took a while to learn to love them. The first one I got was a horrible black one that the NHS provided - it felt a bit like an old man's stick. ""Once I found more colourful sticks - they became something that I could express my identity with, rather than something that I was very shameful of."" Finding more colourful sticks has allowed Ellen to use them to express herself Looking back, Ellen now recognises her walking sticks as a ""a bit of a metaphor"" for her illness. She said: ""I've had to come to accept my illness as well as the stick. ""I was accepting that this is the new normal. That this is what's happening to me and this is how I will potentially feel for the rest of my life. ""I had to make the best of it and carry on and the stick allows me to do that."" Her acceptance however, has its limitations. At home in Aberdeen for Christmas, she decided to leave the sticks behind when leaving the house - not ready to introduce them to old school friends. Ellen believes there is not enough education or understanding about disabilities and chronic illnesses - such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. ""I wish people would understand that disability is a spectrum. ""For people with chronic illnesses, it can often be invisible. But that doesn't make it any less life changing. ""I could walk outside and look completely able-bodied and no-one would ever know - but add the stick I become something different.""

No-deal Brexit warning for UK driversA no-deal Brexit would mean anyone planning to drive outside the UK would need an insurance Green Card.,"If UK motorists plan to drive within the EU after Brexit, they need to act soon or risk breaking the law. That's because a no-deal Brexit would leave drivers needing to have proof of insurance known as a Green Card. EU regulations will hit businesses and individuals. They will also apply to anyone driving across the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border. You need to order the card a month before you plan to travel, warned the Association of British Insurers. Although European insurance authorities agreed to waive the need for Green Cards in the event of a no-deal Brexit in May 2018, it has not been confirmed by the European Commission. UK drivers living in the EU urged to get new licence How will Brexit affect my holidays to Europe? It means Green Cards would be required under EU regulations as proof of insurance if the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal. The documents are supplied by insurers and anyone who drives without one may be breaking the law. Meanwhile the government is still pressing for the European Commission to give the Green Card-waiver a green light. A spokesperson from the Department for Transport said: ""The UK meets all requirements to remain a part of the Green Card-free circulation zone when we leave the EU, and we urge the Commission to issue a decision which would ensure UK motorists can drive in the EU without a Green Card."" Among those affected will be: People who drive across the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border. Anyone planning to take their vehicle to Europe, such as a family planning a holiday to France in the Easter holidays. Any freight company planning to transport goods into the EU after 29 March. EU motorists will also need a Green Card if they plan to drive in the UK. That also applies to Brits living abroad who have arranged cover in the country they live in. If UK motorists are renting a car abroad, they won't need to produce a Green Card as the rental company will provide local insurance. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said: ""As it looks increasingly possible that a no-deal Brexit may happen, we want all insurance customers to know the facts about what this means for them."" Customers' solutions for lower premiums Car and house insurance faces price probe How does Brexit affect the pound? When it comes to travel insurance, Mr Evans said that cover would continue to work in the normal way, even in the event that there is no replacement for the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) system that allows people some free healthcare in the EU. However, he added: ""Customers should always double-check their travel insurance policy meets their full needs."" If there is no deal with the EU, drivers may also need to get an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive abroad. RAC spokesperson Nicholas Lyes said: ""There will be two different types of IDP that apply in EU states, so it is important that motorists heading abroad in the event of a no-deal Brexit check which is required. In cases where someone is driving to Spain via France, they would need both types of IDP."" From 1 February, the government will begin providing IDPs at 2,500 Post Offices across the UK. The NI Department for the Economy suggests that there are approximately 110 million crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland each year. This includes cars, HGVs and buses/coaches. Eurotunnel Shuttle Services carried 1.6 million trucks and 2.6 million cars in 2017 (total number; both directions). According to official statistics, in 2017 there were 2.4 million HGVs travelling from Great Britain to Europe (excluding NI) and 370,000 HGVs travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

GCHQ sets up all-female training classesThe UK's intelligence services say there are too few young women working in cyber-security.,"All-female classes in cyber-skills are being set up by the GCHQ intelligence service, in an attempt to recruit a wider range of online security experts. Almost 90% of the cyber-skills workforce worldwide is male, says GCHQ's cyber-defence arm, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). With warnings of serious skills shortages, the security services are worried about missing female recruits. Chris Ensor of the NCSC says it needs to ""address the imbalance"". There will be 600 free places on all-female CyberFirst Defenders courses in April and May this year, run as a mix of residential and non-residential training events. The venues for the four-day courses will include Nottingham, Lancaster, Wrexham, Edinburgh and Oxfordshire. The intention is to make cyber-skills lessons more open to teenage girls, in a field which has been accused of having a very male image, whether it is James Bond-style stereotypes or stock photos of teenage boys in hoodies. All-female classes have been used in some schools as a way of building confidence in subjects once seen as being more male-dominated. Aisling Brown, curriculum leader at the Stephen Perse Foundation school in Cambridge, said that teaching boys and girls separately in computing can help them with different ways of learning. In computing classes, she said: ""Girls are sometimes more reflective and take time to volunteer answers, while boys can tend to rush."" The school's computing club could tend to become dominated by the boys, she said, and they had to find ways to make it more accessible to girls. It follows the CyberFirst Girls competition,,externallaunched last month, and run by the NCSC to promote computer skills and careers in cyber-security. German politicians targeted in cyber-attack Cyber attack disrupts US newspapers Warns of cyber-threats to Black Friday shoppers The agency wants more teenage girls to get involved, with questions designed to build skills in cryptography, cyber-security, logic and coding and networking. It is part of a wider CyberFirst project aimed at raising cyber-skills in young people up to the age of 18. The security services, needing talented staff to tackle the growing threat of cyber-attacks, have been concerned about recruiting from too small a pool of people with computer skills. The lack of women in cyber-security is part of the bigger picture of women in science, technology, engineering and maths, says the NCSC. Pupils at the Tauheedul Islam Girls' High School in Blackburn have been taking part in the cyber competition The agency says about 35% of its overall staff are female and half of its senior leadership. As well as wanting a better gender balance, the NCSC wants to attract applicants from a wider range of social backgrounds, from state as well as independent schools. Among the schools taking part in the competition is the Tauheedul Islam Girls' High School, a Muslim state school in Blackburn which is among the highest-performing secondary schools in the country. ""Women are very under-represented in the global cyber-industry,"" said assistant principal, Asia Ali, who says she wants ""exceptionally talented girls"" to help make the country safer online. The NCSC has warned of the scale of wide-ranging cyber-threats. Already this month, the NCSC has highlighted threats to hack smart TV devices, cyber-attacks on information about German politicians and the theft of insurance and legal documents relating to the 9/11 attacks. Mr Ensor, the agency's deputy director for skills and growth, said increasing numbers have been taking part in their training courses. ""However, women only make up a small proportion of the global cyber-workforce, and throughout GCHQ and the NCSC we are looking to address the imbalance.""

LiveMay holding talks with MPs after surviving vote5 minutes ago,"Theresa May to publish her new Brexit plan to Parliament on 21 January Full debate and key vote on that plan on 29 January PM holding talks with MPs and urges people to ""work constructively together"" Jeremy Corbyn refuses to take part unless the PM rules out a no-deal Brexit Mrs May has held meetings with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru Government paper suggests new EU referendum would take ""in excess of a year"" Paul Gribben, Dulcie Lee and Becky Morton Details on post Brexit trading tariffs in the event of a no-deal are set to be published later. Reports last week suggestedthey could be drastic with cuts on between 80% and 90% of goods, with some tariffs being scrapped completely. If you need a refresher on what tariffs are and what they aim to do, here's a handy explanation. BBC Radio 5 Live Sally Jones, Deloitte UKâs director for International Trade Policy, has been speaking about the UK's trading arrangements after Brexit and expectations that more information will be released today. She told Wake Up To Money that industries such as steel, ceramics and agriculture were concerned their products would be ""less competitive"". This is because they are already operating in markets where there are already high tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules and also where there is a lot of international competition. Taking cars as an example, tariffs here can be as high as 25% for component parts, and 10% for finished cars under WTO rules, she said. ""If we chose to set a zero tariff  on those components and finished cars for import into the UK then you would see competition for our plants in Sunderland and similar would be increased"". BBC News Channel Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says he had ""constructive talks"" with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove and the prime minister's chief of staff Gavin Barwell. He says he raised the need for the prime minister to take no deal off the table, as well as discussing his preferred option of a Norway-style agreement, which would see a close relationship with the European Union. He told BBC News: âItâs time for all parties to come together in the national
interest."" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has rejected government claims that it would take more than a year to organise another referendum. The Conservative MP, who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""The timetable put forward by the government is simply wrong and they must be aware of it themselves."" He says another referendum could be carried out ""swiftly and within a limited extension of Article 50"". Members of the Tories' influential European Research Group (ERG) had a morning meeting with the prime minister The prime minister has been meeting senior MPs on all sides of the Brexit debate since Wednesday evening. Find out who has been involved in talks from ourtimeline. The prime minister has written to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to say his call for a no deal Brexit to be ruled out before he meets her is an ""impossible condition"". Theresa May says it is ""not within the government's power"" to rule out a no deal. However, she says her ""door remains open"" and she would be ""happy to discuss"" Mr Corbyn's own proposals on Brexit.

A Downing Street spokeswoman stressed that government policy was still that no further referendum will be held.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has criticised a tweet from a Guardian columnist which references calculations that the Leave vote has been declining - in part due to older Leave supporters dying. Polly Toynbee was tweeting about her column, which discusses estimates that the Leave vote has been shrinking by about 1,350 a day. Mr Javid retweeted her along with the comment: ""How utterly disrespectful"". The calculation, conducted on behalf of the People's Vote campaign, takes into account the number of mainly Leave voters who have died, and mainly Remain voters who have reached voting age. The survey predicted that - assuming no voters changed their mind - demographic factors alone were causing the Leave majority to shrink by almost half a million a year. The Scottish government's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said planning for Brexit has been a ""game-changer"" for the country's police force. More officers will be recruited this year ""to ensure capacity and resilience is in place to prepare against a range of contingencies associated with Brexit"".

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The government has produced ""a very short
paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold

Sky News reporter Aubrey Allegretti has tweeted a letter from Jeremy Corbyn, in which the Labour leader urges MPs not to contact the government until the no-deal option is taken off the table. Mr Corbyn said he personally would not meet with Mrs May to talk about the future of Brexit until she ruled out the prospect of a ""disastrous"" no-deal exit. In his letter, he wrote: ""The Prime Minister has offered to open talks with Opposition Parties, however, I have been absolutely clear that any starting point for talks about breaking the Brexit deadlock must be on the provision that the threat of a disastrous 'no deal' outcome is ruled out."" He goes on to write: ""I urge colleagues to respect that condition and refrain from engagement with the government until 'no deal' is taken off the table.""

Here's a handy reminder of the different options being explored around Westminster: Failing that, here'sa simple guide to the UK leaving the EU. The Republic of Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said a no-deal Brexit would have to become ""an exercise in damage limitation"". Speaking in the Irish parliament, Simon Coveney said: ""It would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors, which is currently facilitated by our common EU membership."" Mr Coveney said the EU would continue to seek to be as helpful as possible but that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation. ""The backstop is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he added. ""It acts as an insurance policy, to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit. It is essential."" Tory MP John Whittingdale says he and other senior MPs have had a ""constructive meeting"" with Theresa May - adding that he feels optimistic a deal that appeals to Conservatives and the DUP can be reached.

Norman SmithAssistant political editor Senior Tory MP Nick Boles is seeking to secure parliamentary backing for a bill that would force the government to delay Article 50. The measure would kick in if Mrs May was unable to get a Brexit deal through the Commons by the end of February. Mr Boles said he believed a number of Cabinet ministers  - including the chancellor - support his plan. He also said ministers outside the Cabinet had told him they would resign if forced to oppose the measure. Mr Boles has decided to drop his previous plan to give the Liaison Committee the power to introduce a new draft bill after it was widely criticised by members of the committee. It's thought Mr Boles' proposal - if accepted by the speaker - would be voted on ahead of Mrs May's statement to MPs on her Brexit plans on 29 January. Mr Boles made his comments in an interview with the Political Thinking podcast - published tomorrow. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Housing market outlook worst 'for 20 years'House sale expectations for the next three months are at their lowest for two decades, estate agents warn.BusinessComments","The housing market outlook over the next three months is the worst for 20 years, surveyors say. A net balance of 28% of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members expect sales to fall in the next three months. It's the most downbeat reading since records started in October 1998 and the pessimism is blamed on the lack of clarity around Brexit. Lack of supply and affordability also continued to affect the market. Sales expectations for the next three months are now either flat, with no change predicted, or negative, indicating falling sales, across all parts of the UK,the report said.,external Increasing numbers of surveyors reported seeing house prices fall rather than increase in December, with a net balance of 19% seeing falls rather than rises. That was up from a balance of 11% in November and marked the fourth month in a row of negative house price readings. New buyer inquiries fell for the fifth month in a row in December. The drop-off in interest from buyers was matched by a decline in fresh properties coming on to the market. Brexit uncertainty hits house purchases Where can I afford to live? Where does rent hit young people the hardest? The supply of new properties has been dwindling for six months, said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist. ""It is hardly a surprise with ongoing uncertainty about the path to Brexit dominating the news agenda, that even allowing for the normal patterns around the Christmas holidays, buyer interest in purchasing property in December was subdued. ""This is also very clearly reflected in a worsening trend in near-term sales expectations."" ""We experienced a slowing down in the local property market from last summer onwards with a lot of it down to the Brexit unknowns,"" said estate agent David Knights of David Brown & Co of Ipswich. ""Uncertainty causes people to sit on their hands."" He says that activity in November and December is generally about 50% of that seen during the rest of the year, but that the last two months of 2018 ""were noticeably more quiet"" because of that uncertainty. In the short-term, over the next three to four months, he expects the property market to continue to be subdued. ""When buyers don't know what's going to happen you can understand them being careful about how much they're prepared to offer."" But he remains positive about the property market over the slightly longer term. ""We're not going to see an instant rebound once Brexit is out of the way, but I think we'll see progression over the year,"" he said. ""There are really no signs that we are going have similar problems that we experienced in 2007 and 2008."" The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry published earlier in the week suggested housing activity was muted because of Brexit uncertainty. It said the average UK house price was Â£230,630 in October, falling by 0.1% month-on-month. Looking further ahead, estate agents are a little more hopeful of their sales expectations for 12 months' time. ""Looking a little further out, there is some comfort provided by the suggestion that transactions nationally should stabilise as some of the fog lifts, but that moment feels a way off for many respondents to the survey,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. ""Meanwhile, it is hard to see developers stepping up the supply pipeline in this environment."" He said that to get near to government building targets would ""require significantly greater input from other delivery channels, including local authorities"".

Police watchdog 'brings wrong cases',"Only five police officers in England and Wales were dismissed in the last three years following misconduct cases ordered by the police watchdog. The BBC also found in two-thirds of the 48 cases pursued by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) ""gross misconduct"" charges were not proven. The Police Federation said the IOPC was bringing the ""wrong cases"" and officers often had to wait years to be cleared. The IOPC said its approach had been legally tested and was ""appropriate"". The watchdog has the power to order hearings over allegations of gross misconduct when a force refuses to hold them - they're known as ""directed"" hearings. Figures provided to the BBC after a request under the Freedom of Information Act show that in the three years to October 2018 there were 48 completed directed hearings across 19 police forces. Suspended officers 'paid to do nothing' No action over 'stress ball' officer Aftershave lie police officer sacked In 33 cases gross misconduct, the most serious disciplinary charge that can be levelled, was not proven. Of the 15 police officers against whom charges were upheld five were sacked and 10 received other sanctions. Some 21 police forces didn't carry out any directed hearings - and three constabularies, Essex, Sussex and Wiltshire, failed to provide information. An officer with Nottinghamshire Police who was cleared at an IOPC-directed hearing after a near six-year investigation told BBC News the process was a ""nightmare"". Catherine, who asked to be referred to only by her first name because of the sensitive nature of her work,was accused of using excessive force against a pregnant woman who'd been arrested and taken into custody in July 2011. Although three officers were disciplined over the incident, it took until May 2017 for the charges to be dropped against Catherine. The police constable, who has spent almost 19 years in the police service, said the uncertainty over what would happen to her and whether she'd lose her job had held her career back. ""I couldn't move to a different department, couldn't leave the force, couldn't look to move to a new house or spend money due to the fact that I didn't know what was going to happen,"" she said. The IOPC, formerly the Independent Police Complaints Commission, apologised and admitted their handling of her case had been ""unacceptable"". ""I knew in my heart of hearts I'd done nothing wrong,"" Catherine said. Phill Matthews, conduct lead for the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents 120,000 officers, said the legal test used by the IOPC to determine if a misconduct case should go ahead needed reforming. Sergeant Matthews said the process can leave officers ""traumatised"". ""The IPCC, and IOPC as is now, pursue the wrong cases and often have very little understanding of the evidence and give families and complainants unrealistic expectations,"" he said. ""The effect on the officers involved is sometimes catastrophic. They can be suspended, at massive public expense, which has a knock on effect on morale for whole shifts of officers, or placed on restrictions."" The legal test, known as the 'case to answer' test, is whether a disciplinary panel could, on the basis of the evidence available, make a finding of misconduct or gross misconduct. It is a lower threshold than the 'balance of probabilities' test applied by a disciplinary panel and lower than the 'realistic prospect of conviction' test used by the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether to bring criminal proceedings. The 'case to answer' test is enshrined in legislation and the IOPC said it would be ""unlawful"" for them to ignore or raise the threshold upheld by the High Court. ""We know the case to answer test is low but it has been repeatedly tested through judicial reviews and found to be appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said. The Home Office said it was ""inevitable"" there'd be a 'case to answer' against some officers who were later cleared of misconduct but added that it was implementing reforms to ensure a ""consistent"" approach to the way the test was applied. Policing Minister Nick Hurd said reforms, due for implementation this year, improve how misconduct hearings are prepared and conducted.

Netflix used Lac-Megantic disaster in film,"Netflix used footage of the 2013 Lac-Megantic rail disaster in Bird Box, a horror film starring Sandra Bullock Streaming service Netflix has confirmed it used stock footage of a real-life rail disaster in the film Bird Box. Netflix will not be removing the brief clip from Canada's Lac-Megantic tragedy used early in the film to depict a fictional news story about an apocalyptic scenario. Over 40 people were killed in 2013 when a train carrying crude oil derailed in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic. Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed. Bird Box is not the only Netflix production containing images of the deadly runaway train disaster. Earlier this week, similar footage was found to have been used in the Canadian-American science-fiction drama Travelers. In the show's third season, images of Lac-Megantic's blazing downtown core can be briefly seen illustrating fictional news coverage of a nuclear attack in London. A cloud of smoke is seen over Lac Megantic after a train explosion, July 6, 2013. The production company behind the show, Peacock Alley Entertainment, said in a statement that it acquired footage from stock footage vendor Pond 5 ""and weren't aware of its specific source"". The runaway train that destroyed a town It apologised, saying it did not mean to dishonour the tragic event in the town, and would be replacing the footage used in the show. In a statement to BBC, Pond 5 said it deeply regretted the footage being ""taken out of context and used in entertainment programming"". The company apologised ""to anyone who was offended, especially the victims and their families"". Clips from the company's collection of stock footage and other media are found in TV and documentary series produced by major news and entertainment companies including Disney, Netflix, the Discovery Channel and the BBC, according to its website. The company said its library includes both fictional scenes as well as news and archival footage including ""historical tragedies, military conflicts, weather events, and natural disasters that may depict sensitive events"" and it is rare ""that something like this occurs"". It said it will contact customers who have purchased any related clips to make them aware ""of the sensitive nature of this footage"".

Kuenssberg: Meetings aren't a plan B,"Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. It's clear, wide open, in public, that the cabinet is at odds with each other. Just listen to David Gauke and Liam Fox on whether a customs union could be a compromise for example. The answer for her is not suddenly going to emerge from a unified tier of her top team. There are perhaps five or six of the cabinet who would be happy to see that kind of relationship as a way to bring Labour on board. But there is a group of around the same size who would rather see what they describe as a ""managed no deal"". You may well wonder if that isn't a contradiction in terms. But the principle would be that the UK would pay the divorce bill already agreed and over a two-year period construct a series of side deals on specific issues, rather than try to come up with a whole new comprehensive plan. There are already intense arguments about whether that's remotely realistic. But the overall point is that the prime minister cannot just therefore look to her top colleagues for an immediate solution. Before she decides which way to tack, or how far to budge, she may need to ask herself if the talks she wants to hold with other political parties are occasions when she is really open to ideas - or just ways of managing the political situation. One cabinet minister involved in the talks suggested that many MPs still needed to understand how the agreement they have reached with the EU worked. And that as ""project reality"" dawned, there could still be a way through of salvaging Mrs May's deal in something like its current form. And certainly there wasn't much in the PM's lectern statement to suggest she is suddenly ready to move very much. One former minister described it as ""still flicking the V at the 48% - she's deluded, she never changes her mind and cannot conceive that others might"". If all that the prime minister intends to do is massage a few egos with these talks, it seems unlikely that she'll find a quick route to success. And Labour may well stay outside the process. Many members of the public might be furious that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn won't play nice during a time of crisis. He's always said he believes in dialogue, but when it really matters, he says no. But inside the Labour movement there are others who might accuse of him of helping to make Brexit happen if he takes part. Like so many facets of this process, it's not a straightforward political calculation. But across Parliament, for a very long time now, even some MPs who were on the prime minister's side to start with have been intensely frustrated that she hasn't listened. It will take a lot more than a cup of tea in Downing Street to bring her many critics on board.

May pushes for cross-party Brexit consensus,"This video can not be played Theresa May has called on MPs to ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward Theresa May has urged Jeremy Corbyn to discuss his Brexit plans with her, after he said he would not take part in talks until ""no deal"" was ruled out. In a letter to the Labour leader, the PM wrote that ruling out no deal was an ""impossible condition"" as it was not within the government's power to do it. She has been meeting other leaders to try to find a compromise on Brexit after her deal was rejected by MPs. Earlier, Mr Corbyn dismissed the talks as a ""stunt"". The PM will publish a new plan on Monday with a full debate and key vote scheduled for Tuesday, 29 January. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? Senior politicians on all sides have also been meeting with cabinet ministers to try to find a way forward. But Mr Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, declined to take part, telling Mrs May to ""ditch the red lines"" and ""get serious about proposals for the future"". In a speech in Hastings Mr Corbyn said: ""With no-deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phony talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring."" Mr Corbyn said the ""best outcome"" was to call a general election to ""break the deadlock"". The Labour leader has emailed Labour MPs urging them not to talk to Mrs May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. His stance has come under fire from Labour MP Mike Gapes, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, who told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Jeremy Corbyn has been quite happy in the past to talk to Hamas, Hezobollah... I find it extraordinary he's not prepared to go and meet the prime minister."" Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now Mark Urban: Is Brussels ready to give UK more time? In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I note that you have said that 'ruling out' no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the Government's power to rule out no deal. ""Let me explain why. Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless Parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. ""So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a Withdrawal Agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. ""I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result."" She wrote that she would be ""happy"" to discuss Mr Corbyn's proposals. On Wednesday night, speaking outside Downing Street after talks with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru, Mrs May called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"". ""It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done,"" she said. Separately, Downing Street said the government has produced a ""very short paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold another EU referendum, which suggests it would take ""in excess of a year"". The point of the document was to ""inform the expected discussion"" Mrs May was likely to have with MPs who back another public vote, government sources say. The prime minister is holding meetings with various party leaders as well as Tory Brexiteers and the DUP - both of whom rejected her withdrawal deal earlier this week - on Thursday. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay are also holding talks with senior opposition politicians, including Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.

The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said that the extension of Article 50 - the two year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of a second EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the talks were just ""time wasting"" if the prime minister was not prepared to consider another referendum, rule out a no-deal Brexit or to extend Article 50. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no deal Brexit off the table and a People's Vote on our European future"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum, said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". Following her meeting on Thursday, Green MP Caroline Lucas said the PM refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. ""I repeatedly urged her again and again to take 'no deal' off the table because I think it completely skews the talks because you know that cliff edge is there,"" she said. Mrs May was also resisting the option of extending Article 50, Ms Lucas said. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister was in ""listening mode"" and there was optimism that a Brexit deal could still be reached. She said she made a ""clear ask"" in relation to the Irish backstop, urging Mrs May to address it ""in a satisfactory way"". What does the DUP want from Brexit talks? What happens next? When asked what the government was willing to compromise on, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis refused to give specifics. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mrs May would not consider a customs union and that he did not believe a new referendum was ""the right way to go"".

Meanwhile, the SNP's Ian Blackford has also written to Mr Corbyn, along with other opposition leaders, to urge him to back another referendum as Labour's official position. And, in a letter published in the Times newspaper, more than 170 leading business figures called for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to back another referendum on withdrawal from the European Union ""to stop us crashing out of the EU with no deal at all"". Addressing a Leave Means Leave gathering in Westminster on Thursday evening, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Brexiteers should ""prepare"" and ""organise"" for the possibility of a another referendum.

Hitachi to halt work on UK nuclear plant,"Hitachi has said it will suspend work on a multi-billion-pound UK nuclear project because of rising costs. The decision puts thousands of jobs at risk if the Â£13bn plant at Wylfa Newydd in Anglesey, north Wales, is scrapped. The Japanese firm had been in talks with the UK government since June about funding for the project, which was being built by its Horizon subsidiary. The government said it had failed to agree terms with Hitachi. The nuclear industry said it was ""disappointing"". Hitachi said it would also suspend work on another site, in Oldbury in Gloucestershire, ""until a solution can be found"". About 9,000 workers had been expected to be involved in building the two nuclear reactors, which were due to be operational by the mid-2020s. What's Wylfa and why is it important? 'Tremendous blow' for Wales Is nuclear power the answer to climate change? Hitachi said the decision would cost it an estimated 300bn yen (Â£2.1bn) as ""extraordinary losses"". It said it was suspending the project ""from the viewpoint of its economic rationality as a private enterprise"". Hinkley, Moorside, Wylfa, Oldbury, Bradwell and Sizewell were identified as the sites for the most significant national wave of new nuclear power construction anywhere in the world. Of those six - only one is under construction, three have been abandoned and two face an uphill battle to get the green light. Under those circumstances you might think the government would be embarrassed that its energy policy was in disarray. But it's not. The collapse of the Wylfa and Oldbury projects today (following the abandonment of Moorside) is evidence of some new economic realities that have seen government enthusiasm for new nuclear fade. The first and most obvious is the cost of building the darn things. Read Simon's blog in full The Nuclear Industry Association says the UK has six sites that are licensed to build new nuclear power stations and eight sites that are currently generating power. However, it said that only one of the eight currently operating are due to be in use by 2030. The GMB union warned of an energy crisis. Duncan Hawthorne, chief executive of Hitachi's Horizon subsidiary, said the Anglesey site remained ""the best site for nuclear development in the UK"" and that the company would ""keep the option to resume development in future"". The new nuclear plant had been intended to have a generating capacity of 2,900 MW and have a 60-year operational life. The decision puts the UK's nuclear policy under fresh scrutiny. In November,plans to build a nuclear power station at Moorside in Cumbria were haltedafter Toshiba announced it was winding up its NuGeneration subsidiary, which was behind the project. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: ""As the Business Secretary [Greg Clark] set out in June, any deal needs to represent value for money and be the right one for UK consumers and taxpayers. ""Despite extensive negotiations and hard work by all sides, the government and Hitachi are unable to reach agreement to proceed at this stage."" The department added that the land was owned by Hitachi, which had indicated it wished to retain ownership while it discussed future options with the government. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the government's nuclear strategy was now ""lying in tatters"" and had ""escalated into a full-blown crisis"". The news was greeted with dismay by the Nuclear Industry Association. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the association, said it was ""disappointing, not just for the Wylfa Newydd project but for Anglesey and the nuclear industry as a whole"". ""The urgent need for further new nuclear capacity in the UK should not be underestimated, with all but one of the UK's nuclear power plants due to come offline by 2030."" Successive governments have supported nuclear as a low-carbon way of generating electricity The UK has 15 nuclear reactors, generating about 21% of its electricity Britain's newest nuclear power station is Sizewell B, which started generating in 1995 Sizewell B's expected shutdown date is in 2035 ONS said in 2014 that there were 15,500 people employed in the civil nuclear industry. Source:House of Commons Library except when other source given and BBC Reality Check Justin Bowden, the GMB union's national secretary for energy, said the decision raised ""the very real prospect of a UK energy crisis"". ""While the government has had its head up its proverbial backside over Brexit, vital matters like guaranteeing the country's future energy supply appear to have gone by the wayside."" The CBI described the news as a ""significant blow to the UK's future energy supply plans"". Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief UK policy director, said: ""The government has to demonstrate it is committed to meeting our climate change targets by supporting new low-carbon power supply. ""The loss of new nuclear projects could leave us more heavily dependent in the long run on fossil fuels, which could risk our legally binding climate targets."" The government says it has a range of options for meeting future energy demand, including renewables, storage, interconnectors, new nuclear and more. If the Wylfa Newydd project is scrapped, it leaves the Hinkley Point power station in Somerset as the only new UK reactor still being built. There are plans for new plants at Bradwell and Sizewell, but neither is currently under construction. The British and Japanese prime ministers met earlier this month and Theresa May said she had raised the issue with her counterpart. Climate change: Is nuclear power the answer?

Reports last week suggestedthey could be drastic with cuts on between 80% and 90% of goods, with some tariffs being scrapped completely. If you need a refresher on what tariffs are and what they aim to do, here's a handy explanation. BBC Radio 5 Live Sally Jones, Deloitte UKâs director for International Trade Policy, has been speaking about the UK's trading arrangements after Brexit and expectations that more information will be released today. She told Wake Up To Money that industries such as steel, ceramics and agriculture were concerned their products would be ""less competitive"". This is because they are already operating in markets where there are already high tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules and also where there is a lot of international competition. Taking cars as an example, tariffs here can be as high as 25% for component parts, and 10% for finished cars under WTO rules, she said. ""If we chose to set a zero tariff  on those components and finished cars for import into the UK then you would see competition for our plants in Sunderland and similar would be increased"". BBC News Channel Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says he had ""constructive talks"" with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove and the prime minister's chief of staff Gavin Barwell. He says he raised the need for the prime minister to take no deal off the table, as well as discussing his preferred option of a Norway-style agreement, which would see a close relationship with the European Union. He told BBC News: âItâs time for all parties to come together in the national
interest."" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has rejected government claims that it would take more than a year to organise another referendum. The Conservative MP, who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""The timetable put forward by the government is simply wrong and they must be aware of it themselves."" He says another referendum could be carried out ""swiftly and within a limited extension of Article 50"".

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has criticised a tweet from a Guardian columnist which references calculations that the Leave vote has been declining - in part due to older Leave supporters dying. Polly Toynbee was tweeting about her column, which discusses estimates that the Leave vote has been shrinking by about 1,350 a day. Mr Javid retweeted her along with the comment: ""How utterly disrespectful"". The calculation, conducted on behalf of the People's Vote campaign, takes into account the number of mainly Leave voters who have died, and mainly Remain voters who have reached voting age. The survey predicted that - assuming no voters changed their mind - demographic factors alone were causing the Leave majority to shrink by almost half a million a year. The Scottish government's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said planning for Brexit has been a ""game-changer"" for the country's police force.

In his letter, he wrote: ""The Prime Minister has offered to open talks with Opposition Parties, however, I have been absolutely clear that any starting point for talks about breaking the Brexit deadlock must be on the provision that the threat of a disastrous 'no deal' outcome is ruled out.""

The Republic of Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said a no-deal Brexit would have to become ""an exercise in damage limitation"".

Mr Coveney said the EU would continue to seek to be as helpful as possible but that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation. ""The backstop is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he added. ""It acts as an insurance policy, to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit. It is essential.""

Norman SmithAssistant political editor Senior Tory MP Nick Boles is seeking to secure parliamentary backing for a bill that would force the government to delay Article 50. The measure would kick in if Mrs May was unable to get a Brexit deal through the Commons by the end of February. Mr Boles said he believed a number of Cabinet ministers  - including the chancellor - support his plan. He also said ministers outside the Cabinet had told him they would resign if forced to oppose the measure. Mr Boles has decided to drop his previous plan to give the Liaison Committee the power to introduce a new draft bill after it was widely criticised by members of the committee. It's thought Mr Boles' proposal - if accepted by the speaker - would be voted on ahead of Mrs May's statement to MPs on her Brexit plans on 29 January. Mr Boles made his comments in an interview with the Political Thinking podcast - published tomorrow. Â© 2025 BBC.

No-deal Brexit - data dilemma,"Could data flows come to a halt post-Brexit? Two urgent questions - does your business move data across borders and if so are you prepared for what could happen if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal? The Direct Marketing Association (DMA), which represents a whole raft of data businesses, says any company that moves data between the UK and an EU country needs to be aware of what will change if we effectively sign out of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe's data protection regime. If we are going to continue to see data flowing freely across borders as now, we will need the EU to give us the kind of adequacy deal it has already granted to 12 other non-EU countries - but it isn't clear how quickly that would happen. And in the meantime, the DMA says, there would be severe uncertainty that ""could potentially bring EU-to-UK data flows to a halt"". A couple of examples: A large UK data processing company with EU-based customers and an EU data centre may find it can no longer move their data across borders to be processed in the UK. In the words of the DMA, ""it would lose control of its own data"" A small e-commerce company, perhaps selling Scottish knitwear, has some customers in France and stores their email addresses and previous orders in its database. To continue processing their data, it may need an EU-approved standard contractual clause DMA chief executive Chris Combemale says many larger companies have already moved to open data centres in mainland Europe. He describes one major US financial technology company that had all of its servers in London but now has a duplicate operation in Amsterdam. He says large companies are prepared and will take things  in their stride but the administrative burden on smaller businesses could be quite onerous. ""We're not disaster-mongers - things will carry on but with more cost,"" he says. ""The uncertainty, the extra cost, could reduce investment -  companies could choose to do less business here."" Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham says companies need to consider ""alternative transfer mechanisms"" Lawyers too are warning that data-handling companies - and they account for an awful lot of businesses these days - face a mountain of work. ""Preparing for a no-deal Brexit requires identifying current and future EU-UK data transfers and urgently ensuring that UK entities become 'safe importers' of data in Data Transfers Agreements,"" says Eduardo Ustaran of Hogan Lovells. ""A no-deal Brexit definitely means more bureaucracy, not less."" The Information Commissioner's Office points out that there is comprehensive advice for businesses about theimplications of a no-deal Brexit on its website,external. Introducing the advice, the commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: ""Organisations will need to carefully consider alternative transfer mechanisms to maintain data flows and the guidance we have produced will help you weigh the options and take action if this proves necessary."" Having read through this section, my head is spinning and I can imagine lots of smaller companies will still be struggling to work out exactly what they need to do. But with just 71 days left to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, any business that depends on data had better get their skates on. Otherwise, they could see a vital resource stuck in an endless tailback at the border.

Kuenssberg: Meetings aren't a plan BNo-deal Brexit warning for UK driversWhat happens next?No-confidence motion: How did my MP vote?Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock,"Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. It's clear, wide open, in public, that the cabinet is at odds with each other. Just listen to David Gauke and Liam Fox on whether a customs union could be a compromise for example. The answer for her is not suddenly going to emerge from a unified tier of her top team. There are perhaps five or six of the cabinet who would be happy to see that kind of relationship as a way to bring Labour on board. But there is a group of around the same size who would rather see what they describe as a ""managed no deal"". You may well wonder if that isn't a contradiction in terms. But the principle would be that the UK would pay the divorce bill already agreed and over a two-year period construct a series of side deals on specific issues, rather than try to come up with a whole new comprehensive plan. There are already intense arguments about whether that's remotely realistic. But the overall point is that the prime minister cannot just therefore look to her top colleagues for an immediate solution. Before she decides which way to tack, or how far to budge, she may need to ask herself if the talks she wants to hold with other political parties are occasions when she is really open to ideas - or just ways of managing the political situation. One cabinet minister involved in the talks suggested that many MPs still needed to understand how the agreement they have reached with the EU worked. And that as ""project reality"" dawned, there could still be a way through of salvaging Mrs May's deal in something like its current form. And certainly there wasn't much in the PM's lectern statement to suggest she is suddenly ready to move very much. One former minister described it as ""still flicking the V at the 48% - she's deluded, she never changes her mind and cannot conceive that others might"". If all that the prime minister intends to do is massage a few egos with these talks, it seems unlikely that she'll find a quick route to success. And Labour may well stay outside the process. Many members of the public might be furious that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn won't play nice during a time of crisis. He's always said he believes in dialogue, but when it really matters, he says no. But inside the Labour movement there are others who might accuse of him of helping to make Brexit happen if he takes part. Like so many facets of this process, it's not a straightforward political calculation. But across Parliament, for a very long time now, even some MPs who were on the prime minister's side to start with have been intensely frustrated that she hasn't listened. It will take a lot more than a cup of tea in Downing Street to bring her many critics on board.

No-deal Brexit warning for UK driversWhat happens next?No-confidence motion: How did my MP vote?Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock,"If UK motorists plan to drive within the EU after Brexit, they need to act soon or risk breaking the law. That's because a no-deal Brexit would leave drivers needing to have proof of insurance known as a Green Card. EU regulations will hit businesses and individuals. They will also apply to anyone driving across the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border. You need to order the card a month before you plan to travel, warned the Association of British Insurers. Although European insurance authorities agreed to waive the need for Green Cards in the event of a no-deal Brexit in May 2018, it has not been confirmed by the European Commission. UK drivers living in the EU urged to get new licence How will Brexit affect my holidays to Europe? It means Green Cards would be required under EU regulations as proof of insurance if the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal. The documents are supplied by insurers and anyone who drives without one may be breaking the law. Meanwhile the government is still pressing for the European Commission to give the Green Card-waiver a green light. A spokesperson from the Department for Transport said: ""The UK meets all requirements to remain a part of the Green Card-free circulation zone when we leave the EU, and we urge the Commission to issue a decision which would ensure UK motorists can drive in the EU without a Green Card."" Among those affected will be: People who drive across the Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland border. Anyone planning to take their vehicle to Europe, such as a family planning a holiday to France in the Easter holidays. Any freight company planning to transport goods into the EU after 29 March. EU motorists will also need a Green Card if they plan to drive in the UK. That also applies to Brits living abroad who have arranged cover in the country they live in. If UK motorists are renting a car abroad, they won't need to produce a Green Card as the rental company will provide local insurance. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said: ""As it looks increasingly possible that a no-deal Brexit may happen, we want all insurance customers to know the facts about what this means for them."" Customers' solutions for lower premiums Car and house insurance faces price probe How does Brexit affect the pound? When it comes to travel insurance, Mr Evans said that cover would continue to work in the normal way, even in the event that there is no replacement for the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) system that allows people some free healthcare in the EU. However, he added: ""Customers should always double-check their travel insurance policy meets their full needs."" If there is no deal with the EU, drivers may also need to get an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive abroad. RAC spokesperson Nicholas Lyes said: ""There will be two different types of IDP that apply in EU states, so it is important that motorists heading abroad in the event of a no-deal Brexit check which is required. In cases where someone is driving to Spain via France, they would need both types of IDP."" From 1 February, the government will begin providing IDPs at 2,500 Post Offices across the UK. The NI Department for the Economy suggests that there are approximately 110 million crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland each year. This includes cars, HGVs and buses/coaches. Eurotunnel Shuttle Services carried 1.6 million trucks and 2.6 million cars in 2017 (total number; both directions). According to official statistics, in 2017 there were 2.4 million HGVs travelling from Great Britain to Europe (excluding NI) and 370,000 HGVs travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

What happens next?No-confidence motion: How did my MP vote?Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"May pushes for cross-party Brexit consensusThe PM will meet MPs to try and break the Brexit stalemate later, but Jeremy Corbyn insists no-deal must be ruled out.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Theresa May has called on MPs to ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward Theresa May has urged Jeremy Corbyn to discuss his Brexit plans with her, after he said he would not take part in talks until ""no deal"" was ruled out. In a letter to the Labour leader, the PM wrote that ruling out no deal was an ""impossible condition"" as it was not within the government's power to do it. She has been meeting other leaders to try to find a compromise on Brexit after her deal was rejected by MPs. Earlier, Mr Corbyn dismissed the talks as a ""stunt"". The PM will publish a new plan on Monday with a full debate and key vote scheduled for Tuesday, 29 January. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? Senior politicians on all sides have also been meeting with cabinet ministers to try to find a way forward. But Mr Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, declined to take part, telling Mrs May to ""ditch the red lines"" and ""get serious about proposals for the future"". In a speech in Hastings Mr Corbyn said: ""With no-deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phony talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring."" Mr Corbyn said the ""best outcome"" was to call a general election to ""break the deadlock"". The Labour leader has emailed Labour MPs urging them not to talk to Mrs May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. His stance has come under fire from Labour MP Mike Gapes, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, who told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Jeremy Corbyn has been quite happy in the past to talk to Hamas, Hezobollah... I find it extraordinary he's not prepared to go and meet the prime minister."" Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now Mark Urban: Is Brussels ready to give UK more time? In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I note that you have said that 'ruling out' no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the Government's power to rule out no deal. ""Let me explain why. Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless Parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. ""So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a Withdrawal Agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. ""I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result."" She wrote that she would be ""happy"" to discuss Mr Corbyn's proposals. On Wednesday night, speaking outside Downing Street after talks with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru, Mrs May called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"". ""It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done,"" she said. Separately, Downing Street said the government has produced a ""very short paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold another EU referendum, which suggests it would take ""in excess of a year"". The point of the document was to ""inform the expected discussion"" Mrs May was likely to have with MPs who back another public vote, government sources say. The prime minister is holding meetings with various party leaders as well as Tory Brexiteers and the DUP - both of whom rejected her withdrawal deal earlier this week - on Thursday. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay are also holding talks with senior opposition politicians, including Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.

The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said that the extension of Article 50 - the two year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of a second EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the talks were just ""time wasting"" if the prime minister was not prepared to consider another referendum, rule out a no-deal Brexit or to extend Article 50. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no deal Brexit off the table and a People's Vote on our European future"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum, said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". Following her meeting on Thursday, Green MP Caroline Lucas said the PM refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. ""I repeatedly urged her again and again to take 'no deal' off the table because I think it completely skews the talks because you know that cliff edge is there,"" she said. Mrs May was also resisting the option of extending Article 50, Ms Lucas said. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister was in ""listening mode"" and there was optimism that a Brexit deal could still be reached. She said she made a ""clear ask"" in relation to the Irish backstop, urging Mrs May to address it ""in a satisfactory way"". What does the DUP want from Brexit talks? What happens next? When asked what the government was willing to compromise on, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis refused to give specifics. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mrs May would not consider a customs union and that he did not believe a new referendum was ""the right way to go"". Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. Read full article. EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested that Brussels was ready to respond to any changes in Mrs May's ""red lines"", saying: ""If they change, we'll change."" He said getting an agreement was ""in everybody's interest"" and that ""something has to change"" if it is to be secured. The prime minister survived a vote of no confidence in her government by 325 to 306 votes - a margin of 19 - thanks to the backing of the 10 members of the DUP. Had they switched allegiance, the government would have lost by one vote.

This came after MPs voted against Mrs May's plans for Brexit on Tuesday night by a historic margin when it was rejected by 230 votes -the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. This video can not be played The former prime minister tells Today leaving the EU has to be delayed Former prime minister Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today that an extension to Article 50 was ""inevitable"" at this point and warned a no-deal Brexit would do ""profound damage"" to the UK's economy. There remains deep division among Mrs May's own MPs - including within her cabinet - about possible compromises, such as the option of staying in a customs union. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The government must remove the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit"" The Times newspaper,externalclaimed Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and other cabinet Brexiteers want Mrs May to present MPs with a ""Plan B"" on Monday that would include a promise to impose a time-limit on the Northern Irish backstop - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland - and to negotiate a Canada-style free trade deal. Q&A: The Northern Irish backstop What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock No-deal Brexit warning for UK drivers And the Telegraph reportedit had seen a leaked transcript of a conference call,externalin which Chancellor Philip Hammond told business leaders that a no-deal Brexit could be ""taken off the table"". Meanwhile, the SNP's Ian Blackford has also written to Mr Corbyn, along with other opposition leaders, to urge him to back another referendum as Labour's official position. And, in a letter published in the Times newspaper, more than 170 leading business figures called for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to back another referendum on withdrawal from the European Union ""to stop us crashing out of the EU with no deal at all"". Addressing a Leave Means Leave gathering in Westminster on Thursday evening, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Brexiteers should ""prepare"" and ""organise"" for the possibility of a another referendum. ""If I have to fight again against this lot... it's no more Mr Nice Guy,"" he said.

An American tech CEO who survived 11 September World Trade Centre terror attack in New York in 2001 was among the victims of the hotel attack. ""It is with a heavy heart that I have to report that my brother Jason Spindler passed away this morning during a terror attack in Nairobi, Kenya. Jason was a survivor of 9/11 and a fighter. I am sure he gave them hell!"" his brother Jonathan said in a private Facebook post. Mr Spindler was working for investment bank Salomon Smith Barney in the World Trade Center when his building collapsed in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, reports AFP.

Jeremiah was not just a leader, he was a brother and a mentor to many. He guided his team with humility and corrected with humor. He loved God and everyone he came across; and always challenged his team to grow. Tech company Cellulant, described asone of Africa's most innovative start-ups in the world of financial technology,external, lost six members of staff in the attack: Cellant described Jeremiah Mbaria as a leader, a brother and a mentor to many. ""He guided his team with humility and corrected with humour. He loved God and everyone he came across, and always challenged his team to grow."" He had just taken up a leadership role after his manager left the company late last year. ""He took on the responsibilities of leadership very gracefully and lead by example, working late to help his team meet their deadlines,"" Cellulant said. On the day of the attack, he along with Ashford Kuria, were running the team meeting when they heard an explosion. The two, together with Denis Mwaniki, guided 83 of the 100 colleagues based on the fifth and sixth floor to safety through the building's emergency door. Passionate about his job, Kelvin Gitonga believed ""technology would change the world"", Cellulant said. It described him as ""an intelligent and versatile engineer"" with a thirst for knowledge and learning. He single-handedly overhauled the product's user interface making it easier and more friendly to use, the company said. Mr Gitonga was also involved in providing support for non-web applications. After the militants noticed people were escaping through the emergency door the remaining team scattered. Six sought refuge in a small room underneath the stair cases on the first floor. The other 11 hid in two washrooms on the fifth floor. Mr Gitonga was among the team hiding in the lower floor. Ashford Kuria is fondly remembered by those at Cellutant as ""the ultimate geek"". He had worked on all the company's major products, and was part of the team that built the technology that supports Cellutant services. He was also described as the company's ""unofficial documentarian"". ""If you wanted a photo from any event in the past 10 years - Ash would have had it,"" Cellutant's tribute said. ""His knowledge of everything about everything was hilarious,"" it added. ""[Ashford] will be remembered best for his big smile, warm personality, his kindness [and] love to everyone - and most importantly his tenacity."" ""Energetic"" and ""happy"" was how Cellulant described Wilfred Kareithi  who started as an intern at the company but proved himself to be one of the best engineers. He ""never shied away"" from taking on the most challenging of tasks, the firm's statement said. ""He helped unconditionally, and always sought to mentor new staff members and share knowledge."" He had been managing projects in Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda and Nigeria. ""Just because it is not my job, doesn't mean I can't do it,"" John Ndiritu was known to tell colleagues at Cellulant in need of help. As a quality assurance tester ""he was always willing to go the extra mile to help when called upon"", the company said in a statement on Twitter. ""Jovial, calm and best-known for his humour"", is how they summed up his personality. He was part of the team members that worked on a mobile banking app for Ecobank, one of the leading banks in Africa. The team ""delivered the app in 86 days, four platforms, four languages in 33 countries in Africa"", Cellulant said. Information security expert Denis Mwaniki was described by his employer as a ""curious explorer, strategic thinker, a gentleman and exemplary leader"". Cellulant said it secured coveted information security certification thanks to Mr Mwankiki's ""intellect"", adding that he would be remembered as ""a calm and humble spirit"". He was one of the best IT security experts in Africa, the company said. His work enabled the company to get certified to operate in almost any market in the world. Twenty-six-year-old Japhet Ndunguja Nuru served as paramilitary police officer. According to his older sister, he was killed during a gunfight with the militants who broke into the Dusit complex. Helen Jumapili told theDaily Nation newspaper,externalthat she had spoken with her brother before the attack and he had promised to visit her the following day which was his day off. ""I thought he was resting since he had a long night. My parents, however, kept on calling me to know whether he was OK. We confirmed in the evening that he died in the fight,"" she said. His sister described him as a hardworking man who next month had been about to start building a home in south-eastern Taita Taveta County, where his family lived.

In December, the firm said it would do its utmost to ensure the Â£20bn nuclear power facility went ahead. A statement from the Welsh Government described the report as ""worrying"". ""This is a major project with significant economic benefits to Wales and rest of the country,"" the statement said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation very carefully and press the UK government to do everything it can to help bring this project to Anglesey."" What's Wylfa - and why is it so important? Wylfa Newydd: what happens next? Wylfa Newydd future doubt 'speculation' 'Wylfa jobs could drain away to England' Speculation has been mounting that Hitachiwill scrap the Horizon nuclear power plant project due to potential increases in construction costs. Anglesey's Welsh Assembly member Rhun ap Iorwerth said Hitachi appeared to be ""closer to a decision on Wylfa not progressing"". ""The signs aren't looking good,"" he toldBBC Wales' Good Morning Wales. Anglesey MP Albert Owen told BBC Radio Cymru he wants to know from the UK government ""what is going wrong"" and ""why these questions and fears are being heard"". The UK government had been informal negotiations with Hitachi over the projectsince June. But when British and Japanese prime ministers met on Thursday, they did not discuss the latest on the nuclear power plant. Japan's Shinzo Abe said: ""On the Horizon nuclear power plant project, this is a project which is of strategic importance for both nations. ""I do understand that stakeholders including Hitachi are currently discussing this matter and I will wait until they come to a conclusion. ""We did not touch upon this issue in our summit meeting today."" Theresa May added: ""This is a commercial decision for the company, we have been working with them, but it will be a commercial decision for the company."" Wylfa was not discussed when Japan's Shinzo Abe met Theresa May on Thursday Speaking on Friday, Wales' former first minister, Carwyn Jones, said he found the developments worrying. ""What is troubling me this morning, having heard that news, is this is a case of the UK government being so focused on Brexit that they are not focused on other issues,"" he said. ""And there are bread and butter issues that are hugely important for people living on Anglesey."" Sue Ferns, of the union Prospect, echoed worries that the issue of nuclear power was not raised when Mrs May and Mr Abe met. ""The Japanese prime minister was in Downing Street only yesterday - did the prime minister even think to raise the issue of nuclear new build or was the only thing on her mind the chance to take advantage of his visit to try to give another futile boost to her Brexit deal?"" she added. Peter McIntosh, national officer for energy at the union Unite, said: ""Government must take action now, because if the project does not proceed, it will have a devastating impact on the Welsh economy and on the UK's ability to meet its climate change obligations. But new first minister Mark Drakeford said that while the situation was worrying, ""it's still speculation"". Dylan Morgan, from Pawb (People Against Wylfa B), said the government now needed to focus on alternative plans for energy. ""The message should be very clear - we have got to reassess the whole picture of energy generation and make meaningful investment in all the various technologies of renewable energy."" A spokesman for UK government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: ""Negotiations with Hitachi on agreeing a deal that provides value for money for consumers and taxpayers on the Wylfa project are ongoing. ""They are commercially sensitive and we do not comment on speculation."" On Friday, the firm said suspension of the project remained an option. But it said the latest news report in Japan were not ""based on Hitachi's decision or disclosed information"". ""No formal decision has been made in this regard currently, while Hitachi has been assessing the Horizon project including its potential suspension and related financial impacts in terms of economic rationality as a private company,"" it said in a statement. The new nuclear plant would aim to have a generating capacity of 2900 MW by the mid 2020s and have a 60-year operational life. Shares in the Japanese company jumped 8% after the report the project would be suspended. It comes weeks after fellow Japanese company Toshiba announced plans to wind up its UK nuclear business after failing to find a buyer, dealing a potentially fatal blow toplans for a new nuclear power stationin Cumbria. The original Wylfa nuclear plant near Cemaes closed in 2015 after more than 40 years' service. What's Wylfa and why is it important?

What's Wylfa and why is it important?,"Work on Wylfa Newydd would start in 2020 if it gets the final go ahead There has been concern about whether or not there will be a new Wylfa nuclear plant in Wales in recent weeks. The future of plans for Wylfa is unclear afterJapanese tech company Hitachi said it was suspending work on the nuclear power plant. So what is the big fuss about it - and what does Hitachi's announcement mean for people in Wales? Here is what you need to know about Wylfa Newydd. The new Wylfa power station would be built next to the old power plant on Anglesey Why is Wylfa a big deal? Wylfa Newydd is a plan for a nuclear plant in north Wales. As nuclear plants go in the UK, it is a big one. It represents a real economic opportunity for north Wales to grow and would create about 9,000 jobs for people during construction. There are plans to build two to three power plants at Wylfa in Anglesey and another in Gloucestershire, producing nuclear energy in the 2020s. It is a huge chance for young people to get highly skilled, well paid work and for businesses in north Wales to grow. Wylfa nuclear 'tremendous blow' for Wales Will Anglesey profit from Wylfa? And it could have ripple effects throughout the whole of Wales, by bringing Â£5.7bn to the Welsh economy, according to independent research. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the scheme would be the ""biggest infrastructure project in Wales for a generation"". The original Wylfa Nuclear power station was decommissioned in 2015 Who is Hitachi and why is it thinking of pulling out? Big nuclear plans like Wylfa do not come cheap. It is a multi-billion pound investment being carried out by giant Japanese tech company Hitachi. But there are worries Hitachi may ditch the project - especially since announcing it will suspend it - because construction costs could rise, and uncertainty about what Brexit will mean. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met Theresa May on Thursday - but Wylfa was not discussed The company has been intalks with the UK government since June last yearto agree how Wylfa Newydd will be paid for. These negotiations are critical to the project because it decides how much public money can be invested into Wylfa. Wylfa is an expensive commitment - even for a big company like Hitachi. So it is counting even more on taxpayer money helping them out. However with the UK government's efforts fixed on Brexit, the firm has now ""pressed the pause button"",as an economic adviser put it. There is no upfront cash, no solid commitment by the government, so Wylfa Newydd is becoming riskier for Hitachi. Hitachi are in talks with the UK government about Wylfa What happens if Wylfa is later scrapped? If Hitachi completely pulls the plug it is bad news for people and businesses in Wales. It has just started hiring young apprentices and there is a Â£90,000 promise for an apprentice training scheme in Anglesey. So without the promise of Wylfa, could it mean a brain drain for north Wales? This includes people outside Anglesey too. People across north Wales, from Wrexham to Porthmadog hoping to benefit would have to look elsewhere for anything close to this size of engineering opportunity. Wylfa impact 'not adequately examined' Hitachi 'not given up' on power plant So who is affected if there is no Wylfa? The impacts of this would-be investment boost to Wales will be felt by people and Welsh businesses far and wide. Seventeen-year-olds looking for work at Wylfa would have to look to England for well-paid skilled jobs in the nuclear industry. And businesses in Wales who have already felt the benefit from the nuclear plans, may get less employment. As Coleg Menai welding student Osian Jones said: ""The more jobs that come in, the more opportunities.""

Cumbria nuclear power plant in doubt,"An artist's impression of the Moorside nuclear plant Toshiba plans to wind up its UK nuclear business after failing to find a buyer, dealing a potentially fatal blow to plans for a new nuclear power station in Cumbria. Its NuGen division was behind the development of the Moorside project. Toshiba's decision will dent the UK's plans to develop new nuclear power stations. Unions have criticised the government for failing to intervene and ensure the project went ahead. The Japanese firm said it would start the wind-up process in January. ""After considering the additional costs entailed in continuing to operate NuGen, Toshiba recognises that the economically rational decision is to withdraw from the UK nuclear power plant construction project, and has resolved to take steps to wind-up NuGen,""the Toshiba statement said.,external Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) had been a preferred bidder to take over the nuclear power plant project, but those talks fell through after more than a year of negotiations. Nuclear archive wins best building award Government must 'get a grip' on Sellafield Job cuts at firm behind new nuclear plant Toshiba said it expected to take a 15bn yen ($131.8m; Â£100.5m) hit from the withdrawal, but shares in the firm jumped 12.7% in Tokyo. The GMB union saidthe ""looming collapse"" of Moorside had been ""depressingly predictable"". ""Relying in this way on foreign companies for our country's essential energy needs was always irresponsible,"" said its national officer Justin Bowden. ""A new nuclear power station in West Cumbria remains vital for the UK's future energy security and requires urgent action."" In September NuGen announced it was reducing its team at Moorside from more than 100 to fewer than 40 - leading to speculation the plant's development was in jeopardy. NuGen was initially co-owned by Toshiba and the French firm Engie. Toshiba was subsequently forced to buy the remaining 40% of NuGen it did not already own via a bankruptcy condition related to Engie.

"D-day for future of nuclear power plantThere are fears work on Wylfa Newydd will stop, dealing a ""tremendous blow"" to the economy.Wales","Wylfa Newydd would have a 60-year operational life A decision is expected about whether work to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey will be halted. Japanese media has reported that Hitachi will suspend construction of its Â£20bn Wylfa Newydd plant - with the board due to meet on Thursday. Wales' Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he expected an announcement to be made during the morning. Anglesey council said if the project was paused it would be a ""tremendous blow"" to the north Wales economy. Mr Skates said he hoped that the plant would not be scrapped entirely. ""If it is paused then work must begin immediately across governments and with local government and with the business community in ensuring that there are job opportunities in the short term whilst we find a new investor for the project,"" he said. What's Wylfa and why is it important? Cumbria nuclear power plant in doubt Hitachi 'more likely to put Wylfa on hold' About 9,000 workers had been expected to be involved in building two nuclear reactors on the island, which are due to be operational by the mid 2020s. But speculation has been rife that Hitachi will suspend work on Wylfa - a project of its Horizon division - or scrap it due to potential increases in construction costs. The original Wylfa Nuclear Power Station on Anglesey was decommissioned in 2015 Leighton Jenkins, assistant director of the Confederation of British Industry in Wales, said the importance of the decision ""cannot be over emphasised"". ""This is not just important for the region, not just for Wales but for the whole of the UK's energy structure,"" he said. ""We are becoming a nation of artist's impressions... We need to have a strategic review as to why we struggle to deliver major infrastructure projects in Wales."" Edward Jones, a lecturer in economics at Bangor University who advises the North Wales Growth Bid, said: ""A pause is the best case scenario if we consider how the share price reacted last Friday. ""When there were rumours they were going to suspend the project the share price jumped by 8%."" Speaking on BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme, Dr Jones said investors did not like Hitachi in its current form and it would be ""difficult to do anything other than pause or scrap"" the project. ""If Hitachi does come out and say they're going to pause the project, the UK government have to act very quickly to find out what they mean by pause, is it six months or six years?"" Dr Jones added people in north Wales had already been investing in developing new skills for the project, along with investment by Hitachi themselves and other stakeholders. ""I think it does fall on to the UK government then to make a decision to see how they could help Hitachi... But once we hear the announcement we'll know a bit more about that."" The original Wylfa Nuclear power station was decommissioned in 2015 Energy is not currently devolved to the Welsh Government but Mr Skates said an emergency economic ambitions board meeting will take place on Monday to discuss what job opportunities could be offered to people in the region. He said it would also consider what additional support would be needed for theNorth Wales Growth Deal, which has been based on the premise that Wylfa Newydd would go ahead. ""Partners in north Wales have requested Â£170m for the growth deal and UK government, in spite of this comprehensive ask and programme of projects, offered Â£120m,"" he said. ""My view is that sum, if Hitachi do pause the project, should be significantly increased."" Albert Owen, Labour MP for Ynys Mon, said he was expecting a suspension of the project but at what level remained to be seen. Wylfa Nuclear Power Station offices on Thursday morning ""It's better than cancellation. What we've got to do is all work together and speak with one voice, we've got to keep this project alive. ""There's a lot at stake. We've got to be sensitive about this, we've got to get it moving forward."" Mr Owen added the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the offshore wind farm in north Wales being cancelled showed a proper finance model is needed. ""These bespoke ad hoc deals are not working,"" he said. The plant would aim to have a generating capacity of 2900MW of electricity by the mid 2020s - enough power for about five million homes - and a 60-year operational life. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that despite the funding difficulties, the UK could not turn its back on nuclear power. ""If you want to have a secure, reliable power supply, you definitely do need nuclear,"" he said. Dylan Williams, Anglesey council's head of regulation and economic development, said good jobs on the island were important. ""The recession hit Anglesey very hard and we saw several large employers leave the island,"" he said. ""This led to an increase in outmigration and commuting elsewhere for work.""

Reports last week suggestedthey could be drastic with cuts on between 80% and 90% of goods, with some tariffs being scrapped completely. If you need a refresher on what tariffs are and what they aim to do, here's a handy explanation. BBC Radio 5 Live Sally Jones, Deloitte UKâs director for International Trade Policy, has been speaking about the UK's trading arrangements after Brexit and expectations that more information will be released today. She told Wake Up To Money that industries such as steel, ceramics and agriculture were concerned their products would be ""less competitive"". This is because they are already operating in markets where there are already high tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules and also where there is a lot of international competition. Taking cars as an example, tariffs here can be as high as 25% for component parts, and 10% for finished cars under WTO rules, she said. ""If we chose to set a zero tariff  on those components and finished cars for import into the UK then you would see competition for our plants in Sunderland and similar would be increased"". BBC News Channel Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says he had ""constructive talks"" with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove and the prime minister's chief of staff Gavin Barwell. He says he raised the need for the prime minister to take no deal off the table, as well as discussing his preferred option of a Norway-style agreement, which would see a close relationship with the European Union. He told BBC News: âItâs time for all parties to come together in the national
interest."" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has rejected government claims that it would take more than a year to organise another referendum. The Conservative MP, who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""The timetable put forward by the government is simply wrong and they must be aware of it themselves."" He says another referendum could be carried out ""swiftly and within a limited extension of Article 50"".

Polly Toynbee was tweeting about her column, which discusses estimates that the Leave vote has been shrinking by about 1,350 a day. Mr Javid retweeted her along with the comment: ""How utterly disrespectful"". The calculation, conducted on behalf of the People's Vote campaign, takes into account the number of mainly Leave voters who have died, and mainly Remain voters who have reached voting age. The survey predicted that - assuming no voters changed their mind - demographic factors alone were causing the Leave majority to shrink by almost half a million a year. The Scottish government's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said planning for Brexit has been a ""game-changer"" for the country's police force. More officers will be recruited this year ""to ensure capacity and resilience is in place to prepare against a range of contingencies associated with Brexit"". Mr Yousaf was speaking about budget plans at the justice sub-committee on policing at Holyrood. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister will not attend the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos next week. Downing Street said ""sheâll be focused on matters here"". Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The government has produced ""a very short
paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold
another referendum, Downing Street has said. This was ""produced to inform the expected discussion"" with the MPs who have been to see the PM and other ministers. A government source told me it suggests ""in excess of a

Sky News reporter Aubrey Allegretti has tweeted a letter from Jeremy Corbyn, in which the Labour leader urges MPs not to contact the government until the no-deal option is taken off the table. Mr Corbyn said he personally would not meet with Mrs May to talk about the future of Brexit until she ruled out the prospect of a ""disastrous"" no-deal exit. In his letter, he wrote: ""The Prime Minister has offered to open talks with Opposition Parties, however, I have been absolutely clear that any starting point for talks about breaking the Brexit deadlock must be on the provision that the threat of a disastrous 'no deal' outcome is ruled out."" He goes on to write: ""I urge colleagues to respect that condition and refrain from engagement with the government until 'no deal' is taken off the table.""

Here's a handy reminder of the different options being explored around Westminster: Failing that, here'sa simple guide to the UK leaving the EU. The Republic of Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said a no-deal Brexit would have to become ""an exercise in damage limitation"". Speaking in the Irish parliament, Simon Coveney said: ""It would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors, which is currently facilitated by our common EU membership."" Mr Coveney said the EU would continue to seek to be as helpful as possible but that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation. ""The backstop is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he added. ""It acts as an insurance policy, to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit. It is essential."" Tory MP John Whittingdale says he and other senior MPs have had a ""constructive meeting"" with Theresa May - adding that he feels optimistic a deal that appeals to Conservatives and the DUP can be reached.

Norman SmithAssistant political editor Senior Tory MP Nick Boles is seeking to secure parliamentary backing for a bill that would force the government to delay Article 50. The measure would kick in if Mrs May was unable to get a Brexit deal through the Commons by the end of February. Mr Boles said he believed a number of Cabinet ministers  - including the chancellor - support his plan. He also said ministers outside the Cabinet had told him they would resign if forced to oppose the measure. Mr Boles has decided to drop his previous plan to give the Liaison Committee the power to introduce a new draft bill after it was widely criticised by members of the committee. It's thought Mr Boles' proposal - if accepted by the speaker - would be voted on ahead of Mrs May's statement to MPs on her Brexit plans on 29 January. Mr Boles made his comments in an interview with the Political Thinking podcast - published tomorrow. Â© 2025 BBC.

'Most common' genetic disorder test call,"Jenny Lees has haemochromatosis and believes her mother, sister and son died from the condition A ""stealth disease"" which can cause liver failure, diabetes and severe arthritis may be much more common than previously thought, research has shown. Genetic disorder Haemochromatosis causes the body to absorb too much iron from food and can lead to serious complications if left untreated. Exeter University said the condition could affect up to 20 times more people than earlier figures suggested. Public Health England has welcomed the research. Thought to be the UK's most common genetic disorder, haemochromatosis is linked to a faulty gene passed from both parents to their child. It was believed to seriously affect about one in 100 carriers. But the new research has suggested the true level could be closer to one in 10 among women, and one in five for men. Lead researcher Prof David Melzer said he was astonished at the findings. ""We've shown that hereditary haemochromatosis is actually a much more common and stealth disease, including in older people,"" he said. The UK National Screening Committee said it will be ""look at the evidence to screen for haemochromatosis in 2019/20, as part of its routine three yearly review."" Jason Cloke, 42, died in 2010 after his organs were damaged by a build up of iron. His mother, Jenny Lees, herself a haemochromatosis sufferer, believes three members of her family died from the condition. While her mother and sister were never diagnosed before their deaths, she said they died from severe liver damage; a common symptom. The cause of her son's death, however, was confirmed as haemochromatosis. ""His liver was cirrhosed, he had chronic diabetes, he then picked up hepatitis A and they couldn't give him the antibiotics that he needed,"" said Mrs Lees. She has called for regular blood tests to help detect the condition. ""You don't believe that you're going to lose a child before your death, it's the wrong way round,"" she said. Prof Melzer said haemochromatosis was easy to treat if caught early enough, but was ""difficult to spot"". ""It tends to only be diagnosed quite late on when a lot of the damage is done and treatment is only partially successful,"" he added. The professor and his fellow researchers have called on the NHS to find routine ways of testing for it. This video can not be played BBC News NI Health Correspondent Marie-Louise Connolly explains Haemochromatosis. Haemochromatosis is a condition that leads to the accumulation of iron in the organs of the body It is caused by a faulty gene - Northern Europeans with Celtic origins, particularly of Irish backgrounds, are more likely to carry the gene Symptoms include fatigue, joint disease, skin problems, and sexual health issues - left untreated it can cause serious illness such as liver cancer and cirrhosis Treatment is relatively simple and consists of venesection (bloodletting) - as the body makes more blood to replace that taken, it uses up the excess stored iron Source: Haemochromatosis UK Ruth Jones said she was ""feeling exhausted"" all the time and found running much harder for ""no obvious reason"" Long-distance runner Ruth Jones, 38,  said it took nine months of tests before she was diagnosed with haemochromatosis. Haemochromatosis - 'the Celtic curse' 'I was in excruciating pain from excess iron' The mother-of-two from Stamford, Lincolnshire runs up to 70 miles a week and first visited a doctor with symptoms of low energy levels in September 2017. She said she was ""feeling exhausted"" all the time and found running much harder for ""no obvious reason"". After being diagnosed, she said she was met with a lack of understanding about the condition among medical staff. However, after a transfer to a consultant and undergoing a few treatments, she noticed aches in her joints alleviating. ""I just felt more 'with it' and alive,"" she said. Mrs Jones's husband Brian is now undergoing testing to see if he too has haemochromatosis, which would help to indicate whether their daughters, aged 10 and 13, carry the gene or have the condition. Researchers compared levels of illness and death among those with and without the gene mutations. They analysed data for 2,890 people from theUK Biobank,externalwho had mutations, who were aged between 40 and 70. Participants were monitored for an average of seven years, and hospital records were used to identify diagnosed conditions and deaths during that time. Prof Debra Lapthorne, from Public Health England said: ""We really welcome this study and think the work will be clinically very important as the results could have implications for clinical practice and help us find people much earlier, before significant damage is done. ""This work shows the real benefit to the population of linking academic research to policy and clinical practice."" 'I was in excruciating pain from excess iron' What is Haemochromatosis?

Retailers told to clean up fake faux fur,"Tests revealed the jumper contained real fur - likely to have come from a rabbit Clothing retailers have been told to take immediate action to ensure items they advertise as containing fake fur are not made from real fur. The UK's advertising watchdog has given them a deadline of 11 February, after which they may face sanctions. Last week the Advertising Standards Authorityfound online retailer Boohoohad sold a pompom jumper which used real fur, most likely rabbit fur. It's part of a more widespread problem of real fur masquerading as fake fur. A pompom headband sold by Zacharia Jewellers, a firm trading on Amazon, was also found to have broken the rules. Last yeara BBC investigation foundTK Maxx and other Amazon retailers had sold items labelled faux fur but using real fur. The items were spotted by animal welfare charity the Humane Society International as part of an ongoing investigation into the trend. Real fur, while traditionally considered a luxury material, can sometimes be cheaper than artificial fur. As a result some manufacturers have used fox, racoon or rabbit fur on items without accurately labelling them. The findings against Boohoo and Zacharia prompted the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP), which draws up rules on advertising practice, to issue an enforcement notice. It requires retailers to ensure they are not misleading consumers and provides some advice on how to go about examining products and supply chains more closely. Laboratory testing was the most reliable method but the CAP said customers and retailers could also check items themselves using relatively straightforward methods. These include looking at the base material to see whether it is a natural leather or a woven fabric, and burning some of the fur to see whether it singes or melts. The CAP said it didn't take a view on the ethics of animal fur as a consumer product, which can be legally bought and sold in the UK. But it said making misleading advertising claims that it was ""faux fur"" when it wasn't did breach the rules. Guy Parker, chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said consumers who thought they were buying faux fur ""in good conscience"" could find it ""deeply upsetting"" to find they had actually purchased animal fur. The Humane Society (HSI), said it was delighted its complaint had been upheld but there was still ""a shocking amount of fake faux fur"" for sale in the UK. Claire Bass, executive director of HSI, said consumers had ""the right to be confident that when they buy faux fur they are not being duped into buying the exact animal cruelty they are trying to avoid."" Companies which don't comply could end up being referred to Trading Standards for potential prosecution.

Kenya hotel attack death toll rises to 21,"This video can not be played Nairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation At least 21 people were killed when Somali militants stormed a luxury hotel compound in Nairobi, Kenya's government has confirmed. Hundreds were forced to flee the bloodshed at the DusitD2 hotel and business complex on Tuesday. Some 28 injured people have been admitted to hospital, and Kenya's Red Cross said 19 are still missing. Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack, which triggered a 19-hour security operation. President Uhuru Kenyatta said the siege ended with five jihadist attackers ""eliminated"". Kenya has been a target for al-Shabab since October 2011, when it sent its army into Somalia to fight the jihadist group. The BBC's Andrew Harding, in Nairobi, says cowering groups of civilians were escorted to safety by security forces throughout Tuesday night, amid sporadic bursts of gunfire and the boom of explosions that continued well beyond dawn. Many had spent hours hiding in their offices, or in bathrooms. On the crowded street outside the large, upmarket complex, friends and relatives embraced those who emerged andthanked Kenyan security forces. Mourners have now begun to bury the dead. Read more from Andrew: Relief replaces fear after Kenya attack In a televised address, President Kenyatta said ""every person that was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act"" would be ""relentlessly"" pursued. People arrive at the Chiromo mortuary in Nairobi to help identify victims Two people believed to be linked to the attack were arrested after raids on Wednesday, AFP reported. How Kenya's hotel siege unfolded In pictures: Assault on hotel complex Outrage at pictures of victims According to Reuters news agency, al-Shabab issued a statement calling the attack ""a response"" to US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The move last year overturned decades of US foreign policy, and drew international criticism. Jerusalem is a sacred city in Islam, Judaism and Christianity - and while Israel regards the whole of Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, Palestinians claim the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future state. Kenyan James Oduor, commonly known as Cobra, was tweeting as the attack was unfolding. He was known for his love of football and was well-liked. Allow Twitter content?

The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. The attackers, two of which are shown here, were caught on CCTV as they entered the complex A woman working in a neighbouring building told Reuters: ""I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives."" Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. Allow Twitter content?

At 23:00, a government official said that all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. But just an hour later, gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported in the area. There was more heavy gunfire at about 07:00 on Wednesday. Security forces then combed their way through the building where frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside. The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants. When the gunmen first entered there was confusion, as people first tried to escape and then retreated into the building as they came under fire. One eyewitness, Faith Chepchirchir, told Reuters: ""People were trying to run towards the gate, but then I saw everyone who was running towards the gate was coming back from the gate, now heading to this opposite direction. ""So for me we just closed the doors and then gunshots were just being sprayed all over. From the top, I think [the gunmen] went to the top floor and then started spraying bullets."" Many civilians were trapped in the complex for several hours Many civilians remained holed up in the complex for several hours, as they hid from the attackers in bathrooms, and even under tables and chairs. 'How we survived Kenya hotel siege' Some were able to keep in contact with loved ones by text. They included Zinzi Khalwale, daughter of a former senator Boni Khalwale. Her father told The Daily Nation she had hidden in one of the rooms of her office until her rescue. By the evening, all but the seventh floor of the complex had been cleared, but some civilians remained there, apparently in close proximity to the surviving attackers. They oppose the Somali government, but have carried out attacks throughout East Africa. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? In September 2013,al-Shabab gunmen entered the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and targeted shoppers. During an 80-hour siege at the upscale centre, 67 people were killed. Two years later,the group carried out its deadliest ever assault in Kenya, shooting dead almost 150 people at Garissa University.

"World's coffee under threat, say expertsOf 124 coffees in the world, we only drink two, but we need to protect all of them, say scientists.Science & Environment","We drink two coffees out of more than 100 types growing naturally The first full assessment of risks to the world's coffee plants shows that 60% of 124 known species are on the edge of extinction. More than 100 types of coffee tree grow naturally in forests, including two used for the coffee we drink. Scientists say the figure is ""worrying"", as wild coffee is critical for sustaining the global coffee crop. About one in five of the world's plants is threatened with extinction, and the 60% figure is an ""extremely high"" one. ""If it wasn't for wild species we wouldn't have as much coffee to drink in the world today,"" said Dr Aaron Davis of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ""Because if you look at the history of coffee cultivation, we have used wild species to make the coffee crop sustainable."" Arabica originated in the highlands of Ethiopia Research published in the journal, Science Advances,,externalfound conservation measures were ""inadequate"" for wild coffees, including those considered ""critical"" for  long-term global coffee production. The study found that 75 wild coffee species are considered threatened with extinction, 35 are not threatened and too little is known about the remaining 14 to make any judgement. Furthermore, it was found that 28% of wild coffee species grow outside protected areas and only about half are preserved in seed banks. A second study, in Global Change Biology,,externalfound that wild Arabica coffee can be classed as threatened under official (IUCN Red List) rankings, when climate change projections are taken into account. Its natural population is likely to shrink by up to 50% or more by 2088 because of climate change alone, according to the research. Wild Arabica is used to supply seeds for coffee farming and also as a harvested crop in its own right. Ethiopia is the home of Arabica coffee, where it grows naturally in upland rainforests. ""Given the importance of Arabica coffee to Ethiopia, and to the world, we need to do our utmost to understand the risks facing its survival in the wild,"" said Dr Tadesse Woldemariam Gole, of the Environment and Coffee Forest Forum in Addis Ababa. Many coffee drinkers are unaware that we only use the coffee beans from two species -Coffea ArabicaandCoffea robusta- in the thousands of different blends of coffee on sale. Coffee comes in many blends, but relies on two species In fact, there are 122 coffee species on top of that which occur naturally in the wild. Many of these wild coffees do not taste good to drink, but may contain genes that can be harnessed to help coffee plants survive in the future, amid climate change and emerging diseases that attack coffee trees. Will coffee taste worse as the planet warms? Seeds hold hidden treasures for future food Wild crops pushed to brink of extinction Wild food crops to be 'rescued',external In the longer term, we will need to call on wild species to safeguard the future of the world's coffee crop, say researchers. ""We will call on those wild resources time and time again,"" said Dr Davis. Globally, about one in five plants is threatened with extinction, compared with 60% for coffee. As a comparison, about half of wild tea and mango species are threatened with extinction, 6% of hazelnuts and 9% of pistachios. The vast majority of wild coffee grows in the remote forests of Africa and on the island of Madagascar. Beyond Africa, wild coffee is found in other tropical climates, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Global coffee trade relies on two species - Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora). Coffee plantation in Colombia A third species - Liberica (Coffea liberica) is grown around the world, but is rarely used for coffee drinks. Crop wild relatives are wild plants that are genetically related to cultivated crops. They continue to evolve in the wild, and can be crossed with domesticated crops. They have been used to improve the yields and nutritional quality of crops since the dawn of agriculture. They say we must understand the risks to coffee farming and make sure we have the resources in place to overcome threats. Coffee trees, like many tropical plants, have seeds that do not survive the freeze-drying process used in conventional seed banks - 45% of coffee species have not been ""backed up"" outside the wild. Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha of Kew said this is the first time an IUCN Red List assessment has been carried out to find the extinction risk of the world's coffee, and the figure of 60% is ""extremely high"". ""We hope this new data will highlight species to be prioritised for the sustainability of the coffee production sector, so that appropriate action can be taken to safeguard the species,"" she said.

Police watchdog 'hears wrong cases',"Only five police officers in England and Wales were dismissed in the last three years following misconduct cases ordered by the police watchdog. The BBC also found in two-thirds of the 48 cases pursued by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) ""gross misconduct"" charges were not proven. The Police Federation said the IOPC was bringing the ""wrong cases"" and officers often had to wait years to be cleared. The IOPC said its approach had been legally tested and was ""appropriate"". The watchdog has the power to order hearings over allegations of gross misconduct when a force refuses to hold them - they're known as ""directed"" hearings. Figures provided to the BBC after a request under the Freedom of Information Act show that in the three years to October 2018 there were 48 completed directed hearings across 19 police forces. Suspended officers 'paid to do nothing' No action over 'stress ball' officer Aftershave lie police officer sacked In 33 cases gross misconduct, the most serious disciplinary charge that can be levelled, was not proven. Of the 15 police officers against whom charges were upheld five were sacked and 10 received other sanctions. Some 21 police forces didn't carry out any directed hearings - and three constabularies, Essex, Sussex and Wiltshire, failed to provide information. An officer with Nottinghamshire Police who was cleared at an IOPC-directed hearing after a near six-year investigation told BBC News the process was a ""nightmare"". Catherine, who asked to be referred to only by her first name because of the sensitive nature of her work,was accused of using excessive force against a pregnant woman who'd been arrested and taken into custody in July 2011. Although three officers were disciplined over the incident, it took until May 2017 for the charges to be dropped against Catherine. The police constable, who has spent almost 19 years in the police service, said the uncertainty over what would happen to her and whether she'd lose her job had held her career back. ""I couldn't move to a different department, couldn't leave the force, couldn't look to move to a new house or spend money due to the fact that I didn't know what was going to happen,"" she said. The IOPC, formerly the Independent Police Complaints Commission, apologised and admitted their handling of her case had been ""unacceptable"". ""I knew in my heart of hearts I'd done nothing wrong,"" Catherine said. Phill Matthews, conduct lead for the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents 120,000 officers, said the legal test used by the IOPC to determine if a misconduct case should go ahead needed reforming. Sergeant Matthews said the process can leave officers ""traumatised"". ""The IPCC, and IOPC as is now, pursue the wrong cases and often have very little understanding of the evidence and give families and complainants unrealistic expectations,"" he said. ""The effect on the officers involved is sometimes catastrophic. They can be suspended, at massive public expense, which has a knock on effect on morale for whole shifts of officers, or placed on restrictions."" The legal test, known as the 'case to answer' test, is whether a disciplinary panel could, on the basis of the evidence available, make a finding of misconduct or gross misconduct. It is a lower threshold than the 'balance of probabilities' test applied by a disciplinary panel and lower than the 'realistic prospect of conviction' test used by the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether to bring criminal proceedings. The 'case to answer' test is enshrined in legislation and the IOPC said it would be ""unlawful"" for them to ignore or raise the threshold upheld by the High Court. ""We know the case to answer test is low but it has been repeatedly tested through judicial reviews and found to be appropriate,"" a spokeswoman said. The Home Office said it was ""inevitable"" there'd be a 'case to answer' against some officers who were later cleared of misconduct but added that it was implementing reforms to ensure a ""consistent"" approach to the way the test was applied. Policing Minister Nick Hurd said reforms, due for implementation this year, improve how misconduct hearings are prepared and conducted.

UK groups fund illegal orphanages in AfricaChildren at one squalid home seen by the BBC said they had been beaten and neglected by their carers.UK,"One orphanage was sponsored by donors through Manchester-based builder Patrick Oldham At least 60 illegal orphanages and children's homes in Uganda are being funded by UK charities, church groups and volunteers, the BBC has discovered. The Ugandan government recently announced a programme to close down more than 500 unlicensed orphanages in the country. The BBC attended the closure of one UK-funded home, where children said they had been beaten and neglected. The Ugandan government urged UK donors to check who they are giving money to. A BBC investigation found registered UK charities were funding and supporting dozens of the illegal orphanages on the Ugandan government's closure list. Some said they did not realise the homes they were funding were illegal. The government is shutting down unregistered homes to try and improve oversight of children's care in the country. Some of the homes on the closure list also had volunteers visit from the UK. On a muggy morning in December BBC Radio 4's File on 4 travelled to an area of south-west Uganda called Masaka to record the closure of one illegal home. It was sponsored by donors through Patrick Oldham, a builder from Hyde, in Greater Manchester. Mr Oldham lives part of the year in Uganda, going to the home and introducing the children to visiting volunteers.  He uses social media to give updates and attract sponsorship. Inside, 25 children who had UK sponsors were living in squalid conditions. The open pit latrine toilets were flooding and there was no running water. One boy had been circumcised and was living with an untreated, painful infection. Many of the other children also had skin infections which they say weren't being treated. Following the raid all the children were returned to their families. A government social worker, Maria Nagawa, said conditions there were the worst she had ever seen. Social workers found tools, including an axe, lying of the floor of the orphanage In Masaka, the BBC also met a woman called Laetitia - not her real name - who is a mother of six children. After her husband died, she was struggling to raise money for her children's school fees when she was approached by a woman working for the orphanage in 2016. Laetitia was persuaded to send her two youngest boys, then aged 7 and 5, to the home, where she was promised they would be given a top education. Last spring, the boys were returned home by social workers who were concerned about their living conditions. The eldest of the pair, now aged 9, told the BBC how his brother was beaten if he wet his bed. ""Whenever I tried to go and help him out, they would also beat me,"" he added. Both boys said beatings were common at the home and that they even saw female members of staff melting plastic bags and using them to burn the children. Laeticia says her eldest son also contracted typhoid from dirty drinking water at the orphanage. A government social worker said conditions there were the worst she had seen A Facebook group for the home, regularly updated with posts by Mr Oldham is called ""Rock of Joy children's care"". The BBC investigation found that money was fraudulently raised for the home using the credentials of a charity with a similar name - The Rock of Joy Trust, also based in the North West. The charity also operates in Uganda. The founders of the genuine Rock of Joy Trust said the fact their name was being used in connection to the illegal orphanage was appalling and extremely upsetting. A response on behalf of Mr Oldham said: ""Any personal allegations are refuted, we are considering the possibility of legal action. ""It is our understanding that some children remain and it is paramount that we both protect and secure their future."" An open pit latrine toilet flooded the floor outside the building The permanent secretary of the Ugandan ministry responsible for children Pius Bigirimana warned UK donors against giving money to orphanages without official checks. He said: ""If you are interested in supporting these children, don't just go put money into a home which is unlisted. ""Why don't you assist the family to look after the children instead of looking at an institution?"" The UK charity Hope and Homes for Children is assisting the Ugandan government in its work to keep children in their families, rather than living in institutions. Its chief executive, Mark Waddington said the number of children living in orphanages in Uganda had grown from just under 2,000 in the 1990's to more than 55,000. He said orphanages were now seen as ""an economy"". ""We are seeing children being conned out of households, with their parents being persuaded under the offer of a Western style education,"" he said. ""They are used literally as commodities to raise funding."" Listen to the full File on 4 report, called The Orphanage Business,here.

May: MPs must 'work together' for Brexit,"This video can not be played Theresa May has called on MPs to ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward Theresa May has called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"" and ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward for Brexit. Earlier, the prime minister won a vote of no confidence by 325 to 306, as rebel Tory MPs and the DUP backed her to stay in No 10. But just 24 hours before, both groups ensured her Brexit plan was voted down. On Wednesday night the PM met the SNP, Lib Dem and Plaid Cymru leaders but not Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. She said: ""I am disappointed that the leader of the Labour Party has not so far chosen to take part, but our door remains open."" Mr Corbyn has said that before any ""positive discussions"" can take place, the prime minister should rule out a no-deal Brexit. May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? Kuenssberg: Can Theresa May bring her critics on board? Brexit: A really simple guide The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Labour had been clear that unless Mrs May makes a statement saying the UK will only leave through a managed process, Mr Corbyn is not going anywhere near the talks. But she said it wasn't a straightforward judgement for the Labour party, as many members do not want Brexit to happen - meaning Mr Corbyn could quite easily be criticised for helping the process if he attends. MPs voted against Mrs May's plans for Brexit on Tuesday night by an historic margin when it was rejected by 230 votes -the largest defeat for a sitting government in history.

Speaking outside Number 10, Mrs May said: ""I understand that to people getting on with their lives away from Westminster, the events of the past 24 hours will have been unsettling. ""Overwhelmingly the British people want us to get on with delivering Brexit and also address the other important issues they care about. ""I believe it is my duty to deliver on the British people's instruction to leave the European Union and I intend to do so."" The prime minister said the meetings she had held so far had been ""constructive"" and that she - along with other senior government representatives - would be meeting with other MPs in the coming days to get the ""widest possible views across parliament"" on Brexit. Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, earlier told BBC News that it was not ""unreasonable"" for Mr Corbyn to say: ""Are you serious?"" He added: ""We're very amenable to talks, but I think the prime minister needs to show us that she's actually serious about that. ""Is she actually going to concede on some of these red lines? Are they going to be meaningful to us?"" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The government must remove the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit"" The Westminster leader of the SNP, Ian Blackford, wrote to the PM following his meeting, calling for a ""clear gesture of good faith"" from her. He said that the extension of Article 50 - the mechanism that allows the UK to leave the EU - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit and the option of a second EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Mr Blackford has also written to Mr Corbyn, along with other opposition leaders, to urge him to back another referendum as Labour's official position. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said she had approached the meeting in a constructive manner, but told Mrs May: ""This must not be a meeting for a meeting's sake."" She added: ""We are committed to finding a real solution to the Brexit mess. That means taking a no deal Brexit off the table and a People's Vote on our European future."" The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, has not spoken publically since his meeting with Mrs May, but earlier he also told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit had to be taken off the table, as well as the PM having a ""willingness"" to discuss another referendum - which is the party's preference. And he echoed calls for Mr Corbyn to support a ""People's Vote"", now that he had lost his no confidence motion, or risk becoming a ""handmaiden of Brexit"".

No-deal Brexit - the data dilemma,"Could data flows come to a halt post-Brexit? Two urgent questions - does your business move data across borders and if so are you prepared for what could happen if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal? The Direct Marketing Association (DMA), which represents a whole raft of data businesses, says any company that moves data between the UK and an EU country needs to be aware of what will change if we effectively sign out of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe's data protection regime. If we are going to continue to see data flowing freely across borders as now, we will need the EU to give us the kind of adequacy deal it has already granted to 12 other non-EU countries - but it isn't clear how quickly that would happen. And in the meantime, the DMA says, there would be severe uncertainty that ""could potentially bring EU-to-UK data flows to a halt"". A couple of examples: A large UK data processing company with EU-based customers and an EU data centre may find it can no longer move their data across borders to be processed in the UK. In the words of the DMA, ""it would lose control of its own data"" A small e-commerce company, perhaps selling Scottish knitwear, has some customers in France and stores their email addresses and previous orders in its database. To continue processing their data, it may need an EU-approved standard contractual clause DMA chief executive Chris Combemale says many larger companies have already moved to open data centres in mainland Europe. He describes one major US financial technology company that had all of its servers in London but now has a duplicate operation in Amsterdam. He says large companies are prepared and will take things  in their stride but the administrative burden on smaller businesses could be quite onerous. ""We're not disaster-mongers - things will carry on but with more cost,"" he says. ""The uncertainty, the extra cost, could reduce investment -  companies could choose to do less business here."" Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham says companies need to consider ""alternative transfer mechanisms"" Lawyers too are warning that data-handling companies - and they account for an awful lot of businesses these days - face a mountain of work. ""Preparing for a no-deal Brexit requires identifying current and future EU-UK data transfers and urgently ensuring that UK entities become 'safe importers' of data in Data Transfers Agreements,"" says Eduardo Ustaran of Hogan Lovells. ""A no-deal Brexit definitely means more bureaucracy, not less."" The Information Commissioner's Office points out that there is comprehensive advice for businesses about theimplications of a no-deal Brexit on its website,external. Introducing the advice, the commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: ""Organisations will need to carefully consider alternative transfer mechanisms to maintain data flows and the guidance we have produced will help you weigh the options and take action if this proves necessary."" Having read through this section, my head is spinning and I can imagine lots of smaller companies will still be struggling to work out exactly what they need to do. But with just 71 days left to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, any business that depends on data had better get their skates on. Otherwise, they could see a vital resource stuck in an endless tailback at the border.

Briton killed in Kenya hotel attack named,"Luke Potter was involved in development projects across East Africa A British man killed in an attack on a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, has been named as Luke Potter by the international development charity he worked for. In a statement,external, Gatsby said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the death of its Africa programmes director. Mr Potter was among at least 21 people killed. It is understood a member of the UK Special Forces was involved in a rescue operation at the complex. The Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. Gunmen stormed the complex in the capital on Tuesday. Gunfire and explosions continued into Wednesday beforePresident Uhuru Kenyatta announced the siege had ended. The Foreign Office said another Briton was also wounded in the attack. Latest updates on the siege aftermath In pictures: Attack in Kenya's capital In a statement, Gatsby Africa said Mr Potter had ""devoted the past 10 years of his career to helping some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world"" and had worked with the charity for more than three years, carrying out assignments across East Africa. ""Luke was respected by all he worked with, bringing huge drive, determination, a relentless work ethic, and a thirst for new ideas to every project,"" the statement said. ""He brought a calm head and his unique sense of humour to every situation."" It said Mr Potter was ""instrumental"" in establishing the organisation's forestry programme in Kenya and provided ""crucial leadership, guidance and support"" to other programmes in Tanzania and Rwanda. The charity said its ""thoughts and deepest condolences"" were with Mr Potter's family, partner, daughter and friends and they were offering support to them and their own staff. This video can not be played The scene at the Nairobi Dusit hotel as the rescue operation took place The UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Nic Hailey, confirmed the death of a British man on Twitter. ""I'm very sad to confirm that we believe at least one British national has been killed in the attack,"" he said. ""We are providing our support to his family and friends at this very difficult time."" The Foreign Office added it was ""in contact with the Kenyan authorities"" and was ""ready to help any other British people affected"". It is understood a member of the British SAS - who was in Kenya as part of a training team - was involved in rescuing hostages. The armed special forces soldier entered the hotel complex to help rescue the trapped civilians and, according to a source, fired his weapon. He is believed to have been working alongside members of the US Special Forces, who were already in Nairobi when the attack took place. A man believed to be a member of the British SAS helps people caught up in the attack to safety Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Twitter: ""Really tragic news from Kenya - my thoughts are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones in this attack including one British citizen. ""UK stands with Kenya at this difficult time. Our team in Nairobi are supporting all Brits affected."" On Wednesday morning, President Kenyatta announced the assault was over, adding that the ""terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" and more than 700 civilians had been evacuated to safety. He said: ""We will seek out every person that was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act. ""We are a country governed by laws, rules and regulations - a country that embraces peaceful coexistence... I must also state that we are also a nation that never forgets those who hurt our children."" The president said 14 ""innocent"" people had been killed in the attack. Kenya's police chief later said the death toll had risen to 21. The Kenya Red Cross said about 45 people were still unaccounted for. The US State Department said an American man was among those killed. The luxury complex, which houses the DusitD2 hotel as well as offices, is in the Westlands district of the city. The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday, when four gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park, before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. When the gunmen first entered the complex there was confusion, as people first tried to escape to freedom and then retreated into the building as they came under fire. Many civilians remained holed up in the complex for several hours, as they hid from the attackers in bathrooms, and even under tables and chairs. Groups of civilians were escorted to safety by security forces throughout the night. In the early hours of Wednesday, more than 100 people were rescued. About 30 people are being treated at Nairobi hospitals, media reports say.

Brexit hits house purchases,"The West Midlands had the strongest annual house price growth across the UK in the 12 months to November 2018. But housing activity in southern England was muted because of Brexit uncertainty. Average house prices across the UK climbed by 2.8%, rising from 2.7% annual growth in October 2018. In the West Midlands, prices rose by 4.6%, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry. It said the average UK house price was Â£230,630 in October, falling by 0.1% month-on-month. Over the past two years, there has been a slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England, the report said. The lowest annual growth was in London, where prices actually fell by 0.7% over the year to November, unchanged from the previous month. Where can I afford to live? How I bought a house without mum and dad Where does rent hit young people the hardest? London house prices have been falling over the year each month since July 2018, while potential buyers and sellers have been postponing transactions in the south of England until after the EU withdrawal. Other regions showing the strongest price growth after the West Midlands included the East Midlands, up 4.4%, the South West, up 4.3%, and the North East, up 4%. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' UK Residential Market Survey for November 2018 reported subdued activity in almost all areas of the UK, mainly driven by Brexit uncertainty and a lack of fresh stock. The UK Property Transactions Statistics for November 2018 showed that on a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of transactions on residential properties with a value of Â£40,000 or greater was 100,930, 0.5% lower compared with the same period a year ago. Kevin Roberts, director of the Legal & General Mortgage Club, said: ""The ongoing political uncertainty is clearly causing some buyers and sellers to take a wait-and-see approach when it comes to the property market."" North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said: ""On the one hand, the risk of uncertainty for the property market increases after yesterday's Brexit deal vote, but on the other, it helps to concentrate minds on all sides as the threat of a 'no deal' rises, which was reflected in sterling's strengthening immediately after the result was announced."" At the country level, the largest annual price growth was recorded in Wales, where prices climbed by 5.5% over the year. Scotland saw house prices increase by 2.9% over the last 12 months. In England, the average price increased by just 2.6% over the year. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

Where rent hits young hardest,"This video can not be played What sacrifices have you made to get on the housing ladder? People in their 20s who want to rent a place for themselves face having to pay out an ""unaffordable"" amount in two-thirds of Britain, BBC research shows. They face financial strain as average rents for a one-bedroom home eat up more than 30% of their typical salary in 65% of British postcode areas. Many housing organisations regard spending more than a third of income on rent as unaffordable. A salary of Â£51,200 is needed to ""afford"" to rent a one-bed London home. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your salary on rent. The average rent of a 1-bedroom home exceeds this for twenty-somethings in two-thirds of Britain.    Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2018. Scroll down for methodology. Insufficient data is available for Northern Ireland. Flat-sharing - the choice of many young employees - does not entirely resolve the issue as 12% of postcode areas in Britain remain ""unaffordable"" for two people in their 20s sharing a two-bedroom home. Analysis by the BBC's data team shows that a gross annual income of Â£24,800 would be needed for the average one-bedroom rental flat in England to become affordable under the 30% measure. In Scotland Â£20,700 is needed and in Wales Â£17,600. Many people can pay more than 30% of income on rent, but housing organisations say this puts considerable strain on the rest of their finances. Friends Molly Ebdon, 22, Danielle Campbell, 25, and Amelia Scott, 24 say renting is too expensive Friends Molly Ebdon, 22, Danielle Campbell, 25, and Amelia Scott, 24, all work in Cheltenham but find it prohibitively expensive to rent in the town. ""It is expensive on a starting salary and any kind of saving is not an option,"" Danielle said. Amelia, who previously rented but was now back living in the family home, said that moving into a rented home in Cheltenham would mean giving up a car and cutting back on other spending. But staying with parents also brought restrictions on where to look for jobs. Morgan Twyning says she has chosen to live with her boyfriend's parents Shop manager Morgan Twyning said she and her partner moved in with his parents in order to save, as rent would have taken up most of their salary. The 25-year-old said that Sunday roasts were nice but the living arrangements were ""not what I had envisioned"". ""My friends definitely struggle. A lot of their money is used up in just their rent alone,"" she said. Why was I ashamed of the fact my mum had no money?,external Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? Shared homes: 'We had one girl living on a balcony' Sex and dating when you live with parents Dan Wilson Craw, director of lobby group Generation Rent, said: ""This research is more evidence of how difficult it is to lead the life you expect. If you get a job and work hard, you should expect to have some choice about living arrangements. ""People in areas with a strong jobs market have to find somewhere to share with others in order to afford to live there."" The data reveals the importance of location in determining how big a chunk of their monthly salary is likely to be spent on rent. Kate Faulkner, housing analyst and managing director of Propertychecklists.co.uk, said that renting can be affordable in many areas outside of London, but the particular squeeze in the capital dominated the debate and meant many other pressing concerns for these tenants were overlooked by policymakers. In London, a 20-something with a typical average income would spend 55% of their monthly earnings on a mid-range one-bedroom flat. Housing charity Shelter considers any more than 50% as ""extremely unaffordable"". That rises to 156%, so one-and-a-half times a typical salary, in one part of Westminster - the most expensive part of London - where an average one-bedroom home costs Â£3,500 a month to rent. In contrast, a tenant aged 22-29 looking for a typical property of this kind in the Scottish district of Argyll and Bute would only have to spend 15% of their income. Epping Forest - postcode areas IG9 (rent Â£1,230; 71% of income), RM4 (rent Â£1,126; 65% of income), and IG7 (rent Â£1,087; 62% of income) Cambridge - postcode area CB2 (rent Â£1,082; 62% of income) Elmbridge - postcode area KT10 (rent Â£1,151; 62% of income) Argyll and Bute - postcode area PA28 (rent Â£266; 15% of income) Scottish Borders - postcode areas TD9 (rent Â£327; 19%) and TD8 (rent Â£343; 20% of income) Northumberland - postcode area NE62 (rent Â£324; 20% of income) East Ayrshire - postcode area KA16 (rent Â£347; 20% of income) Finding one or more flatmates is a popular way of cutting the cost for many young tenants. The figures show that two people aged in their 20s sharing a two-bedroom flat in Manchester could pay just over 20% of their income on rent. Separate research from Shelter suggests that tenants may already find that they are cramped for space compared with those who own their homes. What are people's experiences of living in a shared home? Number of middle-aged renters doubles in a decade 'Nightmare' rental shortage for the disabled The charity estimated that private tenants in England are spending Â£140 more in housing costs than people with a mortgage. In the last 10 years, when families have been increasingly likely to rent, owners have seen the average floor space of their homes increase by 7% compared with a 2% rise for tenants. That leaves owners with an average of 30 sq m extra floor space than tenants, which the charity suggests is the equivalent of a master bedroom and a kitchen. This all comes at a time when young adults might look back in anger at previous generations. The BBC research shows that a private tenant in the UK typically spends more than 30% of their income on rent. In 1980, UK private renters spent an average of 10% of their income on rent, or 14% in London. However, there were many more people renting from councils or in social housing at that time. Landlords say they face costs, including their mortgages, insurance, maintenance and licensing, that need to be covered from rents. ""These costs are increasing as the government introduces new measures to discourage investment in property, such as the removal of mortgage interest relief and the changes to stamp duty,"" said Chris Norris, director of policy at the National Landlords Association. ""This is compounded by the number of landlords divesting as their businesses become less financially viable, resulting in fewer properties available to rent, while demand for properties across the UK remains high.""

Map development by Joe Reed and Scott Jarvis, design by Debie Loizou and Irene de la Torre Arenas. There is no official UK measure of what constitutes an ""unaffordable"" rent, but based on recommendations from housing organisations the analysis uses a threshold of no more than 30% of income. The National Housing Federation recommends 30% of gross median income as the measure generally used by people in the housing sector and academics. Shelter defines anything over 33% as ""unaffordable"" and additionally anything over 50% as ""extremely unaffordable"". Because it's the age group that is by far most likely to be renting. Renting has more than doubled over the last 20 years, and 65% of 16-24 year olds and 42% of 25-34 year olds now rent privately, according toHouse of Commons Library research,external.

UK groups fund illegal orphanages in Africa,"One orphanage was sponsored by donors through Manchester-based builder Patrick Oldham At least 60 illegal orphanages and children's homes in Uganda are being funded by UK charities, church groups and volunteers, the BBC has discovered. The Ugandan government recently announced a programme to close down more than 500 unlicensed orphanages in the country. The BBC attended the closure of one UK-funded home, where children said they had been beaten and neglected. The Ugandan government urged UK donors to check who they are giving money to. A BBC investigation found registered UK charities were funding and supporting dozens of the illegal orphanages on the Ugandan government's closure list. Some said they did not realise the homes they were funding were illegal. The government is shutting down unregistered homes to try and improve oversight of children's care in the country. Some of the homes on the closure list also had volunteers visit from the UK. On a muggy morning in December BBC Radio 4's File on 4 travelled to an area of south-west Uganda called Masaka to record the closure of one illegal home. It was sponsored by donors through Patrick Oldham, a builder from Hyde, in Greater Manchester. Mr Oldham lives part of the year in Uganda, going to the home and introducing the children to visiting volunteers.  He uses social media to give updates and attract sponsorship. Inside, 25 children who had UK sponsors were living in squalid conditions. The open pit latrine toilets were flooding and there was no running water. One boy had been circumcised and was living with an untreated, painful infection. Many of the other children also had skin infections which they say weren't being treated. Following the raid all the children were returned to their families. A government social worker, Maria Nagawa, said conditions there were the worst she had ever seen. Social workers found tools, including an axe, lying of the floor of the orphanage In Masaka, the BBC also met a woman called Laetitia - not her real name - who is a mother of six children. After her husband died, she was struggling to raise money for her children's school fees when she was approached by a woman working for the orphanage in 2016. Laetitia was persuaded to send her two youngest boys, then aged 7 and 5, to the home, where she was promised they would be given a top education. Last spring, the boys were returned home by social workers who were concerned about their living conditions. The eldest of the pair, now aged 9, told the BBC how his brother was beaten if he wet his bed. ""Whenever I tried to go and help him out, they would also beat me,"" he added. Both boys said beatings were common at the home and that they even saw female members of staff melting plastic bags and using them to burn the children. Laeticia says her eldest son also contracted typhoid from dirty drinking water at the orphanage. A government social worker said conditions there were the worst she had seen A Facebook group for the home, regularly updated with posts by Mr Oldham is called ""Rock of Joy children's care"". The BBC investigation found that money was fraudulently raised for the home using the credentials of a charity with a similar name - The Rock of Joy Trust, also based in the North West. The charity also operates in Uganda. The founders of the genuine Rock of Joy Trust said the fact their name was being used in connection to the illegal orphanage was appalling and extremely upsetting. A response on behalf of Mr Oldham said: ""Any personal allegations are refuted, we are considering the possibility of legal action. ""It is our understanding that some children remain and it is paramount that we both protect and secure their future."" An open pit latrine toilet flooded the floor outside the building The permanent secretary of the Ugandan ministry responsible for children Pius Bigirimana warned UK donors against giving money to orphanages without official checks. He said: ""If you are interested in supporting these children, don't just go put money into a home which is unlisted. ""Why don't you assist the family to look after the children instead of looking at an institution?"" The UK charity Hope and Homes for Children is assisting the Ugandan government in its work to keep children in their families, rather than living in institutions. Its chief executive, Mark Waddington said the number of children living in orphanages in Uganda had grown from just under 2,000 in the 1990's to more than 55,000. He said orphanages were now seen as ""an economy"". ""We are seeing children being conned out of households, with their parents being persuaded under the offer of a Western style education,"" he said. ""They are used literally as commodities to raise funding."" Listen to the full File on 4 report, called The Orphanage Business,here.

"Shoreham crash pilot 'known risk-taker'Andy Hill's ""negligence"" led him to crash, causing a ""massive fireball"" which killed 11, a jury hears.Sussex","Andy Hill is accused of killing 11 men A ""devastating"" plane crash at the Shoreham Airshow which killed 11 men was caused by the pilot's ""serious negligence"", a court has heard. Jurors were told Andy Hill's Hawker Hunter jet ""disintegrated"" upon impact, creating a ""massive fireball"" when it hit the ground in August 2015. The vintage aircraft was in ""excellent working order"", the Old Bailey heard, and ""pilot error"" was purely to blame. Mr Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. Tom Kark QC, prosecuting, told jurors the defendant was an experienced pilot but had been known to take risks, and a previous air show display had been halted due to his ""dangerous"" flying. Mr Hill, a British Airways captain at the time, had been performing a manoeuvre at Shoreham known as a bent loop before his jet crashed into the A27 in West Sussex, the court heard. Holding up a scale model of the Hawker Hunter, Mr Kark told jurors it had ascended to about 2,800ft (850m) when Mr Hill attempted the stunt. The jet was ""too low, probably by as much as a 1,000ft below the height required"" at the top of the loop, the court heard. ""Mr Hill should not have started his descent"", Mr Kark said, but ""nevertheless continued the manoeuvre"". The jury was shown footage of the jet disappearing behind a row of trees, before it ""disintegrated and...caused a massive fireball"". Spectator David Miles, who was standing on the ""busy"" road, ""watched as the aircraft descended down onto the road and exploded,"" the court heard. ""He heard a bang and started running as fast as he could away from the crash, aware of course that wreckage would be coming his way,"" Mr Kark said. ""He felt an enormous heat and fell to the floor. People that he had been standing next to had simply disappeared and the motorbikes he had noticed earlier were now just burning wreckage."" Ten of the victims died instantaneously, the court heard, while the death of eleventh victim Maurice Abrahams would have been ""rapid"" once his car was engulfed in flames. Two other vehicles were ""completely destroyed"" along with their occupants, Mr Kark said. The jury was told Mr Hill ""miraculously escaped"" when the aircraft broke up and he was thrown into a ditch. At the scene, he was able to give his name as ""Andy"" but was otherwise ""incoherent"", Mr Kark said. He suffered head injuries and rib fractures and has made a full recovery, the court heard. Mr Hill has been repeatedly interviewed by police since the crash, making no comment each time, Mr Kark said. On 1 June 2017, he provided officers with a 10-page statement which said he had no recollection of the crash and believed G-Force pressures may have contributed, Mr Kark said. However, the prosecution said Mr Hill would have experienced ""nothing unusual"" for an experienced pilot, and witness testimony would discount the possibility of G-Force being a factor in the crash. ""In other words he did not lose consciousness in that aircraft"", Mr Kark said. Pilot Andy Hill survived the Hawker Hunter jet crash Mr Hill, from Sandon, Hertfordshire, had served in the RAF between 1985 and 1994 before becoming a commercial pilot, the court heard. The trial would hear from witnesses likely to describe him as ""highly competent and experienced,"" Mr Kark said. However, ""there have also been times when he has taken risks or flown in a way one would not expect a careful and competent fast jet display pilot to do"", he told the court. During a practice display at Duxford in Cambridgeshire in 2014 Mr Hill had flown over the M11 at about 200ft, well below the 500ft minimum, Mr Kark said. ""Mr Hill, in short, was playing fast and loose with the rules which are designed to keep people safe from aircraft performing aerobatic manoeuvres."" Mr Kark said such incidents had demonstrated a ""more cavalier attitude to safety than was appropriate"". The prosecutor said a display by Mr Hill at the 2014 Southport Air Show was halted when he ""performed a dangerous manoeuvre"" which ""took him far too close to the crowd"". Mr Kark said the event's flight director took the ""rare"" step after a ""stop, stop, stop"" call was issued. ""It ought to have been a red light warning to him to plan his displays with great care."" ""Unfortunately, on this occasion in 2015 at Shoreham, no-one had time to call out a 'stop' and his display ended in tragedy. ""The prosecution case is that it was Mr Hill's serious negligence that led directly to the loss of those eleven lives,"" he added. Of the 11 men who died, five were in vehicles and six were spectators. The trial is expected to last up to seven weeks.

Opponents of the withdrawal stressed that although IS now controlled only 1% of the territory they overran five years ago, the group had not disappeared entirely. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has previously criticised Mr Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria, said on Wednesday that the move could encourage IS attacks and ""set in motion enthusiasm by the enemy we're fighting"". Later,US Vice-President Mike Pence said he and President Trump condemned the attack in Syria,externalbut reiterated that the withdrawal plan would continue.

"Housing market outlook worst 'for 20 years'House sale expectations for the next three months are at their lowest for two decades, estate agents warn.Business","The housing market outlook over the next three months is the worst for 20 years, surveyors say. A net balance of 28% of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members expect sales to fall in the next three months. It's the most downbeat reading since records started in October 1998 and the pessimism is blamed on the lack of clarity around Brexit. Lack of supply and affordability also continued to affect the market. Sales expectations for the next three months are now either flat, with no change predicted, or negative, indicating falling sales, across all parts of the UK,the report said.,external Increasing numbers of surveyors reported seeing house prices fall rather than increase in December, with a net balance of 19% seeing falls rather than rises. That was up from a balance of 11% in November and marked the fourth month in a row of negative house price readings. New buyer inquiries fell for the fifth month in a row in December. The drop-off in interest from buyers was matched by a decline in fresh properties coming on to the market. Brexit uncertainty hits house purchases Where can I afford to live? Where does rent hit young people the hardest? The supply of new properties has been dwindling for six months, said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist. ""It is hardly a surprise with ongoing uncertainty about the path to Brexit dominating the news agenda, that even allowing for the normal patterns around the Christmas holidays, buyer interest in purchasing property in December was subdued. ""This is also very clearly reflected in a worsening trend in near-term sales expectations."" ""We experienced a slowing down in the local property market from last summer onwards with a lot of it down to the Brexit unknowns,"" said estate agent David Knights of David Brown & Co of Ipswich. ""Uncertainty causes people to sit on their hands."" He says that activity in November and December is generally about 50% of that seen during the rest of the year, but that the last two months of 2018 ""were noticeably more quiet"" because of that uncertainty. In the short-term, over the next three to four months, he expects the property market to continue to be subdued. ""When buyers don't know what's going to happen you can understand them being careful about how much they're prepared to offer."" But he remains positive about the property market over the slightly longer term. ""We're not going to see an instant rebound once Brexit is out of the way, but I think we'll see progression over the year,"" he said. ""There are really no signs that we are going have similar problems that we experienced in 2007 and 2008."" The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry published earlier in the week suggested housing activity was muted because of Brexit uncertainty. It said the average UK house price was Â£230,630 in October, falling by 0.1% month-on-month. Looking further ahead, estate agents are a little more hopeful of their sales expectations for 12 months' time. ""Looking a little further out, there is some comfort provided by the suggestion that transactions nationally should stabilise as some of the fog lifts, but that moment feels a way off for many respondents to the survey,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. ""Meanwhile, it is hard to see developers stepping up the supply pipeline in this environment."" He said that to get near to government building targets would ""require significantly greater input from other delivery channels, including local authorities"".

This is because they are already operating in markets where there are already high tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules and also where there is a lot of international competition. Taking cars as an example, tariffs here can be as high as 25% for component parts, and 10% for finished cars under WTO rules, she said. ""If we chose to set a zero tariff  on those components and finished cars for import into the UK then you would see competition for our plants in Sunderland and similar would be increased"". BBC News Channel Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says he had ""constructive talks"" with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove and the prime minister's chief of staff Gavin Barwell. He says he raised the need for the prime minister to take no deal off the table, as well as discussing his preferred option of a Norway-style agreement, which would see a close relationship with the European Union. He told BBC News: âItâs time for all parties to come together in the national
interest."" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has rejected government claims that it would take more than a year to organise another referendum. The Conservative MP, who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""The timetable put forward by the government is simply wrong and they must be aware of it themselves."" He says another referendum could be carried out ""swiftly and within a limited extension of Article 50"".

Find out who has been involved in talks from ourtimeline. The prime minister has written to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to say his call for a no deal Brexit to be ruled out before he meets her is an ""impossible condition"". Theresa May says it is ""not within the government's power"" to rule out a no deal. However, she says her ""door remains open"" and she would be ""happy to discuss"" Mr Corbyn's own proposals on Brexit.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has criticised a tweet from a Guardian columnist which references calculations that the Leave vote has been declining - in part due to older Leave supporters dying. Polly Toynbee was tweeting about her column, which discusses estimates that the Leave vote has been shrinking by about 1,350 a day. Mr Javid retweeted her along with the comment: ""How utterly disrespectful"". The calculation, conducted on behalf of the People's Vote campaign, takes into account the number of mainly Leave voters who have died, and mainly Remain voters who have reached voting age. The survey predicted that - assuming no voters changed their mind - demographic factors alone were causing the Leave majority to shrink by almost half a million a year. The Scottish government's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said planning for Brexit has been a ""game-changer"" for the country's police force. More officers will be recruited this year ""to ensure capacity and resilience is in place to prepare against a range of contingencies associated with Brexit"". Mr Yousaf was speaking about budget plans at the justice sub-committee on policing at Holyrood. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister will not attend the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos next week. Downing Street said ""sheâll be focused on matters here"". Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The government has produced ""a very short
paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold
another referendum, Downing Street has said. This was ""produced to inform the expected discussion"" with the MPs who have been to see the PM and other ministers. A government source told me it suggests ""in excess of a
year"" would be needed before another referendum. The document was a single side
of A4 paper and it wonât be published. It doesnât, I understand, include a
discussion of the question. A spokesman for the International Monetary Fund - the organisation made up of 189 countries and which strives for global financial stability - has said Brexit without a deal is the ""most significant near-term risk to the UK economy"". According to Reuters, spokesman Gerry Rice said all Brexit outcomes will entail costs. BBC's political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sky News reporter Aubrey Allegretti has tweeted a letter from Jeremy Corbyn, in which the Labour leader urges MPs not to contact the government until the no-deal option is taken off the table. Mr Corbyn said he personally would not meet with Mrs May to talk about the future of Brexit until she ruled out the prospect of a ""disastrous"" no-deal exit. In his letter, he wrote: ""The Prime Minister has offered to open talks with Opposition Parties, however, I have been absolutely clear that any starting point for talks about breaking the Brexit deadlock must be on the provision that the threat of a disastrous 'no deal' outcome is ruled out."" He goes on to write: ""I urge colleagues to respect that condition and refrain from engagement with the government until 'no deal' is taken off the table."" Earlier today Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit select committee, went to speak to the government. Allow Twitter content?

Here's a handy reminder of the different options being explored around Westminster: Failing that, here'sa simple guide to the UK leaving the EU. The Republic of Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said a no-deal Brexit would have to become ""an exercise in damage limitation"". Speaking in the Irish parliament, Simon Coveney said: ""It would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors, which is currently facilitated by our common EU membership."" Mr Coveney said the EU would continue to seek to be as helpful as possible but that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation. ""The backstop is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he added. ""It acts as an insurance policy, to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit. It is essential."" Tory MP John Whittingdale says he and other senior MPs have had a ""constructive meeting"" with Theresa May - adding that he feels optimistic a deal that appeals to Conservatives and the DUP can be reached.

Norman SmithAssistant political editor Senior Tory MP Nick Boles is seeking to secure parliamentary backing for a bill that would force the government to delay Article 50. The measure would kick in if Mrs May was unable to get a Brexit deal through the Commons by the end of February. Mr Boles said he believed a number of Cabinet ministers  - including the chancellor - support his plan. He also said ministers outside the Cabinet had told him they would resign if forced to oppose the measure. Mr Boles has decided to drop his previous plan to give the Liaison Committee the power to introduce a new draft bill after it was widely criticised by members of the committee. It's thought Mr Boles' proposal - if accepted by the speaker - would be voted on ahead of Mrs May's statement to MPs on her Brexit plans on 29 January. Mr Boles made his comments in an interview with the Political Thinking podcast - published tomorrow. Â© 2025 BBC.
