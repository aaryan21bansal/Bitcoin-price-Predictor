Government to speed up UK climate change target,"Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced. Hitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy. For the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping. But Labour said the government had to match ""rhetoric with reality"". It urged Boris Johnson to treat ""the climate emergency as the emergency it is"" and show ""greater ambition"". The prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position. Homes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers. China and US pledge climate change commitment Have these seven green targets been met? World's wealthiest 'at heart of climate problem' Tax fliers and get rid of SUVs, government told Covid-19 paused climate emissions â but they're rising again The government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) haspredicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. The UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC. Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets. And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded. Tom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: ""The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,"" he said. However, he told the BBC's Today programme: ""At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time."" Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement ""fantastic"", but added: ""We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing."" Mr Murray said ministers were ""facing both directions at the same time"", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were ""still pushing a Â£27bn roads budget"". The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to Â£50bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs. The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years. Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: ""The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years. ""If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action."" Ed Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: ""Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own."" He added: ""The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action."" Net zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery. ""So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality."" He added: ""We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: ""The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable. ""The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.""

"Killer 'accused author of Russia Covid-19 plot'Children's author James Nash was shot by his neighbour who thought he was a spy, an inquest hears.Hampshire & Isle of Wight","James Nash was described as a ""kind-hearted individual and a proactive parish councillor"" A man with a long history of mental illness shot a children's author after becoming wrongly convinced he was part of a Russian plot to spread Covid-19, an inquest has heard. James Nash, 42, was attacked in his garden in Upper Enham, Hampshire, on 5 August and died three days later. The gunman, Alex Sartain, died in a motorbike crash while being pursued by police on the same day. The coroner recorded a conclusion that Mr Nash was unlawfully killed. Mr Nash wrote and illustrated children's books, including The Winter Wild. Hampshire Coroner's Court was told Mr Sartain's mental health problems dated back to 2008 and his father had tried to raise concerns with a GP in June last year but ""only got as far as the receptionist"". Alex Sartain used a homemade shotgun during the attack John Sartain said his son had become paranoid that Mr Nash, his next-door neighbour, was trying to control him. The inquest was told Mr Sartain, 34, had been heard ""muttering"" in the days before the attack about Mr Nash working for Russian president Vladimir Putin and being involved in a conspiracy to ""spread Covid"". The hearing was told that Mr Sartain also believed he was being tracked by the ""CIA, MI6 and SO19"". On the day of the attack, Mr Nash was working in his front garden when raised voices were heard by his wife Sarah Nash - who had been on a video call indoors - followed by a bang. ""As soon as I opened the front door I could see a man in full black leathers stamping on the face of my husband who was flat out on his back,"" Mrs Nash said. The author had managed to deflect the gunshot with his hand but died from head injuries, the inquest heard. Parts of Upper Enham were cordoned off following the shooting Mr Sartain had previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was under the care of a community mental health team until April last year, it was heard. Coroner Jason Pegg said a letter discharging him into the care of a GP was sent by the community mental health team to the Adelaide Medical Centre in Andover. ""That discharge letter... was never seen by the GP. Instead the letter was received by the administration staff at the practice and never passed on as perhaps it should have been,"" he added. The coroner added that it ""cannot be ascertained"" whether Mr Sartain would have been detained in June if his father's concerns had been passed on by the GP's receptionist. He said he would not be taking the matter further as a new partnership was now running the surgery and practices had changed. An inquest into the death of Mr Sartain will be held on Wednesday.

"Any six people can meet outdoors in Wales on SaturdayUp to six people from any household can meet outdoors from this weekend, the Welsh government says.Wales politics","Up to six people from any household will be able to meet outdoors Six people from six households will be able to meet outdoors in Wales from Saturday. The easing of the lockdown rules also mean that from next week pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to re-open to serve customers al-fresco. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was guided by the fact there is lower risk of catching Covid outdoors. It comes after the Welsh government announcedgyms could reopenearlier than previously planned. Currently, up to six people from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet outdoors, although children under the age of 11 or carers do not count in the total. The new rule means any six people can meet outdoors, with children under 11 and carers exempt from the rule. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Opening pubs too soon 'may undo all the good' How many have had a Covid vaccine in Wales? It brings Wales roughly in line with England and Scotland, although England does not allow an exemption for children. Mr Drakeford said: ""Because meeting outdoors continues to be lower risk than meeting indoors, we are able to bring forward changes to allow any six people to meet outdoors. ""This will provide more opportunities for people, especially young people, to meet outdoors with their friends. This will undoubtedly have a significant positive impact on people's well-being."" Kelly Jolliffe, landlady of the Greyhound Inn, said her phone has been ""ringing off the hook"" with booking requests Kelly Jolliffe, landlady of the Greyhound Inn and Hotel in Usk, said she was ""very excited"" to re-open, adding she can seat 160 people in her beer garden. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Ms Jolliffe said: ""We don't make masses of profit, but it's about getting people back in here. ""Getting the team kind of match fit, if you like, ready to be able to open indoors as well, because it takes probably four to six weeks to get us all back up and running properly."" She said the phone had been ""ringing off the hook"" with customers wanting to make bookings. ""People have just been so supportive and also they're being flexible. What's fabulous is they're phoning and saying, 'Whenever you can fit us in. We know you're going to be busy, so it doesn't have to be a certain time, doesn't have to be a certain table, just fit us in when it suits you'."" David Morgan, landlord of the Cross Inn in Maesteg, said that while the new rules were a positive move, but he still had concerns. He said: ""Everything's still vague. We know six people can meet outside -- we found that on Wales Online this morning and the pubs are definitely opening. ""What about the other regulations? Do we still do track and trace? We know nothing and we won't find out anything until Thursday. ""I've been phoning my main suppliers and the rep there, she's been giving me all of the information. There's other independent brewers I've been picking stuff up off. We've had very little from the government and the council. ""We're apprehensive. It all depends on if people come out, when they come out, how they're going to react to coming out because they've been taught how to drink in the house with cheap booze."" Earlier this month, Mr Drakeford announced gyms would reopenearlier than planned- on 3 May instead of 10 May. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the move should have happened ""weeks ago and would've happened in the Welsh Conservative roadmap out of lockdown"". ""Labour's insistence on playing politics, rather than following the science, has tragically left Wales with the longest lockdown, worst economic impact and highest death rate in the UK,"" he said. Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: ""This is obviously good news for the hospitality sector which has been so hard hit by Covid, especially during this current lockdown. ""I want the Welsh government to ensure that financial support remains for those bars and restaurants who do not have outdoor seating and am calling for support to be given to those businesses who are only able to partially open."" Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth added: ""This confirmation will be welcome news for some businesses, but many rely on indoor hospitality for their financial viability. ""With favourable prevailing conditions, indoor hospitality should be allowed to reopen on May 17th to put the spring back in the step of Welsh business."" Welsh Labour said it had nothing to add to the Welsh government statement. Wales' Covid case rate has been the lowest of the UK nations since 26 January. It currently stands at 15.9 cases per 100,000. Only 1.7% of Covid tests now result in a positive result - the lowest in Wales since 3 September. The number of ""active"" Covid patients in hospital on Sunday, 105, is also the lowest since the pandemic began, while numbers in critical care with Covid are in single figures for the first time since early September.

Tesco fined Â£7.56m for selling out-of-date food,"The supermarket giant was given the penalty at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday Tesco has been fined Â£7.56m for selling out-of-date food at three stores in Birmingham. Offending items were found at two Tesco Express stores, in the city centre and Bournville, and a Tesco Metro in Bristol Road South. The fine was handed down after Tesco Stores Ltd admitted 22 breaches of the Food Safety and Hygiene Regulations, which happened between 2016 and 2017. Tesco said it took ""immediate action"" to rectify problems. The grocery company was given the penalty at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday and further ordered to pay prosecution costs of Â£95,500, the city council said. The prosecution by its environmental health department came after complaints were received by the local authority about food being sold past its use-by date, triggering an investigation. Food inspectors visited three of the company's food retail premises in Birmingham Food inspectors visited three of the company's city food retail premises. The Tesco Metro in Bristol Road South has since been re-branded under Tesco's discount chain, Jack's. Date-checking for the firm is now externally approved by Hertfordshire County Council because the company's Welwyn Garden City head office is located in that local authority's area. Latest news from the West Midlands A Tesco spokesman said: ""We're disappointed that a small number of out-of-date products were found on sale in three stores in 2016/17. ""The safety of our customers is always our priority and these incidents are not representative of the high standards of safety and quality we expect in Tesco stores. ""We took immediate action to address this at the time and we want to reassure our customers that we have robust procedures in place to make sure that this doesn't happen."" The grocery company was also ordered to pay a Â£170 victim surcharge. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Mr Nash wrote and illustrated children's books, including The Winter Wild. Hampshire Coroner's Court was told Mr Sartain's mental health problems dated back to 2008 and his father had tried to raise concerns with a GP in June last year but ""only got as far as the receptionist"". Alex Sartain used a homemade shotgun during the attack John Sartain said his son had become paranoid that Mr Nash, his next-door neighbour, was trying to control him. The inquest was told Mr Sartain, 34, had been heard ""muttering"" in the days before the attack about Mr Nash working for Russian president Vladimir Putin and being involved in a conspiracy to ""spread Covid"". The hearing was told that Mr Sartain also believed he was being tracked by the ""CIA, MI6 and SO19"". On the day of the attack, Mr Nash was working in his front garden when raised voices were heard by his wife Sarah Nash - who had been on a video call indoors - followed by a bang. ""As soon as I opened the front door I could see a man in full black leathers stamping on the face of my husband who was flat out on his back,"" Mrs Nash said. The author had managed to deflect the gunshot with his hand but died from head injuries, the inquest heard. Parts of Upper Enham were cordoned off following the shooting Mr Sartain had previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was under the care of a community mental health team until April last year, it was heard. Coroner Jason Pegg said a letter discharging him into the care of a GP was sent by the community mental health team to the Adelaide Medical Centre in Andover. ""That discharge letter... was never seen by the GP. Instead the letter was received by the administration staff at the practice and never passed on as perhaps it should have been,"" he added. The coroner added that it ""cannot be ascertained"" whether Mr Sartain would have been detained in June if his father's concerns had been passed on by the GP's receptionist. He said he would not be taking the matter further as a new partnership was now running the surgery and practices had changed. An inquest into the death of Mr Sartain will be held on Wednesday.

Government to speed up UK climate change targetBoris Johnson says carbon emissions must fall by 78% by 2035 - 15 years earlier than previously planned.UK Politics,"Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced. Hitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy. For the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping. But Labour said the government had to match ""rhetoric with reality"". It urged Boris Johnson to treat ""the climate emergency as the emergency it is"" and show ""greater ambition"". The prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position. Homes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers. China and US pledge climate change commitment Have these seven green targets been met? World's wealthiest 'at heart of climate problem' Tax fliers and get rid of SUVs, government told Covid-19 paused climate emissions â but they're rising again The government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) haspredicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. The UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC. Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets. And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded. Tom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: ""The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,"" he said. However, he told the BBC's Today programme: ""At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time."" Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement ""fantastic"", but added: ""We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing."" Mr Murray said ministers were ""facing both directions at the same time"", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were ""still pushing a Â£27bn roads budget"". The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to Â£50bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs. The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years. Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: ""The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years. ""If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action."" Ed Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: ""Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own."" He added: ""The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action."" Net zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery. ""So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality."" He added: ""We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: ""The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable. ""The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.""

Ministers to do 'everything' to block new league,"This video can not be played 'Football is meant to be on merit' - fans react to European Super League proposals The government has said it will do ""whatever it takes"" to prevent a breakaway European Super League involving six leading English clubs. Boris Johnson said ministers would be working to make sure the league did not go ahead in the way being proposed. The Duke of Cambridge also said he shared fans' concerns about ""the damage it risks causing to the game we love"". But the president of Real Madrid told a Spanish TV show: ""We are doing this to save football at this critical moment."" Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid, said the decision to create the new league was in part taken because ""young people are no longer interested"" in the game. Speaking for the first time since the league was announced, Mr Perez said: ""Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt."" The 12 founding members of the league, which includes Real Madrid plus three yet to join - would be permanent and never face relegation. Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan. The competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition. Matches would take place midweek and rival the existing Champions League. But the president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, warnedplayers who play for teams in the ESL would be ""banned from the World Cup and the Euros"". European Super League Q&A - what happens next? Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league? I'm disappointed and disgusted - Danny Murphy As opposition to the plans gathered momentum, Prince William, President of the Football Association, said in a tweet: ""Now, more than ever, we must protect the entire football community - from the top level to the grassroots - and the values of competition and fairness at its core."" And broadcaster Sky Sports said: ""We have not been involved in any discussions with the proposed breakaway European Super League."" ""We are completely focused on supporting our long term football partners in the UK and in Europe, already providing fans with the best live action from the best football competitions in the world,"" the company added. This video can not be played ""We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game"" â Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden In a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden criticised the so-called ""big six"" English clubs for going ""against the very spirit of the game"". He added club owners ""should remember that they are only temporary custodians of these clubs and that they forget fans at their peril"". Mr Dowden said he had spoken to Uefa and the Football Association, who both oppose the move by the 12 clubs, adding that, ""if they can't act, we will"". ""We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening,"" he told MPs. ""We are examining every option from governance reform to competition law and mechanisms that allow football to take place. ""We will be reviewing everything Government does to support these clubs to play. We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game."" A fan-led review, due to take place after the pandemic, has been brought forward because of the ESL announcement, Mr Dowden said. It will be led by former sports minister Tracey Crouch and consider how fans can have an even greater say in the oversight of the game. The review will also look at the finances of the men's and women's game, its governance and whether an independent football regulator should be set up. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Super League ""not good for football"" Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was ""going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this (plan) doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed"". Downing Street said ministers were looking at a ""range of options"", including a German-style system of fan ownership of clubs and clawing back coronavirus support loans. But Labour urged ministers to do more, with shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens saying it was ""time for the government to get off the subs bench and show some leadership on the pitch because we need reform of football"". She added: ""It's not as if there's been a blockage here in Parliament preventing the government from taking action to sort the problems out."" About 700 fans gathered outside the ground and then dispersed before kick-off Fans and pundits have expressed revulsion at what they claim would be an unfair competition that would lock many teams out of top European football. Match of the Day host and former England footballer Gary Lineker said it was ""a time of great concern"", adding that if the ESL went ahead as planned, it would have ""massive ramifications"" on the domestic game. ""It will wreck the pyramid system (of leagues, promotion and relegation) that has been so important to local football clubs, communities and teams, and it takes out the competition."" Around 68% of football fans strongly oppose the creation of the ESL, while only 14% support it,according to a YouGov survey of 1,730 fans,external. Some 700 football supporters gathered outside Leeds United's Elland Road groundahead of the club's Premier League game against Liverpool to protest against the proposed new league. A Liverpool shirt was burned and a plane flew over the stadium displaying an anti-Super League message. Inside the stadium Leeds players wore T-shirts saying 'Earn it' next to the Champions League logo and 'Football is for the fans'. A banner behind one goal had the same message. This video can not be played Manchester United fan Natalie Burrell said she was 'disgusted' by the plans Launching their plan, the 12 founding members of the ESL said the pandemic had ""accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model"". They said there was a ""need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid"". BBC's Sports Editor Dan Roan said leading figures were insisting the Super League would generate much more money, not just for the clubs involved, but for the rest of the ""football family"". He added they seemed ""very confident"" they were on a strong legal footing when it came to blocking any punishments threatened by bodies such as Uefa. Earlier, Manchester United's shares rose within minutes of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where they are traded. Fifteen minutes after the trading day began, they were up around 8.5%. Meanwhile, Juventus's share price jumped by more than 14% on Monday morning. But Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp hassaid he remained opposed to the idea of the league- despite his club agreeing to join it. ""I like the competitive aspect of football. I like that West Ham might play in the Champions League,"" he said, adding that he and his players did not know about the move before it happened.

Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league?,"Plans for a new football European Super League (ESL) have collapsed, following the withdrawal of most of the teams involved. The decision follows a massive backlash against the league, which had the support of some of the world's biggest clubs. Six English Premier League teams had signed up to the ESL - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. They joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid as founder members. The idea was for the clubs to remain in their national leagues, but also to play each other in a new midweek European competition, which would have rivalled the Champions League. The ESL would have had 20 teams, of which 15 founding members would be permanent and never face relegation. Five other sides would qualify each year. All six English Premier League clubs dropped out of the project on Tuesday night. They have now been followed by Atletico Madrid in Spain and Italian team Inter Milan. One of the chief movers behind the ESL, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, has now admitted that the ESL is not likely to go ahead. ""I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,"" he said. ""But evidently no, I don't think that project is now still up and running."" ESL 'cannot now proceed' How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded With 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics said it would have devalued the game because it was unfair and uncompetitive. For instance, Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League since the 2016-17 season, but they would have been guaranteed a place - regardless of how they performed in the domestic league. However, a future winner of the Premier League would not necessarily have qualified for the ESL if they were not a permanent member. If this were the case, that team would miss out on millions of pounds in revenue. The ESL attracted widespread criticism from pundits, players, MPs and most football bodies not involved. Fans of the clubs involved held several protests outside their grounds. Chelsea fans protest against plans for a European Super League ahead of the club's game against Brighton It appears they were taken aback by the strength of criticism. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to supporters and the ""wider football community"". Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the ""anxiety and upset"" caused by the proposal. Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders,"" in making their decision. Real Madrid president Florentino Perezhad claimed it would ""save football"", at a time when young people are ""no longer interested"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". The founding clubs were promised a share of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan. Most are in considerable debt,made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators. Big clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries. If they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses. Super League makes financial sense for top clubs The 20-team league would have been split into two groups of 10, playing each other at home and away. The top three in each group would have qualified for the quarter-finals, with the fourth and fifth-placed teams competing in a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. It would then have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May. The president of Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations), Aleksander Ceferin, had warned that participating clubs could be banned from European competition, and their players prevented from appearing at the Euros and the World Cup. Mr Ceferin welcomed the English clubs' reversal, saying, ""the important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this, and move forward together"".

Why was India not already on the red list?,"Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's Home Affairs Committee, has criticised the delay in putting India on the government's travel-ban ""red list"". ""They should have put India on the red list at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since then, we've had this three-week period in which thousands of people have returned from India and that probably includes hundreds of the new variant Covid cases,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. India was added to the red list on 23 April, but neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh had been on it since 9 April. One of the variants of coronavirus first identified in India has spread to the UK. Just under half of these cases involve international travel and the strain has now been designated a ""variant of concern"". What is the India Covid variant? The red list is the government'slist of 43 countries,externalfrom which there are strict restrictions on travel to England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have similar rules in place with the same list of countries. The restrictions are designed to protect the UK from new variants, against which vaccines may be less effective and which may spread more easily. Which countries are on the red list? What are the Indian, Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? India red list add 'may be too late', Prof Mark Walport says Travel to England is banned for anyone who has been in one of the countries in the past 10 days, except for UK citizens and residents, who have to isolate on arrival at government-approved hotels. Direct flights are banned from most red list countries, but not Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya and India. The government says this is to allow critical freight and make it easier for British nationals to return home. The decision is based on Joint Biosecurity Centre risk assessments, which include: how good a country's testing structures are, including checking for variants how many cases those systems have identified whether people in that country have been catching new variants at home or the cases have come from overseas evidence of whether that country has exported cases of new variants to other countries, including to the UK how good the country's travel links with the UK are The first point is important, because the genome sequencing needed to identify new variants is very sophisticated and relatively rare. But just because a country has found variants of concern, or has many cases of coronavirus, it will not necessarily be on the red list. On 18 May,external, the World Health Organization identified: 106 countries where the variant identified in South Africa had been found, of which 28 are on the red list 61 countries with the variant identified in Brazil, of which 19 are on the red list 48 countries with the variant identified in India, of which 6 are on the red list. Bangladesh had the South Africa but not the Brazil variant and Pakistan had neither when they were added to the red list on 9 April. India had both, as well as a new variant, but was not added for another two weeks. On 9 April: Pakistan had a seven-day average of 21 cases per million people Bangladesh had twice as many India had four times as many Health Secretary Matt Hancock said these figures depended on how much testing was being done and said ""far more"" was carried out in India. He said the decision to add Pakistan and Bangladesh earlier was based on a higher proportion of people arriving in the UK from these countries, testing positive for coronavirus. ""When we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India,"" Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May. Figures from NHS Test and Trace,externaldo not support that claim. For the period 25 March to 7 April, the positivity rate from Bangladesh was 3.7%, from India was 5.1% and from Pakistan was 6.2%. Mr Hancock was asked about this in Parliament on 19 May and said: ""The positivity rate in India, on which the decision to put Pakistan but not India on the red list was 1.6% in India and 4.6% in Pakistan, which is three times higher, as I said."" But those are not published figures. He didn't give the date for them and didn't mention Bangladesh this time. Checking Matt Hancock's claim about Covid cases from India ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said. Boris Johnson had planned a trade visit to India but cancelled iton 19 April- days before the country was added to the red list. One of the variants first identified in India was designated as a variant of concern on 7 May. By 17 May, 2,323 cases of this variant had been found in the UK, of which 483 had been in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. The WHO said,externalit appeared to have a higher rate of transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines may be less effective against it. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cited fears of the India variant on 14 May as one of the reasons why Glasgow and Moray willnot have restrictions eased as planned. In the four weeks before India was added to the red list, 6,560 people were tested on arrival in England from India. Of those, 425 tested positive for coronavirus, which is about 6%. The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according toa 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Almost 60% of positive Covid19 tests are now sent for genome sequencing to identify new variants, which means the government has a good idea of where the cases are. Asked about the delays in adding India to the red list, the UK's former chief scientific adviser Prof Mark Walport told the BBC: ""These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth.""

Klopp remains against Super League,"This video can not be played Players not to blame for Super League - Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp Jurgen Klopp is determined to remain Liverpool boss and ""help sort it"" after reiterating his opposition to the European Super League. The Reds are one of 12 clubs toagree to join the breakaway competition. In 2019 Klopp saidhe hoped there would never be a Super League,externaland before the1-1 Premier League draw with Leedshe confirmed his opinion had not changed. ""I heard I will resign. If times get tough it makes me even more sticky that I will stay,"" he said after the game. Super League created to save football, says Real president Perez Monday Night Club on the European Super League Reds vice-captain James Milner was even more critical of the new tournament - which has threatened to cause a schism in football. ""I don't like it one bit and hopefully it doesn't happen,"" he told BBC Sport. ""It [the current system] has worked well for a long time. What has made it special, what we have done over the last few years, is we have earned the right to win the Champions League and the Premier League. The product we have currently is very good. ""It is difficult. Coming into the game today Leeds fans were making their feelings shown. As players we don't really have a say so it feels a bit unjust."" Former England captain Alan Shearer said it was unfair for Klopp to have to address the ESL and end up in an awkward situation. ""He doesn't want what his owners want and that is a really powerful voice,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""Where are these owners? Why don't they come out and tell us why they want a closed shop that no-one else can get into?"" This video can not be played Liverpool midfielder James Milner speaks against club's involvement in Super League Leeds players wore T-shirts saying 'Earn it' next to the Champions League logo and 'Football is for the fans' and left the shirts in Liverpool's dressing room in case they wanted to join the protest. That angered Klopp. ""We were not involved in the process,"" he said after the game. ""We are the team, we wear the shirts with pride. Somebody has made a decision with the owners in world football that we don't know exactly why. ""We are here, we are the face of the club and arrived here and Leeds fans shouted at us as though we made the decision but we didn't. ""Gary Neville was talking about 'You'll Never Walk Alone'. This already should be forbidden. It's our anthem. We have the right to sing our anthem. He doesn't understand it anyway so I don't want this because it's not fair. ""I don't like this [Super League] either, but I don't talk about the other clubs... Leeds players wore T-shirts opposed to the Super League ""I wish Gary Neville would be in a hot seat somewhere and not where the most money is. ""He was at Manchester United where the most money was and now he's at Sky where the most money is. Don't forget that we have nothing to do with this. We are in the same situation like you all. We got the information yesterday and we still have to play football. ""'Damn them to hell?' Did he write that today? These things are really not OK."" European Super League Q&A - What happens next? 'Bonfire of greed' - How Europe has reacted Ministers will do 'whatever it takes' to block breakaway Neville responded by arguing that he and Klopp were actually in agreement, but defended his own comments. ""I've handed out enough insults over the years to Liverpool, but yesterday was nothing to do with insulting Liverpool,"" he said. ""I don't know why I'm living in his head. I don't know what's spiked him. ""Yesterday was an impassioned plea from me about protecting football in this country. ""My biggest disappointment was with Manchester United and Liverpool. I think I've equally distributed enough criticism to both clubs in the last 24 hours so I don't know what the problem is."" This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" Fans of several clubs protested outside Elland Road- including burning a Liverpool shirt - while Reds fans displayed banners opposing the move at Anfield. A plane flew over Leeds' ground saying 'No to Super League'. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin has said clubs and players involved with the ESL could bebanned ""as soon as possible""from all Uefa competitions - and the World Cup. Klopp told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""If you thought, what could make the year worse? All that happened, the pandemic, all the injuries, other stuff and then that came up. Another challenge... but we'll get through somehow.""

Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa was also critical of the Super League proposal. ""It shouldn't surprise us,"" he told the BBC. ""In all walks of life the powerful look after their own and don't worry about the rest of us. ""The big teams are also created due to the opposition of the other teams. In the search for higher economic earnings they forget about the rest. The powerful are more rich and the weak are poorer. It doesn't do good to football in general."" Bielsa's striker Patrick Bamford also said ""it is wrong"". ""Playing in a league you can't get relegated or promoted... it is not football,"" he said. Fulham chairman Shahid Khan said via the club website: ""The concept will not serve the game or our most important stakeholders - the generations of football fans here in England and throughout Europe who have been as loyal to their domestic leagues, and the opportunities they offer, as they are faithful to their favourite team."" PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said the Super League idea had been mooted for some time but was ""the last thing the game needs"". ""It is a little bit of a ticking time bomb that we have,"" Taylor told BBC Sport. ""You have renegade members who run riot. That causes a massive problem for the vast majority of clubs or you look to try and control it. ""It is a real test for Uefa, Fifa and our Football Association and also it is something you need to be able to win over, because we are an entertainment industry, the players are important as are the fans and you can't just have a cavalier attitude and ignore it, or it will come back and bite you.""

""We ain't stopping,"" said Neville. ""If they get this through, it will change football in this country forever. We have to mobilise, organise. Everyone has to be behind this.

Carragher said: ""The owners, these are the people to blame for it. They are burning the history of what these clubs are about. The only reason Liverpool have a chance of being in this is because of all the European titles in their history. They have only won once with FSG. ""I think these clubs think it is a done deal.

""Now, having the audacity to believe they should be better than everyone else - I was flabbergasted."" Ex-Arsenal strikerIan Wrightsaid he could not believe his former club was one of those involved in the ESL move.

""God, the man would be turning in his grave knowing what is going on now. Is this how far we have fallen?

""These clubs have an obligation to their country. I love the league format, if clubs leave the English league it will kill the game as a spectacle. ""The Champions League will be watered down.

World Cup and Euros ban threat for Super League players,"This video can not be played 'It's a time of great concern' - Lineker on European Super League The European Super League (ESL) is a ""disgraceful, self-serving"" plan and a ""spit in the face of football lovers"", says Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin. He also said players who play for teams involved in the closed league would be ""banned from the World Cup and Euros"". Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among12 clubs who have agreed to join the proposed ESL. UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden announced a fan-led review of football. This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" Dowden said the review had been brought forward and would offer a ""root and branch"" review of the sport, covering finance, governance and regulation. He said while football's authorities are equipped to handle the proposed ESL breakaway, the UK government would provide ""full backing"". ""Be in no doubt, if they can't act, we will,"" added Dowden. ""We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening. We are examining every option. Put simply, we will be reviewing everything the government does to support these clubs."" Labour welcomed Dowden's statement but said it was ""short on detail and the urgency this situation merits"". A YouGov poll of 1,730 football fans found 79% opposed the idea of a European Super League, with 68% of those polled stating they are strongly opposed to the move.

The ESL will be a ""new midweek competition"" with teams continuing to ""compete in their respective national leagues"". After it was announced on Sunday, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"". World football's governing body previously said it would not recognise such a competition and any players involved could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. The 14 Premier League clubs not signed up to the ESL will meet on Tuesday to assess the proposals and consider a response. Protest banners were placed outside Liverpool's Anfield stadium On Monday, Ceferin reiterated clubs and players involved with the ESL could be banned ""as soon as possible"" from all Uefa competitions. ""We're still assessing with our legal team but we will take all the sanctions that we can and we will inform you as soon we can,"" he said. ""My opinion is that as soon as possible they have to be banned from all our competitions and the players from all our competitions."" Super League: Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new tournament? 'A bonfire of greed' - how Europe reacted to the Super League Aleksander Ceferin has been Uefa president since 2016 Ceferin was particularly critical of Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, who have both stepped down from their roles at Uefa. Agnelli was also a long-time president of the European Club Association (ECA), from which all 12 clubs involved in the ESL have resigned. ""He's probably one of the biggest disappointments, or the biggest disappointment of all,"" said Ceferin. ""I don't want to be too personal. But the fact is that I've never seen a person that would lie so many times, so persistently that he did was unbelievable. ""I spoke with him also on Saturday afternoon. He said, 'These are all only rumours. Don't worry, nothing is going on'. And then he said, 'I'll call you in one hour'. And he turned off the phone."" On Woodward, Ceferin added: ""I didn't have much contact with him but he called me last Thursday in the evening saying that he's very satisfied with the [Champions League] reforms, that he fully supports the reforms, and that the only thing he would like to speak about is about financial fair play. ""And obviously he already signed something else."" Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, the only manager of one of England's 'big six' joining the ESL to speak so far, said he ""trusts the club to make the right decisions"". ""I've know since yesterday but I am here to be in the hardest competition, it's why I came here to play the toughest competitions,"" he said. ""I am part of this club and I trust this club to make the right decisions. I think it's too early to judge everything and it's not my part. On my badge it says that everyone has to play their role. My role is to coach, be focused, and we've another game tomorrow."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier on Monday, Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow said the ESL was a ""grotesque concept"" and goes against everything football stands for. ""These proposals do away with sporting merit,"" Purslow told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It would enable a small number of clubs to be in this competition come what may and, for millions of people in football, that goes against everything the sport means and stands for. ""The idea is that the uncertainty that comes with sport, that makes it so compelling, that we all love, is actually damaging to the business models of these huge clubs. ""So the scheme is designed to take away that uncertainty, to give predictability to their businesses so that, if they're badly managed or have a poor year, they're still in the premier tournament. ""Does that sound like sport or football to you? To me it sounds a grotesque concept."" Writing on Twitter, Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani said: ""Absolutely against the sporting spirit, the dream of millions of fans to conquer the champions on the field, with planning, vision, work. Kill dreams of players and fans. ""The teams are fans and WE are custodians of the club."" Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl reiterated his opposition to the move. ""There cannot be any other opinion about it. It's a big threat, what I see coming up - war, if you want, from the big clubs,"" he said. ""We will see what the future brings but it's a big threat and we have to fight against it. ""I hope we have the fans with us, and without the fans football won't work. They have a lot of power, these big clubs."" And Preston North End, one of the Football League's 12 founding clubs in 1888, said the breakaway could ""destroy nearly 150 years of football history for short-term riches for the few"". North End won the first two league titles and the club's statement went on: ""The underlying principle that these breakaway clubs appear to have completely disregarded is that football is most importantly about its supporters.

Two men killed in Tesla 'without driver' in seat,"Two men were killed after a Tesla car crashed into a tree and caught fire in Texas, and police believe there was nobody present in the driver's seat at the time of the accident. The 2019 Tesla Model S was travelling at a high speed when it failed to negotiate a curve on a winding road. The victims, both in their 50s, were found in the front passenger seat and in the back of the vehicle. Tesla's chief said data recovered so far showed Autopilot was not enabled. Mark Herman, Harris County Precinct 4 constable said that âno-one was driving the vehicle at the time of impactâ, adding that the case was still under investigation. However, the car-maker's chief executive, Elon Musk, tweeted: ""Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled...,externalmoreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.""

LiveLiveAs it happened: India on UK travel red list amid variant concerns1 minute ago1 minute ago GoodbyeGoodbye7 minutes ago Scotland also adds India to 'red list'Scotland also adds India to 'red list'16 minutes ago Re-cap: What were today's main developments?Re-cap: What were today's main developments?,"India will be on the UK international travel red list from 04:00 BST on Friday Delhi begins week-long lockdown after a weekend curfew failed to halt record spike in cases overwhelming health services India has had over 200,000 cases a day since 15 April - with 1,620 new deaths reported on Sunday Health officials investigating whether India variant might spread more easily and evade vaccines 103 cases of the variant have been found in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK PM Boris Johnson has cancelled his planned trip to India next week More than 10 million UK adults have had two doses of a vaccine UK records its lowest number of daily Covid deaths since 7 September - four - and 2,963 new confirmed cases Edited by Martha Buckley and George Bowden We're bringing our live coronavirus coverage to a close. We'll be back tomorrow with more developments. Monday's live coverage was edited by Martha Buckley and George Bowden, and written by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Lauren Turner and David Walker. The Scottish government has confirmed that India will be added to its travel ""red list"". The UK government made the same decision earlier today for England, meaning anybody who is not a UK or Irish resident or British citizen cannot enter the UK if theyâve been in India in the last 10 days. UK and Irish residents or British citizens arriving in Scotland and England from India will need to complete a 10-day quarantine in an approved hotel. There are currently no direct international flights from India to Wales or Northern Ireland. The Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said international travel required a âcautious approach, on a four-nation basisâ. It's time to re-cap some of the main developments from the day:  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organization (WHO) is advising countries not to demand proof of vaccination as a requirement before travelling. The WHOâs emergency committee said vaccine passports would simply increase inequality, and might not help reduce the spread of Covid-19. Many European countries are already planning to demand proof of vaccination from arriving holidaymakers. But with widely different levels of vaccination between rich and poor countries, the organisation says vaccine passports will contribute to inequality, allowing those who have been vaccinated first, such as older people from wealthy countries, more freedom of movement than others. And there is only limited evidence, so far, to suggest that those who have been vaccinated cannot transmit the virus. Instead, the WHO is calling, again, for a global commitment to vaccine equity, in which the elderly, the chronically ill, and health workers in all countries are prioritised. Itâs not just the fairest thing to do, the WHO believes, but also the fastest way to reduce the number of hospitalisations and deaths. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent With all British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights soon to be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine on arrivial into England from India, what are the exemptions? Well, if you travel to England and have been in a red listed country in the last 10 days, in most circumstances, you will have to stay in a government-approved hotel at your own cost. A few of the jobs that do not have to do so include: aircraft pilots and crew; seamen, masters, inspectors and surveyors of ships; those with border security duties; defence personnel, visiting forces and government contractors; diplomatic missions and international organisations and conferences. There are also some exemptions, such as for some unaccompanied minors attending boarding school who might be able to quarantine at their boarding school. As well as some people attending someone who is dying or a funeral - if it is a close family member - although this is limited and requires requesting permission and they cannot use public transport to get there. More details on exemptions can be foundhere,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord earlier Earlier today - as seen in the picture above - Labour leader Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord in Bath who made a series of Covid claims. Rod Humphris said âthe last time we had this much death was 2008â and noted that the average age of death for people with coronavirus was over 80. The figures are right but there are some health warnings that come with them. Last yearâs Covid epidemic brought the UKâs death rates back to where they stood 13 years before, in 2008. Death rates are supposed to get better every year. Undoing more than a decadeâs worth of progress in one fell swoop just doesnât happen in ordinary times. Itâs like losing 13 yearsâ GDP growth in a single year: it would be a national economic emergency, even if it only brought the UKâs economy back to where it was in 2008. Onto the second claim: most people who die with Covid are elderly - three-quarters of Covid deaths have been in those over 75. But that doesnât mean they were all on deathâs doorstep. Even if youâre an 80-year-old, overweight man with diabetes who smokes, your life expectancyis around four more years,external. So, many of the 150,000 people who have died with Covid have likely lost years of life. Saajan Radia said he would be unable to visit his wife's family People in Leicester have been giving the BBC their reaction to India being added to the UK travel ""red list"". Travel agent Nisha Ganatra, of Citibond Travel, said she was braced for the cancellation of trips to India. ""Most of the people, 99% will cancel now,"" she said. ""It is quite difficult for us - there is no money for us. We're not making anything at all."" And Saajan Radia, also from Leicester, said as his wife's family is in India, they usually visit at least once a year. ""Since last year we've not been able to go,"" he said, adding how difficult it was for the family to have ""that uncertainty of not being able to see my kids' grandparents"". Surges of Covid are happening again around the world, driven by some new subvariants of Omicron. Matt Hancock has been urged to resolve concerns about food provision for people in quarantine hotels, particularly for those who are fasting during Ramadan - which is currently being observed. Labour MP Imran Hussain called on Hancock to ""urgently resolve this frankly absolutely shambolic situation with the booking system"" and to ensure food ""meets the faith and dietary requirements of travellers particularly those fasting during Ramadan"". Hancock said the government was ""very careful"" to ensure the majority of those who have to go through managed quarantine have a good experience and said he would make sure public health minister Jo Churchill met with Hussain to hear about individual concerns. He added that ""making sure that food provision is appropriate for those fasting at Ramadan"" was ""very important"". Reality Check As we've been reporting, India will be added to the UK's so-called red list - meaning there will be strict restrictions on travel between the countries from Friday. It has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April, and near neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh have both been on the red list since 9 April. Criteria for being added to the list include how good a country's testing is, how many cases have been identified, and whether the country has exported new variants of concern. As of 13 April, Bangladesh, which had the South Africa variant but not the Brazil variant, and Pakistan, which had neither, were on the list. But India, which had both, was not added for another two weeks. ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, says. Read more here. People who live, work or travel in various parts of the UK are being urged to get a Covid test. During the health secretary's appearance in the Commons earlier, Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, questioned why India was not put on the red list sooner. She said: ""Hong Kong this week have identified 47 Covid cases just on a single Delhi flight and we have still 16 more direct flights, many more indirect flights from India to here before Friday alone."" Matt Hancock said decisions on each country were ""kept under constant review"". The world has the means to
bring the pandemic under control within months, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. ""We have the tools to bring this pandemic under control in a
matter of months, if we apply them consistently and equitably,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying at a daily news briefing.

India is being added to the red list of countries from which travel is banned, we heard in the House of Commons this afternoon. It means Britons arriving from India will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days when they get back. Anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen will be banned from entering if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. But is that new rule for England, or is it the whole of the UK? Well, technically, as public health is determined by individual nations, it only concerns England. As there are no international flights into Wales or Northern Ireland however, they tend to fall into line with England's decisions. And there are no quarantine hotels in Wales or Northern Ireland either. Scotland currently requires hotel quarantine for all international arrivals at the moment anyway, so today's announcement makes no difference to anyone landing there. Here's an explainer on which countries are currently on the red list and exactly what it means for travellers. Airline Virgin Atlantic says it will continue to operate its flights to India until the country officially joins the UK travel red list at 04.00 BST on Friday. ""Our flights between London Heathrow and Delhi and Mumbai will be departing as scheduled until 23 April, with all customers arriving in England subject to a pre-departure Covid-19 test and 10-day self-isolation at home, with two further PCR tests,"" it says. The airline is reviewing its schedule of India operations from Friday and says customers should check their flight status. Virgin is due to operate one flight from Mumbai and one flight from Delhi to the UK before Friday's change. As has been mentioned by Matt Hancock,the government data,externalshows more than 10 million people have now received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. The figures show that up to Sunday 32,932,448 first doses had been given in the UK - a rise of 83,225 on the previous day. There have also been 10,152,039 second doses, an increase of 221,193. As we reported earlier, the Indian capital, Delhi, is due to go into lockdown  for a week after a record spike in cases overwhelmed the city's healthcare system. The city had imposed a weekend curfew, but reported its highest single-day spike so far on Sunday - 24,462 cases. It has almost run out of beds at hospital intensive care units and oxygen is in short supply, the city's chief minister said earlier. Crematoriums in the area are also overwhelmed. One in three people in Delhi is testing positive, the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from the city. Separately, the Indian government has said all adults will be eligible to get a coronavirus vaccination from the start of next month. India has been reeling from a deadly second wave since the start of April. Read more here. Back to the Commons, where SNP health spokeswoman Dr Philippa Whitford asked if Matt Hancock recognised the need for a ""more coordinated global response"" to allow a safer return to international travel and business. Hancock replied he agreed on that, saying international collaboration was something he, along with the foreign secretary and prime minister, were working ""incredibly hard"" on. He said they were using the presidency of the G7 and the ""enthusiasm of the new administration"" in the US, under President Joe Biden, to ""try to drive that"". Hancock said in particular, they were looking for collaboration ""amongst like-minded democracies in favour of an open and transparent science-led response to pandemics"".   The UK has reported four new deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,the lowest figure since September,external. You have to go back to 7 September for a day when fewer deaths, three, were reported across the country. Due to lags in reporting, figures are often lower at the start of the week, and some deaths which have occurred in the past 24 hours may not yet have made it into the daily figures. Wales has begun to report on a six-day basis with Monday's figure covering a 48-hour period. The UK has recorded 127,274 Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test since the start of the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has finished updating MPs on coronavirus developments.

Tesco fined Â£7.56m for selling out-of-date foodOffending items were found at three stores in Birmingham between 2016 and 2017.Birmingham & Black Country,"The supermarket giant was given the penalty at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday Tesco has been fined Â£7.56m for selling out-of-date food at three stores in Birmingham. Offending items were found at two Tesco Express stores, in the city centre and Bournville, and a Tesco Metro in Bristol Road South. The fine was handed down after Tesco Stores Ltd admitted 22 breaches of the Food Safety and Hygiene Regulations, which happened between 2016 and 2017. Tesco said it took ""immediate action"" to rectify problems. The grocery company was given the penalty at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday and further ordered to pay prosecution costs of Â£95,500, the city council said. The prosecution by its environmental health department came after complaints were received by the local authority about food being sold past its use-by date, triggering an investigation. Food inspectors visited three of the company's food retail premises in Birmingham Food inspectors visited three of the company's city food retail premises. The Tesco Metro in Bristol Road South has since been re-branded under Tesco's discount chain, Jack's. Date-checking for the firm is now externally approved by Hertfordshire County Council because the company's Welwyn Garden City head office is located in that local authority's area. Latest news from the West Midlands A Tesco spokesman said: ""We're disappointed that a small number of out-of-date products were found on sale in three stores in 2016/17. ""The safety of our customers is always our priority and these incidents are not representative of the high standards of safety and quality we expect in Tesco stores. ""We took immediate action to address this at the time and we want to reassure our customers that we have robust procedures in place to make sure that this doesn't happen.""

LiveLiveAs it happened: India on UK travel red list amid variant concerns1 minute ago,"India will be on the UK international travel red list from 04:00 BST on Friday Delhi begins week-long lockdown after a weekend curfew failed to halt record spike in cases overwhelming health services India has had over 200,000 cases a day since 15 April - with 1,620 new deaths reported on Sunday Health officials investigating whether India variant might spread more easily and evade vaccines 103 cases of the variant have been found in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK PM Boris Johnson has cancelled his planned trip to India next week More than 10 million UK adults have had two doses of a vaccine UK records its lowest number of daily Covid deaths since 7 September - four - and 2,963 new confirmed cases Edited by Martha Buckley and George Bowden We're bringing our live coronavirus coverage to a close. We'll be back tomorrow with more developments. Monday's live coverage was edited by Martha Buckley and George Bowden, and written by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Lauren Turner and David Walker. The Scottish government has confirmed that India will be added to its travel ""red list"". The UK government made the same decision earlier today for England, meaning anybody who is not a UK or Irish resident or British citizen cannot enter the UK if theyâve been in India in the last 10 days. UK and Irish residents or British citizens arriving in Scotland and England from India will need to complete a 10-day quarantine in an approved hotel. There are currently no direct international flights from India to Wales or Northern Ireland. The Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said international travel required a âcautious approach, on a four-nation basisâ. It's time to re-cap some of the main developments from the day:  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organization (WHO) is advising countries not to demand proof of vaccination as a requirement before travelling. The WHOâs emergency committee said vaccine passports would simply increase inequality, and might not help reduce the spread of Covid-19. Many European countries are already planning to demand proof of vaccination from arriving holidaymakers. But with widely different levels of vaccination between rich and poor countries, the organisation says vaccine passports will contribute to inequality, allowing those who have been vaccinated first, such as older people from wealthy countries, more freedom of movement than others. And there is only limited evidence, so far, to suggest that those who have been vaccinated cannot transmit the virus. Instead, the WHO is calling, again, for a global commitment to vaccine equity, in which the elderly, the chronically ill, and health workers in all countries are prioritised. Itâs not just the fairest thing to do, the WHO believes, but also the fastest way to reduce the number of hospitalisations and deaths. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent With all British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights soon to be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine on arrivial into England from India, what are the exemptions? Well, if you travel to England and have been in a red listed country in the last 10 days, in most circumstances, you will have to stay in a government-approved hotel at your own cost. A few of the jobs that do not have to do so include: aircraft pilots and crew; seamen, masters, inspectors and surveyors of ships; those with border security duties; defence personnel, visiting forces and government contractors; diplomatic missions and international organisations and conferences. There are also some exemptions, such as for some unaccompanied minors attending boarding school who might be able to quarantine at their boarding school. As well as some people attending someone who is dying or a funeral - if it is a close family member - although this is limited and requires requesting permission and they cannot use public transport to get there. More details on exemptions can be foundhere,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord earlier Earlier today - as seen in the picture above - Labour leader Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord in Bath who made a series of Covid claims. Rod Humphris said âthe last time we had this much death was 2008â and noted that the average age of death for people with coronavirus was over 80. The figures are right but there are some health warnings that come with them. Last yearâs Covid epidemic brought the UKâs death rates back to where they stood 13 years before, in 2008. Death rates are supposed to get better every year. Undoing more than a decadeâs worth of progress in one fell swoop just doesnât happen in ordinary times. Itâs like losing 13 yearsâ GDP growth in a single year: it would be a national economic emergency, even if it only brought the UKâs economy back to where it was in 2008. Onto the second claim: most people who die with Covid are elderly - three-quarters of Covid deaths have been in those over 75. But that doesnât mean they were all on deathâs doorstep. Even if youâre an 80-year-old, overweight man with diabetes who smokes, your life expectancyis around four more years,external. So, many of the 150,000 people who have died with Covid have likely lost years of life. Saajan Radia said he would be unable to visit his wife's family People in Leicester have been giving the BBC their reaction to India being added to the UK travel ""red list"". Travel agent Nisha Ganatra, of Citibond Travel, said she was braced for the cancellation of trips to India. ""Most of the people, 99% will cancel now,"" she said. ""It is quite difficult for us - there is no money for us. We're not making anything at all."" And Saajan Radia, also from Leicester, said as his wife's family is in India, they usually visit at least once a year. ""Since last year we've not been able to go,"" he said, adding how difficult it was for the family to have ""that uncertainty of not being able to see my kids' grandparents"". Surges of Covid are happening again around the world, driven by some new subvariants of Omicron. Matt Hancock has been urged to resolve concerns about food provision for people in quarantine hotels, particularly for those who are fasting during Ramadan - which is currently being observed. Labour MP Imran Hussain called on Hancock to ""urgently resolve this frankly absolutely shambolic situation with the booking system"" and to ensure food ""meets the faith and dietary requirements of travellers particularly those fasting during Ramadan"". Hancock said the government was ""very careful"" to ensure the majority of those who have to go through managed quarantine have a good experience and said he would make sure public health minister Jo Churchill met with Hussain to hear about individual concerns. He added that ""making sure that food provision is appropriate for those fasting at Ramadan"" was ""very important"". Reality Check As we've been reporting, India will be added to the UK's so-called red list - meaning there will be strict restrictions on travel between the countries from Friday. It has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April, and near neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh have both been on the red list since 9 April. Criteria for being added to the list include how good a country's testing is, how many cases have been identified, and whether the country has exported new variants of concern. As of 13 April, Bangladesh, which had the South Africa variant but not the Brazil variant, and Pakistan, which had neither, were on the list. But India, which had both, was not added for another two weeks. ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, says. Read more here. People who live, work or travel in various parts of the UK are being urged to get a Covid test. During the health secretary's appearance in the Commons earlier, Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, questioned why India was not put on the red list sooner. She said: ""Hong Kong this week have identified 47 Covid cases just on a single Delhi flight and we have still 16 more direct flights, many more indirect flights from India to here before Friday alone."" Matt Hancock said decisions on each country were ""kept under constant review"". The world has the means to
bring the pandemic under control within months, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. ""We have the tools to bring this pandemic under control in a
matter of months, if we apply them consistently and equitably,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying at a daily news briefing. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joined the briefing from Sweden as a guest, condemned what she said was the ""tragedy"" of vaccine inequity as she donated â¬100,000 ($120,000) from her foundation to Covax, the scheme aiming to give global access to Covid-19 vaccines.

"World Cup and Euros ban threat for Super League playersUefaâs president says the proposed closed league is ""disgraceful"" and a ""spit in the face of football lovers"".","This video can not be played 'It's a time of great concern' - Lineker on European Super League The European Super League (ESL) is a ""disgraceful, self-serving"" plan and a ""spit in the face of football lovers"", says Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin. He also said players who play for teams involved in the closed league would be ""banned from the World Cup and Euros"". Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among12 clubs who have agreed to join the proposed ESL. UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden announced a fan-led review of football. This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" Dowden said the review had been brought forward and would offer a ""root and branch"" review of the sport, covering finance, governance and regulation. He said while football's authorities are equipped to handle the proposed ESL breakaway, the UK government would provide ""full backing"". ""Be in no doubt, if they can't act, we will,"" added Dowden. ""We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening. We are examining every option. Put simply, we will be reviewing everything the government does to support these clubs."" Labour welcomed Dowden's statement but said it was ""short on detail and the urgency this situation merits"". A YouGov poll of 1,730 football fans found 79% opposed the idea of a European Super League, with 68% of those polled stating they are strongly opposed to the move.

""We are all united against this nonsense of a project,"" he said. ""I cannot stress more strongly how everyone is united against these disgraceful, self-serving proposals, fuelled by greed above all else.

The ESL will be a ""new midweek competition"" with teams continuing to ""compete in their respective national leagues"". After it was announced on Sunday, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"". World football's governing body previously said it would not recognise such a competition and any players involved could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. The 14 Premier League clubs not signed up to the ESL will meet on Tuesday to assess the proposals and consider a response. Protest banners were placed outside Liverpool's Anfield stadium On Monday, Ceferin reiterated clubs and players involved with the ESL could be banned ""as soon as possible"" from all Uefa competitions. ""We're still assessing with our legal team but we will take all the sanctions that we can and we will inform you as soon we can,"" he said. ""My opinion is that as soon as possible they have to be banned from all our competitions and the players from all our competitions."" Super League: Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new tournament? 'A bonfire of greed' - how Europe reacted to the Super League Aleksander Ceferin has been Uefa president since 2016 Ceferin was particularly critical of Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, who have both stepped down from their roles at Uefa. Agnelli was also a long-time president of the European Club Association (ECA), from which all 12 clubs involved in the ESL have resigned. ""He's probably one of the biggest disappointments, or the biggest disappointment of all,"" said Ceferin. ""I don't want to be too personal. But the fact is that I've never seen a person that would lie so many times, so persistently that he did was unbelievable. ""I spoke with him also on Saturday afternoon. He said, 'These are all only rumours. Don't worry, nothing is going on'. And then he said, 'I'll call you in one hour'. And he turned off the phone."" On Woodward, Ceferin added: ""I didn't have much contact with him but he called me last Thursday in the evening saying that he's very satisfied with the [Champions League] reforms, that he fully supports the reforms, and that the only thing he would like to speak about is about financial fair play. ""And obviously he already signed something else."" Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, the only manager of one of England's 'big six' joining the ESL to speak so far, said he ""trusts the club to make the right decisions"". ""I've know since yesterday but I am here to be in the hardest competition, it's why I came here to play the toughest competitions,"" he said. ""I am part of this club and I trust this club to make the right decisions. I think it's too early to judge everything and it's not my part. On my badge it says that everyone has to play their role.

Earlier on Monday, Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow said the ESL was a ""grotesque concept"" and goes against everything football stands for. ""These proposals do away with sporting merit,"" Purslow told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It would enable a small number of clubs to be in this competition come what may and, for millions of people in football, that goes against everything the sport means and stands for. ""The idea is that the uncertainty that comes with sport, that makes it so compelling, that we all love, is actually damaging to the business models of these huge clubs. ""So the scheme is designed to take away that uncertainty, to give predictability to their businesses so that, if they're badly managed or have a poor year, they're still in the premier tournament. ""Does that sound like sport or football to you? To me it sounds a grotesque concept."" Writing on Twitter, Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani said: ""Absolutely against the sporting spirit, the dream of millions of fans to conquer the champions on the field, with planning, vision, work. Kill dreams of players and fans. ""The teams are fans and WE are custodians of the club."" Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl reiterated his opposition to the move. ""There cannot be any other opinion about it. It's a big threat, what I see coming up - war, if you want, from the big clubs,"" he said. ""We will see what the future brings but it's a big threat and we have to fight against it. ""I hope we have the fans with us, and without the fans football won't work. They have a lot of power, these big clubs."" And Preston North End, one of the Football League's 12 founding clubs in 1888, said the breakaway could ""destroy nearly 150 years of football history for short-term riches for the few"". North End won the first two league titles and the club's statement went on: ""The underlying principle that these breakaway clubs appear to have completely disregarded is that football is most importantly about its supporters.

Food inspectors visited three of the company's food retail premises in Birmingham Food inspectors visited three of the company's city food retail premises. The Tesco Metro in Bristol Road South has since been re-branded under Tesco's discount chain, Jack's. Date-checking for the firm is now externally approved by Hertfordshire County Council because the company's Welwyn Garden City head office is located in that local authority's area.

Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league?Europe's biggest teams have suffered during the Covid pandemic and say they want financial stability.BusinessComments,"Plans for a new football European Super League (ESL) have collapsed, following the withdrawal of most of the teams involved. The decision follows a massive backlash against the league, which had the support of some of the world's biggest clubs. Six English Premier League teams had signed up to the ESL - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. They joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid as founder members. The idea was for the clubs to remain in their national leagues, but also to play each other in a new midweek European competition, which would have rivalled the Champions League. The ESL would have had 20 teams, of which 15 founding members would be permanent and never face relegation. Five other sides would qualify each year. All six English Premier League clubs dropped out of the project on Tuesday night. They have now been followed by Atletico Madrid in Spain and Italian team Inter Milan. One of the chief movers behind the ESL, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, has now admitted that the ESL is not likely to go ahead. ""I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,"" he said. ""But evidently no, I don't think that project is now still up and running."" ESL 'cannot now proceed' How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded With 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics said it would have devalued the game because it was unfair and uncompetitive. For instance, Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League since the 2016-17 season, but they would have been guaranteed a place - regardless of how they performed in the domestic league. However, a future winner of the Premier League would not necessarily have qualified for the ESL if they were not a permanent member. If this were the case, that team would miss out on millions of pounds in revenue. The ESL attracted widespread criticism from pundits, players, MPs and most football bodies not involved. Fans of the clubs involved held several protests outside their grounds. Chelsea fans protest against plans for a European Super League ahead of the club's game against Brighton It appears they were taken aback by the strength of criticism. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to supporters and the ""wider football community"". Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the ""anxiety and upset"" caused by the proposal. Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders,"" in making their decision. Real Madrid president Florentino Perezhad claimed it would ""save football"", at a time when young people are ""no longer interested"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". The founding clubs were promised a share of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan. Most are in considerable debt,made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators. Big clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries. If they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses. Super League makes financial sense for top clubs The 20-team league would have been split into two groups of 10, playing each other at home and away. The top three in each group would have qualified for the quarter-finals, with the fourth and fifth-placed teams competing in a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. It would then have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May. The president of Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations), Aleksander Ceferin, had warned that participating clubs could be banned from European competition, and their players prevented from appearing at the Euros and the World Cup. Mr Ceferin welcomed the English clubs' reversal, saying, ""the important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this, and move forward together"".

Two men killed in Tesla 'without driver' in seatOne victim was found in the front passenger seat and the other was in the back after the accident in Texas.,"Two men were killed after a Tesla car crashed into a tree and caught fire in Texas, and police believe there was nobody present in the driver's seat at the time of the accident. The 2019 Tesla Model S was travelling at a high speed when it failed to negotiate a curve on a winding road. The victims, both in their 50s, were found in the front passenger seat and in the back of the vehicle. Tesla's chief said data recovered so far showed Autopilot was not enabled. Mark Herman, Harris County Precinct 4 constable said that âno-one was driving the vehicle at the time of impactâ, adding that the case was still under investigation.

They said there was a ""need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid"". BBC's Sports Editor Dan Roan said leading figures were insisting the Super League would generate much more money, not just for the clubs involved, but for the rest of the ""football family"". He added they seemed ""very confident"" they were on a strong legal footing when it came to blocking any punishments threatened by bodies such as Uefa. Earlier, Manchester United's shares rose within minutes of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where they are traded. Fifteen minutes after the trading day began, they were up around 8.5%. Meanwhile, Juventus's share price jumped by more than 14% on Monday morning. But Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp hassaid he remained opposed to the idea of the league- despite his club agreeing to join it. ""I like the competitive aspect of football.

Why are countries put on the travel ban list?,"Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's Home Affairs Committee, has criticised the delay in putting India on the government's travel-ban ""red list"". ""They should have put India on the red list at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since then, we've had this three-week period in which thousands of people have returned from India and that probably includes hundreds of the new variant Covid cases,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. India was added to the red list on 23 April, but neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh had been on it since 9 April. One of the variants of coronavirus first identified in India has spread to the UK. Just under half of these cases involve international travel and the strain has now been designated a ""variant of concern"". What is the India Covid variant? The red list is the government'slist of 43 countries,externalfrom which there are strict restrictions on travel to England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have similar rules in place with the same list of countries. The restrictions are designed to protect the UK from new variants, against which vaccines may be less effective and which may spread more easily. Which countries are on the red list? What are the Indian, Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? India red list add 'may be too late', Prof Mark Walport says Travel to England is banned for anyone who has been in one of the countries in the past 10 days, except for UK citizens and residents, who have to isolate on arrival at government-approved hotels. Direct flights are banned from most red list countries, but not Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya and India. The government says this is to allow critical freight and make it easier for British nationals to return home. The decision is based on Joint Biosecurity Centre risk assessments, which include: how good a country's testing structures are, including checking for variants how many cases those systems have identified whether people in that country have been catching new variants at home or the cases have come from overseas evidence of whether that country has exported cases of new variants to other countries, including to the UK how good the country's travel links with the UK are The first point is important, because the genome sequencing needed to identify new variants is very sophisticated and relatively rare. But just because a country has found variants of concern, or has many cases of coronavirus, it will not necessarily be on the red list. On 18 May,external, the World Health Organization identified: 106 countries where the variant identified in South Africa had been found, of which 28 are on the red list 61 countries with the variant identified in Brazil, of which 19 are on the red list 48 countries with the variant identified in India, of which 6 are on the red list. Bangladesh had the South Africa but not the Brazil variant and Pakistan had neither when they were added to the red list on 9 April. India had both, as well as a new variant, but was not added for another two weeks. On 9 April: Pakistan had a seven-day average of 21 cases per million people Bangladesh had twice as many India had four times as many Health Secretary Matt Hancock said these figures depended on how much testing was being done and said ""far more"" was carried out in India. He said the decision to add Pakistan and Bangladesh earlier was based on a higher proportion of people arriving in the UK from these countries, testing positive for coronavirus. ""When we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India,"" Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May. Figures from NHS Test and Trace,externaldo not support that claim. For the period 25 March to 7 April, the positivity rate from Bangladesh was 3.7%, from India was 5.1% and from Pakistan was 6.2%. Mr Hancock was asked about this in Parliament on 19 May and said: ""The positivity rate in India, on which the decision to put Pakistan but not India on the red list was 1.6% in India and 4.6% in Pakistan, which is three times higher, as I said."" But those are not published figures. He didn't give the date for them and didn't mention Bangladesh this time. Checking Matt Hancock's claim about Covid cases from India ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said. Boris Johnson had planned a trade visit to India but cancelled iton 19 April- days before the country was added to the red list. One of the variants first identified in India was designated as a variant of concern on 7 May. By 17 May, 2,323 cases of this variant had been found in the UK, of which 483 had been in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. The WHO said,externalit appeared to have a higher rate of transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines may be less effective against it. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cited fears of the India variant on 14 May as one of the reasons why Glasgow and Moray willnot have restrictions eased as planned. In the four weeks before India was added to the red list, 6,560 people were tested on arrival in England from India. Of those, 425 tested positive for coronavirus, which is about 6%. The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according toa 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Almost 60% of positive Covid19 tests are now sent for genome sequencing to identify new variants, which means the government has a good idea of where the cases are. Asked about the delays in adding India to the red list, the UK's former chief scientific adviser Prof Mark Walport told the BBC: ""These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth.""

There will be more on the European Super League there as well as more reaction to Tottenham sacking Jose Mourinho. Thanks for all your comments and bye for now. Leeds United v Liverpool (20:00 BST) There is a match in the Premier League tonight as Leeds United take on last season's champions Liverpool. Leeds forwards Raphinha and Rodrigo are both doubts and will undergo late fitness tests. They are without captain Liam Cooper, who is suspended due to the red card he received in the victory over Manchester City. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is boosted by the news that he has no new injury concerns to contend with. Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson, Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk remain on the sidelines. And here is a clip of what we have been talking about as Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, tells Parliament that the UK Government will 'do everything' to prevent the European Super League from happening. This video can not be played Following Dowden's comments in Parliament, shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens
called this ""a watershed moment for our national game"". She said: ""Football governance
is broken, football finance is broken and football fans, whichever club we
support, are ignored. ""The hedge-fund owners and
billionaires who treat football clubs like any other of their commodities have no care
for history of our football, for the role it plays in villages, towns and
cities up and down our country and especially for the fans who are the
beating heart of it. ""They should understand their role
as custodians rather than cartel chiefs. The future of our national game
and all our clubs depend on it."" Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said the UK Government will be ""reviewing everything the Government does"" to
support the so-called big six football clubs who have decided to join the
European Super League. Making a statement on the matter in the
Commons, he said he has spoken to the football authorities,
adding: ""My message for them was clear: they have our full backing. ""But, be in no doubt, if they can't
act we will. We will put everything on the table to prevent this from
happening. We are examining every option from governance reform to competition
law and mechanisms that allow football to take place. ""Put simply, we will
be reviewing everything the Government does to support these clubs to play. I
have discussed these options with the Prime Minister this morning and we are
working at pace across Government and with football authorities. ""We will do everything it takes to protect our national game. These clubs have decided to put money ahead of fans."" Simon StoneBBC Sport PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has turned down the chance to
replace Andrea Agnelli as chairman of the European Clubsâ Association. The ECA is reeling from the resignation of all 12 clubs involved
in the planned European Super League. BBC Sport understands Al-Khelaifi was the first choice to take
over from Juventus chairman Agnelli, who was condemned for his behaviour in
joining the planned breakaway by UEFA president. However, Al Khelaifi is reluctant to add to his workload. BBC Sport has been told this is not the prelude to a move by PSG
to join the 12 clubs, as they hoped, and that Al Khelaifi has been speaking
with the ECA and Uefa today as the row that has engulfed them continues. #bbcfootball Ian Unsworth:I don't know why people are getting so stressed about this ESL when the answer is so simple - don't watch it. If there is no audience then it can't survive, the last 12 months should've taught people that. Peter Hart:People saying a super league will fail. It won't. They have realised they don't need local fans anymore. They've seen the empty stadiums and the millions watching in China and India and Africa etc and done the maths....2+2=$$$$$. Traddad:Time for 10 Downing to call the bluff and force the German 51% fan ownership model down the throats of all England football teams regardless of Super League outcome.

Derby County boss Wayne Rooney has said""protecting the English football pyramid is the most important thing""after six Premier League clubs agreed to join a European Super League (ESL). Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 sides to have signed up to the proposals for a new midweek competition. The English Football League said in a statement that the plans ""attack the foundation of open and fair competition upon which our game is built"". Rooney, who is United and England's all-time top scorer, said he wanted the English pyramid to be ""protected and rewarded"" and called the timing of the announcement ""strange"". ""The people in charge of these clubs are not stupid. We'll have to wait to see what the plans are,"" he said. ""I don't think it would be a great look to pull away from cup competitions but let's see what the proposals are.""

At Old Trafford... ...at Anfield... ...and at Tottenham's training ground. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker says the potential for a new European Super League ""is a time of great concern"".

Eventually it will (ticket costs, travel). Then those clubs go to non-league. Similar problems are happening in cricket (though greed is less a motive, lower wages). But already Test & county squads suffering. Ben Green:Will be really interesting to hear a statement from players in the big 6. I think the clubs as employers will fall foul of employment laws if their decision prevents the players being part of the current FIFA structure, which their contracts are based on.

After it was announced on Sunday, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"". World football's governing body previously said it would not recognise such a competition and any players involved could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup.

'A bonfire of greed' - how Europe reacted to the Super League Aleksander Ceferin has been Uefa president since 2016 Ceferin was particularly critical of Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, who have both stepped down from their roles at Uefa. Agnelli was also a long-time president of the European Club Association (ECA), from which all 12 clubs involved in the ESL have resigned. ""He's probably one of the biggest disappointments, or the biggest disappointment of all,"" said Ceferin. ""I don't want to be too personal. But the fact is that I've never seen a person that would lie so many times, so persistently that he did was unbelievable. ""I spoke with him also on Saturday afternoon. He said, 'These are all only rumours. Don't worry, nothing is going on'. And then he said, 'I'll call you in one hour'. And he turned off the phone."" On Woodward, Ceferin added: ""I didn't have much contact with him but he called me last Thursday in the evening saying that he's very satisfied with the [Champions League] reforms, that he fully supports the reforms, and that the only thing he would like to speak about is about financial fair play. ""And obviously he already signed something else."" Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, the only manager of one of England's 'big six' joining the ESL to speak so far, said he ""trusts the club to make the right decisions"". ""I've know since yesterday but I am here to be in the hardest competition, it's why I came here to play the toughest competitions,"" he said. ""I am part of this club and I trust this club to make the right decisions. I think it's too early to judge everything and it's not my part. On my badge it says that everyone has to play their role.

Earlier on Monday, Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow said the ESL was a ""grotesque concept"" and goes against everything football stands for. ""These proposals do away with sporting merit,"" Purslow told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It would enable a small number of clubs to be in this competition come what may and, for millions of people in football, that goes against everything the sport means and stands for. ""The idea is that the uncertainty that comes with sport, that makes it so compelling, that we all love, is actually damaging to the business models of these huge clubs. ""So the scheme is designed to take away that uncertainty, to give predictability to their businesses so that, if they're badly managed or have a poor year, they're still in the premier tournament. ""Does that sound like sport or football to you? To me it sounds a grotesque concept."" Writing on Twitter, Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani said: ""Absolutely against the sporting spirit, the dream of millions of fans to conquer the champions on the field, with planning, vision, work. Kill dreams of players and fans. ""The teams are fans and WE are custodians of the club."" Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl reiterated his opposition to the move. ""There cannot be any other opinion about it. It's a big threat, what I see coming up - war, if you want, from the big clubs,"" he said. ""We will see what the future brings but it's a big threat and we have to fight against it. ""I hope we have the fans with us, and without the fans football won't work. They have a lot of power, these big clubs."" And Preston North End, one of the Football League's 12 founding clubs in 1888, said the breakaway could ""destroy nearly 150 years of football history for short-term riches for the few"". North End won the first two league titles and the club's statement went on: ""The underlying principle that these breakaway clubs appear to have completely disregarded is that football is most importantly about its supporters.

beating heart of it. ""They should understand their role
as custodians rather than cartel chiefs. The future of our national game
and all our clubs depend on it."" Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said the UK Government will be ""reviewing everything the Government does"" to
support the so-called big six football clubs who have decided to join the
European Super League. Making a statement on the matter in the
Commons, he said he has spoken to the football authorities,
adding: ""My message for them was clear: they have our full backing. ""But, be in no doubt, if they can't
act we will. We will put everything on the table to prevent this from
happening. We are examining every option from governance reform to competition
law and mechanisms that allow football to take place. ""Put simply, we will
be reviewing everything the Government does to support these clubs to play. I
have discussed these options with the Prime Minister this morning and we are
working at pace across Government and with football authorities. ""We will do everything it takes to protect our national game. These clubs have decided to put money ahead of fans."" Simon StoneBBC Sport PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has turned down the chance to
replace Andrea Agnelli as chairman of the European Clubsâ Association. The ECA is reeling from the resignation of all 12 clubs involved
in the planned European Super League. BBC Sport understands Al-Khelaifi was the first choice to take
over from Juventus chairman Agnelli, who was condemned for his behaviour in
joining the planned breakaway by UEFA president. However, Al Khelaifi is reluctant to add to his workload. BBC Sport has been told this is not the prelude to a move by PSG
to join the 12 clubs, as they hoped, and that Al Khelaifi has been speaking
with the ECA and Uefa today as the row that has engulfed them continues. #bbcfootball Ian Unsworth:I don't know why people are getting so stressed about this ESL when the answer is so simple - don't watch it. If there is no audience then it can't survive, the last 12 months should've taught people that. Peter Hart:People saying a super league will fail. It won't. They have realised they don't need local fans anymore. They've seen the empty stadiums and the millions watching in China and India and Africa etc and done the maths....2+2=$$$$$.

LiveLiveUK places India on red list amid variant concerns4 minutes ago,"India will be on the UK international travel red list from 04:00 BST on Friday Delhi begins week-long lockdown after a weekend curfew failed to halt record spike in cases overwhelming health services India has had over 200,000 cases a day since 15 April - with 1,620 new deaths reported on Sunday Health officials investigating whether India variant might spread more easily and evade vaccines 103 cases of the variant have been found in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK PM Boris Johnson has cancelled his planned trip to India next week More than 10 million UK adults have had two doses of a vaccine UK records its lowest number of daily Covid deaths since 7 September - four - and 2,963 new confirmed cases Edited by Martha Buckley and George Bowden We're bringing our live coronavirus coverage to a close. We'll be back tomorrow with more developments. Monday's live coverage was edited by Martha Buckley and George Bowden, and written by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Lauren Turner and David Walker. The Scottish government has confirmed that India will be added to its travel ""red list"". The UK government made the same decision earlier today for England, meaning anybody who is not a UK or Irish resident or British citizen cannot enter the UK if theyâve been in India in the last 10 days. UK and Irish residents or British citizens arriving in Scotland and England from India will need to complete a 10-day quarantine in an approved hotel. There are currently no direct international flights from India to Wales or Northern Ireland. The Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said international travel required a âcautious approach, on a four-nation basisâ. It's time to re-cap some of the main developments from the day:  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organization (WHO) is advising countries not to demand proof of vaccination as a requirement before travelling. The WHOâs emergency committee said vaccine passports would simply increase inequality, and might not help reduce the spread of Covid-19. Many European countries are already planning to demand proof of vaccination from arriving holidaymakers. But with widely different levels of vaccination between rich and poor countries, the organisation says vaccine passports will contribute to inequality, allowing those who have been vaccinated first, such as older people from wealthy countries, more freedom of movement than others. And there is only limited evidence, so far, to suggest that those who have been vaccinated cannot transmit the virus. Instead, the WHO is calling, again, for a global commitment to vaccine equity, in which the elderly, the chronically ill, and health workers in all countries are prioritised. Itâs not just the fairest thing to do, the WHO believes, but also the fastest way to reduce the number of hospitalisations and deaths. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent With all British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights soon to be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine on arrivial into England from India, what are the exemptions? Well, if you travel to England and have been in a red listed country in the last 10 days, in most circumstances, you will have to stay in a government-approved hotel at your own cost. A few of the jobs that do not have to do so include: aircraft pilots and crew; seamen, masters, inspectors and surveyors of ships; those with border security duties; defence personnel, visiting forces and government contractors; diplomatic missions and international organisations and conferences. There are also some exemptions, such as for some unaccompanied minors attending boarding school who might be able to quarantine at their boarding school. As well as some people attending someone who is dying or a funeral - if it is a close family member - although this is limited and requires requesting permission and they cannot use public transport to get there. More details on exemptions can be foundhere,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord earlier Earlier today - as seen in the picture above - Labour leader Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord in Bath who made a series of Covid claims. Rod Humphris said âthe last time we had this much death was 2008â and noted that the average age of death for people with coronavirus was over 80. The figures are right but there are some health warnings that come with them. Last yearâs Covid epidemic brought the UKâs death rates back to where they stood 13 years before, in 2008. Death rates are supposed to get better every year. Undoing more than a decadeâs worth of progress in one fell swoop just doesnât happen in ordinary times. Itâs like losing 13 yearsâ GDP growth in a single year: it would be a national economic emergency, even if it only brought the UKâs economy back to where it was in 2008. Onto the second claim: most people who die with Covid are elderly - three-quarters of Covid deaths have been in those over 75. But that doesnât mean they were all on deathâs doorstep. Even if youâre an 80-year-old, overweight man with diabetes who smokes, your life expectancyis around four more years,external. So, many of the 150,000 people who have died with Covid have likely lost years of life. Saajan Radia said he would be unable to visit his wife's family People in Leicester have been giving the BBC their reaction to India being added to the UK travel ""red list"". Travel agent Nisha Ganatra, of Citibond Travel, said she was braced for the cancellation of trips to India. ""Most of the people, 99% will cancel now,"" she said. ""It is quite difficult for us - there is no money for us. We're not making anything at all."" And Saajan Radia, also from Leicester, said as his wife's family is in India, they usually visit at least once a year. ""Since last year we've not been able to go,"" he said, adding how difficult it was for the family to have ""that uncertainty of not being able to see my kids' grandparents"". Surges of Covid are happening again around the world, driven by some new subvariants of Omicron. Matt Hancock has been urged to resolve concerns about food provision for people in quarantine hotels, particularly for those who are fasting during Ramadan - which is currently being observed. Labour MP Imran Hussain called on Hancock to ""urgently resolve this frankly absolutely shambolic situation with the booking system"" and to ensure food ""meets the faith and dietary requirements of travellers particularly those fasting during Ramadan"". Hancock said the government was ""very careful"" to ensure the majority of those who have to go through managed quarantine have a good experience and said he would make sure public health minister Jo Churchill met with Hussain to hear about individual concerns. He added that ""making sure that food provision is appropriate for those fasting at Ramadan"" was ""very important"". Reality Check As we've been reporting, India will be added to the UK's so-called red list - meaning there will be strict restrictions on travel between the countries from Friday. It has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April, and near neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh have both been on the red list since 9 April. Criteria for being added to the list include how good a country's testing is, how many cases have been identified, and whether the country has exported new variants of concern. As of 13 April, Bangladesh, which had the South Africa variant but not the Brazil variant, and Pakistan, which had neither, were on the list. But India, which had both, was not added for another two weeks. ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, says. Read more here. People who live, work or travel in various parts of the UK are being urged to get a Covid test. During the health secretary's appearance in the Commons earlier, Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, questioned why India was not put on the red list sooner. She said: ""Hong Kong this week have identified 47 Covid cases just on a single Delhi flight and we have still 16 more direct flights, many more indirect flights from India to here before Friday alone."" Matt Hancock said decisions on each country were ""kept under constant review"". The world has the means to
bring the pandemic under control within months, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. ""We have the tools to bring this pandemic under control in a
matter of months, if we apply them consistently and equitably,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying at a daily news briefing. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joined the briefing from Sweden as a guest, condemned what she said was the ""tragedy"" of vaccine inequity as she donated â¬100,000 ($120,000) from her foundation to Covax, the scheme aiming to give global access to Covid-19 vaccines.

""We have the means at our disposal to correct the great imbalance that exists around the world today in the fight against Covid-19. Just as with the climate crisis, we must help those who are the most vulnerable first,"" the 18-year-old added. India is being added to the red list of countries from which travel is banned, we heard in the House of Commons this afternoon. It means Britons arriving from India will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days when they get back. Anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen will be banned from entering if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. But is that new rule for England, or is it the whole of the UK? Well, technically, as public health is determined by individual nations, it only concerns England. As there are no international flights into Wales or Northern Ireland however, they tend to fall into line with England's decisions. And there are no quarantine hotels in Wales or Northern Ireland either. Scotland currently requires hotel quarantine for all international arrivals at the moment anyway, so today's announcement makes no difference to anyone landing there. Here's an explainer on which countries are currently on the red list and exactly what it means for travellers. Airline Virgin Atlantic says it will continue to operate its flights to India until the country officially joins the UK travel red list at 04.00 BST on Friday. ""Our flights between London Heathrow and Delhi and Mumbai will be departing as scheduled until 23 April, with all customers arriving in England subject to a pre-departure Covid-19 test and 10-day self-isolation at home, with two further PCR tests,"" it says. The airline is reviewing its schedule of India operations from Friday and says customers should check their flight status. Virgin is due to operate one flight from Mumbai and one flight from Delhi to the UK before Friday's change. As has been mentioned by Matt Hancock,the government data,externalshows more than 10 million people have now received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. The figures show that up to Sunday 32,932,448 first doses had been given in the UK - a rise of 83,225 on the previous day. There have also been 10,152,039 second doses, an increase of 221,193. As we reported earlier, the Indian capital, Delhi, is due to go into lockdown  for a week after a record spike in cases overwhelmed the city's healthcare system. The city had imposed a weekend curfew, but reported its highest single-day spike so far on Sunday - 24,462 cases. It has almost run out of beds at hospital intensive care units and oxygen is in short supply, the city's chief minister said earlier. Crematoriums in the area are also overwhelmed. One in three people in Delhi is testing positive, the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from the city. Separately, the Indian government has said all adults will be eligible to get a coronavirus vaccination from the start of next month. India has been reeling from a deadly second wave since the start of April. Read more here. Back to the Commons, where SNP health spokeswoman Dr Philippa Whitford asked if Matt Hancock recognised the need for a ""more coordinated global response"" to allow a safer return to international travel and business. Hancock replied he agreed on that, saying international collaboration was something he, along with the foreign secretary and prime minister, were working ""incredibly hard"" on. He said they were using the presidency of the G7 and the ""enthusiasm of the new administration"" in the US, under President Joe Biden, to ""try to drive that"". Hancock said in particular, they were looking for collaboration ""amongst like-minded democracies in favour of an open and transparent science-led response to pandemics"".   The UK has reported four new deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,the lowest figure since September,external. You have to go back to 7 September for a day when fewer deaths, three, were reported across the country. Due to lags in reporting, figures are often lower at the start of the week, and some deaths which have occurred in the past 24 hours may not yet have made it into the daily figures. Wales has begun to report on a six-day basis with Monday's figure covering a 48-hour period. The UK has recorded 127,274 Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test since the start of the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has finished updating MPs on coronavirus developments.

Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league?Europe's biggest teams have suffered during the Covid pandemic and say they want financial stability.,"Plans for a new football European Super League (ESL) have collapsed, following the withdrawal of most of the teams involved. The decision follows a massive backlash against the league, which had the support of some of the world's biggest clubs. Six English Premier League teams had signed up to the ESL - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. They joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid as founder members. The idea was for the clubs to remain in their national leagues, but also to play each other in a new midweek European competition, which would have rivalled the Champions League. The ESL would have had 20 teams, of which 15 founding members would be permanent and never face relegation. Five other sides would qualify each year. All six English Premier League clubs dropped out of the project on Tuesday night. They have now been followed by Atletico Madrid in Spain and Italian team Inter Milan. One of the chief movers behind the ESL, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, has now admitted that the ESL is not likely to go ahead. ""I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,"" he said. ""But evidently no, I don't think that project is now still up and running."" ESL 'cannot now proceed' How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded With 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics said it would have devalued the game because it was unfair and uncompetitive. For instance, Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League since the 2016-17 season, but they would have been guaranteed a place - regardless of how they performed in the domestic league. However, a future winner of the Premier League would not necessarily have qualified for the ESL if they were not a permanent member. If this were the case, that team would miss out on millions of pounds in revenue. The ESL attracted widespread criticism from pundits, players, MPs and most football bodies not involved. Fans of the clubs involved held several protests outside their grounds. Chelsea fans protest against plans for a European Super League ahead of the club's game against Brighton It appears they were taken aback by the strength of criticism. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to supporters and the ""wider football community"". Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the ""anxiety and upset"" caused by the proposal. Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders,"" in making their decision. Real Madrid president Florentino Perezhad claimed it would ""save football"", at a time when young people are ""no longer interested"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". The founding clubs were promised a share of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan. Most are in considerable debt,made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators. Big clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries. If they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses. Super League makes financial sense for top clubs The 20-team league would have been split into two groups of 10, playing each other at home and away. The top three in each group would have qualified for the quarter-finals, with the fourth and fifth-placed teams competing in a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. It would then have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May. The president of Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations), Aleksander Ceferin, had warned that participating clubs could be banned from European competition, and their players prevented from appearing at the Euros and the World Cup. Mr Ceferin welcomed the English clubs' reversal, saying, ""the important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this, and move forward together"".

"'Only sensible' to cancel India trip, says JohnsonThe PM's visit has been called off amid concerns over rising Covid cases in the country.UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson postpones his trip to India, saying it was ""only sensible"" with its rising coronavirus cases. Boris Johnson has said it was ""only sensible"" to cancel his trip to India, due to take place next Monday. India has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily and has been added to the UK's ""red list"", meaning people returning from there must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. The PM said he would instead speak to his counterpart Narendra Modi online. The trip - aimed at boosting trade and investment ties - had originally been due to take place in January. But it was called off because of the UK lockdown. The second cancellation comes as a Covid variant is spreading in India, with its government confirming 1,620 deaths from the virus on Sunday. The capital Delhi has been put into lockdown. How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave What is the Indian variant? Delhi announces lockdown as Covid cases surge UK health officials are investigating whether the variant, first found in India, spreads more easily and is able to resist the vaccine. Public Health England says 103 cases have been detected in England, with four more recorded in Scotland. Speaking on a visit to Bath, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""You can see around the world that the virus is still going up in a number of places. We need to be very careful about that."" Asked about his cancelled India visit, the prime minister said it was ""frustrating"" but ""Narendra Modi and I have basically come to the conclusion that, very sadly, I won't be able to go ahead with the trip. ""I do think it's only sensible to postpone, given what's happened in India, the shape of the pandemic there."" The prime minister added that countries around the world had ""a massive amount of sympathy with India, what they're going through"", and that the UK's relationship with India was of ""huge importance"". The trip - billed as Mr Johnson's first major overseas visit since entering Downing Street - had been set up to move the two countries nearer to a post-Brexit trade agreement. To cancel one prime ministerial trip to India is unfortunate. To cancel twice isâ¦ The government wants a trade deal with Delhi. Or to start talks about a trade deal with Delhi, at the very least. That could become a little bit harder now that Boris Johnson's tour has been cancelled for a second time. Hence why the prime minister wants to keep up the contact with his counterpart Narendra Modi virtually, and is flagging other opportunities for them to meet face to face, such as this summer's G7 summit in Cornwall. But is that meeting now in doubt, as coronavirus interrupts the travel plans of world leaders just as much as the rest of us? And some observers say that the logistics of dealing with India is the easy part, and negotiating a trade deal will be significantly harder. Last week, Downing Street said it would be scaled down - with the bulk of the meetings taking place on Monday 26 April, rather than across four days as originally planned. But Labour argued the trip should be cancelled entirely and that the two prime ministers should talk via Zoom. One senior Conservative also told the BBC it would have been ""absurd"" for the trip go ahead. The prime minister's official spokesman said there was not ""one single factor"" behind the cancellation, but the situation in India was ""challenging"" and that it was ""not the right time for a visit."" He added that Mr Johnson and Mr Modi would meet in person later this year.

The PM said he would instead speak to his counterpart Narendra Modi online. The trip - aimed at boosting trade and investment ties - had originally been due to take place in January. But it was called off because of the UK lockdown. The second cancellation comes as a Covid variant is spreading in India, with its government confirming 1,620 deaths from the virus on Sunday. The capital Delhi has been put into lockdown. How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave What is the Indian variant? Delhi announces lockdown as Covid cases surge UK health officials are investigating whether the variant, first found in India, spreads more easily and is able to resist the vaccine. Public Health England says 103 cases have been detected in England, with four more recorded in Scotland. Speaking on a visit to Bath, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""You can see around the world that the virus is still going up in a number of places. We need to be very careful about that."" Asked about his cancelled India visit, the prime minister said it was ""frustrating"" but ""Narendra Modi and I have basically come to the conclusion that, very sadly, I won't be able to go ahead with the trip. ""I do think it's only sensible to postpone, given what's happened in India, the shape of the pandemic there."" The prime minister added that countries around the world had ""a massive amount of sympathy with India, what they're going through"", and that the UK's relationship with India was of ""huge importance"". The trip - billed as Mr Johnson's first major overseas visit since entering Downing Street - had been set up to move the two countries nearer to a post-Brexit trade agreement. To cancel one prime ministerial trip to India is unfortunate. To cancel twice isâ¦ The government wants a trade deal with Delhi. Or to start talks about a trade deal with Delhi, at the very least. That could become a little bit harder now that Boris Johnson's tour has been cancelled for a second time. Hence why the prime minister wants to keep up the contact with his counterpart Narendra Modi virtually, and is flagging other opportunities for them to meet face to face, such as this summer's G7 summit in Cornwall. But is that meeting now in doubt, as coronavirus interrupts the travel plans of world leaders just as much as the rest of us? And some observers say that the logistics of dealing with India is the easy part, and negotiating a trade deal will be significantly harder. Last week, Downing Street said it would be scaled down - with the bulk of the meetings taking place on Monday 26 April, rather than across four days as originally planned. But Labour argued the trip should be cancelled entirely and that the two prime ministers should talk via Zoom. One senior Conservative also told the BBC it would have been ""absurd"" for the trip go ahead. The prime minister's official spokesman said there was not ""one single factor"" behind the cancellation, but the situation in India was ""challenging"" and that it was ""not the right time for a visit.""

"Low-deposit mortgage scheme launchedFirst-time buyers will get cheaper deals if they can stretch to a bigger deposit, analysts say.Business","High Street lenders are now starting to offer mortgages to borrowers offering a deposit of just 5% under a new government guarantee scheme. The policy, announced in the Budget, is designed to help more first-time buyers secure a home. But the launch comes as average house prices in the UK continue to rise to record levels. Analysts also suggest that cheaper deals are available for those able to stretch to a 10% deposit. When does the stamp duty holiday extension end? Ten ways the Budget will affect you Home movers 'have a spring in their step' The scheme is similar to policies previously used to boost the housing market and the economy, as well as offering support to those buying a home for the first time. The new scheme will be available to anyone buying a home costing up to Â£600,000, unless they are buy-to-let or second homes. The government is offering a partial guarantee, generally of 15%, to compensate lenders if the borrower defaults on repayments. Karen Wright, 41, runs a beauty salon in Cheshire, while her husband Christopher, 33, is a joiner. As self-employed people, they have both been hit hard by the pandemic, with Karen's salon closed for five months out of the past year. That's made it all the more difficult to save for a deposit for their dream home. ""We've been renting since 2010,"" says Karen, ""but we want something that's a 'forever' home for us. ""Trying to save up 20% is very difficult, but with this scheme, we might be able to pay down more than we thought we could and be able to come within the budget of what we currently pay in the rental market."" The couple are keen to find a three-bedroom house in the Wirral, so their two children can each have a room of their own. ""It's not the cheapest area, but we're looking for something we can maybe do up, utilising my husband's skills."" The guarantee is designed to give lenders the confidence to offer 95% loan-to-value mortgages - many of which were withdrawn during the Covid crisis. Lloyds, Santander, Barclays, HSBC andÂ NatWestÂ are starting to offer products this week and Virgin Money will do so next month.Â However, some lenders such as Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, and Barclays have said that these products will not be available for new-build properties. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Every new homeowner and moverÂ supportsÂ jobs right across the housingÂ sector, butÂ saving for a big enough deposit can be hard, especially for first-time buyers.Â Â ""By giving lenders the option of a government guarantee on 95% mortgages, many more products will become available, boosting the sector, creating new jobs and helping people achieve their dream of owning their own home."" However, lenders will still carry out affordability checks. Anyone who has lost a job, or whose income has been sporadic owing to the pandemic's effect on employment may find it difficult to secure a mortgage. House prices have been rising - partly because of government stimulus, and there are concerns too about the potential for some to fall into negative equity if this is followed by sharp falls in property values. Some of the new mortgage rates are close to 4% for a two-year fixed rate deal. For example, rates on NatWest's new 95% mortgages will start at 3.9%. Lloyd Cochran, head of mortgages at NatWest, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It reflects the extra risk the bank is taking on. I think over the long term that is a pretty competitive rate for customers. ""One of the things we do is ensure that the customer can afford that rate. We also ensure... the customer can afford that loan if interest rates were to rise."" However, analysts say rates could be cut significantly, by as much as 0.75 of a percentage point, for borrowers able to stretch to a 10% deposit. ""With more lenders poised to launch deals for this sector of the market, [borrowers] level of choice should hopefully increase even further,"" said Eleanor Williams, from financial information service Moneyfacts. ""Increased competition within the higher loan-to-value tiers will hopefully translate to more competitive rates for these borrowers.""

New draft hospitality Covid guidance a 'bombshell',"A Scottish restaurant owner has described new draft hospitality Covid guidance as a ""bombshell"". The sector had expected that 1m (3ft) social distancing would apply between tables when it reopens next Monday. But the new proposals state people from different households will now have to observe social distancing at tables. The government said it had worked with industry and unions to ensure its guidance was ""evidence-based, fair and ethical, clear and realistic"". When Scotland moves to level three next MondayÂ the hospitality sector will be able to sell alcohol outdoors to a maximum group of six people from six households. The sale of alcohol indoors will not be permitted, however, a maximum of six people from two households will be able to meet indoors and premises will close at 20:00.Â Â How ready is Scotland to unlock? What Covid rules are changing, and when? How are the Covid numbers looking in Scotland? Carina Contini, co-owner of Cantini restaurants in Edinburgh, said she was feeling ""really optimistic"" until thenew guidance,externalwas published at 18:00 on Friday. She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""They have thrown us an absolute bombshell, an absolutely impossibility in terms of reopening. ""The bookings that we have already got we will have to phone up and say 'I'm sorry we can't honour your booking because we can't host this level of capacity'."" Ms Contini said she would also have to let down suppliers and her staff. She added: ""It is absolutely going to be crippling for the sector."" She said the rules were completely impractical. ""If I was catering for six people at a table, I would have to have a table that is 3.5m (11ft) long,"" she said. ""There is not a restaurant supplier in the country that makes tables that are 3.5m long. ""Elderly couples who may be hard of hearing are going to have to FaceTime themselves over lunch because the distance is so far away."" Ms Contini also criticised the short notice, ahead of the sector's planned reopening next Monday, and urged the Scottish government to reconsider. She added: ""These regulations are now more harmful, more dangerous to our business than Covid itself."" The hospitality industry has been hit hard by the pandemic Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, emphasised that the guidance was draft. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""It is extremely important that the sector have the opportunity to comment, to express their concerns and to see what is feasible for them. ""I imagine the reason the 1m requirement between different household members is in place is to provide additional protection but the government has to balance up additional harms at the moment."" Meanwhile, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of an ""impending unemployment tsunami"" and said a majority of businesses had run out of money to pay furlough contributions and fixed costs. It also highlighted a recent survey of its members which found the average Covid-related debt was Â£150,000 or more per premises. NTIA spokesman Gavin Stevenson said: ""Many of our members have been closed for over a year now, and virtually all have suffered crippling financial losses. ""In short, the money going out every month has been far greater than the money coming in, and government support has typically covered less than a quarter of this deficit."" ""To add insult to injury government support has now ended while there is no end date to forced closure and other restrictions."" He called on the Scottish government to provide ""substantial and immediate"" additional support for as long as businesses remain closed and operate under ""unviable"" restrictions. Alternatively, he said his members needed a ""clear route map"" with target dates for the end of all legal restrictions on capacity, activity and opening hours. April 12 2021: Pubgoers gathered at outdoor bars in Old Compton Street in London's Soho The Scottish government said the draft guidance ""may be amended subject to comments received to take into account engagement with stakeholders."" A spokesman added: ""The requirement to physical distance has been established for some time and businesses are already following existing sectoral advice on this. The draft guidance builds on that but does not introduce significant change."" He added that it would help businesses due to open next week do so ""as safely as possible"" and provided guidance on how business owners could calculate maximum capacity on their premises. Last weekhospitality and tourism leaders in Scotlandcriticised the Covid restrictions which prevent the sector from reopening. And they warned that waiting two weeks before reopening would come at a cost to Scotland's economy of Â£20m. They were speaking asEngland's lockdown rules eased further, with pub gardens and restaurants among the places able to reopen. South of the borderpeople can now visit bars and restaurants outdoors but must either follow therule of six, or be in a group of any size with no more than two households present. Tables must be socially distanced. The First Minister is set to confirm what she's been signalling for some time - hospitality will re-open in Scotland next Monday, April 26. There will be restrictions on the industry, and one measure that many owners find frustrating is one metre social distancing. This is the same rule that was in place last year. It means there should be one metre between any customers who are not part of the same household, even if they are at the same table. It's not hard to work out why this isn't popular with some industry figures - social distancing (even at one metre) means fewer customers can fit in. But the virus is still circulating, and measures like this are designed to lower transmission risk. Other changes scheduled for April 26 should go ahead as planned. Gyms and shops will re-open, and travel between Scotland, England and Wales should be possible. But it's unlikely further changes will be accelerated. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

The sale of alcohol indoors will not be permitted, however, a maximum of six people from two households will be able to meet indoors and premises will close at 20:00.Â Â How ready is Scotland to unlock? What Covid rules are changing, and when? How are the Covid numbers looking in Scotland? Carina Contini, co-owner of Cantini restaurants in Edinburgh, said she was feeling ""really optimistic"" until thenew guidance,externalwas published at 18:00 on Friday. She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""They have thrown us an absolute bombshell, an absolutely impossibility in terms of reopening. ""The bookings that we have already got we will have to phone up and say 'I'm sorry we can't honour your booking because we can't host this level of capacity'."" Ms Contini said she would also have to let down suppliers and her staff. She added: ""It is absolutely going to be crippling for the sector."" She said the rules were completely impractical. ""If I was catering for six people at a table, I would have to have a table that is 3.5m (11ft) long,"" she said. ""There is not a restaurant supplier in the country that makes tables that are 3.5m long. ""Elderly couples who may be hard of hearing are going to have to FaceTime themselves over lunch because the distance is so far away."" Ms Contini also criticised the short notice, ahead of the sector's planned reopening next Monday, and urged the Scottish government to reconsider. She added: ""These regulations are now more harmful, more dangerous to our business than Covid itself."" The hospitality industry has been hit hard by the pandemic Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, emphasised that the guidance was draft. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""It is extremely important that the sector have the opportunity to comment, to express their concerns and to see what is feasible for them. ""I imagine the reason the 1m requirement between different household members is in place is to provide additional protection but the government has to balance up additional harms at the moment."" Meanwhile, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned of an ""impending unemployment tsunami"" and said a majority of businesses had run out of money to pay furlough contributions and fixed costs. It also highlighted a recent survey of its members which found the average Covid-related debt was Â£150,000 or more per premises. NTIA spokesman Gavin Stevenson said: ""Many of our members have been closed for over a year now, and virtually all have suffered crippling financial losses. ""In short, the money going out every month has been far greater than the money coming in, and government support has typically covered less than a quarter of this deficit."" ""To add insult to injury government support has now ended while there is no end date to forced closure and other restrictions."" He called on the Scottish government to provide ""substantial and immediate"" additional support for as long as businesses remain closed and operate under ""unviable"" restrictions. Alternatively, he said his members needed a ""clear route map"" with target dates for the end of all legal restrictions on capacity, activity and opening hours. April 12 2021: Pubgoers gathered at outdoor bars in Old Compton Street in London's Soho The Scottish government said the draft guidance ""may be amended subject to comments received to take into account engagement with stakeholders."" A spokesman added: ""The requirement to physical distance has been established for some time and businesses are already following existing sectoral advice on this. The draft guidance builds on that but does not introduce significant change."" He added that it would help businesses due to open next week do so ""as safely as possible"" and provided guidance on how business owners could calculate maximum capacity on their premises. Last weekhospitality and tourism leaders in Scotlandcriticised the Covid restrictions which prevent the sector from reopening. And they warned that waiting two weeks before reopening would come at a cost to Scotland's economy of Â£20m. They were speaking asEngland's lockdown rules eased further, with pub gardens and restaurants among the places able to reopen. South of the borderpeople can now visit bars and restaurants outdoors but must either follow therule of six, or be in a group of any size with no more than two households present. Tables must be socially distanced. The First Minister is set to confirm what she's been signalling for some time - hospitality will re-open in Scotland next Monday, April 26. There will be restrictions on the industry, and one measure that many owners find frustrating is one metre social distancing. This is the same rule that was in place last year. It means there should be one metre between any customers who are not part of the same household, even if they are at the same table. It's not hard to work out why this isn't popular with some industry figures - social distancing (even at one metre) means fewer customers can fit in. But the virus is still circulating, and measures like this are designed to lower transmission risk. Other changes scheduled for April 26 should go ahead as planned. Gyms and shops will re-open, and travel between Scotland, England and Wales should be possible. But it's unlikely further changes will be accelerated. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

'Big Six' agree to join European Super League,"This video can not be played 'It's a time of great concern' - Lineker on European Super League Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 clubs who have agreed to join a new European Super League (ESL). In a seismic move for European football, the Premier League clubs will join AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid. The ESL said the founding clubs had agreed to establish a ""new midweek competition"" with teams continuing to ""compete in their respective national leagues"". European Super League a 'grotesque concept', says Villa chief executive Purslow 'I'm disappointed and disgusted' - ex-Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Murphy 'A bonfire of greed' - how Europe reacted to the Super League 'Football pyramid must be protected' - Rooney It said the inaugural season was ""intended to commence as soon as practicable"" and ""anticipated that a further three clubs"" would join the breakaway. The ESL said it also planned to launch a women's competition as soon as possible after the men's tournament starts. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Uefa and the Premier Leaguecondemned the movewhen the news broke on Sunday. And speaking on Monday, he said the government was ""going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed"". Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Gloucestershire, he said: ""I don't think that it is good news for fans, I don't think it's good news for football in this country."" The 14 Premier League clubs not signed up to the ESL will meet on Tuesday to assess the proposals and consider a response. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Critics say the move is being driven purely by money, would destroy domestic leagues and is against the integrity of the sport. Unlike the Champions League, which teams must qualify for, the ESL would include the same 15 teams every year, with the remaining five qualifying annually. World governing body Fifa had previously said itwould not recognise such a competition,and any players involved could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Uefa, Europe's governing body, reiterated that warning on Sunday when it said players involved would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. After the ESL was announced, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"". The ESL has sent a letter to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and Uefa boss Aleksander Ceferin issuing notice of legal proceedings in European courts designed to block any sanctions the two governing bodies may try enforce over the formation of the ESL. In a statement, the ESL said: ""Going forward, the founding clubs look forward to holding discussions with Uefa and Fifa to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new league and for football as a whole."" This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League There were talks in October, involving Wall Street bank JP Morgan, overa new Â£4.6bn competitionthat would replace the Champions League. Uefa had hoped the plans fora new 36-team Champions League- with reforms confirmed on Monday - would head off the formation of a Super League. However, the 12 sides involved in the Super League do not think the reforms go far enough. They said the global pandemic had ""accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model"". ""In recent months, extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions,"" they added. ""The founding clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid."" Super League: Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new tournament? Younger fans happier about prospect of breakaway league - December 2020 poll Tell us your thoughts on the proposals. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The league will have 20 teams - the 12 founding members plus the three unnamed clubs they expect to join soon, and five sides who qualify annually according to their domestic achievements. Under the proposals, the ESL campaign would start in August each year, with midweek fixtures, and the clubs would be split into two groups of 10, playing each other home and away. The top three in each group would qualify for the quarter-finals, with the teams in fourth and fifth playing a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. From then on, it would have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League before a single-leg final in May at a neutral venue. The ESL said it would generate more money than the Champions League and would result in a greater distribution of revenue throughout the game. Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, the first chairman of the ESL, said the new competition would ""help football at every level"". ""Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires,"" he added. Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli has resigned from the Uefa executive committee and as chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), which had pushed the planned Champions League reforms. He said the 12 clubs had ""come together at this critical moment, enabling European competition to be transformed, putting the game we love on a sustainable footing for the long-term future"". It is understood all 12 clubs have resigned from the ECA and their respective representatives from the ECA board. Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano have also stood down from their roles at Uefa. Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer will be a vice-chairman of the Super League. He said: ""By bringing together the world's greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid."" Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund have said they will not be joining and are committed to the ECA, along with fellow German side Bayern Munich. Liverpool and Manchester United are the two most successful sides in English football history Essentially, widespread condemnation from anyone not involved in the proposed league. Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"". He said: ""These clubs are not just great global brands - of course they're great global brands - they're also clubs that have originated historically from their towns, from their cities, from their local communities, they should have a link with those fans, and with the fan base in their community. ""So it is very, very important that that continues to be the case. I don't like the look of these proposals, and we'll be consulting about what we can do."" France's President Emmanuel Macron welcomed French clubs refusing to join. Uefa released a joint statement with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation, La Liga and the Italian Football Federation, as well as Serie A, saying they would ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using ""all available measures"". The ECA said it ""strongly opposed"" the league, while the Football Supporters' Association said the plans were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". World players' union Fifpro said it will ""vigorously oppose measures by either side that would impede the rights of players, such as exclusion from their national teams"". It added: ""This decision leaves players and their unions with many concerns and questions about its impact not only on the fabric and cultural identity of football but also more practically on their careers."" A protest sign outside Manchester United's Old Trafford ground The League Managers Association said a Super League would be ""catastrophically destabilising to the entire European football pyramid, with deep and far-reaching consequences"". It added: ""Closing off the top of the pyramid of European club football would immediately extinguish many of the ambitions and dreams that drive managers, coaches, players and fans."" Former Portugal midfielder Luis Figotweeted:,external""This greedy and callous move would spell disaster for our grassroots, for women's football, and the wider football community only to serve self-interested owners, who stopped caring about their fans long ago, and [show] complete disregard for sporting merit. Tragic."" Paris St-Germain and former Manchester United midfielder Ander Herreratweeted:,external""I fell in love with popular football, with the football of the fans, with the dream of seeing the team of my heart compete against the greatest. ""If this European super league advances, those dreams are over. ""I love football and I cannot remain silent about this, I believe in an improved Champions League, but not in the rich stealing what the people created."" Among ex-professionals, former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport the plans ""sound soulless"", former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports he was ""absolutely disgusted"", while former team-mate Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport that the proposals will hurt fans the most.

Fan groups associated with all six English clubs involved are strongly opposed to the Super League. Liverpool supporters' group Spirit of Shankly (SOS) said it was ""appalled"" by the decision of Fenway Sports Group, the club's US-based owner. In a social media post, SOS said: ""FSG have ignored fans in their relentless and greedy pursuit of money. Football is ours, not theirs. Our football club is ours not theirs."" Chelsea Supporters' Trust called the move ""unforgivable"" and said its members and ""football supporters across the world have experienced the ultimate betrayal"". The Arsenal Supporters' Trust called the club's agreement to join ""the death of Arsenal as a sporting institution"". Manchester City's Official Supporters Club said the move showed ""those involved have zero regard for the game's traditions"", adding it was ""determined to fight against this proposed Super League"". The Manchester United Supporters' Trust had earlier said the proposals were ""completely unacceptable"" and the ESL ""goes against everything football, and Manchester United, should stand for"". Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said the ESL was a ""concept driven by avarice and self-interest at the expense of the intrinsic values of the game we hold so dear"". BBC Sport's Simon Stone If there was any lingering doubt over the desire of these 12 clubs to launch their own competition, it has been removed by their statement - reinforced by each of them through their own media platforms. So many questions remain unanswered. Chiefly, can they actually get their plan over the line given the strong resistance from Uefa and the leagues and associations of the countries concerned? But beyond that, who will the other three clubs be to make up the 15 founding members? Will Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain eventually join up? And how will the other five clubs be decided? These discussions will be fascinating. But right now, the clubs who have signed up to the European Super League have a public relations battle to turn around perceptions - because initial reaction has been overwhelmingly negative.

There will be more on the European Super League there as well as more reaction to Tottenham sacking Jose Mourinho. Thanks for all your comments and bye for now. Leeds United v Liverpool (20:00 BST) There is a match in the Premier League tonight as Leeds United take on last season's champions Liverpool. Leeds forwards Raphinha and Rodrigo are both doubts and will undergo late fitness tests. They are without captain Liam Cooper, who is suspended due to the red card he received in the victory over Manchester City. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is boosted by the news that he has no new injury concerns to contend with. Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson, Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk remain on the sidelines. And here is a clip of what we have been talking about as Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, tells Parliament that the UK Government will 'do everything' to prevent the European Super League from happening. This video can not be played Following Dowden's comments in Parliament, shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens
called this ""a watershed moment for our national game"". She said: ""Football governance
is broken, football finance is broken and football fans, whichever club we
support, are ignored. ""The hedge-fund owners and
billionaires who treat football clubs like any other of their commodities have no care
for history of our football, for the role it plays in villages, towns and
cities up and down our country and especially for the fans who are the
beating heart of it. ""They should understand their role
as custodians rather than cartel chiefs. The future of our national game
and all our clubs depend on it."" Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said the UK Government will be ""reviewing everything the Government does"" to
support the so-called big six football clubs who have decided to join the
European Super League. Making a statement on the matter in the
Commons, he said he has spoken to the football authorities,
adding: ""My message for them was clear: they have our full backing. ""But, be in no doubt, if they can't
act we will. We will put everything on the table to prevent this from
happening. We are examining every option from governance reform to competition
law and mechanisms that allow football to take place. ""Put simply, we will
be reviewing everything the Government does to support these clubs to play. I
have discussed these options with the Prime Minister this morning and we are
working at pace across Government and with football authorities. ""We will do everything it takes to protect our national game. These clubs have decided to put money ahead of fans."" Simon StoneBBC Sport PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has turned down the chance to
replace Andrea Agnelli as chairman of the European Clubsâ Association. The ECA is reeling from the resignation of all 12 clubs involved
in the planned European Super League. BBC Sport understands Al-Khelaifi was the first choice to take
over from Juventus chairman Agnelli, who was condemned for his behaviour in
joining the planned breakaway by UEFA president. However, Al Khelaifi is reluctant to add to his workload. BBC Sport has been told this is not the prelude to a move by PSG
to join the 12 clubs, as they hoped, and that Al Khelaifi has been speaking
with the ECA and Uefa today as the row that has engulfed them continues. #bbcfootball Ian Unsworth:I don't know why people are getting so stressed about this ESL when the answer is so simple - don't watch it. If there is no audience then it can't survive, the last 12 months should've taught people that. Peter Hart:People saying a super league will fail. It won't. They have realised they don't need local fans anymore. They've seen the empty stadiums and the millions watching in China and India and Africa etc and done the maths....2+2=$$$$$.

Byron Bay backlash over Netflix show plans,"Netflix described Byron Bay as the ""perfect setting"" for its new Australian reality show Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for a boycott of a proposed Netflix reality show to be set in the Australian beach town of Byron Bay. Anger has erupted in the community over the planned influencer-led series titled Byron Baes. The petition, which calls for a filming ban, argues the town will be used as a ""punch line"" for the show. Some businesses have refused to take part in the show, local media report. The picturesque town on the New South Wales north coast is known for its surf beaches and relaxed lifestyle. It has gained prominence in influencer culture and over the past year, has alsobecome a mecca for visiting Hollywood stars. Unveiling plans for the series last month, Netflix said: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that an influencer in possession of a good follower count must be in want of a beach backdrop.â£ ""And there's no better backdrop - or magnet for influencers - than Byron Bay, the perfect setting for our next Australian Netflix Original."" It said the ""docu-soap"" would follow ""hot Instagrammers living their best lives"". The plans have been met with frustration. ""It's a multinational company trying to exploit the town's name when the community doesn't want it and think they can just come in and use us as a commodity,"" local musicianBen Gordon, who owns cafe The Byron Bay General Store, told the Sydney Morning Herald,external. Locals are unhappy with the perception of Byron Bay that has grown in some parts of the media. They claim an unrealistic view of the town has emerged via social media, a glossy portrayal that doesn't reflect life for most locals. They point to a range of social and environmental challenges facing Byron Bay - and many want Netflix out.

Why do clubs want new league?,"Plans for a new football European Super League (ESL) have collapsed, following the withdrawal of most of the teams involved. The decision follows a massive backlash against the league, which had the support of some of the world's biggest clubs. Six English Premier League teams had signed up to the ESL - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. They joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid as founder members. The idea was for the clubs to remain in their national leagues, but also to play each other in a new midweek European competition, which would have rivalled the Champions League. The ESL would have had 20 teams, of which 15 founding members would be permanent and never face relegation. Five other sides would qualify each year. All six English Premier League clubs dropped out of the project on Tuesday night. They have now been followed by Atletico Madrid in Spain and Italian team Inter Milan. One of the chief movers behind the ESL, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, has now admitted that the ESL is not likely to go ahead. ""I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,"" he said. ""But evidently no, I don't think that project is now still up and running."" ESL 'cannot now proceed' How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded With 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics said it would have devalued the game because it was unfair and uncompetitive. For instance, Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League since the 2016-17 season, but they would have been guaranteed a place - regardless of how they performed in the domestic league. However, a future winner of the Premier League would not necessarily have qualified for the ESL if they were not a permanent member. If this were the case, that team would miss out on millions of pounds in revenue. The ESL attracted widespread criticism from pundits, players, MPs and most football bodies not involved. Fans of the clubs involved held several protests outside their grounds. Chelsea fans protest against plans for a European Super League ahead of the club's game against Brighton It appears they were taken aback by the strength of criticism. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to supporters and the ""wider football community"". Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the ""anxiety and upset"" caused by the proposal. Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders,"" in making their decision. Real Madrid president Florentino Perezhad claimed it would ""save football"", at a time when young people are ""no longer interested"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". The founding clubs were promised a share of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan. Most are in considerable debt,made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators. Big clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries. If they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses. Super League makes financial sense for top clubs The 20-team league would have been split into two groups of 10, playing each other at home and away. The top three in each group would have qualified for the quarter-finals, with the fourth and fifth-placed teams competing in a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. It would then have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May. The president of Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations), Aleksander Ceferin, had warned that participating clubs could be banned from European competition, and their players prevented from appearing at the Euros and the World Cup. Mr Ceferin welcomed the English clubs' reversal, saying, ""the important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this, and move forward together"". After the collapse of plans for a super league, the BBC discusses the future of football with current and former club bosses, fans and sport business experts in a specialWake Up To Money Business of Sport Podcast.

Uefa and PL condemn plan,"Liverpool and Chelsea are understood to be part of the group that have signed up to a breakaway league Uefa, the Premier League and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have condemned 12 major European clubs, including the 'big six' from England,signing up to a breakaway European Super League. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are part of the group. La Liga's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Serie A's AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus are involved. Uefa said it will use ""all measures"" possible to stop the ""cynical project"". Senior figures at European football's governing body are furious about the proposals. This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"" and that the UK government supports the sport's authorities ""in taking action"". He added: ""The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps."" The European Clubs' Association (ECA), which represents Europe's clubs, held an emergency meeting on Sunday in the wake of the reports. BBC Sport understands none of the clubs mentioned in the Super League reports responded to a request to attend the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar. Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain were among the clubs who were present. In a statement the ECA said it would be ""strongly opposed"" to a ""closed super league model"". It has pushedplans for a 36-team Champions League,which Uefa had hoped would head off the formation of a Super League. The Champions League reforms are set to be confirmed on Monday. BBC Sport was told last week of plans for some sort of confirmation about a European Super League. Uefa released a joint statement, together with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as well as Serie A, on Sunday. They said they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using both judicial and sporting measures if required. They also reiterated Fifa's stance that players taking part in the Super League would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. In a separate statement, the Premier League said it condemned the proposal as it ""attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart"" of domestic and European football. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement the government is ""concerned this plan could create a closed shop at the very top of our national game"". He added: ""We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities. This video can not be played A European Super League: The future of football? ""I would be bitterly disappointed to see any action that destroys that."" Labour leader Keir Starmer said the clubs involved should ""rethink immediately"" or ""face the consequences of their actions"". ""This proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers,"" he said. Juventus owner Andrea Agnelli, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis would all have had a significant input into the Champions League discussions on Friday. However, those clubs are among those to have broken ranks, to the fury of Uefa, whose president Aleksander Ceferin wanted to stave off a Super League threat. The Premier League said a European Super League would ""destroy"" the dream of fans that ""their team may climb to the top and play against the best"". It added such a league would ""undermine the appeal of the whole game"" and that they would work with the FA, the English Football League, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), League Managers Association (LMA) and fans to ""defend the integrity and future prospects of English football"". Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans The FA said it will ""not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football"" and will ""take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary"" to stop it. Bundesliga sides are opposed to the plans because the German model means commercial investors cannot have more than a 49% stake in clubs, so fans hold a majority of their own voting rights. French Ligue 1 side Paris St-Germain are not part of the group either. Uefa said it thanked ""those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up"" to the breakaway league. ""We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced,"" it added. ""This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough."" Quite when the European Super League would start is unclear. However, world governing bodyFifa has already said it would not recognise such a competitionand any players involved in it would be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Serie A has called an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter. The Football Supporters' Association said it is ""totally opposed"" to the plans, which it said were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom."" The PFA said it had ""substantial concerns"" about the proposal, adding it would ""detract from the strength and joy of domestic football and diminish the game for the vast majority of fans across the continent"". France's President Emmanuel Macron said he ""welcomes the position of French clubs to refuse to participate"" in a European Super League ""that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit"". A statement from the French presidency added: ""The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP [France's professional leagues governing body], FFF [France's football association], Uefa and Fifa to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European."" It has been agreed the new-look Champions League will involve an initial phase where every club plays 10 matches each rather than the current group phase. In addition there would be play-offs, followed by a knockout phase. The most controversial aspect of the proposals surround the allocation of the four additional places, with two being reserved for the clubs ranked highest in Uefa's coefficient table who fail to qualify for the Champions League through their domestic competition, but do secure some kind of European football. At the moment, Liverpool and Chelsea would be the clubs who benefited from that system if it was in place this season. Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville said he is ""absolutely disgusted"" by the plans. ""I'm a Manchester United fan and have been for 40 years,"" Neville, who also co-owns League Two club Salford City, told Sky Sports. ""It's an absolute disgrace. ""Honestly, we have to wrestle back the power in this country from the clubs at the top of this league and that includes my club."" The former England defender said the six English clubs involved should be docked points and fined. ""It's pure greed,"" Neville said. ""They're [the club's owners] imposters. ""They're nothing to do with football in this country. There's 100-odd years of history in this country of fans who have lived and loved these clubs. ""We're in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Football clubs in the [semi-professional] National League are going bust, furloughing players and these lot are having Zoom calls about breaking away. ""Dock them all points tomorrow. Put them at the bottom of the league and take the money off them. Seriously. You have to stamp on this.""

Rooney, who is United and England's all-time top scorer, said he wanted the English pyramid to be ""protected and rewarded"" and called the timing of the announcement ""strange"". ""The people in charge of these clubs are not stupid. We'll have to wait to see what the plans are,"" he said. ""I don't think it would be a great look to pull away from cup competitions but let's see what the proposals are."" We're getting some pictures coming through of some angry fans outside the grounds of the six English clubs that have agreed to join the European Super League. At Old Trafford... ...at Anfield... ...and at Tottenham's training ground. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker says the potential for a new European Super League ""is a time of great concern"". The former England captain believes it could have ""massive ramifications on our game in this country and will wreck the pyramid system"".

If anyone should get thrown out of football it's those owners. Bad luck to City and Chelsea as will affect them more than most! Ralph Brooker:Agree with comments saying let them do it. Let ESL fail. Eventually it will (ticket costs, travel). Then those clubs go to non-league. Similar problems are happening in cricket (though greed is less a motive, lower wages). But already Test & county squads suffering. Ben Green:Will be really interesting to hear a statement from players in the big 6. I think the clubs as employers will fall foul of employment laws if their decision prevents the players being part of the current FIFA structure, which their contracts are based on. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire has been talking to BBC Radio 5 Live and running through the numbers how the European Super League (if it ever goes ahead) would be funded.

McAllister, a footballer turned professor of politics and sports governance, is aiming to become the first Welsh person to be elected to the Fifa Council - and the first woman from any UK nation to sit at football's top table. The European Super League has not just been criticised in England, in Italy the front page of daily newspaper TuttoSport says ""Are you crazy? The Super League kills football'. A plan by some of the world's biggest football clubs to start a new European Super League (ESL), has provoked strong opposition. The clubs involved say the ESL will benefit football as a whole, but critics say it's driven by greed. We have a story on our business pages which looks at the financial reasons why these clubs have pushed for the ESL. Read the feature here.

"'Big Six' agree to join European Super LeagueManchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham are among 12 clubs in the new ""mid-week competition"".","This video can not be played 'It's a time of great concern' - Lineker on European Super League Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 clubs who have agreed to join a new European Super League (ESL). In a seismic move for European football, the Premier League clubs will join AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid. The ESL said the founding clubs had agreed to establish a ""new midweek competition"" with teams continuing to ""compete in their respective national leagues"". European Super League a 'grotesque concept', says Villa chief executive Purslow 'I'm disappointed and disgusted' - ex-Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Murphy 'A bonfire of greed' - how Europe reacted to the Super League 'Football pyramid must be protected' - Rooney It said the inaugural season was ""intended to commence as soon as practicable"" and ""anticipated that a further three clubs"" would join the breakaway. The ESL said it also planned to launch a women's competition as soon as possible after the men's tournament starts. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Uefa and the Premier Leaguecondemned the movewhen the news broke on Sunday. And speaking on Monday, he said the government was ""going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed"". Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Gloucestershire, he said: ""I don't think that it is good news for fans, I don't think it's good news for football in this country."" The 14 Premier League clubs not signed up to the ESL will meet on Tuesday to assess the proposals and consider a response. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Critics say the move is being driven purely by money, would destroy domestic leagues and is against the integrity of the sport. Unlike the Champions League, which teams must qualify for, the ESL would include the same 15 teams every year, with the remaining five qualifying annually. World governing body Fifa had previously said itwould not recognise such a competition,and any players involved could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup. Uefa, Europe's governing body, reiterated that warning on Sunday when it said players involved would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams. After the ESL was announced, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"". The ESL has sent a letter to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and Uefa boss Aleksander Ceferin issuing notice of legal proceedings in European courts designed to block any sanctions the two governing bodies may try enforce over the formation of the ESL. In a statement, the ESL said: ""Going forward, the founding clubs look forward to holding discussions with Uefa and Fifa to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new league and for football as a whole."" This video can not be played Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League There were talks in October, involving Wall Street bank JP Morgan, overa new Â£4.6bn competitionthat would replace the Champions League. Uefa had hoped the plans fora new 36-team Champions League- with reforms confirmed on Monday - would head off the formation of a Super League. However, the 12 sides involved in the Super League do not think the reforms go far enough. They said the global pandemic had ""accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model"". ""In recent months, extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions,"" they added. ""The founding clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid."" Super League: Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new tournament? Younger fans happier about prospect of breakaway league - December 2020 poll Tell us your thoughts on the proposals. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The league will have 20 teams - the 12 founding members plus the three unnamed clubs they expect to join soon, and five sides who qualify annually according to their domestic achievements. Under the proposals, the ESL campaign would start in August each year, with midweek fixtures, and the clubs would be split into two groups of 10, playing each other home and away. The top three in each group would qualify for the quarter-finals, with the teams in fourth and fifth playing a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. From then on, it would have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League before a single-leg final in May at a neutral venue. The ESL said it would generate more money than the Champions League and would result in a greater distribution of revenue throughout the game. Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, the first chairman of the ESL, said the new competition would ""help football at every level"". ""Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires,"" he added. Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli has resigned from the Uefa executive committee and as chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), which had pushed the planned Champions League reforms. He said the 12 clubs had ""come together at this critical moment, enabling European competition to be transformed, putting the game we love on a sustainable footing for the long-term future"". It is understood all 12 clubs have resigned from the ECA and their respective representatives from the ECA board. Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano have also stood down from their roles at Uefa. Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer will be a vice-chairman of the Super League. He said: ""By bringing together the world's greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid."" Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund have said they will not be joining and are committed to the ECA, along with fellow German side Bayern Munich. Liverpool and Manchester United are the two most successful sides in English football history Essentially, widespread condemnation from anyone not involved in the proposed league. Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"". He said: ""These clubs are not just great global brands - of course they're great global brands - they're also clubs that have originated historically from their towns, from their cities, from their local communities, they should have a link with those fans, and with the fan base in their community. ""So it is very, very important that that continues to be the case. I don't like the look of these proposals, and we'll be consulting about what we can do."" France's President Emmanuel Macron welcomed French clubs refusing to join. Uefa released a joint statement with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation, La Liga and the Italian Football Federation, as well as Serie A, saying they would ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using ""all available measures"". The ECA said it ""strongly opposed"" the league, while the Football Supporters' Association said the plans were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"". World players' union Fifpro said it will ""vigorously oppose measures by either side that would impede the rights of players, such as exclusion from their national teams"". It added: ""This decision leaves players and their unions with many concerns and questions about its impact not only on the fabric and cultural identity of football but also more practically on their careers."" A protest sign outside Manchester United's Old Trafford ground The League Managers Association said a Super League would be ""catastrophically destabilising to the entire European football pyramid, with deep and far-reaching consequences"". It added: ""Closing off the top of the pyramid of European club football would immediately extinguish many of the ambitions and dreams that drive managers, coaches, players and fans."" Former Portugal midfielder Luis Figotweeted:,external""This greedy and callous move would spell disaster for our grassroots, for women's football, and the wider football community only to serve self-interested owners, who stopped caring about their fans long ago, and [show] complete disregard for sporting merit. Tragic."" Paris St-Germain and former Manchester United midfielder Ander Herreratweeted:,external""I fell in love with popular football, with the football of the fans, with the dream of seeing the team of my heart compete against the greatest. ""If this European super league advances, those dreams are over. ""I love football and I cannot remain silent about this, I believe in an improved Champions League, but not in the rich stealing what the people created."" Among ex-professionals, former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport the plans ""sound soulless"", former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports he was ""absolutely disgusted"", while former team-mate Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport that the proposals will hurt fans the most.

Fan groups associated with all six English clubs involved are strongly opposed to the Super League. Liverpool supporters' group Spirit of Shankly (SOS) said it was ""appalled"" by the decision of Fenway Sports Group, the club's US-based owner. In a social media post, SOS said: ""FSG have ignored fans in their relentless and greedy pursuit of money. Football is ours, not theirs. Our football club is ours not theirs."" Chelsea Supporters' Trust called the move ""unforgivable"" and said its members and ""football supporters across the world have experienced the ultimate betrayal"". The Arsenal Supporters' Trust called the club's agreement to join ""the death of Arsenal as a sporting institution"". Manchester City's Official Supporters Club said the move showed ""those involved have zero regard for the game's traditions"", adding it was ""determined to fight against this proposed Super League"". The Manchester United Supporters' Trust had earlier said the proposals were ""completely unacceptable"" and the ESL ""goes against everything football, and Manchester United, should stand for"". Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said the ESL was a ""concept driven by avarice and self-interest at the expense of the intrinsic values of the game we hold so dear"". BBC Sport's Simon Stone If there was any lingering doubt over the desire of these 12 clubs to launch their own competition, it has been removed by their statement - reinforced by each of them through their own media platforms. So many questions remain unanswered. Chiefly, can they actually get their plan over the line given the strong resistance from Uefa and the leagues and associations of the countries concerned? But beyond that, who will the other three clubs be to make up the 15 founding members? Will Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain eventually join up? And how will the other five clubs be decided? These discussions will be fascinating. But right now, the clubs who have signed up to the European Super League have a public relations battle to turn around perceptions - because initial reaction has been overwhelmingly negative.

Government offices and essential services, such as hospitals, pharmacies and grocers, will be open during the lockdown, which starts on Monday night. The city had imposed a weekend curfew, but reported its highest single-day spike so far on Sunday - 24,462 cases. India has been reeling from a deadly second wave since the start of April. How India failed to prevent a deadly second wave 'Think about ICU workers before you party' 'Covid lockdown will make us beg for food again' Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city had almost run out of beds at hospital intensive care units (ICUs) and that oxygen was in short supply. ""I have always been against lockdowns, but this one will help us amplify the number of hospital beds in Delhi,"" he told a virtual press conference on Monday. He also appealed to the city's migrant workers not to leave -last year's national lockdown saw millions of them heading back to their villagesafter they found themselves unemployed and running out of money. ""This was a difficult decision to take but we had no other option left,"" Mr Kejriwal said. ""I know when lockdowns are announced, daily-wage workers suffer and lose their jobs. But I appeal to them to not leave Delhi. It's a short lockdown and we will take care of you.""

We'll be back tomorrow with more developments. Monday's live coverage was edited by Martha Buckley and George Bowden, and written by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Lauren Turner and David Walker. The Scottish government has confirmed that India will be added to its travel ""red list"". The UK government made the same decision earlier today for England, meaning anybody who is not a UK or Irish resident or British citizen cannot enter the UK if theyâve been in India in the last 10 days. UK and Irish residents or British citizens arriving in Scotland and England from India will need to complete a 10-day quarantine in an approved hotel. There are currently no direct international flights from India to Wales or Northern Ireland. The Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said international travel required a âcautious approach, on a four-nation basisâ. It's time to re-cap some of the main developments from the day:  Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The World Health Organization (WHO) is advising countries not to demand proof of vaccination as a requirement before travelling. The WHOâs emergency committee said vaccine passports would simply increase inequality, and might not help reduce the spread of Covid-19. Many European countries are already planning to demand proof of vaccination from arriving holidaymakers. But with widely different levels of vaccination between rich and poor countries, the organisation says vaccine passports will contribute to inequality, allowing those who have been vaccinated first, such as older people from wealthy countries, more freedom of movement than others. And there is only limited evidence, so far, to suggest that those who have been vaccinated cannot transmit the virus. Instead, the WHO is calling, again, for a global commitment to vaccine equity, in which the elderly, the chronically ill, and health workers in all countries are prioritised. Itâs not just the fairest thing to do, the WHO believes, but also the fastest way to reduce the number of hospitalisations and deaths. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent With all British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights soon to be subject to mandatory hotel quarantine on arrivial into England from India, what are the exemptions? Well, if you travel to England and have been in a red listed country in the last 10 days, in most circumstances, you will have to stay in a government-approved hotel at your own cost. A few of the jobs that do not have to do so include: aircraft pilots and crew; seamen, masters, inspectors and surveyors of ships; those with border security duties; defence personnel, visiting forces and government contractors; diplomatic missions and international organisations and conferences. There are also some exemptions, such as for some unaccompanied minors attending boarding school who might be able to quarantine at their boarding school. As well as some people attending someone who is dying or a funeral - if it is a close family member - although this is limited and requires requesting permission and they cannot use public transport to get there. More details on exemptions can be foundhere,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord earlier Earlier today - as seen in the picture above - Labour leader Keir Starmer was confronted by a pub landlord in Bath who made a series of Covid claims. Rod Humphris said âthe last time we had this much death was 2008â and noted that the average age of death for people with coronavirus was over 80. The figures are right but there are some health warnings that come with them. Last yearâs Covid epidemic brought the UKâs death rates back to where they stood 13 years before, in 2008. Death rates are supposed to get better every year. Undoing more than a decadeâs worth of progress in one fell swoop just doesnât happen in ordinary times. Itâs like losing 13 yearsâ GDP growth in a single year: it would be a national economic emergency, even if it only brought the UKâs economy back to where it was in 2008. Onto the second claim: most people who die with Covid are elderly - three-quarters of Covid deaths have been in those over 75. But that doesnât mean they were all on deathâs doorstep. Even if youâre an 80-year-old, overweight man with diabetes who smokes, your life expectancyis around four more years,external. So, many of the 150,000 people who have died with Covid have likely lost years of life. Saajan Radia said he would be unable to visit his wife's family People in Leicester have been giving the BBC their reaction to India being added to the UK travel ""red list"". Travel agent Nisha Ganatra, of Citibond Travel, said she was braced for the cancellation of trips to India. ""Most of the people, 99% will cancel now,"" she said. ""It is quite difficult for us - there is no money for us. We're not making anything at all."" And Saajan Radia, also from Leicester, said as his wife's family is in India, they usually visit at least once a year. ""Since last year we've not been able to go,"" he said, adding how difficult it was for the family to have ""that uncertainty of not being able to see my kids' grandparents"". Surges of Covid are happening again around the world, driven by some new subvariants of Omicron. Matt Hancock has been urged to resolve concerns about food provision for people in quarantine hotels, particularly for those who are fasting during Ramadan - which is currently being observed. Labour MP Imran Hussain called on Hancock to ""urgently resolve this frankly absolutely shambolic situation with the booking system"" and to ensure food ""meets the faith and dietary requirements of travellers particularly those fasting during Ramadan"". Hancock said the government was ""very careful"" to ensure the majority of those who have to go through managed quarantine have a good experience and said he would make sure public health minister Jo Churchill met with Hussain to hear about individual concerns. He added that ""making sure that food provision is appropriate for those fasting at Ramadan"" was ""very important"". Reality Check As we've been reporting, India will be added to the UK's so-called red list - meaning there will be strict restrictions on travel between the countries from Friday. It has been reporting more than 200,000 cases daily since 15 April, and near neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh have both been on the red list since 9 April. Criteria for being added to the list include how good a country's testing is, how many cases have been identified, and whether the country has exported new variants of concern. As of 13 April, Bangladesh, which had the South Africa variant but not the Brazil variant, and Pakistan, which had neither, were on the list. But India, which had both, was not added for another two weeks. ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, says. Read more here. People who live, work or travel in various parts of the UK are being urged to get a Covid test. During the health secretary's appearance in the Commons earlier, Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, questioned why India was not put on the red list sooner. She said: ""Hong Kong this week have identified 47 Covid cases just on a single Delhi flight and we have still 16 more direct flights, many more indirect flights from India to here before Friday alone."" Matt Hancock said decisions on each country were ""kept under constant review"". The world has the means to
bring the pandemic under control within months, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. ""We have the tools to bring this pandemic under control in a
matter of months, if we apply them consistently and equitably,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying at a daily news briefing. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joined the briefing from Sweden as a guest, condemned what she said was the ""tragedy"" of vaccine inequity as she donated â¬100,000 ($120,000) from her foundation to Covax, the scheme aiming to give global access to Covid-19 vaccines.

""We have the means at our disposal to correct the great imbalance that exists around the world today in the fight against Covid-19. Just as with the climate crisis, we must help those who are the most vulnerable first,"" the 18-year-old added. India is being added to the red list of countries from which travel is banned, we heard in the House of Commons this afternoon. It means Britons arriving from India will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days when they get back. Anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen will be banned from entering if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. But is that new rule for England, or is it the whole of the UK? Well, technically, as public health is determined by individual nations, it only concerns England. As there are no international flights into Wales or Northern Ireland however, they tend to fall into line with England's decisions. And there are no quarantine hotels in Wales or Northern Ireland either. Scotland currently requires hotel quarantine for all international arrivals at the moment anyway, so today's announcement makes no difference to anyone landing there. Here's an explainer on which countries are currently on the red list and exactly what it means for travellers. Airline Virgin Atlantic says it will continue to operate its flights to India until the country officially joins the UK travel red list at 04.00 BST on Friday. ""Our flights between London Heathrow and Delhi and Mumbai will be departing as scheduled until 23 April, with all customers arriving in England subject to a pre-departure Covid-19 test and 10-day self-isolation at home, with two further PCR tests,"" it says. The airline is reviewing its schedule of India operations from Friday and says customers should check their flight status. Virgin is due to operate one flight from Mumbai and one flight from Delhi to the UK before Friday's change. As has been mentioned by Matt Hancock,the government data,externalshows more than 10 million people have now received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. The figures show that up to Sunday 32,932,448 first doses had been given in the UK - a rise of 83,225 on the previous day. There have also been 10,152,039 second doses, an increase of 221,193. As we reported earlier, the Indian capital, Delhi, is due to go into lockdown  for a week after a record spike in cases overwhelmed the city's healthcare system. The city had imposed a weekend curfew, but reported its highest single-day spike so far on Sunday - 24,462 cases. It has almost run out of beds at hospital intensive care units and oxygen is in short supply, the city's chief minister said earlier. Crematoriums in the area are also overwhelmed. One in three people in Delhi is testing positive, the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from the city. Separately, the Indian government has said all adults will be eligible to get a coronavirus vaccination from the start of next month. India has been reeling from a deadly second wave since the start of April. Read more here. Back to the Commons, where SNP health spokeswoman Dr Philippa Whitford asked if Matt Hancock recognised the need for a ""more coordinated global response"" to allow a safer return to international travel and business. Hancock replied he agreed on that, saying international collaboration was something he, along with the foreign secretary and prime minister, were working ""incredibly hard"" on. He said they were using the presidency of the G7 and the ""enthusiasm of the new administration"" in the US, under President Joe Biden, to ""try to drive that"". Hancock said in particular, they were looking for collaboration ""amongst like-minded democracies in favour of an open and transparent science-led response to pandemics"".   The UK has reported four new deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,the lowest figure since September,external. You have to go back to 7 September for a day when fewer deaths, three, were reported across the country. Due to lags in reporting, figures are often lower at the start of the week, and some deaths which have occurred in the past 24 hours may not yet have made it into the daily figures. Wales has begun to report on a six-day basis with Monday's figure covering a 48-hour period. The UK has recorded 127,274 Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test since the start of the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has finished updating MPs on coronavirus developments.

There will be more on the European Super League there as well as more reaction to Tottenham sacking Jose Mourinho. Thanks for all your comments and bye for now. Leeds United v Liverpool (20:00 BST) There is a match in the Premier League tonight as Leeds United take on last season's champions Liverpool. Leeds forwards Raphinha and Rodrigo are both doubts and will undergo late fitness tests. They are without captain Liam Cooper, who is suspended due to the red card he received in the victory over Manchester City. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is boosted by the news that he has no new injury concerns to contend with. Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson, Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk remain on the sidelines. And here is a clip of what we have been talking about as Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, tells Parliament that the UK Government will 'do everything' to prevent the European Super League from happening. This video can not be played Following Dowden's comments in Parliament, shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens
called this ""a watershed moment for our national game"". She said: ""Football governance
is broken, football finance is broken and football fans, whichever club we
support, are ignored. ""The hedge-fund owners and
billionaires who treat football clubs like any other of their commodities have no care
for history of our football, for the role it plays in villages, towns and
cities up and down our country and especially for the fans who are the
beating heart of it. ""They should understand their role
as custodians rather than cartel chiefs. The future of our national game
and all our clubs depend on it."" Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said the UK Government will be ""reviewing everything the Government does"" to
support the so-called big six football clubs who have decided to join the
European Super League. Making a statement on the matter in the
Commons, he said he has spoken to the football authorities,
adding: ""My message for them was clear: they have our full backing. ""But, be in no doubt, if they can't
act we will. We will put everything on the table to prevent this from
happening. We are examining every option from governance reform to competition
law and mechanisms that allow football to take place. ""Put simply, we will
be reviewing everything the Government does to support these clubs to play. I
have discussed these options with the Prime Minister this morning and we are
working at pace across Government and with football authorities. ""We will do everything it takes to protect our national game. These clubs have decided to put money ahead of fans."" Simon StoneBBC Sport PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has turned down the chance to
replace Andrea Agnelli as chairman of the European Clubsâ Association. The ECA is reeling from the resignation of all 12 clubs involved
in the planned European Super League. BBC Sport understands Al-Khelaifi was the first choice to take
over from Juventus chairman Agnelli, who was condemned for his behaviour in
joining the planned breakaway by UEFA president. However, Al Khelaifi is reluctant to add to his workload. BBC Sport has been told this is not the prelude to a move by PSG
to join the 12 clubs, as they hoped, and that Al Khelaifi has been speaking
with the ECA and Uefa today as the row that has engulfed them continues. #bbcfootball Ian Unsworth:I don't know why people are getting so stressed about this ESL when the answer is so simple - don't watch it. If there is no audience then it can't survive, the last 12 months should've taught people that. Peter Hart:People saying a super league will fail. It won't. They have realised they don't need local fans anymore. They've seen the empty stadiums and the millions watching in China and India and Africa etc and done the maths....2+2=$$$$$. Traddad:Time for 10 Downing to call the bluff and force the German 51% fan ownership model down the throats of all England football teams regardless of Super League outcome. When the idea of a European Super League was first mentioned, we asked some fans for their views on the subject. This is what they said... Allow Twitter content?

Derby County boss Wayne Rooney has said""protecting the English football pyramid is the most important thing""after six Premier League clubs agreed to join a European Super League (ESL). Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 sides to have signed up to the proposals for a new midweek competition. The English Football League said in a statement that the plans ""attack the foundation of open and fair competition upon which our game is built"". Rooney, who is United and England's all-time top scorer, said he wanted the English pyramid to be ""protected and rewarded"" and called the timing of the announcement ""strange"". ""The people in charge of these clubs are not stupid. We'll have to wait to see what the plans are,"" he said. ""I don't think it would be a great look to pull away from cup competitions but let's see what the proposals are."" We're getting some pictures coming through of some angry fans outside the grounds of the six English clubs that have agreed to join the European Super League. At Old Trafford... ...at Anfield... ...and at Tottenham's training ground. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker says the potential for a new European Super League ""is a time of great concern"". The former England captain believes it could have ""massive ramifications on our game in this country and will wreck the pyramid system"". This video can not be played 'It's a time of great concern' - Lineker on European Super League #bbcfootball Jimmy Ottaway:These six club owners have landed their employees and fans of the clubs in this mess without any consultation. If anyone should get thrown out of football it's those owners. Bad luck to City and Chelsea as will affect them more than most! Ralph Brooker:Agree with comments saying let them do it. Let ESL fail.

There will be more on the European Super League there as well as more reaction to Tottenham sacking Jose Mourinho. Thanks for all your comments and bye for now. Leeds United v Liverpool (20:00 BST) There is a match in the Premier League tonight as Leeds United take on last season's champions Liverpool. Leeds forwards Raphinha and Rodrigo are both doubts and will undergo late fitness tests. They are without captain Liam Cooper, who is suspended due to the red card he received in the victory over Manchester City. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is boosted by the news that he has no new injury concerns to contend with. Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson, Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk remain on the sidelines. And here is a clip of what we have been talking about as Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, tells Parliament that the UK Government will 'do everything' to prevent the European Super League from happening. This video can not be played Following Dowden's comments in Parliament, shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens
called this ""a watershed moment for our national game"". She said: ""Football governance
is broken, football finance is broken and football fans, whichever club we
support, are ignored. ""The hedge-fund owners and
billionaires who treat football clubs like any other of their commodities have no care
for history of our football, for the role it plays in villages, towns and
cities up and down our country and especially for the fans who are the
beating heart of it. ""They should understand their role
as custodians rather than cartel chiefs. The future of our national game
and all our clubs depend on it."" Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said the UK Government will be ""reviewing everything the Government does"" to
support the so-called big six football clubs who have decided to join the
European Super League. Making a statement on the matter in the
Commons, he said he has spoken to the football authorities,
adding: ""My message for them was clear: they have our full backing. ""But, be in no doubt, if they can't
act we will. We will put everything on the table to prevent this from
happening. We are examining every option from governance reform to competition
law and mechanisms that allow football to take place. ""Put simply, we will
be reviewing everything the Government does to support these clubs to play. I
have discussed these options with the Prime Minister this morning and we are
working at pace across Government and with football authorities. ""We will do everything it takes to protect our national game. These clubs have decided to put money ahead of fans."" Simon StoneBBC Sport PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has turned down the chance to
replace Andrea Agnelli as chairman of the European Clubsâ Association. The ECA is reeling from the resignation of all 12 clubs involved
in the planned European Super League. BBC Sport understands Al-Khelaifi was the first choice to take
over from Juventus chairman Agnelli, who was condemned for his behaviour in
joining the planned breakaway by UEFA president. However, Al Khelaifi is reluctant to add to his workload. BBC Sport has been told this is not the prelude to a move by PSG
to join the 12 clubs, as they hoped, and that Al Khelaifi has been speaking
with the ECA and Uefa today as the row that has engulfed them continues. #bbcfootball Ian Unsworth:I don't know why people are getting so stressed about this ESL when the answer is so simple - don't watch it. If there is no audience then it can't survive, the last 12 months should've taught people that. Peter Hart:People saying a super league will fail. It won't. They have realised they don't need local fans anymore. They've seen the empty stadiums and the millions watching in China and India and Africa etc and done the maths....2+2=$$$$$. Traddad:Time for 10 Downing to call the bluff and force the German 51% fan ownership model down the throats of all England football teams regardless of Super League outcome. When the idea of a European Super League was first mentioned, we asked some fans for their views on the subject. This is what they said... Allow Twitter content?

Derby County boss Wayne Rooney has said""protecting the English football pyramid is the most important thing""after six Premier League clubs agreed to join a European Super League (ESL). Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 sides to have signed up to the proposals for a new midweek competition. The English Football League said in a statement that the plans ""attack the foundation of open and fair competition upon which our game is built"". Rooney, who is United and England's all-time top scorer, said he wanted the English pyramid to be ""protected and rewarded"" and called the timing of the announcement ""strange"". ""The people in charge of these clubs are not stupid. We'll have to wait to see what the plans are,"" he said. ""I don't think it would be a great look to pull away from cup competitions but let's see what the proposals are."" We're getting some pictures coming through of some angry fans outside the grounds of the six English clubs that have agreed to join the European Super League. At Old Trafford... ...at Anfield... ...and at Tottenham's training ground. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker says the potential for a new European Super League ""is a time of great concern"". The former England captain believes it could have ""massive ramifications on our game in this country and will wreck the pyramid system"". This video can not be played 'It's a time of great concern' - Lineker on European Super League #bbcfootball Jimmy Ottaway:These six club owners have landed their employees and fans of the clubs in this mess without any consultation.

Rebuilding NHS 'could be bigger task than Covid',"This video can not be played Christine Evans says she was told she would have to pay around Â£15,000 for private treatment Rebuilding the NHS after Covid could be a bigger challenge than the pandemic itself, leading doctors have said. Surgeons say a ""radical rethink"" of the way hospitals work is needed, while doctors said tackling backlogs would be a ""huge challenge"" for exhausted staff. Meanwhile, cancer charities fear the disruption will lead to a surge in deaths, particularly in Wales. They all agree getting the NHS back on its feet will be the biggest challenge faced by an incoming Welsh government. Amid these warnings, academics said difficult choices would have to be made on where money was spent. BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke has been looking at some of the key health issues facing whoever wins the Senedd election on 6 May. Baby groups 'forgotten' as Wales' restrictions eased Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? South Wales valleys' high death rates 'caused by poverty' Richard Pugh, head of Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said places like his Rhymney hometown recorded some of Wales' highest coronavirus case rates. Mr Pugh said that happened because ""huge"" inequalities already existed. In communities like his, in Caerphilly county, Mr Pugh said ""we all know each other"". Richard Pugh said ""huge"" inequalities already existed ""I could point to you people's houses where sadly they've lost someone because of Covid,"" he said. ""When we lose one of us we lose something about the community itself."" Mr Pugh has lived in the town all of his life. ""Unfortunately we're top of the wrong leagues all the time, for example diabetes and cancer,"" he said. ""Here and in the other coalfield areas we have been hit the hardest and are still being hit the hardest. ""Health inequalities in this community are huge."" That problem remained unsolved when the pandemic ""came on top of that"". ""We've got to look at ourselves about that,"" Mr Pugh said. There have been more than 900 positive tests for Covid in the area, which also covers Pontlottyn and Abertysswg The case rate is the highest in Caerphilly county and the 31st highest of all communities in Wales over the course of the pandemic There have been 35 deaths due to Covid - 32 of them in the devastating second wave of the pandemic over the winter Its mortality rate over the pandemic is 394.1 deaths per 100,000 people - the 29th highest of communities of this size in Wales Christine Evans has been waiting for 15 months for treatment for her arthritis Waiting lists for other NHS treatments have grown massively because of the priority given to coronavirus. Arthritis patient Christine Evans has been on an NHS waiting list for 15 months. The 67-year-old said the condition of her right knee had left her ""barely [able to] walk 30 yards"". Ms Evans, who works in healthcare, said she was thinking of going private, which would cost about Â£15,000. She said: ""When I went to see the consultant, I would have said on a scale of one to 10 my pain level was around about six or seven. ""I was able to walk perhaps 100 yards, which is not too bad. ""Now we're 15 months down the line and I can barely walk 30 yards. And my pain levels are ranking up around about a nine."" Ms Evans, from Llanharry, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said it was ""pretty awful"". ""You get up in the morning, you think: 'Oh, can I face today?'"" She said she felt for consultants. ""They're normally able to step up to the plate and help us, and they just can't,"" she said. Helen Whyley, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, urged those needing care who were ""not wanting to bother the NHS"" to seek advice from health practitioners such as their GP. ""We know there are challenges about reopening services, but we also need to understand and make sure that we've got everyone who needs care at least on the list waiting for it, so that we can put those plans together,"" she said. After going into the pandemic with a shortage of nurses, then adding extra services such as the vaccination programme, she said there was a ""massive challenge"" ahead for staff. ""Many of them are absolutely exhausted, so our current workforce also needs to get its breath back in addition to get going on the things that we always used to do,"" she said. ""The next Welsh government needs to be really strong, really brave and take the opportunity to look at the whole system."" Mountain Ash GP Dr Kamila Hawthorne said the backlog facing the NHS was a ""huge problem"". ""We're going to need to give much clearer instructions to patients as to what to do if, while they're waiting, anything else happens which might mean that their condition is getting worse,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""It's very worrying really that conditions that in the past you knew would be seen as secondary care within, say eight weeks' time, now might take easily a year."" In January more 500,000 people in Wales were on waiting lists. There has been an eight-fold increase in those waiting longer than nine months. The backlog could take years to clear. The Royal College of Surgeons' Wales director, Richard Johnson, said the NHS needed a ""radical rethink"". ""We should be developing Covid-light sites on a regional basis,"" he said. ""So you've got hospitals, where there's no emergency patients going in there, dedicated to treating the backlog of patients. ""We know from experience it's very easy to turn services off, but it's far more difficult to bring them back online again."" The new government is likely to be under pressure to bring down waiting lists fast. The Royal College of Physicians' Olwen Williams said more doctors were needed and those already in place needed to ""refresh and renew themselves"". ""We have come to a point in the pandemic when everyone's taking a deep breath and thinking 'what's next'."" she said. Recruiting more staff will not be enough, according to Dr Williams. She said: ""A lot of us really do believe that we have to look at really doing things that have got value, and leaving aside some of the things we have done in the past, and think, 'does this person really need to be seen by 10 different clinicians, could they not be seen by one?'."" Olwen Williams said more doctors were needed and those already in place needed to ""refresh and renew themselves"" According to Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, the Welsh government gave NHS Wales an extra Â£1.4bn in the last financial year to deal with the pandemic. That was down to extra money that came to Wales due to increased NHS spending in England. But much more funding islikely to be needed to help the NHS recover,external. ""You are looking at an extremely challenging picture for the next Welsh government,"" said Guto Ifan, a research associate at the centre. There were the direct costs of Covid, test and trace, and potentially re-vaccinations. ""Also the indirect costs of Covid-19 are probably more substantial beyond this year,"" Mr Ifan said. ""If NHS productivity doesn't recover because of social distancing requirements and heightened infection control, that means the NHS can deliver less care for the resources it's given."" The new Welsh government will have about a billion pounds unallocated for 2021-22. This is partly because Wales sourced personal protective equipment and introduced Test, Track and Protect more cheaply than in England. Guto Ifan said it was an ""extremely challenging picture"" for the next Welsh government ""Whichever party or parties form the next Welsh government, they'll all be hoping and wishing the UK government changes course on its spending plans,"" said Mr Ifan. ""With that money carried forward from last year to this year,the Welsh government will be in a position to meet NHS funding pressures this year. ""But it's next year when those funding pressures really start to bite in the context of the UK government's current plans."" Welsh Labour said it would help services recover by installing ""the biggest catch-up programme our NHS has ever seen"". A Â£1bn NHS recovery plan, it said, would be launched ""on day one"". Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said coronavirus had ""devastated our communities"" and ""exposed our fragility"". He said his party would build ""better hospitals"". Plaid Cymru said NHS waiting times were ""unacceptably long"" before the pandemic. ""Radical and robust action is needed in order to ensure the service is resourced and has the capacity to provide healthcare to the thousands of people waiting,"" a spokesman said. The Welsh Liberal Democrats said they would establish a taskforce to address health inequalities and improve public health by ""promoting healthy living and good life choices"". A spike in cancer cases could be on the way, Macmillan Cancer Support's Richard Pugh fears. He said people had not sought treatment during the pandemic because of worries about protecting the NHS. He admitted he was ""terrified"" by the prospect of more cases. ""More and more people are getting diagnosed, and later and younger as well,"" Mr Pugh said. ""So it's not your traditional over-65s, it's those people unfortunately that have been sat on symptoms in their house, the younger ones who we would have saved."" They had not got help because of ""fear and respect"", he said. ""The fear was they were frightened of catching Covid, and the respect was: 'I see the NHS on the TV every day, I don't want to burden them with this little bump or this mole'.""
